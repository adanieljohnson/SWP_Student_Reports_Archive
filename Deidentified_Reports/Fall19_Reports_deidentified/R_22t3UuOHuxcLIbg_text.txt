Title: Effect of Water pH on Root:Shoot Ratio of Mung Bean Plants 

Abstract:
The effect of water with different pH values (pH=3.5, 7, 8.5) was tested on the growth of mung bean plants. This growth has been observed by measuring a plants root:shoot ratio, the two organs a plant uses to allocate energy. It was proposed that if physiological pH conditions were compromised that there would be an increase in the root:shoot ratio. Plants were set up in three treatment groups and watered for two weeks. The results between all groups were compared by running an analysis of variance (ANOVA). There was no significant difference between the plants in the acidic pH, neutral pH, or alkaline pH. This is because some plants are able to maintain their architecture under compromised conditions, and also because some phenotypic changes are subtle and in different traits, thus making it difficult to differentiate variance in morphological change by measuring the root:shoot ratio. 

Introduction:
Studies on plant phenotypic plasticity has been rapidly advancing as our environment is increasingly being impacted from global warming. Plants are able to respond to these environment changes due to phenotypic plasticity, which is defined to be ‘the ability of individual genotypes to produce different phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions’ [Pigliucci et al.: 2006]. The effect of soil pH is increasingly becoming more of an issue today due to the effect of acid rain and irrigation water impeding the physiological pH of an environment’s soil pH. This response can be observed morphologically by observing how plants allocate energy by expending more mass to grow a particular organ that allows it to capture the most of its limited resources when under environmental stress due to limiting resources [Bloom et al.: 1985]. 
Soil nutrient availability can compromise a plants ability to allocate resources, such that if the nutrients in the soil are compromised the plant will alter its allocation between the roots and shoots [Hill et al.: 2006]. Roots serve as the absorptive organ, so it is expected that in environmental conditions where water is scarce that the plant invest more mass into its roots to be able to efficiently pump water meters deep from the ground. pH levels can directly impact the soil and cause stress on a plant to express different phenotypic variations in its roots. It’s vital for the plant to grow in its optimal pH because pH levels affect the availability of nutrients in the soil – in which most plants allocate soil nutrients in a pH between 6 and 7.5. The most prominent nutrients found in the soil that aid plant growth and reproduction are nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur. When the pH levels of the soil are affected, this can directly affect how the nutrients interact with one another underground. For example, phosphorous is known to become less soluble in more alkaline conditions, thus making it difficult for the plant to retrieve the nutrients it needs. Another key nutrient is nitrogen, where acidic conditions of the soil can create a slow nitrification process, in which plants and crops that need to be able to uptake nitrate readily now are in a compromised environment [Sainju et al.: 2006]. To test how drastically mung beans would change phenotypically, plants were tested being watered under three different pH levels: 3.5, 7, and 8.5. If plants uptake nutrients most readily under more neutral pH, then the root:shoot ratio is expected to be smallest in the pH of 7 and impacted more in acidc and alkaline pH conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted using Vigna radiate – mung bean – seeds. Seeds were then planted in a tray of 5 replicates containing vermiculate. The mung beans were divided into three groups of water pH (acidic pH of 3.5, neutral pH of 7, alkaline pH of 8.5). In each replicate, 50mL of “Miracle-Gro” fertilizer and 9 mung bean seeds were added. To ensure the effect of different soil pH levels, the temperature and sunlight were controlled by placing the plants in a greenhouse. The plant was allowed to grow for two weeks, in which the prepared groups were watered with 50mL of their respective pH treatment daily. After two weeks, data was collected from the five replicates per each treatment group. The following measurements were taken: total plant weight (g), root weight (g), shoot weight (g), root length (cm), and shoot length (cm). The mean of the replicates for each measurement was taken and using the mean values the root:shoot weight ratio and root:shoot length ratio were calculated. The root:shoot ratios of the mung bean plants between each pH group was compared using an ANOVA test to determine whether the results were significant.  

Results:
The neutral, physiological pH of soil in both weight and length root:shoot ratios had the smallest ratio. Both plant groups treated with water of an acidic pH (pH=3.5) and water of an alkaline pH (pH=8.5) showed a larger value in their measurements of weight and length root:shoot ratios. The mean root:shoot weight ratio between the three groups did not differ significantly (p=0.198). The mean root:shoot length ratio between the three groups did not show any significant difference either (p=0.768). The mean values and their deviations are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.	


Discussion:
The root:shoot ratio for the neutral pH was smallest as expected, however, the results did not show a significant difference between the mean root:shoot ratios for weight and length of the mung beans treated with an acidic pH of, the neutral pH of 7, and the alkaline pH of 8.5. Thus, the range of pH values had no effect on the growth of the plant since the root:shoot ratio did not change drastically from the different groups. In a previous study analyzing how acid rain affects root:shoot ratios, it was found that root:shoot ratios decreased with increasing acidity only for plants that were infected by a fungal endophyte [Cheplick: 1993]. This can explain why acidic pH conditions did not yet impact the uptake of nutrients for a healthy mung bean plant. Nutrient uptake is observed by plants displaying long roots, thus in plants where it a nutrient might be compromised by the change in pH, it is expected that the root:shoot ratio would increase in order to uptake the depleted nutrient. Phosphorous is found in the top soil of plants and past studies have shown that depletion of phosphorous due to pH stresses. In response, plants are able to alter architecture in their roots to be able to uptake phosphorous more readily. For example, root hair growth, axial root length, and lateral branching can all be modified to make nutrient uptake more efficient [Bhattacharya: 2018]. It can be plausible that the mung beans were altering their root architecture in different phenotypic traits in acidic pH conditions compared to alkaline pH conditions, which would make it difficult to tell root:shoot differences between the treatments. Systematic errors, such as diluting the pot with previous pH water used could have led to faulty results, or the plants might have needed to grow for longer to be able to see a more intricate response in the root:shoot ratio. Further research investigating the different phenotypic architecture under different pH values could be tested to see if this played a role in contributing to any variation unnoticed in the root:shoot ratios.
