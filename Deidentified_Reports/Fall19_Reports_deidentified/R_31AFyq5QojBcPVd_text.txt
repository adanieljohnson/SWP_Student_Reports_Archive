Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Mass of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
hi

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a species of insect, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, that is commonly a pest of the Solanaceae plant family [del Campo:1999] [Renwick:1999]. In the early forms of their life, they take the form of a caterpillar and are characterized by having a horn on one end of their bodies, giving them their “hornworm” name. As they grow into their adult stage, they take the form of a large moth. The Tobacco Hornworm is found throughout the United States and Central America. It is more heavily concentrated, however, in the South of the US. The Maduca sexta is a specialist of solanaceous plants, like pepper and tobacco. Plants in the family Solanaceae contain steroidal and triterpenoid glycosides, chemical compounds that play an important role in the biology of Manduca sexta [Haribal et al:2006]. The Manduca sexta is very commonly used as a model organism in labs, mainly because they can feed on artificial food, by putting plant tissue in their diet [Byron:2017] [Gillet-Kaufman:2017]. The insect contains three important hormones: Juvenile hormone, Prothoracicotropic, and Ecdysterone. All hormones help in the development, molting and formation of Pupa into adults. In this study, the effects of the Juvenile hormone (JH) were studied. JH is Manduca sexta regulates the type of molt during development and regulates functions as an adult. The hypotheses this study looked to test was by adding more Juvenile Hormone (precor) to the caterpillar’s diet, the average life cycle will accelerate and therefore increase the average mass of Manduca sextas treated with hormone compared to the control group.

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, eight caterpillars were placed into two different enclosed boxes with 4 divisions in each so every caterpillar would be alone. Then, added ten grams of artificial food in each container. In half of the cubicles, the food was mixed with five drops of distilled water (the control group) and in the other half of the cubicles, the food was mixed with five drops of precor (the experimental group). Every day for the next two weeks, students checked on the caterpillars by cleaning their living areas and weighing the caterpillars daily to record their increase in mass. If there was no food left in the containers, 10 more grams would be added with the corresponding mixer (distilled water or precor depending on the caterpillar). On the final day of the experiment, the final masses of the caterpillars were taken and written down in a lab notebook. Then, taking the averages for all the experimental groups and control groups, created a line graph (Figure 1) to describe the change of mass of the caterpillars depending on what they received in their food. With the final masses of each caterpillars, the students were able to determine the change in weight comparing the control and experimental group. Finally, a two-sample T-test was conducted to find the P-value and T-value. 

Results:
Significant results were found between the control water given group and the experimental JH received group. The control group got noticeably heavier and bigger faster than the experimental group did. At the end of week 1 (day 7 on Figure 1), the control group weight average was 4.13g +/- 1.43g SD, while the experimental group average was 2.48g +/- 5.9 SD.  However, by the end of the experiment, both the control and experimental group had relatively similar averages at around 12.5g +/- 1.43g SD for the control and +/- 5.9 SD for the experimental (not including the mass of one of the experimental caterpillars that died at around 0.9 grams). However, if we do account for the dead caterpillar, the ending average for the experimental group turns out to be around 9.4 +/- 5.9 SD. Figure 1 shows the change in average mass of the blue line (control group) and the orange line (experimental group). 

Discussion:
Due to the 0.8 P-value, we failed to reject the null hypothesis which was that adding the Juvenile Hormone to the Manduca sexta diet would not affect the growth of caterpillars and would not change their differential in mass. This value indicates the results are not statistically significant, with such a large P-value, meaning our results were likely due to chance. It is clear that adding additional Juvenile Hormone (precor) to the Manduca sexta caterpillars does not increase the development of the insect, however, it may stunt the growth of the caterpillars. If we do not include the outlier of the caterpillar that died at the end of the 14 days, the averages of the caterpillars at the end of the experiment were almost identical, as shown in Figure 1. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, several scientists looked at the effect of JH in the insect Drosophila, or fruit flies. The study found that the extraction of the Corpus Allata, which results in the absence of JH, resulted in no effect in the weight of the insect [Mirth:2014] [Tang:2014] [Makohon-Moore:2014] [Salhader:2014] [Gokhale:2014]. This contradicts our findings that the addition of JH may stunt growth. However, providing that our P-value was 0.8 with the outlier and even 0.45 with the outlier, it very well could have been due to a batch of slowly growing caterpillars. One factor that was not accounted for during the experiment was the amount of food consumed by the caterpillars on the daily basis. The bins were routinely cleaned; however, it was not kept accounted for which caterpillars had been defecating the most, and thus eating the most. It is in the range of possibilities that the precor added to the food was not as appetizing to the caterpillars and ate at a slower rate, which could explain the delayed growth. Another study on the effect of the effect of JH on growth, (using Methoprene) proved that using high concentration of the compound, inhibited male and female development of the Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) [Boboye:1975] [Carman:1975]. This study proves the inaccuracy of our original hypothesis. Overall it seems that adding JH to the Manduca sexta’s diet either has no effect on the growth of the insect, or in fact slows down the rate of growth.
