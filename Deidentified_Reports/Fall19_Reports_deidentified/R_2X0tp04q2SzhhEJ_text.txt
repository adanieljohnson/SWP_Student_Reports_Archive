Title: The Effect of NaCl Exposure on Leaf Surface Area of Radish Plants Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
Radish (Raphanus satuvus) plants were grown to examine the effect of NaCl exposure on leaf surface area. Each day saltwater was added to the radish plants over a period of two weeks. After two weeks the radish plants were collected, and leaf surface area measured. This data was then analyzed using a two-tailed t_test. The average surface area of the plants exposed to NaCl was greater than those not exposed with averages of 3.305cm^2 for controll and 4.14cm^2 for experimental with a p_value of 0.194. This data suggests that, at certain concentrations, salt exposure is not harmful to radish plants.

Introduction:
In communities, plants interact with both biotic factors and their environment to attain the resources they need. This interaction often results in a need to adapt in order to survive. In plants, this adaptation often occurs through a process called resource allocation [Johnson: 2016]. Resource allocation is where an organism has a limited resource and in order to attain more of it, it channels the resources that it does have into attaining more of the resource that it needs. One example of this is that plants that live in the desert because they have a limited source of water, tend to grow much longer roots. 
	High concentrations of NaCl in soil often have negative effects on plants by limiting available resources, specifically water [Uchiya: 2016]. While many plants are sensitive to high concentrations of salt, soil with low salt concentration has been used to improve vegetable quality [Mizrahi: 1985]. Many plants are sensitive to NaCl, but we chose to study radishes because of their quick growing time and their growing significance as an agricultural product [Hannah: 2009]. Our objective was to assess the effect of high NaCl concentrations on the leaf surface area of radish plants. Because of the aversive effect of NaCl on plants and their ability to maintain water balance, we hypothesize that radish plants exposed to high concentrations of NaCl will have smaller leaf surface areas as they allocate resources to their roots. 


Materials and Method:
Radish seeds were soaked in water for thirty minutes to increase germination rates. Then 15 seeds were planted in each of six pots filled with vermiculite. Each day for two weeks, three of the pots, the controll group, were watered with 150Ml of water. The other three pots, the experimental group, were watered with 150Ml of a 6 mol NaCl solution. After two weeks, the leaf surface area of the radish plants was taken. Here the three largest leaves from each pot were taken and the surface area calculated by placing the leaves under a clear 0.5x0.5cm grid and then counting the filled and partially filled squares. After collecting this data for both the controlls and experimental groups, a two-tailed t_test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
After two weeks, the controll plants were smaller and lighter in color than the experimental plants which were considerably larger and dark green in color. The average surface area of the leaves in the experimental group was greater than the surface area of the experimental group. The average leaf surface area of the controll group was 3.305cm^2 while the average of the salt conditions was 4.14cm^2. This was further demonstrated with the p_value 0.194 when comparing the controll and experimental groups (figure 1). 

Discussion:
From this data, we can conclude that our hypothesis is not supported because the leaf surface area of the experimental groups was not smaller than that of the controll group. In our experiment, the leaf surface area of the plants exposed to salt was greater than that of the plants not exposed to salt. This differs from what was found by [Marcelis 1999]. In their experiment, like out hypothesis, they found that plants exposed to NaCl had smaller leaves when compared to plants not exposed to NaCl. One potential explanation for this is the length of time they allowed the plants to grow. In their experiment, they grew the plants for 30 days before measuring the leaf surface area. This would allow for the radish tuber to begin to grow and might impact how resources would be allocated potentially making the leaves smaller. 
Another possible explanation for this is that the concentration of salt or the amount of water we used may have allowed the radishes to be more efficient at maintaining water balance in the vermiculite. Because vermiculite has no nutrients the plants exposed to NaCl may have been better able to absorb other water when compared to plants that had no nutrients in their soil. The plants in the controll group did not have any salts in their soil and thus were smaller when compared to the experimental group. It is possible that if the controll groups were given a low level of NaCl and then the experimental groups were given a more concentrated solution, the results may have been different. 
	In further studies, we would likely add NaCl or a different salt to the soil of both the controll and experimental groups. Also, we might extend the time in which the plants were grown and test different concentrations of NaCl instead of examining just one. As far as sampling goes, our experiment could be improved by randoMly selecting leaves as opposed to picking the biggest leaves out of each pot.
