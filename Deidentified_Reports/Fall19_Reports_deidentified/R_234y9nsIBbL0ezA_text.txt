Title: Treating Spinach Chloroplasts with NaCl Does Not Affect Photosystem II Activity

Abstract:
The present study explores whether different concentrations of NaCl will affect photosystem II activity, interpreted as overall photosynthesis activity. Spinacia oleracea, or spinach, is the organism being used to provide chloroplasts to test. Previous studies have discovered salinity treatments to hinder photosynthesis rates. It is hypothesized that increased NaCl concentrations will decrease photosystem II activity in spinach chloroplasts. The method consisted of creating triplicates of reaction mixtures containing either 0mM, 100mM, or 200mM NaCl, the compound DCIP, chloroplasts, water, and reaction buffer, alongside of a negative controll containing no chloroplasts and a blank without DCIP. The mixtures’ absorbances at 600nm were measured at 10, 20, and 30 minutes and average percent changes were found. Major results found that salinity did not significently affect absorbance or DCIP reduction (p_value for comparing 0mM NaCl and 100mM NaCl = 0.399; p_value for comparing 0mM NaCl and 200mM NaCl = 0.340). This led to the conclusion that these concentrations of NaCl do not have any hindering nor accelerating effect on photosystem II activity or overall photosynthesis rate. Retesting the hypothesis with more than 3 NaCl concentrations would be beneficial.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a necessary metabolic process that takes place within plants. Photosynthesis describes the process in which plants take in carbon dioxide, light energy, and water from the environment to generate glucose and oxygen [Johnson: 2019]. There are two main types of reactions in photosynthesis; one being light-dependent reactions and the other called light-independent reactions (or the Calvin cycle) [Johnson: 2019]. Light-dependent reactions rely heavily on an integral membrane protein named photosystem II within the chloroplast – the organelle responsible for photosynthesis [Johnson: 2019]. Photosystem II plays a large role in creating a proton gradient necessary for photosynthesis. Therefore, measuring photosystem II activity by the rate at which it reduces certain chemicals can be a reliable read-out for seeing how efficiently it is operating [Johnson: 2019]. Photosystem II working more or less efficiently in turn indicates a faster or slower rate of photosynthesis, respectively. 
There are many different environmental factors that have the power to affect a plant’s photosystem II activity. In the current study, we will explore whether or not salinity concentrations can affect photosystem II’s activity, using chemical read-outs to determine the rate of reduction reactions. To do this, Spinacia oleracea (or spinach) will be used, due to it being a convenient and reliable source of chloroplasts. One previous study found salt stress to dramatically decrease chlorophyll in plants, as well as necessary proteins, sugars, and starches in plant structure [Agastian: 2000]. A second experiment investigated how NaCl concentrations would affect the plants ability to take in carbon dioxide from its environment, a necessary input to photosynthesis [Longstreth: 1984]. The authors found that higher concentrations of salinity caused carbon dioxide uptake to decrease by 51%, therefore significently decreasing photosynthesis rate [Longstreth: 1984]. Consistent with these findings in prior studies, it is hypothesized in the present study that increased NaCl concentrations will decrease photosystem II activity in spinach chloroplasts.

Materials and Method:
Photosystem II activity was measured by using the following procedure. To begin, we packed a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and 2, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves. We threw away the veins and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Any excess moisture from the leaves was blotted off. When the mortar and pestle were cold, they were wiped dry, then the spinach leaves were added. 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the leaves. We ground the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added, mixed with the spinach slurry, and the entire volume of green slurry was strained through two layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.
Next, in order to enrich the chloroplasts, we transferred 200 μL of the filtered liquid from the beaker into a microtube labeled “Sample of A,” and stored this on ice. We transferred the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm) in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. It was necessary to use a balanced centrifuge. We poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B.” The pellet of debris was left at the bottom of tube “A.” We removed 200 μL of the liquid from the 50 Ml tube marked “B,” placed it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B,” and stored it on ice. Next, we centrifuged the 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm) in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was poured off, and we were careful as to not disturb the pellet. Tube “B” was placed on ice. 20 Ml of grinding buffer was then added to the pellet in order to resuspend it, done by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. 200 μL of this resuspended pellet was transferred into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet” and stored on ice. 
After this process, we prepared the following thirteen glass tubes in the table outlining their contents below (see Table 1).  
When we were ready to begin the assay, we added 100 μL of the enriched chloroplasts from Sample of B Pellet to all of the tubes except the three that were void of chloroplasts. The data collected were the absorbances of each tube’s reaction mixture at 600nm. This was measured with a spectrophotometer and read at different increments of time: at the very start of the experiment (right after adding the chloroplasts), after 10 minutes, after 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes. Percent change after every 10-minute increment was calculated for each tube.
The specific chemical that we used to give a read-out of photosystem II activity was DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) in what is called a DCIP decolorization assay. The reason DCIP works in this experiment is due to the fact that during natural photosynthesis, photosystem II is constantly reducing plastoquinone and passing the electrons to electron acceptors [Johnson: 2019]. DCIP in this experiment served as an alternative electron acceptor, being blue initially, but turning colorless when it gets reduced by the processes of photosystem II. This process, using alternative electron acceptors to measure photosystem II activity, is named the Hill reaction [Johnson: 2019]. Therefore, the color change (or loss of blue color) in the reaction can then be measured by reading the mixture’s absorbance at 600nm, where a decrease in absorbance means photosystem II is active. 
The averages of the percent changes in absorbance for each group and between each increment of time were calculated, as well as each average’s standard deviation. The statistical tests used to analyze the results were two-tailed, independent t_tests. One p_value was found for the difference between the change in absorbance after 30 minutes in the chloroplasts treated with 0mM NaCl and those treated with 100mM NaCl. A second p_value was found for the difference between the change in absorbance after 30 minutes in the chloroplasts treated with 0mM NaCl and those treated with 200mM NaCl. Comparing these groups to each other allowed us to see the direct effect of NaCl concentration on DCIP reduction. 

Results:
The results of this experiment indicated somewhat sporadic trends in the average changes in absorbance. As seen in Figure 1, the general trend for the average change in absorbance for the reaction mixture void of chloroplast was a slight increase (0.248% change after 10 minutes, 0.412% change after 20 minutes). There was a much larger deviation from the mean for the values after 10 and 20 minutes than there was for the 30-minute value. 
The average change in absorbance for the tubes with chloroplasts but without NaCl were also lacking much of a pattern. At first, there was a small decrease after 10 minutes, then a small increase after 20 minutes, and then a considerably large increase after 30 minutes (Fig. 2). One can also see in Figure 2 that the standard deviations for the values at 10, 20, and 30 minutes were of considerable value (1.103 after 10 minutes, for example). 
Figure 3 represents the average change in absorbance for the reaction mixture containing chloroplasts and 100mM NaCl. There were only decreases in absorbance shown for this mixture across each time increment. At first these decreases got larger, then they remained relatively the same after the 20-minute measure. The standard deviations were bigger after 20 and 30 minutes than that after 10 minutes, as shown in Figure 3.
Finally, Figure 4 represents the average changes in absorbance for the tubes containing chloroplasts and 200mM NaCl, the highest concentration of NaCl tested. There were considerably large decreases in absorbance at 600nm for each value, and each percent change became more negative after each round of 10 minutes. There were also very large standard deviations for each value. For example, the standard deviation of the average percent change in absorbance after 30 minutes was 15.8. 
The statistical test run was a two-tailed t_test, comparing the 30-minute percent changes in absorbance between chloroplasts in 0mM NaCl and 100mM NaCl, and then between chloroplasts in 0mM NaCl and 200mM NaCl. The p_value for the first comparison was .399, and that of the second comparison was .340; therefore, neither of these groups were statistically significently different from each other.

Discussion:
The results obtained during this experiment did not support the study’s hypothesis that higher salt concentrations would decrease photosystem II activity. In fact, the average changes in absorbance for both of the reaction mixtures containing concentrations of NaCl were negative across all increments of time. This essentially means that the chloroplasts exposed to NaCl concentrations actually reduced DCIP more so than the chloroplasts not exposed to NaCl. However, analysis of the results states that there is no statistically significent difference between both the changes in absorbance between the chloroplast reaction mixtures in 0mM NaCl and 100mM NaCl and the mixtures in 0mM NaCl and 200mM NaCl. So, in summary, this tells us that salt concentration has no effect on the rate in which photosystem II reduces DCIP, therefore indicating that salt concentration has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach. Finally, with these results, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, which stated that there was no difference between photosystem II activity with or without exposure to NaCl. 
This is a very interesting finding, due to the previously stated fact that prior studies have found salt stress and salinity treatments to hinder photosynthesis rate [Longstreth: 1984]. Other studies discovered that treating plants with salt concentrations was so detrimental to the plant that it destroyed multiple necessary components within its cells, such as sugars, proteins, and chlorophyll [Agastian: 2000]. Previous findings such as these are why the results from the present study are surprising and fascinating. However, there are possible explanations for why these results differ from previous results.
One possible reasoning for why there was no significent difference between photosynthesis activity in chloroplasts treated with salt and chloroplasts not treated with salt could be that this experiment was done with triplicates. In the future, it would be interesting to test whether having more replicates of each reaction mixture would result in either more significent findings or findings consistent with past studies. Furthermore, another reason for these outcomes could potentially be that the gradients in salt concentrations tested were not large enough to yield significent results. It would be worthwhile to retest this hypothesis with multiple groups of chloroplasts exposed to different levels of NaCl, perhaps testing upwards of five different concentrations. 
In conclusion, the present study tested whether or not salinity would hinder photosystem II activity and discovered that it does not. Photosystem II activity is very important to measure, since it plays an integral role in how efficiently a plant preforms photosynthesis. In the future, it would be valuable to continue exploring the other factors beyond salinity that could potentially alter photosynthesis rate, so we can better understand both the optimal and harmful environments that certain species may reside in.
