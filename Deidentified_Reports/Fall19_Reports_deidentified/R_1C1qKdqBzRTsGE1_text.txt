Title: The effects of juvenile hormones on the Manduca Sexta larva’s development and growth

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the method, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.


Introduction:
Juvenile hormones play a large role in the development of insects [Nijhout: 1982]. In the process of molting, the juvenile hormone is responsible for stimulating the follicle cells to pump out juvenile hormone to create development of spaces between cells [Davey: 1977]. Over the years, it has been discovered that in the developmental process of the insect’s life, JH is something that can be switched on and off in critical periods for growth [Nijhout: 1982]. However, with the knowledge that the juvenile hormone keeps an insect in a juvenile (pre-reproductive) instar, we questioned if it would play a positive role in the development of our caterpillar subjects. Due to their primary food choice as larvae being the tobacco leaf, for the agricultural business they present themselves to be a pest. Therefore, it is more beneficial for the tobacco hornworms to reach their adult phase because once their reach adulthood, their primary diet changes. Therefore, the effect of the juvenile hormone on the Manduca Sexta larvae will prove to be very beneficial to the production of pesticides. We chose to use the Manduca Sexta larvae as our subject due to its distinctive developmental phases. The Manduca Sexta, typically, goes through four to five distinctive instar phases with gradual weight and length increase as it approaches its adult phase [Byron: 2017]. They are prevalent in North Carolina due to their diet consisting primarily of tobacco leaves as well as their relatively quick lifecycle [Villanueva: 2018]. Collectively we hypothesized that if we expose the Manduca Sexta to an increased level of JH in its food, then their developmental stage will be prolonged preventing them from reaching the typical weight of the final 5th instar stage into adult eclosion.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta larva were collected then randoMly selected into two groups of four. Each group was fed a 10-gram portion of the provided caterpillar food. Each were also kept in the same incubation machine, the temperature consistent for both groups. The controll group of larva’s foods was treated with six drops of distilled water, the food was then rolled into a small ball in order to retain moisture then provided to each of the four controll group larvae. The experimental group’s food was treated with six drops of Precor- juvenile hormone-, their food also rolled into a small ball to retain moisture. Each larva was massed every day for the last two weeks. Each day for measurement the fecal matter was cleaned out of the containing unit for each larva and if the food was dry to the touch it was replaced with another 10-gram amount treated with the proper treatment.   In order to properly analyze the data -make sure the results weren’t due to chance- a two-tailed T-test was used to determine the p_value.

Results:
After the two weeks of testing, we were successful in preventing the death of any of our test subjects. There were also visible differences in the quality of health between the experimental and controll groups- discoloration in the experimental group. The weights of the experimental were proven to be statistically insignificent when compared to the controll groups weights (p_value: 0.397 controll group SD: 1.86 average: 12.495 experimental group SD: 5.34 average: 9.914). Each group showed significent signs of increase in both the experimental and controll weights, however through the statistical testing, these weight changes were not notably significent from one another. The difference of weight change from the first day and the last day were recorded (Figure 1. Mean weight differences between the experimental and controll group)

Discussion:
Our initial hypothesis was rejected due to the results of our statistical testing proving no significent difference between the weight of the controll group and the experimental group. Therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted in that the presence of excess JH does not affect the length of their developmental period. The statistical test further proves that our differences in weights- when comparing the experimental and controll group- were most likely due to chance. However, the visual difference between the two groups was very evident in the behavior and overall health disparities between the two groups. The larva in the experimental group began to have yellow discoloration as opposed to the controll group and also molted less than that of the controll group. Post molting, they remained in a seemingly juvenile state, thus providing visual evidence that the presence of the juvenile hormone is preventing the subjects from developing the adult structures -reproductive and wing structures- which has been proven to be an effect of the juvenile hormone [Davey: 1977]. There was also a lack in significent weight drops in the experimental groups due to molting, however, it can be predicted that the lack of a weight drop was due to the presence of the juvenile hormone. This is relevant because weight drops correlate to an insect’s pupation, therefore the lack of a weight drop from the experimental group could be due to the presence of JH in their food thus preventing them from properly pupating. It is suspected that the lack of statistical difference between the two groups could be due to a relatively low dose of the juvenile hormone present in the experimental group’s food treatment. This study utilized 6 drops of the juvenile hormone; therefore, it can be predicted that if a slightly higher dose is added to the treatment groups food then there may be a larger statistical difference between the two groups.   In order to improve this experiment, more drops of the hormone could be added to the food to enhance the effects of the juvenile hormone on the growth and development of the larva subjects. As well as increasing the sample size of both the controll and experimental group to further observe the changes between the two groups in order to get a larger sample size to lessen the standard deviation in the weights of the two groups. In doing this we will have a broader study group to see if there is significent prolongment in the developmental stage of the Manduca Sexta larvae with the presence of JH. This will allow us to accurately see the relevance of having JH in pesticides in order to determine how much should be present in pesticides to prevent them from staying in the larvae stage for an extended period of time.
