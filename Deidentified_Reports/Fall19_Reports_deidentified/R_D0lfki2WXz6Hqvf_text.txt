Title: The Effects of Salt Stress on Photosystem II of Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The main objective of the present study was to determine if salt stress decreased the photosystem II activity in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea leaves. Salt stress has been shown by previous studies in the field to decrease photosynthetic capacity, however the effect of salinity on Spinacia oleracea in particular is not agreed upon. This study used the Hill Assay to measure photosystem II activity of chloroplasts prepared in 0 mM NaCl, 100 mM NaCl, and 200 mM NaCl solutions. The results of this study did not show any significent difference between the photosystem II activities of the groups after 30 minutes. We conclude that further research should be done to confirm this finding and that if Spinacia oleracea truly is resistant to the effects of salt stress, this knowledge will be useful for agriculture under climate change. 

Introduction:
Plants depend on cellular energy that is produced through the process of photosynthesis. The photosynthesis reaction takes six carbon dioxide molecules and twelve water molecules and converts them into one glucose molecule, six water molecules, and six molecular oxygen molecules. This process requires many components that are found in the organelle, chloroplasts. These components are classified into three stages in the process of photosynthesis – Photosystem I, Photosystem II, and the Calvin Cycle (Bio 113 Lab Sakai Site). The first two stages are dependent upon light, as the processes completed in these stages use the energy of photons to begin. In photosystem I, the energy from the photons is used to bring electrons in the chlorophyll molecules to an excited state. The excited electrons aid in the conversion of NADP+ to NADPH, a process which aids in the formation of the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane (Bio 113 Lab Sakai Site). Simultaneously, photosystem II uses the energy from the photons to excite the chlorophyll electrons enough to move them to the plastoquinone. Hydrolysis reactions then reduce the chlorophyll and produce molecular oxygen along with electrons and protons that join the proton gradient in the thylakoid membrane. The plastoquinone then transfers electrons as more protons are added to the proton gradient (Bio 113 Lab Sakai Site). The ATP generated from this proton gradient along with the NADPH from photosystem I are then used by the Calvin Cycle to complete the process of photosynthesis (Bio 113 Lab Sakai Site). 
	To gain further understanding of the process of photosynthesis and what effects it, we needed to determine a way to measure the complex processes outlined above in a laboratory setting. We determined that we would measure the activity of photosystem II by measuring its passing of electrons to alternative electron acceptors. This reaction is called the Hill Reaction. The Hill Reaction allows for usage of a spectrophotometer to measure light absorbance as a stand-in for photosystem II activity. As the electrons are passed and the alternative electron acceptor is reduced, the color of the molecules will shift towards colorless which will decrease the light absorbance measured. 
	Various factors can affect the activity of photosystem II, and therefore the process of photosynthesis. One such factor is the salinity of the environment in which the chloroplasts are undergoing their reactions. High salinity or “salt stress” is thought to adversely affect the process of photosynthesis, and is thought to have specific negative effects on photosystem II (Mehta et al.: 2010). It is thought that salinity may create salt stress on the electron transport mechanism which inhibits the electron transfer process in photosystem II (Mehta et al.: 2010). This would be shown through the Hill Reaction outlined above because an inhibition of the electron transfer process would stop the reduction of the alternative electron acceptors. Salt stress is also thought to impair the carbon dioxide supply available for the chloroplasts to use as an input for the photosynthesis reaction (Chaves et al.: 2009). This suppression of carbon dioxide is thought to have a particular effect on photosystem II, although the mechanism of this effect is not currently agreed upon in the field (Murata et al.: 2007). There is additional evidence that high salt content inhibits the repair of photodamage in photosystem II as well (Murata et al.: 2007).
	The organism used in our study was Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). This is a model organism for the present study because it is a common crop and it is relatively easy to extract its chloroplasts. Additionally, there is not consensus in the field on the effects of salinity on spinach chloroplasts which makes spinach an important organism to study. Some previous studies have shown that the photosynthesis activity in spinach is altered by the salinity of the environment in which they were grown. Spinach plants grown in high salinity environments in Chow et al.’s study showed less photosynthetic capacity than spinach plants grown in low salinity environments (Chow et al.: 1990). However, other studies have shown that although spinach plant growth is suppressed when grown in high salinity environments, the photosynthetic capacity is not measurably different at the level of the chloroplasts (Downton et al.: 1985). 
	Due to the lack of consensus in the field, we wanted to gain further insight on if there was a measurable impact of salinity on the photosystem II activity in spinach leaves. All of the studies discussed above examined the effects that growing plants in environments of different salinity contents had on the photosynthetic capacity of the chloroplasts. Due to the lack of prior knowledge about the effect of placing chloroplasts from the same leaves into solutions of different salinity contents, we decided to test the immediate effect of salinity on photosystem II activity in this way. This study would add knowledge to the field on if effects of salinity are resulting from a plant growing in high salt content or from simple exposure to high salt content. We hypothesize that we will see higher absorbances (representing less photosystem II activity) for the experimental samples soaked in saline solution (100 mM NaCl and 200 mM NaCl) than for the controll sample soaked in water. 


Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we used a Hill Assay to compare absorbances as a stand-in for activities of our controll and experimental groups. Our groups consisted of a negative controll of no chloroplasts and no salinity, a positive controll of chloroplasts and no salinity, an experimental of chloroplasts and 100 mM NaCl, and a second experimental of chloroplasts and 200 mM NaCl. Each group also contained 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. To isolate the chloroplasts for the assay, we put our ground-up spinach leaves with grinding buffer through several centrifuge spins until we successfully removed as much of the other parts of the spinach leaves as possible through this method. Triplicates of each condition were created and the absorbances of each sample were tested and recorded right after they were mixed, after 10 minutes, after 20 minutes, and finally after 30 minutes. The recorded absorbances after 30 minutes were the values used for data analysis because these values were taken after the most amount of time given for the reaction to occur. We used two independent samples t_tests to determine if the absorbances of the 100 mM NaCl samples significently differed from those of the positive controlls and if the absorbances of the 200 mM NaCl samples differed from those of the positive controlls. 

Results:
The results of our study showed no significent difference between the absorbances of the experimental group with 100 mM NaCl (M = 0.374, n = 3, SD = 0.047) and the positive controll group (M = 0.372, n = 3, SD = 0.014), t(4) = 0.09, p = 0.93. The results also showed no significent difference between the absorbances of the experimental group with 200 mM NaCl (M = 0.314, n = 3, SD = 0.058) and the positive controll group, t(4) = 0.08, p = 0.17. These findings can be seen in Figure 1. The general trends of our data showed that the positive controll group showed an increase in absorbance over the 30 minutes (average percent change of 0.92) and the two experimental groups showed a decrease in absorbance over the 30 minutes (average percent changes of -0.49 for the 100 mM NaCl group and -9.01 for the 200 mM NaCl group). These results can be seen in Figure 2.

Discussion:
The results displayed above do not support our hypothesis that our spinach chloroplasts would show a decrease of photosystem II activity when reacting in a solution with high salinity. Rather, the results show no significent difference between the groups at all. This was a surprising finding because prior literature has suggested that salt stress inhibits the activity of the electron transport process (Mehta et al.: 2010). One possible reason that the present study did not show the effect of salt stress on the electron transport process could be that the concentrations of salt used in the study (100 mM and 200 mM) were not sufficient to create this effect in the short time frame of 30 minutes. The study that suggested the inhibition of the electron transport process conducted an NaCl treatment over one hour before taking measurements and used concentrations up to 0.5 M NaCl (Mehta et al.: 2010). This difference in design could explain why we did not see a decrease in photosystem II activity in the present study. 
	Another possible reason for our finding is that salinity may not have a large effect on the photosynthetic capacity of spinach plants. Prior studies have shown little to no effect of salinity on photosynthesis of spinach plants specifically, but have found a large effect on the size of the plant (Downton et al,: 1983). Downton et al.’s study showed that although spinach plants subject to high salinity environments did not grow nearly as large as the spinach plants not subject to high salinity environments, the chloroplast activity was not altered (Downton et al,: 1983). From these findings and the contribution of the present study, it is a possible conclusion that the chloroplasts of spinach plants in particular are not adversely affected by salt stress in the same way as some other plants.
	After completing this study, I suggest further research on the photosystem II activity of spinach chloroplasts. A subsequent study should be conducted over a longer period of time comparing the photosystem II activities of salt-stressed spinach chloroplasts and salt-stressed chloroplasts of other plant types. Ideally, this subsequent study will have larger sample sizes in order to increase the power and pick up on an effect if one is present. 
	Furthering the knowledge about the effects of salinity on photosynthesis is important because the salinity of the water on earth (and therefore the soil as well) is increasing due to the rising seal-levels resulting from climate change (Vineis et al.: 2011). As climate change continues and salinity increases, it is important to know which crops may be able to withstand the salinity and continue providing food. The present study along with other previous ones alluded to above point to spinach as a possibility of a crop with a strong ability to withstand high salt content.
