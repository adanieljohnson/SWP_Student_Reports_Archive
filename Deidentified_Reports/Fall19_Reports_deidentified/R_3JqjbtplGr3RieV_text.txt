Title: Effects of Salinity on Plant Growth of Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation in plants can be caused as a result of variations in environmental conditions and resource availability. Salt contamination is one such condition that can be caused by the wind, rain, the weathering of rocks, or ocean flooding. This environmental variation was replicated in this study by watering an experimental group of Buckwheat plants, Fagopyrum esculentum, with a 6 g per liter saline solution. This tested for a decrease in plant growth in comparison to the control group that was watered with tap water. The results showed a significant decrease in average root length (p= 0.0003), average shoot length (p=0.003), average root mass (p=0.01), average shoot mass (p=0.007), and root-shoot length ratio (p=0.002). There was no significant decrease in root-shoot mass ratio (p=0.39). The data collected on length and mass indicated that saline contamination inhibited plant growth by draining water resources, rather than altering resource allocation.

Introduction:
Variations in environmental conditions can produce limits on the resources that plants require such as water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients. These limitations can lead to phenotypic changes in the plants growing under those conditions due to allocating resources to either the roots or the shoots (stems), or through mechanisms that inhibit access to, or drain, these resources. One possible environmental change that can affect growing plants is salt contamination. Salt can get into soil through wind, rain, or the weathering of rocks (Rengasamy 2010). Additionally, rising sea levels and the increasing frequency and intensity of flooding pose great risks for an increase in salt contamination. Salt contaminated soil can prevent water absorption at the roots of plants because saline lowers the potential energy outside the roots, causing water to move away from high potential energy inside the roots and outside the plant, leading to dehydration. Additionally, sodium and chloride ion buildup in the plant can lead to ion toxicity over time (Rengasamy 2010). Finally, salt has been observed to increase absorption of the toxic element cadmium, which can hinder plant growth by inhibiting respiration, photosynthesis, water-related processes, and gas exchange (Xu et al. 2010). Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as Buckwheat, is an ideal model organism because it matures quickly and is a grain crop, meaning experiments on buckwheat provide a good representation of how salinity will affect popular crops (Encyclopaedia Britannica 2017). This lab predicted that the introduction of a saline solution to the watering routine of growing buckwheat plants would result in a decrease in plant growth due to salt contamination of soil inhibiting the absorption of water. 

Materials and Methods:
Buckwheat seeds were planted to make 6 control and 6 experimental replicants. For each replicant, about 4 germinated buckwheat seeds were planted in a pot of vermiculite, 50 mL of Miracle Grow were added, and then soaked with water. Both control and experimental groups were placed in a greenhouse and watered daily for 2 weeks. The control group was soaked with tap water daily while the experimental group was soaked with a 6g per liter NaCl solution. After 2 weeks, the tallest individual of each replicant was isolated from the pot and excess soil was delicately washed from the plant to ensure all roots remained intact. Then, each plant was cut to separate roots and shoots. Root and shoot length and mass of each individual was measured and the corresponding root-shoot ratios were calculated. Finally, the results between the experimental and control groups were analyzed for significant differences using a one-tailed two sample t-test. 

Results:
Average root and shoot length and mass, and root-shoot ratios for length and mass are displayed in Figure 1. One replicant in the control group did not produce any plants so averages from this group only consisted of five replicants. There was a general decrease in average root and shoot length between the control and experimental group (Figure 2). A similar trend was seen between the control and experimental group of root and shoot mass (Figure 3). The root-shoot ratios for length and mass also displayed a general decreasing trend from control to experimental. However, the mass ratios did not decrease as intensely and the length ratios (Figure 4).

Discussion:
The results indicated that introducing saline to growing buckwheat plants resulted in a significant decrease in average root length (p= 0.0003), average shoot length (p=0.003), average root mass (p=0.01), and average shoot mass (p=0.007). Although there was also a significant decrease in root-shoot length ratio (p=0.002), there was no significant decrease in root-shoot mass ratio (p=0.39). Increase in salt contamination can also increase the cadmium concentration in plants which has been shown to reduce all nutrients and inhibit physiological processes in plants (Xu et al. 2010). Because of this, salinity would likely affect the roots and shoots in similar proportions. Therefore, the data collected on length and mass was more useful in showing that salinity decreased plant growth by producing smaller root and shoot masses and lengths in the experimental group compared to the control. The significance of the lengths and masses in comparison to the ratios also indicated that salt causes phenotypic changes in plants by draining resources rather than altering resource allocation. These findings could be valuable in agricultural businesses by helping farmers create the best environment to maximize crop growth by avoiding areas that are at risk of high salt contamination. Minimal levels of salt in the environment are inevitable, but future studies can be lead to determine what specific salt concentrations can cause detrimental effects. Therefore, farmers could be notified when the salt contamination to their crops is high enough to require action. The results of this study and future adaptations could also have greater implications because increasing salt contamination can be a result of human actions. Human pollution and destruction has caused global climate change, leading to rising sea levels worldwide. These rising sea levels can cause sea water to intrude into coastal soils, increasing the salt concentration in environments were crops are grown. In the Pacific Islands, for example, there has been observed a 0.6-2.0 mm per year rise in sea levels since 1950. Here, places where crops are grown usually only rise a maximum of 5 meters above sea level, but the sea levels could continue to rise 0.2-0.4 meters by 2050 (Aladjadjiyan 2012). It is likely that similar observations can be made in other coastal regions around the world where people rely on crop growing near oceans to survive. Additionally, severe events like storms and flooding are increasing in severity and frequency which could also cause salt water contamination for farms and crops affected by these events. These studies are important to show the detrimental effects of salt contamination on plant growth and agricultural productivity, displaying yet another reason why actions must be taken to slow climate change and rising sea levels, or to find mechanisms to combat these environmental changes.
