Title: Effect of red light on the resource allocation of mung beans (Vigna Radiata)

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect that red light would have on the growth rate of mung beans (Vigna radiata) in terms of resource allocation. We hypothesized that the plants grown under the red light would have larger shoots, thus, giving us a smaller root to shoot ratio because the use of red light on plants has been shown to facilitate photosynthesis and produce elongated plants. We had three control pots, each planted with four mung bean seeds, that received normal sunlight, and three experimental pots that were placed under a thin, red plastic tarp, and both were left for two weeks. They were watered daily with 200 mL of tap water. We then measured the root length, shoot length, and then analyzed the root to shoot ratio at the end of the two weeks. A two-sample one-tailed t-test was then done on all these to see if there was significant difference. The results of this experiment partially support our hypothesis because while there isn’t any significant difference between the root to shoot length ratios of the two groups (p = 0.44) or between the average root length (p = 0.10), there was a significant difference between the average shoot lengths of the two groups (p = 0.04).

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of an environmental condition to see how it might affect the growth of leguminous plants in terms of resource allocation. We chose to test the effect red light would have on the root and shoot growth rate of mung beans (Vigna radiata) since plants rely on sunlight to produce the nutrients they need through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is crucial for most life earth, and any environmental factors that have the ability to affect photosynthetic rates in plants will have drastic effects on plant growth. 
	Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplast of plants and it converts light energy from the sun into consumable chemical energy to fuel the individual’s activities [Alberts: 2002]. Critical to the first steps of photosynthesis are proteins called light-harvesting complexes (LHCs), which are excited by photons and drives chemical reactions necessary for survival [Kondo: 2017]. Red light (600-700nm) is generally considered one of the most efficient wavelengths for eliciting photosynthesis in plants and stimulating plant growth, and in many cases, plants grown solely under red light have a stretched, elongated appearance [McCree: 1972]. 
	In response to resource limitations in their environment, most species have evolved to allocate their resources in a particular pattern, which is referred to as resource allocation. In nature, selective pressures have led species to make certain evolutionary trade-offs, to gain tolerance to biotic or abiotic stressors that threaten their survival [Johnson: 2019]. There’s always some room for modification of the general pattern, depending on the variations in the environment the organism faces [Johnson: 2019]. The resource required for plant growth can be divided into those needed above ground (i.e. shoots) and those below soil surface (i.e. roots), and plant species will vary in how they allocate their energy and metabolic resources among the different parts [Johnson: 2019]. This phenotypic plasticity can be measured through the length of the roots and shoots of a plant, and by comparing root to shoot ratios. 
	Mung beans are a plant species in the legume family, originating from East and South Asia, that grow at a relatively rapid rate and mature early, making them ideal species to study in a laboratory setting. We hypothesized that the experimental group, under the effect of red light, would have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group and there would be a significant difference. We would expect this seeing as plants grown under red light have been found to have an extended appearance above the ground, thus, the ratio would have a larger denominator, giving a smaller number.


Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, we began by obtaining mung bean seeds and soaking them before planting them into six black pots with vermiculite. Each pot contained four seeds, and we placed the pots facing the sunlight in the greenhouse. Three pots were left in the natural sunlight (control), while the other three were placed under a red-light tarp (experimental group). The plants were monitored daily for two weeks and were given 200 mL of tap water daily. After the two weeks, the six pots were removed from the greenhouse to be examined and compared. The entire pot was placed in a tub of water to loosen the soil to obtain individual replicates. We then chose eight individual replicates at random from both the control and experimental groups (16 in total). Each replicate was dried thoroughly and weighed. Each replicate was then carefully cut at the root-shoot junction, and the roots and shoots were separately weighed and measured. The root to shoot ratio of the control and experimental group were analyzed and compared through a two-sample one-tailed t-test.

Results:
The average maximum root length measured of mung bean plants under normal conditions was 8.09 cm, with a standard deviation of 5.02 cm, while the one measured for plants under experimental conditions (red light) averaged 10.90 cm, with a standard deviation of 3.10 cm (Figure 1). There was no significant difference (p = 0.10) between the average root lengths of the two groups. Furthermore, the average maximum shoot length measured of mung bean plants under normal conditions was 11.23 cm, with a standard deviation of 4.17 cm, while the one measured for plants under red light averaged 14.30 cm, with a standard deviation of 2.50 cm (Figure 2). There was a significant difference (p = 0.046) between the average shoot lengths of the two groups. Moreover, the mung beans in the control group has an average R:S value of 0.81, with a standard deviation of 0.49, while the plants under the red light had an average R:S value of 0.77, with a standard deviation of 0.20 (Figure 3). There was no significant difference (p = 0.44) between the root to shoot length ratios of the two groups.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment partially support our hypothesis because while there isn’t any significant difference between the root to shoot length ratios of the two groups, there was a significant difference between the average shoot lengths of the two groups. We expected the plants in the experimental group, under the red light to allocate more resources to the shoots to expend energy on growth and reproduction, instead of the collection of nutrients from the soil [Johnson: 2019]. Therefore, giving us longer shoots, and smaller root to shoot ratios. This is due to the fact that under the red light they are not obtaining the optimum lighting and are trying to grow to reach the sunlight. While we do see a significant difference between the average shoot length of the groups, with the plants under the red light growing more, seeing as there was no significant difference between the R:S ratio, we can determine that in this experiment the mung beans were not allocating most of their energy to the shoots. 
	A factor that could have affected our results is that rather than using red light bulbs, we used a red-colored thin tarp, which could have slipped off its tent since the sticks were not permanently held down, or it could have received uneven red light if the tarp was moved throughout the watering of plants. The fact that it was in a greenhouse, where plants receive a wide solar spectrum also influences our results, since the color of light used would have less impact on extension of shoots. Furthermore, in some cases plants grown under only red light do not have desirable growth characteristics, and with the addition of some blue light there would be more compact plants [Wollaeger: 2015]. 
	To better this experiment in the future, it would be beneficial to use a red light bulb, instead of the tarp, and then separate the experimental group into an area that will only receive the light from the bulb, to have less confounding variables and get more accurate results. This experiment is important because our global environment is currently experiencing a period of significant change in climate at an incredibly rapid rate, one we’ve never witnessed before, and this will cause damage to plants and it may alter their physiological functions. Farmers will have to find more efficient ways of producing high-yield crops in a world of less resources, and understanding how plants allocate their energy to different environmental stimuli could be a step in the right direction.
