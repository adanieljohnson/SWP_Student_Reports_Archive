Title: Rate of habituation in Betta splendins according to agnostic behavior in response to identity and distance of exposure to stimulus

Abstract:
Agonistic behavior can be observed in male Betta splendins that exhibit both broadside and facing behaviors when confronted with a stimulus. Stimuli can include their own image in a mirror as well as another male. This study considered a single male Betta splendins exposed to his own image in a mirror for trial group 1, two males exposed to each other while physically separated in adjacent compartments of a tank for trial group 2, and two males exposed to each other while physically separated at opposite ends of a tank for trial group 3. The purpose was to determine the relationship between habituation, or the adaptation to a stimulus, and distance of separation between subject and stimulus. The hypothesis indicated that time of habituation would increase with each repetition of a trial, that the trial group 1 would have the shortest time of habituation, trial group 2 would have the longest time of habituation, and trial group 3 would have a moderate time of habituation. The data collected supported the predicted trends, but p_values of 0.071 and 0.458 for two-sample t_tests between trials 1 and 2 and trials 2 and 3, respectively indicated a lack of significance in the data. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendins exhibit agnostic behavior when exposed to the stimulus of another male, with or without a physical barrier and in mirrors when the stimulus is their own image. The behaviors exhibited are broken down into two different categories, intraspecific within the same species, and interspecific between different species [Johnson: 2019]. The behaviors examined in this experiment were solely intraspecific between male Betta splendins exposed to varying stimuli including exposure to self-image in a mirror, exposure to a second male while physically separated but in close proximity, and exposure to a second male while physically separated at a long distance. According to previous studies, agnostic behaviors were exhibited by male Betta splendins both in response to the presence of other males as well as in response to a mirror [Bronstein: 1984]. Behaviors considered agnostic include the broadside behaviors of pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing in order of increasing aggression, as well as the facing behaviors of erect pectoral fins, spreading of opercula, and creating red “mane,” again in order of increasing aggression [Johnson: 2019]. Habituation, or the modification of behavior over time in response to a continuous exposure to a stimulus, results in the lessening of agnostic behavior of male Betta splendins over time of exposure [Peeke: 1969]. Based on prior studies, males should exhibit increased agnostic behavior when exposed to another male rather than being exposed to his own image in a mirror [Bronstein: 1983]. In addition, prior studies have suggested that distance between subjects and stimuli is inversely related to intensity of agnostic behaviors of male Betta splendins in response to stimulus [Bronstein: 1981]. We hypothesize that the time of habituation will decrease with each repetition of exposure in each sample situation. In addition, habituation will occur faster in one male exposed to his own image in a mirror as a stimulus than in two males physically separated at a distance from each other, both of which will exhibit faster rates of habituation than two males physically separated from each other in close proximity. 

Materials and Method:
Three male Betta splendins that would be used for subsequent trials were first observed quietly in their isolated environments with no external stimuli presented. One male was then exposed to a stimulus via his own image in a mirror for the first trial, using fish 1. The second trial, using fish 2 and 3, examined the behavior of two physically separated males in adjacent compartments in the tank, which was the considered the standard controll and was compared to the other two trial groups for analysis and statistical testing. The third trial, using fish 1 and 2, considered two physically separated males at opposite ends of the tank. The time at which the last agnostic behavior was displayed before a period of relaxation lasting at least thirty seconds was considered the time of habituation for this study and was recorded along with observations for each trial, which lasted for up to six minutes. Each trial was completed three times. The subjects were allowed to rest for at least five minutes between each trial to prevent over-stressing of the fish. Two-sample t_tests were conducted, one for trial one, of one male exposed to a mirror image of itself, versus trial two, the standard controll of two physically separated males in adjacent compartments, and the second for trial three, of two physically separated males at opposite ends of the tank, versus trial two, the standard controll. 

Results:
Fish 2 was the most active out of the three subjects. Fish 3 was inactive throughout the study. All trials were capped at six minutes. The average time of habituation of trial 1 was less than that of the standard controll and the average time of habituation for trial 3 was less than that of the standard controll, but greater than that of trial 1, as shown in Figure 1. The one-tailed p_values for the two-sample t_tests were 0.071 for the first test comparing trial 1 to the standard controll and 0.458 for the second test comparing trial 3 to the standard controll. 

Discussion:
The trends shown in the data supported the original hypothesis. Each group exhibited a decrease in times of habituation with the only exception being a ten second increase between the first and second replications in trial group 3, which is consistent with former studies [Peeke: 1969]. The average time of habituation of one male exposed to his own image in a mirror, for trial 1, was lower than that of trial 2 and trial 3 and the time of habituation for trial 3 was lower than that of trial 2, all of which supported the original hypothesis. However, the p_values of the two t_tests did not indicate significance in the data. One variable that was not accounted for in this study was the natural level of aggression of each fish. For example, fish 2 exhibited significently more agnostic behavior in response to minimal stimuli than either of the other fish and took longer to reach habituation than either of the other fish. This behavior could have contributed to different results than if a different, less-active fish was used in the trials. The results, though not statistically significent, are consistent with previous study. Male Betta splendins exposed to their own images in a mirror present with less agnostic behavior, overall than those exposed to another male [Bronstein: 1983]. Increased distance was also shown to decrease the time of habituation, as suggested in previous study as distance being inversely related to the level of agnostic behavior [Bronstein: 1981]. Options for further study of this subject include larger-scale study to controll for the individual differences in behavior between fish, increased variety of distances to identify a more exact relationship between distance and habituation, and identification of the point at which the distance between two fish is too great to provoke any sort of agnostic behavior. Other variables that could be considered include the size of the fish, coloring of the fish, and characteristics of the surrounding environment (e.g. obstructions in view such as plant life or rocks). This specified study of Betta splendins agnostic behavior is applicable to the overall study of animal behavior in varying environments and can be applied to fields from large-scale farming to household pets to veterinary practice.
