Title: Temperature Effects on the Agonistic Behaviors of Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Betta Splenden were chosen due to their intensive and obvious display when they are around other Betta splendens. There is limited research on the impact  of temperature variation on behavior traits, which expresses the need for this study.  The experimental hypothesis is: when Betta Splenden  from cold, room temperature, and warm water environments are placed in a tank  the fish from the warmer environment will be more aggressive and bold due increased Betta Splendan being warm water fish and warm temperatures cause more general  movement or responses.  There were a total of four fish with one fish in both the colder and warmer fish tank and then two fish at room temperature. The ANOVA test showed that there was no significance between the normal and hot temperature environment; however there was a significant difference between the cold and hot as well as cold and normal tanks.  The results showed that temperature does play a role in the exhibited aggressive behaviors of the Betta splendas; however, the temperature that had the most impact was the colder temperature.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior.  It allows for researchers to  study and gather insight about ecosystems, genetics, and evolutionary biology.  Ethnology is beneficial because studying one organism’s behaviors and intraspecific behaviors with in its own species allows for researchers to understand different be behaviors such as survival and mating.  These behaviors are interspecific and affect the organisms living in that ecosystem.  Understanding these behaviors help to understand the balance and function of that particular environment.  Also, no one species is the same but some species behaviors are similar to others, at least enough to learn from and apply it to the understanding of another.  Etologist also use their research to understand the change in behaviors and evolution’s impact on the species
In this study the organism that is being observed is the Betta splendens, also known as a Siamese fighting fish.  These organisms were chosen due to their intensive and obvious display when they are around other Betta splendens.  Some of the displays include broadside and facing movements.  Broad side movements are considered to be less threatening in comparison to the facing movements.  Broad side movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing.  The intimidating  behaviors that the fish exhibits when they notice another fish of the same species are erected pectoral fins, spreading of their gill covers, and protruding  their branchiostegal membranes-- “red manning”.   Another interesting behavior to be observed is how one fish will react to the fish first that demonstrating aggressive--or agonistic behaviors.  They may choose to intensify the situation, ignore it or try to escape the situation altogether
After researching these behaviors and response some of them resemble human behaviors as well; in the since that they act this way to be intimidating or protect themselves.  This understanding leads to the question of how does temperature impact the behavior of an organism.  Many people believe that tension, aggression, and violence go hand in hand with increased environmental  temperature. The  Forsatkar et al.  study stated that there is limited research on the impact  of temperature variation on behavior traits.  They also noticed an increased “boldness” in increased temperature.  This idea and research is what lead to the current study. Due to the lack of information regarding colder temperatures this study includes it in the variables.   The experimental hypothesis is: when Betta Splenden  from cold, room temperature, and warm water environments are placed in a tank  the fish from the warmer environment will be more aggressive and bold due increased Betta Splenden being warm water fish and warm temperatures cause more general  movement or responses.




Materials and Methods:
There were a total of four fish.  There was one fish in both the colder and warmer fish and then two fish in the room temperature water. Each tank is a different temperature to represent different environmental temperatures; 16℃,19℃,21℃.  The cold tank was created by gradually adding ice to room temperature water while the fish sat in a container in the tank.  The warm tank was created using a heating pad.  Each of the 3  fish were in their tank for about 15 minutes to get acclimated with their environment.  After the 15 minutes were over the divider between the two room temperature fish was removed and the fish were observed for 5 minutes.  After the 5 minutes were over the dividers were put back in place for 5 minutes so that the fish could rest.  This occurred two more times. The next fish to be observed was the warmer one. The fish was removed from the warmer tank was placed in the tank with the room temperature fish, but on the opposite side of the divider.  Once the warm fish was in the room temperature tank for 5 minutes the dividers were removed and the fish were observed for 5 minutes.  When those 5 minutes ended the divider was placed between the two fish.  The warm fish was placed back in the warm tank for 5 minutes.  This happened two more times.  The same process occurred between the cold and warm fish 3 times.  An ANOVA Test was used to test the significance of these tests.


Results:
The ANOVA test showed that there was no significance between the normal and hot temperature environment; however there was a significant difference between the cold and hot as well as cold and normal tanks.  During the normal tank trials there were an average of 8.66 observed agnostic behaviors per trial with a standard deviation of +/- 2.88. In the warm tank it was an average of 13.33 +/- 2.88 observation per trial and 0 for the cold tank.  This data can be seen in Figure 1.



Discussion:
The hypothesis for this study was partially supported.  The results showed that temperature does play a role in the exhibited aggressive behaviors of the Betta Splenden; however, the temperature that had the most impact was the colder temperature.  Rather than the warm fish becoming significantly more aggressive due to their exposure to a warmer environment, the idea that was expected, the cold fish became significantly inactive.  When the cold fish was placed with the controlled fish the cold fish showed no agnosist intraspecific behaviors.  Rather than engage with the other Betta splenden the cold fish constantly swam away.  The colder  temperature had a greater impact on the behavior of the fish over the warm temperature is a decrease in body temperature changes the physical chemistry of the cell produced a decline in metabolic activity [Johnston:1987].  Low temperatures can lead to dormancy in fish as well.  [Johnston: 1987].  The reason that the cold temperature had a greater impact than the warmer one was because Betta fish are more accustomed to warmer temperatures.  So the warmer tank had an impact, just not as much.

Studies like this are important due to the increasing climate.  Climate change is affecting organisms and their ecosystems.  Understanding temperature impacts can help researchers predict the effects of climate change.  Some conclusions that can be made for this experiment is that decreased temperatures can  affect birth rates and overall survival rates because of the dormancy; it enables their metabolic activities.  The increase of temperature is important to understand, because if high temperatures increase activity there may be an increase on birth and death rates.  The fish may fight each other more causing and increase in deaths; however, the increase in activity may increase mating activity and birth rates. Experimenting on Betta fish can help to understand other fish and other organisms that are similar.  Learning this information is necessary to understand the planet and its inhabitants. One topic that can be studied to enhance this study is determining if the duration of time spent in different temperature environments play a role in behaviors as well.
