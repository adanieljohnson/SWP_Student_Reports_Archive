Title: Effect of Salinity on Photosystem-II Activity in Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
Photosynthesis, glycolysis, and respiration are all extremely important metabolic processes in organisms. In this lab we focused on photosynthesis and more specifically photosystem-II activity. The main objective of this experiment was to figure out what environmental factors impact reduction and oxidation reactions which ultimately impact photosystem-II activity. In this experiment we specifically focused on salinity and how increasing the concentration of salinity would affect photosystem-II activity in spinach leaves. In order to conduct this experiment we made 4 groups with different concentrations of NaCl. The first group had no chloroplasts in it and 0mM NaCl, the last three groups all had chloroplasts but had different concentrations of NaCl. The second group had 0mM NaCl, the third group had 100mM NaCl, and the fourth group had 200mM NaCl. We then tested the absorbances of these groups over a time span of 30 minutes testing the absorbances every 10 minutes, and we also found the percent changes between every time. Overall, we found that the absorbance levels were lower at the higher salinity concentration which means that there was more photosystem-II activity which is not what we hypothesized would happen which therefore means that we failed to reject the null hypothesis

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and some other organisms where they utilize sunlight and ultimately convert the light energy from the sun to chemical energy. After photosynthesis occurs the energy stored from photosynthesis is released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and by respiration in the mitochondria. Photosynthesis, glycolysis, and respiration are all extremely important metabolic processes in organisms. In this lab, the main objective is to figure out what environmental factors impact reduction and oxidation reactions which ultimately impact photosystem-II activity. There are many different variables that have an effect on photosystem-II activity. Photosystem-II is the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions in photosynthesis. Photosystem-II is located in the thylakoid membrane. The main function of this photosystem is to capture energy from absorbed photons of light which will ultimately cause electrons to leave chlorophyll and move to plastoquinone. In this experiment, our lab group focused on the effects of salinity on photosystem-II activity. In previous experiments that have also tested the effects of salinity on the photosystem-II activity, it has been shown that salinity affects many different types of organelles within the plant that are necessary for photosynthesis. For example, in an experiment done it was shown that there was, “A decrease in chlorophyll concentration in salinized plants” [Longstreth: 1983]. Therefore, our hypothesis that we tested was that if we put the spinach leaves in different concentrations of NaCl then the photosynthesis levels, more specifically the photosystem-II levels, would decrease.

Materials and Methods:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if salinity had any effect on photosystem-II activity, therefore we had to ensure that we had all of the correct materials in order to correctly do this experiment. To begin we gathered 4 spinach leaves, 24mL of DCIP, 30mL of reaction buffer, 40mL of grinding buffer, and 0.316g of NaCl. After ensuring that we had all of the correct materials we placed a mortar and pestle, medium-sized beaker, and 3 50mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to keep their temperatures low. After removing the large veins from the spinach leaves we placed the leaves in a mortar and pestle and added the cold grinding buffer to the spinach leaves and started to grind the spinach leaves into a thick paste. After that, we added another 10 mL of grinding buffer to the mortar and continued to mix everything. After the mixture was fully mixed we strained spinach slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The next main part of our experiment was to concentrate and enrich our chloroplasts. In order to obtain the chloroplasts, we transferred the filtered liquid from the beaker into a 50mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged it twice and collected the concentrated chloroplasts. This step was extremely important because the concentrated chloroplasts were necessary to make our experiment test tubes. The first tube that we made had no chloroplasts, the second test tube that we had included 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts, and 0mM concentration of NaCl solution, the third tube had 100μl of the enriched chloroplasts and 100mM of NaCl, and the final test tube that we had included 100μl of the enriched chloroplasts and 200mM of NaCl. For each of the four solutions that we were testing, we had 3 test tubes for each, therefore, including the one blank test tube we had a total of 13 test tubes. After we made all of our solutions we tested the absorbances of each of the test tubes after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes checking the %change after each amount of time.


Results:
For this experiment we measured the average percent change in absorbance measuring it every 10 minutes over a 30 minute time period, we did this for each of the four groups we observed. This data can be seen in the graphs below. For our statistical analysis, we used a two-tailed t-test. The two-tailed t-test was used to compare the percent change in absorbance averages after 30 minutes between the group with chloroplasts in the 0mM NaCl solution and 100mM NaCl solution, and then another two-tailed t-test was used to compare the percent change average in absorbance after 30 minutes between the group with chloroplasts in the 0mM NaCl and 200mM NaCl solution. We were able to get a p-value for both tests, the first one was 0.399 and the second one was 0.340. Since both of these values are greater than 0.05 they are both not statistically significantly different from one another.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that salinity would have a significant effect on photosystem-II activity was not supported by our experiment. This, therefore, means that we failed to reject the null hypothesis. During the course of our experiment we found that there was a slight decrease in the average absorbances between the group with chloroplasts at 0mM and 100mM and between the groups with chloroplasts at 0mM and 200mM. Since lower absorbances indicate that there was more photosystem-II activity this means that there was more photosystem-II activity in the group with the highest salinity concentration. We did not suspect this to happen as we thought that increasing the salinity concentration that the leaves were placed in would result in the closing of the stomata in the plant, and also reduce photosynthesis levels, more specifically photosystem-II levels. The majority of the experiments that we have looked at have shown that levels of photosystem-II activity increase at low salinity, “At low salinity, photosynthetic CO2 uptake increased over the control, but it decreased at higher salinity” [Agastian: 2000]. There could be many explanations as to why our experiment did not work the way expected it to, like the majority of other experiments that we have analyzed. First and foremost we only tested the photosystem-II activity levels in 3 different concentrations that were fairly close to one another. This, therefore, could explain why our results were not statistically different, because the concentrations were too close and provided similar results. Therefore, one improvement that we could make in the future when repeating this experiment could be raising the concentration of NaCl much higher than 200mM and adding more groups where the salinity concentrations are not as similar. Additionally, we only did 3 trials for each group which could have also had an impact on our experiment. Therefore, it would be extremely helpful in the future to increase the number of trials done for each group and conduct this experiment with much higher concentrations.
