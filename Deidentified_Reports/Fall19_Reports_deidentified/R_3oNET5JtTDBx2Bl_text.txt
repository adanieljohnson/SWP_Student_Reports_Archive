Title: Resource Allocation in Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
	While they are not our closest cousins, plants grow and adapt during their lives much like humans. They allocate resources to grow and adapt in ever changing environments, responding to various stimuli from shade to availability of nutrients in the soil (Chen 2019). To test the trends of resource allocation, it was decided to plant Raphanus sativus in three growth mediums; soil, clay and gravel. After two weeks, with daily rewatering, we extracted the plants from the growth medium. Plant growth was analyzed by determining the average size in length and mass for the Raphanus sativus, followed by the root to shoot ratio in centimeters and grams, then testing the data with an ANOVA test at 5% significance. This will prove that more nutrient rich growth mediums should exhibit larger growth and a higher root to shoot ratio. This should be followed up by an experiment on variations in the same soil type of levels of nitrogen, or levels of exposure to sunlight, as these are also factors influencing the growth and allocation of resources in a plant (Linding 2019). This would likely cause the plant to grow larger in size, and be able to allocate more resources to the shoots and leaves, as the roots would always be sufficient to gather water and nitrogen (Ruan 2013).

Introduction:
	Plants, and all organisms for that matter, are always impacted by their environment. This includes how humans and beavers greatly change their environments to survive, and includes how thousands of species of bacteria are able to survive in the most toxic, salty and hot places in the world. In order to grow and reproduce, plants must adapt to their environment, much like beavers, humans,  and bacteria have. The beauty of plants is that they have phenotypic plasticity; even individuals in the same species develop differently and do so in response to different environmental conditions (Anon 2). Plants have developed leaves for photosynthesizing glucose, and shoots to hold these leaves in the sun (Anon 1). The roots grew to gather other nutrients which are required for life, including nitrogen and water. In North Carolina plants contend with changes in temperature salinity levels of nitrogen and exposure to sunlight. Salinity and nitrogen levels are impacted by nearby fertilization by large farms, and sunlight can vary as larger trees cast shade on smaller plants. This is accounted for by the plants with a strategy known as resource allocation. Resource allocation is the ability of an organism to divert energy to one aspect of itself to more effectively compete in its environment (Ruan 2013). Plants must have basic nutrients to survive, but the allocation of these nutrients in certain areas can help the plan in a number of ways. By allocating resources to grow roots will give the plant greater access to water and nitrogen in the soil, along with being more stable (Chen 2019). Allocation to the roots means that less is available for the shoots and leaves, as resources are limited in a natural environment. The medium on which a plant grows impacts the size of the roots and shoots of plants. Knowing this, we will test how plants allocate resources in different environments by measuring the growth and resource allocation patterns of Raphanus sativus, over three growth mediums. Then, we will measure the length and weight of their roots and shoots to determine statistical differences in allocation strategies. If the Raphanus sativus grow in a less nutrient rich environment, they should allocate resources (and thus grow) differently than in a nutrient-dense environment. Specifically, the more nutrient dense soil will have a higher allocation to the roots than the clay and gravel, with gravel having the smallest size as well. 


Materials and Method:
Materials
	In order to complete this lab, a number of materials and resources must be used. To grow plants in a controllled environment, we utilized the greenhouse located in Winston Hall at Wake Forest University. The plants we used were Raphanus sativus, divided into groups of three to five. Raphanus sativus were planted in the three growth mediums; potting soil, red clay and gravel. Raphanus sativus were grown without addition of any nutrients outside of soil, sunlight and water. Additional resources needed are a scale, a ruler, paper towels, excess water for cleaning the plants, scissors, and a computer to run ANOVA tests.
Method
To begin, gently clean each plant of soil and cut at the root-shoot junction noted by a change of color. Weigh 1-10 whole plants and record the overall weight. Record the length of the overall plant. Weigh and measure the roots and shoots separately, in grams and centimeters. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the masses and lengths for each treatment group. Graph with bars showing the root:shoot ratio and standard deviation. We will use mean measurements of plant size in length and mass (in a ratio) along with an ANOVA test at 5% confidence to ensure results are not due to chance. 


Results:
	Table one shows the root to shoot ratios of the three growth groups, and Figure 1 shows the root to shoot ratio for length in centimeters. Figure 2 shows the root to shoot ratio for mass. From the two graphs, the soil group grew the largest. The clay and gravel groups grew similar in size, but the gravel group had the largest root size. For our statistical tests, we used the ANOVA test twice, using the measures of length for the roots and shoots to determine significance. The p_value from this length test is .164, which is well above the requirement of 5% confidence. Thus, the experiment may be due to random chance, and no conclusions can be drawn until this error can be reduced. The same procedure was done with the mass, and the p_value for mass was 0.19, which is below the threshold of significance, but irrelevant because of the high p_value for length. 


Discussion:
	The goal of this procedure was to determine if plants (in our case, Raphanus sativus) allocate resources differently if grown in clay, gravel and soil. As figure one shows, the size of the plants grown in soil is much larger than the other two growth mediums, which seems to indicate that the soil is not only the best growth medium, but also that given such a rich medium, the soil group roots were much longer in proportion to total body size than the roots of the other growth mediums. The significance of the data is upheld by our ANOVO tests, and this means that our hypothesis is supported; the plants in the soil grew larger root systems than the other groups, allowing for larger size. The clay and gravel groups had smaller roots, but harger shoot and leaf systems. As the root to shoot ratios show, there is clearly a difference in the resource allocation of Raphanus sativus (Ruan 2019). Errors in this experimental design are the lack of a true “controll” group, which complicated the statistical testing of the hypothesis, and that the watering of the treatment groups may have been inconsistent over the research period. Additionally, the handling of the plants could have been imprecise, as small roots were easily lost in cleaning. Future research can be done in treating groups with different nutrient supplements, or treat the same soil types in conditions such as low light or high salinity.
