Title: The Effects of Precor on the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
The scientific name for tobacco hornworms is the Manduca Sexta; it is an insect of the order Lepidoptera. Under the constant conditions in a lab, it takes the Manduca Sexta to reach an adult moth in 19-23 days. The lifecycle of the tobacco hornworm starts as an egg, five instar larva stages, pupa, and finally an adult moth. The hormone that is focused on in the experiment is Precor, which is an insecticide that’s has the activated Methoprene ingredient, a Juvenile Hormone analog—meaning it mimics the structure of Juvenile Hormone [El-Sheikh, Kamita, and Hammock 2016]. Juvenile Hormone regulates what type of molt will occur throughout development [Nijhout: 1974]. The Precor is expected to make the caterpillars mature at a slower rate which can be looked at by their mass. This is expected because Juvenile Hormone, as mentioned before, is an insect growth regulator, thus inhibits the formation of adult characteristics within the larvae stages and pupal development. The reason why the Manduca Sexta is an ideal subject for this study is due to abundance of them in the population and they have a short life cycle that is significantly different between larvae stages and pupa stages. Our hypothesis is when five drops of Precor is added to each insect’s food source, it is predicted that their average mass will be less than the control group by the end of the two weeks. The reason why this experiment is being conducted is to discover the effects excess amount of Precor will have on the caterpillar; whether is matures quicker or not. The importance of this experiment is due Precor being used an insecticide, the experiment will demonstrate the effects it has on the insects, specifically the caterpillar. This experiment is specifically testing how the caterpillars will mature slower due to the Precor added to their food source.

Materials and Methods:
The first thing that was done in the experiment was to obtain two containers that had four compartments within them isolated the caterpillars, but it kept them together based on them being the control or the treatment group; each of the four compartments contained a singular caterpillar. The compartments were labelled one through four and label on each container and was labelled if the container was the treatment group or the control group. Each compartment had ten grams of food for each caterpillar; the control had five drops of water in their food and the treatment group had five drops of Precor in the food source. Before the caterpillars were placed into their compartments, they were weighed to compare the initial mass to final. The caterpillars were placed randomly in each compartment. The caterpillars were placed in an incubator due to temperature. For two weeks the caterpillars were weighed and recorded, then compared at the end to compare the mean mass of the treatment and control group. Within the two weeks, food was replaced with new food and the compartments were cleaned. The independent variable of our experiment was the amount of Precor added to the food supply and the dependent variable was the average mass of the caterpillar. The control of the experiment was the caterpillars with only water added to their food. The graph that was used to analyze our results was one-tailed T-test, which gave us a p-value. The purpose of this testing is to determine if there was statistical significance or not. All the raw data was put into a bar graph format and error bars were added. 

Results:
Within the two-week period, it is noted that the mean treatment and control group was not statistical substantial (t-stat= 0.983402, df=6, P=0.456997). The general trend at the beginning of the experiment was the average mass of the treatment group being lower than that of the control group. Towards the end of the experiment the average mass of the treatment group increased more quickly, while the control groups’ mass stalled and stop growing all together towards the end (Figure 2). There is an outlier in the control group that would not gain mass and ended up dying. The average mass of the treatment group was 12.18 and the mean of the control groups was 9.11 (Figure 1). 

Discussion:
The experiment hypothesized that when five drops of Precor was added to the food source of the caterpillar, the average mass of the caterpillar will be lower than caterpillars that did not receive Precor. The mean of the treatment group was 12.18 while the mean of the control group was 9.11 (Figure 1). The reason why the mean of the control group was significantly lower than the mean of the treatment group could be due to an outlier we had in the control group. This is shown through the standard deviation of the control group which was at a +/- 6.23 s.d. while the standard deviation for the treatment group was at a +/- 0.40 s.d. which is significantly lower. The outlier did not gain mass and did end up dying. The outlier had a notable injury on the tail of the caterpillar which could be a probable cause of the caterpillar not gaining mass and dying off. It is notable in our experiment that the treatment group started off with a lower mass than the control group but seemed to, at the end of the experiment, catch up to the control group, while it seemed like the control group stopped gaining mass (Figure 2). Therefore, the beginning trend demonstrated in figure 2 followed our null hypothesis being that Precor stunt the growth of the caterpillars compared to the control group. Towards the end, figure 2 supported the rejection of our null hypothesis; figure two shows that the control group weighed less compared to the treatment group. The control group’s mass seems to even off and even drop, but this could be due to the caterpillars in the control group starting to pupate [Kiguchi: 1978]. The next logical step for this study is to repeat the experiment, especially due to the outlier. There is a probability in the study that was conducted, the treatment group got used to the Precor, therefore no longer being affected by the initial dosage [Oliver-Williams: 2018]. Thus, the study to be altered to upping the dosage every 3 days to avoid this situation. If the study was kept at the original format, the hypothesis could change to involve how the caterpillars are affected by the Precor at first, but further into the experiment the caterpillars get immune to it. This study demonstrates how Precor does limit the growth of the caterpillars, even if towards the end it seems like they got bigger than the control group. It seemed as if the control group was pupating due to the glassy physical feature that appeared on their bodies, which was not notable in the treatment group, thus concluding that the treatment group was not maturing as quickly as the control group. In conclusion, our null hypothesis was rejected.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average mass of both treatment and control caterpillars’ groups. How the caterpillars mass averaged out during the two weeks; one group being the treated group with Precor in addition to their food source and the control group getting water into their food source. Four caterpillars are placed in in each group: 4 caterpillars for the treatment group and 4 for the control group. One can tell the error bar was significantly larger in the control group than the treatment group, this is due to an outlier. The outlier was a caterpillar that did not gain mass for the beginning days and ended up dying. Error bars for the four caterpillars in the treatment group was +/- 0.40 s.d. and the error bar for the four caterpillars in the control group was +/- 6.23 s.d.
Figure 2. Average Mass gained throughout the two weeks. The treatment group contained 4 caterpillars and the control group also contained 4 caterpillars that were weighed over a two weeks span. The treatment group had five drops of Precor added to their 10 grams of food. The orange line represents the average mass gained for the treatment group and the blue line represents the average mass gained for the control group. *************************************************************************
