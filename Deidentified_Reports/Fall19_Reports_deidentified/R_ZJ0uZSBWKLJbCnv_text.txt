Title: The Effect of Ecdysone Hormone on the Mass of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones play a vital role in the life of all living organisms. In this experiment, the hormone ecdysone, or 20E, (molting process hormone) demonstrates how too much of one hormone can have detrimental effects to a species. Excess 20E cause developmental delays and death in Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis is “The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight.” We tested this with two groups (1 control and 1 group treated with 20E hormone). We placed both groups in plastic containers and gave them food. The 20E treated group was given 5 drops of the hormone in their food. For two weeks, every day, we weighed the caterpillars and recorded our results.

We found that the caterpillars given 20E hormone, had decreased in size and died after 14 days. With this, we were able to support our hypothesis. The average mass for our control group was 2.31 g and for our treatment group, 0.089 g. Our P-value= 0.000629, which supports our hypothesis. These results are significant because they reveal the effect of ecdysone on the molting process of Manduca sexta. It increases our knowledge and understanding of not only the hormones involved in molting, but how consuming too much of one hormone can disrupt development of that hormone in the body.



Introduction:
Background: Hormones are produced by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream and affect the activity of another part of the body [Morely: 2019].  Hormones control the organs and they affect growth, reproduction, energy, development, and many other factors of the body. Certain types of hormones influence certain organs and tissues [Morely: 2019]. 

In this experiment, we looked at the roles of hormones in Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. Its holometabolous life cycle has 4 stages (egg, larvae, pupa, and adult) [Byron: 2017]. These stages are generated by molting, which is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer and the old layer is shed [Hadley: 2019]. The tobacco hornworm maintains homeostasis by sensory pathways and hormones [Byron: 2017]. It produces the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in the corpus cardiacum and this then triggers the production of the ecdyson [Song: 2017]. The tobacco hornworms use ecdysone (20E), produced in the parathoracic gland and juvenile hormone (JH), produced in the corpus allatum, in the molting process [Ishimoto: 2010]. JH keeps the hornworm looking juvenile. 20E plays an important role in developmental transitions in larva molting. In this experiment, we treated the tobacco hornworms with 20E to stimulate growth, cell reproduction, cell regeneration, and to affect molt timing. The tobacco hornworm was chosen for this experiment because of its short life cycle (39-48 days) and because it is considered a pest when it is in its moth form, so any harm to them during the experiment does not have a major negative impact on the environment [Byron: 2017]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of the 20E hormone (independent variable) on the molting process of the tobacco hornworm. We will use weight (dependent variable) to quantitatively analyze our results. 

Hypothesis: The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight.

Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in weight between the control group and the group treated with 20E.

Materials and Methods:
Two 4- cell containers with lids and punched holes were used. They were labeled the controls and treatment so you could differentiate which caterpillar was which. To prepare the food, 10 grams of food were measured for each caterpillar. For the treatment group, 10 grams of food were mixed with five drops of 20E hormone in a separate bowl with a spoon and repeated for the other three cells. The food was then packed into the corner of each cell tightly so it did not dry out. For the control caterpillars, 10 grams of food were packed tightly to each corner and 5 drops of water were added to each clump of food. Finally, 1 caterpillar was placed in each cell and the containers were placed in the refrigerator. For 14 days, daily, the weight of each caterpillar was weighed and recorded.

Independent Variable: Tobacco hornworms given 20E hormone

Dependent Variable: The mass in grams of the tobacco hornworms

Control Variables: Amount of food given, type of food given, temperature, moisture, amount of drops of hormones/ water.

Statistical Tests: The unpaired two-sample T-test was used in order to test the hypothesis and to see if there is a significant difference between the group with 20E and the control group. 

Results:
Qualitative Results: Initially, all of the hornworms were bright green in color and relatively moist. For about the first week, all the control worms stayed pretty moist as they increased in size. However, the second week, they became more dry. Their color was bright green throughout the 14 days. By the end of the 14 days, signs of molting were seen in the hornworms. For the 20E treated hornworms, they clearly developed much slower. By the third day, they were evidently smaller and were moving much slower. As the days progressed, the treatment hormones became darker in color and appeared to be dried and shriveled up. By day 11 they were all dead. The difference in size, moisture, and color can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2.

Statistical Test Results: The mean for the control group was 2.3 g and the standard deviation was 2.03 g. The mean for the treatment group was 0.09 g and the standard deviation was 0.03 g. The average masses during the 14 days are represented in Table 1 and graphed in Figure 3. Using the T-Test, it was found that the t-stat= 0.0006, df=6, P-value= 0.000629. This is visually demonstrated in Figure 4.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, “The tobacco hornworms treated with the 20E hormone will have decreased weight” is supported and our null hypothesis, “There will be no difference in weight between the control group and the group treated with 20E” is rejected. We can conclude this from our results in the t-test. Our P-value was 0.000629, which is less than P= 0.05, showing there was a statistical difference between our control group and our treatment group. 

Biologically our results are supported for multiple reasons. In the introduction, it is explained that the corpus cardiacum produces PTTH in a consistent release. Insects, like the tobacco hornworm have a “biological clock” in their brain that triggers the 20E hormone to be produced from this consistent release of PTTH.  [Song: 2017]. It is possible that when the tobacco hornworms were consuming the 20E hormone orally in their food, it caused a decrease in the production of 20E in the body. We can use research of other hormones as support. According to an endocrinologist, Dr. Ghandi Saadeh, MD, “Use of anabolic steroids for bodybuilding will cause the testes to shut down their testosterone production” [Vann: 2015]. Testosterone is the best known hormone to be affected when one consumes too much testosterone through steroids, but it is very likely other hormones in the body, like 20E act similarly.  

Another biological explanation is that because the 20E hormone levels were always so high, the juvenile hormone levels were never able to develop to a high enough level that the hornworms could grow and develop to an adequate size, in their juvenile stages, before molting. Therefore, the 20E hormone became lethal for the insects. The role of all three hormones (PTTH, 20E, and JH) was disrupted by the excess 20E and therefore, caused a decrease in weight and development of the tobacco hornworm.

Our results are supported by previously published studies. In 1980, biologists Louis Safranek and Carroll M. Williams studied the prothoracic hormone in Manduca sexta. They concluded that the species has four major development transitions before adulthood (larval molt to fifth instar, feeding after fifth instar, larval-pupal molt, and pupal-adult molt). They found that the beginning of each molt had a rise in ecdysone production [Safranek: 1980]. However, Safranek and Williams then injected ecdysone and implanted active prothoracic glands and found that this can hinder development [Safranek: 1980]. Therefore, they concluded that each of the four developmental stages is dependent on adequate ecdysone levels for transformation [Safranek: 1980]. Biologists HF Nijhout, G Davidowitz, and DA Roff performed a study where they analyzed the effect of the timing of ecdysone on body size. They found that timing plays a major role in the metamorphosis of Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 2006]. They concluded that it is a “pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life that causes the larvae to stop feeding and growing and initiate metamorphosis” [Nijhout: 2006]. This supports our experiment because our insects were never able to receive this “pulse” because they had constant ecdysone they were consuming.

There are several potential sources of error that could have affected the results of our experiment. When transferring the tobacco hornworms from the container to the scale, they often had food or manure attached to them, causing a potential increase in mass. This tended to be more common in the control group because they were more developed in size and had limbs that could hold onto the food or manure better. Another potential source of error could be that we did not weigh the insects at the same time of day every day. This could cause a slight variance in the data and could also affect our results of when the treatment caterpillars actually died. 

Our results are heavily supported by previous studies, but for this data to be thoroughly supported, the experiment should be done again with more tobacco hornworms and with groups receiving different amounts of 20E. One group should have the hormone completely blocked and the other groups should vary on the amount of 20E they receive. This would show us how much of the hormone is detrimental to the insect and what happens if they have none. To do this I would test 4 different groups (control group, group with ecdysone blocked, group with the amount of ecdysone we tested in the experiment, and a group with slightly less ecdysone). I would also use 8 caterpillars for each group in order to have stronger data.

In conclusion, hormones in any species play a major role in the development and function of the species. In this experiment, we focused on insects and the effects hormones, specifically ecdysone, have on the molting process. Our results can be broadened to other hormones in the body and provide insight into the function of these hormones. Hormones consumed in excess can have detrimental effects and our study supports this. Further research and experiment variations is always necessary, but with our data and the researched data, common trends will most likely be found in new research.
