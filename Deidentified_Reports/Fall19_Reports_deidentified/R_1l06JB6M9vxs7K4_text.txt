Title: Decreasing the roots:shoots of Fagopyrum esculentum by providing a nitrogen solution in the soil

Abstract:
The manipulation of the amount of nitrogen present in the soil of growing Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly known as Buckwheat, was used in order to see the impact of altering the environment on the roots:shoots of both weight and length. We predicted that an increase of available nitrogen in the soil would decrease the roots:shoots. This relationship is important to understand phenotypic plasticity and to recognize the importance of the availability of resources on growth allocation in plants. Two groups of three pots with twelve buckwheat seeds each were grown in the same environment except one group received 32% nitrogen solution to their daily water supply. After two weeks, the results indicated that the experimental group with the added nitrogen in their soil had a decreased length and weight roots:shoots compared to the control group. This implies growth was allocated to the stem and leaves due to the availability of nitrogen in the soil, reducing the need to grow longer roots. A two sample one tailed t test was conducted and confirmed the statistical significance and established a relationship between nitrogen present and the roots:shoots in our experiment. The results supported our original hypothesis.


Introduction:
Plants adapt different patterns in order to successfully grow and reproduce in a specific environment. Phenotypic plasticity can be defined as differences in physical appearance or behavior of an individual due to factors of the environment. Both just slight adjustments to biotic and abiotic factors impact plant growth. Solar energy and carbon dioxide and elements in the soil are allocated for storage and for growth of new and existing parts of the plant. Nitrogen is a vital nutrient for plants because it is a component of chlorophyll and is critical for growth of different structures. In many environments nitrogen is limited so plants form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen producing bacteria which is then allocated among the roots and shoots in order to obtain the crucial nutrient [Carolina Fertilizer Foundation: 2009]. In most cases, nitrogen is absorbed by the plant’s roots and distributed. Roots primarily absorb underground nutrients and maintain the placement of the entire plant. The leaves are the location of photosynthesis and stems support the structure. The roots:shoots (leaves and stem) provides information about how the plant adapts to its specific environment to effectively compete and obtain available resources. Biologists pay attention to this relationship to better under the health of their plant and to understand if there is a lack of above or underground resources. A study revealed that nitrogen has a significant impact on the roots:shoots in that increased nitrogen nutrition decreased the ratio but there is an optimal amount of nitrogen. The ratio was decreased because more energy was allocated to the growth of the shoots with an easier access to nitrogen. However, there is an optimal amount since the plant requires a certain quantity of absorbed nitrogen and will not absorb excess nutrients. The roots:shoots began to increase when there was too much nitrogen in the soil in order to start allocating growth to the roots again with the abundance of nitrogen. [Shangguan: 2004]. Fagopyrum esculentum, more commonly referred to as Buckwheat, was used in our experiment to understand the relationship between the roots:shoots and the amount of nitrogen present in the soil. This species is native to Asia and has been an important crop as it has nutritional values. We hypothesized that Buckwheat plants consuming extra nitrogen will have a lower roots:shoots because growth would be allocated to leaves and stems. We predicted this because the plentiful underground nutrients, the nitrogen, can be readily absorbed by the roots. Less growth is needed to occur in nutrient dense soil because there is less need to increase surface area for absorption of roots because there is decreased competition for nitrogen when there is more.


Materials and Methods:
The independent variable in our experiment was the presence of added nitrogen and the dependent variable was the roots:shoots. In order to understand the relationship of our variables, first the control and experimental groups were set up. We used three pots with twelve Buckwheat seeds each in both groups. The groups were placed in identical conditions and received almost identical treatments. Both plants were placed the same quantity and type of soil and put next to each other in the greenhouse. The seeds grew in uniform amounts of light, humidity, and temperature. Both groups were given 200 mL of a hydrating substance every day for two weeks. The control group received 200 mL of water daily. The experimental group was given 100 mL of 32% nitrogen solution mixed with 100 mL of water daily (200 mL of 16% nitrogen solution). At the end of the two-week period, we recorded the root length, root weight, shoot weight, and shoot length for six plants in each group (2 plants picked randomly from each pot). We used scissors to separate the roots and shoots and used a scale and ruler to collect data. We then calculated the roots:shoots of both weight and length to compare the ratios of the control and experimental group. The means and standard deviations of each ratio were also recorded and a two sample one tailed t test was conducted to understand the relationship between the two variables.


Results:
The results of the experiment reveal that the roots:shoots consistently decreased when nitrogen was added to the daily supply of water of Buckwheat plants. Mathematically, this indicates that the length and weight of the shoots was growing more than the roots throughout the duration of the experiment. The mean ratio of the weight of roots to shoots of the control group was 0.56 and the mean average of the ratio of the weight of the roots to shoots of the experimental group was 0.28 (Figure 1). The same trend was revealed in the comparison of the length ratios. The mean length root:shoot of the control group was 1.21 and the experimental was 0.54 (Figure 1). Finally, the two sample one-tailed (non paired) t test revealed the p value for the weight ratios to be .007 and 4.5 x 10-6 for the length, demonstrating statistical significance for both values and establishing a relationship between the presence of added nitrogen and the roots:shoots. The t-test for the weight ratio revealed a t-stat of 2.9 and degree of freedom of 10. Lastly, the t -test length ratio had a t-stat of 8.2 and degree of freedom of 10.


Discussion:
The results of our experiment support our original hypothesis. Before conducting our procedure, we predicted that providing an experimental group with a nitrogen solution would decrease the roots:shoots of Buckwheat plants. Analyzing both the weight roots:shoots and the length roots:shoots reveals that adding nitrogen decreases the value of the ratio. This indicates that growth was allocated to the leaves and stems above ground rather than the roots underground. Other studies have found similar results that parallel ours. In a study conducted on many different types of crops, for example maize, wheat, barley, and potato, it was found that low levels of nitrogen led to an increased root:shoot because the plant increased the content of the root system when nitrogen levels were low [Engels: 1995]. This study supports our findings because it helps to explain why growth would be allocated to the roots or shoots depending on the availability of nitrogen, a vital resource: Growth occurs less to the part of the plant that can easily obtain resources. In our experiment, with extra nitrogen, the weight and length of the shoots increased more in order for the plant to obtain more solar energy and other atmospheric elements while nitrogen was plentiful. There was less of a need to compete for the underground resource, nitrogen, because the abundance reduced competition so the roots did not need to grow as much. Further, Engels’ study demonstrates how growth was allocated to the roots when nitrogen was depleted in order to increase surface area to maximize absorption efficiently and compete among other plants. These findings are extremely important for many reasons. Understanding phenotypic plasticity of plants can help determine the health of the plant and about the environment around them because plants will allocate available resources best suited to compete with other living organisms around them depending on the specific condition of biotic and abiotic factors they experience. Farmers or biologists, for example, can manipulate the environment to promote growth of the desired part of the plant and best maximize the health of the crop they are growing. Another study to compliment this one is to do a similar experiment with controlling amounts of other resources, particularly with atmospheric elements to see if the roots:shoots would increase or decrease if sunlight, for example, is limited.
