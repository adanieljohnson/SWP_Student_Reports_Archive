Title: Agonistic Behavior of Betta splendens in Response to Shapes

Abstract:
This experiment examined the aggressive behaviors in Betta splendens to various ‘fish-like’ shapes. Agonistic behaviors were quantified by calculating the frequency of the total aggressive behavior displayed in each experimental trial. Based on results, the betta male used for this experiment displayed aggressive behaviors towards all three shapes—results were statistically insignificant. Further experimentation would prolong the study to determine at which point would a betta become habituated to aggressive displays of behavior.

Introduction:
Animal behavior has been studied by ethologist for many years to determine patterns of behavior in response to stimulus and conditions the same species respond to light, others respond to color or shape. Particularly, aggressive behavioral responses have been studied in Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish or bettas. Bettas are known as ‘fighting fish’ because in the presence of other members of its species, male bettas exert agonistic behaviors—vibrant blue and res scale colors, tail flashing, pelvic fin flickering, display of the red mane—among various other behavioral responses. However, display of the red mane is the most aggressive behavior that betta males exhibit. 
	In the presence of females, male bettas typically do not display as many agonistic behaviors, but this is not relative to all male betta behavior [Dzieweczynski:2005]. In this experiment, one male betta fish was introduced to a variety of shapes to determine is agonistic behavior and habituation to various fish-like shapes. An experiment conducted on aggressive behaviors of bettas suggests that bettas tend to attack aggressive opponents more than nonaggressive ones [Cain:2005]. Based on this assumption, we hypothesize that the betta male will habituate the least to the realistic cut-out off a male betta fish with a red mane. 


Materials and Methods:
Before beginning the experiment, three fish-like shapes were created: a blue cut out with a red semi-circle underneath the front (representing a betta fish with a red mane), an identical blue cut-out without the red semi-circle (representing a betta fish without a red mane), a relative fish shape with a red semi-circle (representing a fish with a red mane). Each cut out accounted for aggressive vs. nonaggressive behavioral reactions. 
One male betta fish was placed in a glass fish tank and was allotted 5 minutes to adjust to the new environment before experimentation. Individually, each shape was placed near the glass of the fish tank. Three trials were conducted to determine the frequency, in seconds, of agonistic behavior the betta male displayed to each shape within a 5-minute experimental period. The betta male was given 5 minutes to rest between each trial. The frequency of agonistic behavior was analyzed using a one-tailed t-test to determine the statistical significance between the realistic betta shape displaying a red mane versus the fish shape displaying the red mane and the realistic betta shape displaying a red mane versus the realistic betta shape without a red mane. 



Results:
The frequency of agonistic behavior in the male betta towards the realistic betta shape with a red mane (M=286.67, SD=15.4) compared to the frequency of agonistic behavior towards the realistic fish shape (M=287.67, SD=11.2) did not demonstrate significant effects on the behavior of the male betta, t=0.09, p=0.47. Likewise, the frequency of the agonistic behavior in the male betta towards the realistic betta shape with a red mane compared to the frequency of the realistic betta without the red mane (M=289.33, SD=2.5) showed no significant influence on the agonistic behavior of the betta male, t=-0.3, p=0.39)

Discussion:
Results from this experiment did not support our hypothesis that the betta male would habituate the least to the realistic betta male shape with a red mane. As shown in Figure 1 the average frequency of agonistic behavior did was within the range of ~286 seconds to ~289 seconds for all three experimental shapes. Additionally, it was determined from the two one-tailed t-tests that none of the shapes have a significant influence on the frequency of aggressive behavior displayed in the betta male used for this experiment. The betta male actively displayed highly agonistic behavior (red mane, tail slapping, and attempting to bite the shapes) throughout the majority of each 5-minute experimental period. 
Considering that the betta male did not display any more aggression to the realistic betta fish cut out with a red mane than it he did to the realistic betta without a red mane leads to three possible interpretations of the quantitative and qualitative results. There is a possibility that the betta male used for this experiment was innately more aggressive than the average betta male. Dominant males are typically those that attack an image of a live (betta male) and displaying intraspecific agonistic behaviors more intensely prior to combat [Bronstein: 1985].  
Generally, experiments that involve determining the habituation of a species range from a few weeks to months. The duration of an experiment conducted to determine the habituation of betta fish to the reflection was 5 months. It was concluded that bettas showed a decrease in aggressive behaviors over the course of the 5 months but there was never an extinction of the behavioral stimuli (the reflection) [Clayton:1968]. Furthermore, in the experiment conducted by Cain, it was determined that found that when physical space is limited, bettas will display more aggressive behaviors [2005]. Further experimentation would increase the test subject of betta males, lengthen the duration of the experimental period if time permits and test the shapes at various distances from the glass or within the tank.

Figure 1: The frequency of agonistic behavior in the betta male during a 5 minutes interval. Three shapes were presented to the male betta: a realistic betta shape with a red mane (blue bar), realistic fish shape with red mane (orange bar), and a realistic betta without a red mane (grey bar). With each additional trial, the frequency of agonistic behavior slightly increased. Three trials were conducted for each shape. *************************************************************************
