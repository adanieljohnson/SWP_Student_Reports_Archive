Title: The Effect of Low and High Temperatures on the Rate of Photosynthesis for Spinacia Oleracea 

Abstract:
Over the course of this experiment, the central idea was based on observing observe whether the rate of photosynthesis will change based on the temperature change occurring. The main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that if we were to increase the temperature from room to a higher temperature, then the photosynthetic activity of the Spinach leaves would decrease. During the method, there were three samples observed, one sample with no chloroplast at 25C, one sample with chloroplast at 25C, and one sample with chloroplast at 45C. There was also a sampled blank at 25C. Each sample was read. Over the course of 10-minute interval to measure the percent change in absorbance 600 nm for photosynthetic activity. We used a spectrophotometer instrument to read the absorbances by transferring the samples from the test tube to cuvette and reading them. After calculating the p_value using a 1-tailed paired t_test Based on the observed results, our calculate data was statistically insignificent, so we rejected our alternative hypothesis.

Introduction:
The main purpose of this experiment is to observe whether the rate of photosynthesis will change based on the temperature change occurring. Initially, Photosynthesis is a known chemical reaction for plants in which uses light for the synthesis of energy and nutrition for plant life. Within Photosynthesis, the absorption of light is a main component through the pigmentation of the thylakoids in the chloroplast, as well as the main activity in photosystems II, where energy is both absorbed, as well used to assemble lost electrons for the photosystem activity. In this experiment, DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) will be used as a way of measuring photosystem II activity, which can indicate the overall rate of photosynthetic activity. When using a spectrophotometer, the utilizing of DCIP is evident as it reveals the pigmentations absorbing light as DCIP goes from blue (original color) to colorless over time. Photosynthesis has multiple factors that can either slow the rate of the reaction or increase it. Scientifically, Temperature in relation to photosynthesis is known to be a limiting factor it can impact the photosynthetic activity if increased or decreased majorly. In terms of the correlation between Hill reaction (DCIP) and temperature showed to have an inactivation effect when temperatures were high [WG: 1976].  Within Spinacia Oleracea, which is the scientific name for Spinach leaves, are known to be able to photosynthesize at maximum temperatures of 25-30C, although in a recent study, “temperature acclimation” adaptation to new temperatures for photosynthetic activity or allowing the “optimum” temperature to adjust to new temperature changes with experimented Spinach leaves.[Yamori:2005] Although the study did mention to have little change, the overall optimum energy did adjust to new temperature levels, which is evident overtime in photosynthetic activity. The main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that if we were to increase the temperature from room to a higher temperature, then the photosynthetic activity of the Spinach leaves would decrease.  


Materials and Method:
Initially, we began by preparing a spinach like paste for the first exercise by in order to separate the chloroplast from spinach leaves. To simplify the process, we began cooling the mortar and pestle in an ice bath, while picking out the spinach leaves and removing the large central vein. After adding the 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer to the spinach leaves and grinding the leaves to a paste, we grinded the slurry and then added additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer until the spinach slurry was filtered for any remaining larger pieces using a cheese cloth. In order to conserve time and material, we began enriching our chloroplast by transferring the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4C. We did not use microtubes to conserve material and time. We then poured the supernatant out of tube marked “A” into a second tube marked “B,” which is then centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4C. After the 10 minutes, we began the measuring of photosystem activity II under our conditions of temperature. We categorized 1 blank test tube under controll conditions at room temperature of 25C, as well as 3 test tubes with no chloroplast at 25C, 3 test tubes with chloroplast at 25C, and 3 test tubes with chloroplast at 45C. after test tubes were distinguished, we added 100 μl to the blank tube, as well as test tube #5-10. We then added distilled water, 130 mM DCIP, and reaction buffer to according to the volume required for each test tube. The blank test tube only had added stilled water, chloroplast, and reaction buffer. After everything was added accordingly, we assembled the blank test tube in a cuvette for the spectrophotometer to zero out the spectroscopy for the readings of the other test tubes. After the absorbance was set to 600 nm, we transferred each test tube into a cuvette to begin measurement. we began measuring the test tubes for their absorbances at zero, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes under their temperature conditions. For the room temperature samples, the placed the test tubes in a test tube handle. As for the 45C higher temperature, we placed the test tubes in an incubator with a light bulb shining on both the room temperature and high temperature for light source. Once the results were observed, we used a 1 tailed paired t_test, and calculated results.

Results:
Based on the results calculated and graphed, the calculated peaks for both the controll and treatment group frogs was not statistically significent (t-value= 2.24, d.f.= 2, P-value= 0.154. The results were based off of the three samples for no chloroplast at 25C, Chloroplast at 25C, and Chloroplast at 45C. The observed peaks for the initial absorbance at 600 nm was the highest for the controll group (No chloroplast at 25C) which was 0.415 nm.  As for observed peaks for the final absorbance at 600 nm, the highest observed peak was also the controll group (No chloroplast at 25C) which was 0.414 nm which was greater than both the samples with chloroplast at 25C and 45C. 

Discussion:
Referring back to the results, the statistical paired t_test calculated a final value that was not statistically significent, so we reject our alternative hypothesis which is main hypothesis for this experiment conveys that if we were to increase the temperature from room to a higher temperature, then the photosynthetic activity of the Spinach leaves would decrease. Based on the calculated values, and graph, our observed data correlates well with our interpretation of our results. As previously stated in the introduction, higher temperatures should have a negative impact on photosynthetic activity of plants, which specifically was Spinach leaves in this experiment. Although in the first 10 minutes, as well as 20 minutes, there had been negative values for the absorbance reading at 600nm for the sample of chloroplast at 45C, at 30 minutes, there was an increase in the absorbance reading (as shown in figure 1).  There was a similar trend for the sample with chloroplast at 25C, where the absorbance decreased, then increased. The rates of photosystems II mediated electron transport decreased as the temperature was increased from 25 to 45C Figure 1. Almost total loss of PS 2 activity was observed at 45C,  yet increases at 30 minutes as states previously.  As for the controll sample at 25C with no chloroplast, since there was no chloroplast, the DCIP did not reduced to DCPIP, thus showing the decline in figure 1. Although our hypothesis was not supported, the correlation behind the effects that temperature has on photosynthetic activity vary immensely, from the conditions of time that were given in the experiment, to the experimental error, as well as previously mentioned temperature acclimation and the effects that temperature has on photosystems II. In a recent study, a 48-hour experiment was tested for the “Role of Temperature stress on Chloroplast Biogenesis.” When the plants were placed in higher temperatures, inactivation and separation from light-harvesting complex occurred “damaging the photosynthetic activity.” [Dutta:2009]. In future studies, we should consider the limitations. Temperature could have on specific components of the experiment, including the DCIP and its function, as well as the chloroplast, rather the broad idea that photosynthesis will be impacted. As for the little difference in comparing the sample for 25C with chloroplast to 45C with chloroplast, the samples could have been at similar temperatures when being read in the spectrophotometer due to lack of efficiency with time, as well as motion movement, when walking with the incubated cuvettes to the spectrophotometer, which can allow them to cool or reset. Overall, the experiment was conducted revealing the Effect of Low and High Temperatures on the Rate of Photosynthesis for Spinacia Oleracea.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This line graph represents the percent change in absorbance over the course of 30 minutes for Spinach leaves under High and Low Temperature conditions at both 25C and 45C. The average was measured for absorbance percent change under 600 nm. The peaks at no chloroplast represents a positive change at the initial start but begins to decline at 20-minute percent change. Both trends for the sample peaks for Chloroplast under both temperature conditions of 25C and 45C represent little change in comparison with one another peaks overtime for absorbance percent change. *************************************************************************
