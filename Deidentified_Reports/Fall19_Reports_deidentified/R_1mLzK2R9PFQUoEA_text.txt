Title: The effect of Juvenile Hormone (IG Regulator) on the weight of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
NA

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect from the family Solanaceae. This insect was chosen because it is cheap, not dangerous, and the results are easy to observe. There are three main hormones in this hornworm that aid in its the molting and development. These three hormones are Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. Prothoracicotropic Hormone is produced by the corpus cardiacum and regulates the release of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development. Lastly, Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt during development and is produced by the corpus allata. In a typical hornworm, Juvenile Hormone would decrease at the end of the 4th larva stage and drop more during the 5th larva stage. Then, it will increase until the Pupil Eclosion, the stage right before adult development, and after the Pupil Eclosion it then decreases back down to a consistent level [Johnson: 2019]. After molting this insect changes into an adult moth. The amount of Juvenile Hormone matters because it will affect the hornworms development and will give us an understanding of the endocrine system in hornworms. So, the hypothesis for this study was that if the tobacco hornworms are given eight drops of additional Juvenile Hormone (IG Regulator) then they will weigh less than the controll group.


Materials and Method:
A container of four compartments was labeled one through four and another container with four compartments was labeled five through eight. The controll group was in compartments one through four and the experimental group was in compartments five through eight. Ten grams of food were measured, and eight drops of IG Regulator were added to the food. The controll group was created in the same way, but eight drops of water were added to the food instead of IG Regulator. So, in all eight compartments, there was food with either eight drops of water or Juvenile Hormone (IG Regulator). Also, there was one caterpillar in each compartment so, a total of eight caterpillars were tested. Then, every day the caterpillars were observed and weighed to document the changes that had occurred. After, a T-test was used to test the statistical significance of the weight differences between the groups. Lastly, these caterpillars were placed in the freezer to die and then disposed of.  

Results:
In this experiment, there were some general trends that arose while observing the caterpillars. One general trend was that the weight of the experimental group was higher than the weight of the controll group. As shown in Figure 1, around day twelve the line for the experimental group rose significently higher than the line for the controll group. However, after observing this trend and doing a T-test, it was shown to not be statistically significent. Another trend observed was the difference in color between the controll group and the experimental group. As shown in Figure 2, the controll group has a darker skin and more profound stripes. On the other hand, the controll group consisted of a whiter skin and less profound stripes. 



Discussion:
In this experiment, we tested whether Juvenile Hormone (IG Regulator) influenced the weight of the Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis for this study was that if the tobacco hornworms are given eight drops of additional Juvenile Hormone (IG Regulator) then they will weigh less than the controll group. We tested our statistical significance through a One-Tailed T-test and our p_value was not statistically significent (p= 0.39). This could be due to the hormone not influencing weight or due to causes of error. However, the hormone not influencing weight may not be a valid reason because Figure 1 shows that the hormone aided the caterpillars to gain weight. Through this figure we concluded that the experimental group ended up weighing more than the controll group, which did not support our hypothesis. A different study tested the controll of body size in the Manduca sexta and concluded that “body size is fully determined by three fundamental parameters: the growth rate, the critical weight, and the interval between the critical rate and the secretion of ecdysone” [Nijhout: 2006] meaning that all three of these could have been altered when excess juvenile hormone was factored into the equation. This article also pointed out that ecdysone causes the larva to stop feeding and later grow which initiates metamorphosis [Nijhout: 2006]. So, when we gave the experimental group excess amounts of juvenile hormone this could have affected their ecdysone levels, making them larger and heavier. But there could also be causes of error. Some causes of error include not being exact in the amount of food given each day, not zeroing out the scale before weighing each caterpillar, or even not closing the clear sliding door while weighing the caterpillars. Future research could address these causes of error to make the experiment statistically significent. Another eye-opening detail learned in this study was the difference in color between the experimental group and the controll group as shown in Figure 2. Throughout the experiment, the experimental group was always lighter with whiter skin and less defined stripes, while the experimental group stayed its darker blue color with defined stripes. This color difference could be due to the excess amount of Juvenile hormone that the experimental group received. However, it is hard to tell the cause of this so, future research combined with statistically significent data will result in a successful finding if juvenile hormone influences weight and if it influences the color of the Manduca Sexta.
