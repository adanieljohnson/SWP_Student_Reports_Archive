Title: Resource allocation and growth in common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) in response to nitrogen availability

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether nitrogen concentration in water correlated with resource allocation and growth in the plant common buckwheat (F. esculentum). It was hypothesized that an increased nitrogen concentration in water would cause an increased shoot growth in the plant in relation to its roots.  This was tested by planting buckwheat seeds and providing half the seeds with a nitrogen dilution in water and the other half the seeds with distilled water daily for 14 days.  After growth, the root:shoot ratios (R:S) for both weight and length were calculated for samples in the experimental and control groups.  This resulted in the average R:S ratio being higher in the control group (0.56g) than the experimental group (0.28g) for weight, as well as for length (mm)  with the control value being 1.21mm and the experimental value being 0.54. It was determined that these results were statistically significant via a one-tailed paired t-test, indicating that nitrogen concentration in water indeed increased shoot growth in buckwheat.  With replication of these results and variation of this experiment, this study could serve as a foundation to optimize buckwheat farming and production.  


Introduction:
Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a plant species originating in central and Western China and brought to Europe during the Middle Ages (Alberta Government 2001).  Today, this highly nutritious plant is a dietary staple world-wide (Fang et. al. 2018, 2).  The ability to control the growth patterns of this essential plant could increase production in the farming industry and food levels overall, and this could be made possible with an understanding of resource allocation in this plant.  
	The phenomenon of resource allocation refers to how an organism dedicates more of its energy and resources to one area and less to another.  There are many factors in an ecological community that can affect how a plant allocates its resources.  These factors can be non-living abiotic factors, such as sunlight or gas exposure, or they can be living biotic factors in the form of the other organisms the plant in question interacts with in its community (Johnson, A.D, Mallison S. 2019, 16).  The concept of resource allocation is described further in the paper Manipulating resource allocation in plants by E. Bennett, J. Roberts and C. Wagstaff featured in the Journal of Experimental Botany.  Specifically, in reference to their study of resource allocation in seeds of Arabidopsis plants, they highlight the fact that “The distribution of nutrients and assimilates in different organs and tissues is in a constant state of flux throughout the growth and development of a plant” (Bennett, Roberts, Wagstaff 2012, 1).  That is, as the plant begins to develops, it responds to environmental cues to allocate resources to each organ differently and therefore cause each part of the organism to grow at a different rate, which is a key consideration in this study.  
The abiotic factor of interest for this study is nitrogen (N2).  This gas, often present in the soil due to nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can be “the most limiting nutrient” (Johnson, A.D, Mallison, S, 2019, 18).  Although many plants absorb nitrogen through their roots, different plants tend to vary in how they acquire and allocate nitrogen (18).  For example, “many rapidly growing weeds [such as common buckwheat] favor the strategy of placing more nitrogen in leaves” in order to “increas[e] the photosynthetic ability of the plant and, consequently, the growth rate” (18).  
Considering the phenomenon of resource allocation and the interaction of nitrogen with quickly growing plants such as common buckwheat, the purpose of this experiment is to study the relationship between nitrogen and resource allocation in the common buckwheat plant (Fagopyrum esculentum).  The study Effects of nitrogen fertilizer and planting density on the leaf photosynthetic characteristics, agronomic traits and grain yield in common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum M.) by Fang in others in ScienceDirect determined that “the plant height increased with the increase of nitrogen fertilizer” (Fang et. al 2018, 1).  Based off of these results and the relationship between nitrogen and fast growing plants, it is hypothesized that as the availability of nitrogen increases for the buckwheat plants, more resources will be allocated to their shoots, so they will have larger and heavier shoots in relation to their roots.   


Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, a set concentration of nitrogen infused water was given to a group of growing buckwheat plants, and was controlled against a group of buckwheat plants growing in the same conditions but given only water.  First, 6 pots were planted with 12 plants per pot.  Three pots were placed in the control group while the other 3 plots were placed in the experimental group.  The pots in the control group were each given 200mL of water once daily for two weeks, while pot in the experimental group was given 100mL of a 32% nitrogen solution diluted in another 100mL of water (overall 16% nitrogen solution) daily.  During this time the plants grew in the same location in a greenhouse in which all other environmental factors were controlled.  
	After 14 days, 2 plants were sampled from each pot.  For each plant, the total weight, total length, root weight and length and shoot weight and length were respectively measured in grams (g) using a beam balance, and millimeters (mm) using a given ruler.  When measuring the root and shoot separately the shoot was cut from the root at the same spot on each individual plant.  The collected data was then used to calculate the root: shoot ratio (R:S) for both the root and shoot weight and length separately.  To analyze the data, a one-tailed paired t-test was run in order to obtain a p-value and compare it to the critical value at 10 degrees of freedom.  


Results:
The root to shoot ratio (R:S) was significantly larger for the control groups for both weight and length, shown in Figures I and II.  The average R:S weight ratio for the control and experimental groups respectively was 0.562 g and 0.278 g as seen in Table I.  The standard deviation for these two groups was 0.18 and 0.16 (Table I).  Likewise, the average R:S length ratio for the control and experimental groups respectively was 1.21 mm and 0.545 mm, while the standard deviation for the groups was 0.18 and 0.08 as seen in Table II.  For the one-tailed t-test assuming equal variance, the p-value for the weight ratio difference was 0.0075 and the p-value for the length ratio difference was 0.00000455 as seen in Tables I and II.  These values were both less than the critical value of 1.81 with 1 degree of freedom at an 𝛼 value of 0.05, therefore the R:S ratios were statistically significantly different between the control and experimental groups for both.  


Discussion:
As demonstrated above the R:S ratio was significantly greater in the control group (water supplementation) compared to the experimental group (nitrogen infused water supplementation).  This showed that the both shoot length and weight were larger than the root weight and length in the experimental group as opposed to the control group, which correlated with the hypothesis.  In addition, with p-values sufficiently lower than the critical values for the paired t-tests in both categories, the data was proven to be significant.  Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected and there was a non-random relationship between nitrogen availability and resource allocation in the buckwheat plants; specifically, as the nitrogen level increased the buckwheat plant allocation of growth to the shoot as opposed to the root increased.  Regarding the dietary and industrial use of buckwheat plant in society, the relationship between nitrogen and buckwheat growth could be a useful tool for farming and crop production.  Although this relationship is currently understood with the use of nitrogen fertilizers, further studies could determine whether there is an optimal concentration of nitrogen that maximizes buckwheat shoot growth and hence produces the optimal buckwheat crop.
