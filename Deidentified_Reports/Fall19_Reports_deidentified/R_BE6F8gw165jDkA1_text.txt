Title: Effect of Temperature on Photosystem II Activity in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
 In this experiment, we used a DCIP decolorization assay with chloroplasts derived from spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea, to investigate the effect of temperature on the rate of activity of Photosystem II. Our hypothesis, that as temperature increases, the absorbance values would decrease, indicating increased activity of Photosystem II, was not upheld, because our data was insignificent. However, because there was no statistical difference between the negative controll and room temperature groups, we also concluded that there were very few chloroplasts in our preparation.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy [Johnson: 2019]. This chemical energy stored in the bonds of carbohydrates enables both photosynthetic plants and any other organisms who eat these plants to live; photosynthesis is the first process required for life [Johnson: 2019]. 
Photosystem II, the first major component of the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis, has the enzymatic function of oxidizing water [Zouni: 2001]. As the sun bombards photosystem II with photons, excited electrons from the primary donor P680 are accepted by a plastoquinone [Zouni: 2001]. Photosystem II oxidizes water in order to restore the electrons missing from P680 [Zouni: 2001]. The descent of electrons to their final acceptor, NADPH, powers the creation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, whose membrane potential is harnessed to synthesis the ATP used to manufacture sugars in the Calvin cycle [Johnson: 2019]. All of this is to say that the enzymatic function of Photosystem II is necessary for life on earth. 
	Enzymatic activity increases as temperature increases [Wolfenden: 1999]. Using a DCIP decolorization assay for treatment groups of chloroplasts from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) leaves at 20 degrees Celsius, 23 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius, the effect of temperature on Photosystem II’s rate of activity may be measured. As Photosystem II oxidizes water, blue DCIP is reduced to colorless DCIPH2 [Johnson: 2019]; at zero, ten, twenty and thirty minutes a spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of DCIP still in solution with the chloroplasts, indicating the rate of oxidation. We hypothesized that as temperature increases, then the rate of decolorization would also increase, indicating increased photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Method:
	We obtained chloroplasts by grinding with mortar and pestle de-veined spinach leaves with 400 mM sucrose in pH 8 buffer. We strained then centrifuged this paste for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius at 12000 rpm. After pouring off the supernatant, we resuspended the pellets, creating our chloroplast suspension. We used 100 microliters of this suspension, as well as 200 Ml of 130 mM DCIP  in three groups of three replicates for our DCIP decolorization assay. We placed the three groups under grow lamps, incubated at 20 degrees Celsius, 23 degrees Celsius and 45 degrees Celsius, and measured the absorbance every ten minutes for thirty minutes. We used a two sample, one tailed t test to compare the percent change of absorbance after thirty minutes. 

Results:
For the 45o C group, absorbance values increased after ten minutes, then decreased to thirty minutes. For both the 20 and 23o C groups, absorbance values decreased after ten minutes, then increased until thirty minutes. The absorbance values of the negative controll also decreased over the 30 minutes. In all groups there was a net decrease in absorbance values. The 20o C group demonstrated the largest percent change of any group over any time interval; it also had the largest standard deviation. All groups demonstrated a percent change close to zero after thirty minutes, although the 45o group and the negative controll group were closer to zero after twenty minutes. 

Discussion:
	There was not a statistical difference in the percent change of absorbance between the 23o C group and the 20o C group (t_stat = 0.77, d.f. = 4, P value = 0.24), between the 23o C group and the 45o C group (t_stat =1.14, d.f. = 4, P value = 0.15), or between the 23o C group and the negative controll group (t_stat = 1.12, d.f. = 4, P value = 0.19). Therefore, temperature has no discernable effect on photosynthetic activity. However, because there was no statistical difference between the percent change of absorbance between the 23o C group and the negative controll group, the chloroplasts did not convert any DCIP to DCIPH2 even under normal conditions. The results from our lab the previous week, as well as the lab manual, indicate that there should have been a significent difference between the percent change of absorbance between the 23o C group and the negative controll group; the chloroplasts ought to have reduced some of the DCIP [Johnson: 2019]. The concentration of chloroplasts in the solution was so low that very little DCIP was reduced, so few that any change in absorbance could have happened by chance. Other scholarship has demonstrated that plants have an optimal temperature range for photosynthesis [Hikosaka: 2006]. This range is not genetically predetermined, but rather a result of growth temperature [Hikosaka: 2006]. Because our results disagree with other scholarship, our standard deviations are quite enormous, as seen in Figure 1, and our controll group at room temperature did not demonstrate a statistically significent difference in percent change of absorbance from our negative controll, we can conclude that the chloroplasts were in such a low concentration that they reduced an imperceptible amount of DCIP, or none at all. This experiment ought to be repeated, however, the supernatant from the centrifugation ought to be spun in the centrifuge again, and the resulting pellet ought to be used as the source of chloroplasts. We also ought to repeat this experiment, because information about if and how plants, especially crop plants, respond to different temperatures could be used to stay one step ahead of our planet’s increasingly unpredictable temperature patterns.
