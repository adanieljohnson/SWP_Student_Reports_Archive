Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
Abstract

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, develops from a larva into an adult moth through a series of hormone secretions throughout the insect’s adolescence [Cymborowski: 1980]. The life cycle of the tobacco hornworm includes five instar larva stages [Cymborowski: 1980]. Three main hormones govern the stages of the Manduca sexta life cycle: prothoracic hormone (PTTH), ecdysone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) [Bollenbacher: 1980]. PTTH regulates the release of ecdysone; ecdysone regulates the timing of molting; and juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt that occurs, usually preventing metamorphosis in order to maintain a juvenile structure [Cymborowski: 1980]. Both JH and 20E work together in specific concentration ratios throughout the life cycle in order to regulate the stages of Manduca sexta development [Bollenbacher: 1980].
The following experiment was inspired by the question: how does juvenile hormone impact the growth in mass of Manduca sexta? Because JH’s main role is to maintain youth, the null hypothesis posits that if Manduca sexta are treated with JH, then their growth in mass will be less than Manduca sexta that aren’t treated with JH [Cymborowski: 1980]. The alternative hypothesis states that if Manduca sexta are treated with JH, then they will demonstrate the same growth patterns in mass as Manduca sexta that aren’t treated with JH.

Materials and Methods:
Manduca sexta that were still in their larval instar stages were acquired and kept in an incubator prior to the experimental set-up. Two four-cell containers were obtained, with two holes punctured with a puncture tool into each of the cell’s walls in order to ensure airflow throughout the containers. The containers’ lids remained unpunctured. One container’s lid was labeled “JH Group”, while the second container’s lid was labeled “Control Group”. Each container’s cells were numbered one through four in order to keep track of which hornworm was which when collecting data.
A square container was placed on a scale, the scale was zeroed, and 40 grams of food kept at room temperature were measured out, then stirred. For the Control Group container, 10 grams of food was measured and placed into one of the container’s cells, repeated until each cell had 10 grams of food. Next, using a transfer pipet, three to ten drops of di water were placed on the food to prevent it from drying out. The same weighing process was followed for the JH Group, with 40 grams of food kept at room temperature measured out into a square container, then stirred. 10 grams of food were measured for each other container’s cells. Using a new transfer pipet, five drops of JH were placed on the 10-gram portions of food, then stirred into the food. For both groups, the food was maintained in one clump per cell in order to prevent drying. 
Eight Manduca sexta were weighed before being placed one by one into their own individual cells. Their weights and appearances were recorded in a data table under “Day 0”, then recorded every day (Days 1-14) in a data table for two weeks. Throughout the experiment, both containers were placed in an incubator. Dried-out food was replaced with another 10 gram portion as needed, prepared in the same aforementioned manner for the Control Group and JH Group. Once all data was collected, a two-paired t-test was conducted to compare the growth of the JH and Control Groups and to determine if the difference in growth rates was statistically significant.

Results:
Though compiled data shows slight differences in growth rates of Manduca sexta treated with JH versus the control group, statistical analysis of this experiment’s data indicates no significant difference between these groups’ growth rates. Consistent throughout both groups, hornworms treated with JH and hornworms in the control group showed a consistent and steady increase in weight over the course of the experiment (Figure 1). When comparing the average difference in growth between Days 0 and 15 in both the Control and JH Groups, the data shows a slight difference in growth rate, with hornworms in the JH Group having a larger difference in average weight from the start of the experiment to the end than hornworms in the Control Group, as depicted in Figure 2. The Control Group shows an average difference in weight of 12.22 grams from Day 0 to Day 15, while the JH Group shows an average difference in weight of 13.06 grams within the same time frame (Figure 2 and Table 1). 
Similarly, qualitative observations showed a visual difference between hornworms treated with JH and hornworms in the Control Group. Manduca sexta in the Control Group demonstrated white and black stripe-like markings on their green exteriors (Figure 3), whereas Manduca sexta in the JH Group demonstrated light white markings and lacked black markings entirely (Figure 4). Manduca sexta in the Control Group also demonstrated a darker green than the hornworms in the JH Group, shown through a comparison of Figures 3 and 4, despite similar growth rates in both groups.
The difference in growth between the JH Group and Control Group contradicts the null hypothesis of this experiment, which states that the JH Group would grow slower than the Control Group. This growth difference is proven inconsequential, however, through paired t-test statistical testing (13.06 g vs. 12.22 g, P=0.5461), depicted in Table 1 along with the average growth rates of each group. Based on the experiment’s numerical data alone as shown in Table 1, there is no significant difference between the growth in mass of Manduca sexta treated with JH during development as opposed to Manduca sexta that receive no treatment (13.06 g vs. 12.22 g, P=0.5461), refuting the null hypothesis.

Discussion:
According to the results of this experiment, juvenile hormone has no impact on the growth rate in mass of Manduca sexta, refuting the null hypothesis. One explanation for these results is that JH levels are already high compared to 20E levels during Manduca sexta adolescence, as JH’s main function is to maintain a juvenile structure within the Manduca sexta [Truman: 1999]. Because these levels are already so high, an introduction of even more JH may have very little impact on the insect’s growth, leading to results like those of this experiment. Because JH never leaves the Manduca sexta’s system in the developmental time frame of this experiment, there is no marked difference in growth between the JH Group and Control Group [Truman: 1999; Zhou: 2001].
A similar train of thought can be followed when it comes to the differences in coloration observed between the Control Group and Manduca sexta that were treated with JH. JH’s primary role is to inhibit maturation, affirmed by this experiment in qualitative observations about the appearance-related changes in the hornworms treated with JH [Truman: 1999]. JH was present in abundance in the JH Group of hornworms, while the concentration ratios of JH and 20E remained normal for the Control Group, potentially leading to a difference in gene expression between the two groups as the usual low-level releases of 20E were minimized by JH’s abundance [Zhou: 2001]. Because the hornworms in the Control Group received no additional hormones that prevent maturation, these hornworms may have had the capability to begin the early stages of the maturation process due to their normal hormone concentration ratios, forming external black and white stripe-like markings, unlike the JH group [Truman: 1999; Zhou: 2001].
In order to make more definitive conclusions regarding JH’s role in the growth in mass of Manduca sexta, further experimentation is required. To achieve more conclusive data, it would behoove future experimental designs to have an extended observation period that goes beyond 15 days. With this extended period of observation, Manduca sexta will be able to advance further along in their development and growth, providing more data and a stronger foundation for forming conclusions from the experiment’s results. Additionally, a separate hypothesis could be tested regarding JH’s role in the color change of hornworms observed in this experiment, exploring what specific influences might have contributed to the lighter appearance of the JH Group hornworms in comparison to the Control Group hornworms. These future experiments have the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind insect hormones and their influence on organism development, making them especially worthwhile.
