Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone Activator on the Growth and Weight of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
	The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that has a typical life cycle of around 39 to 48 days. The Manduca sextaâ€™s life cycle is an example of a holometabolous life cycle. It goes through four major stages of life; egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. When the Manduca sexta transitions from the pupa stage to the adult stage, it forms a larval cuticle or cocoon. To change through these stages, multiple hormones are involved. Two of the main hormones in the Manduca sexta are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development, while Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt. Juvenile Hormone inhibits Ecdysone, which prevents molting and the development of the larva into an adult [Anonymous:2014]. Before the caterpillar pupates, there is a commitment pulse. This is because Ecdysterone levels rise while Juvenile Hormone levels are low. Juvenile Hormone levels drop at critical points of development in order to allow Ecdysone to be released so the insect can molt. Juvenile Hormone also expresses juvenile characteristics, so when this hormone level drops, adult characteristics can form as molting occurs. Juvenile Hormone also promotes the synthesis of lipoproteins and glycoproteins [Adams:2009]. In this experiment, the effect of a Juvenile Hormone activator is tested on the Manduca sexta by measuring their weight. One group of four Manduca Sexta will be given the Juvenile Hormone activator while another group of four is given no activator. The independent variable will be the Juvenile Hormone Activator, and the dependent variable is the weight of the Manduca sexta. If a Manduca sexta is given a synthetic Juvenile Hormone activator, then this Manduca sexta will not develop as quickly as the Manduca sexta that is given nothing, in turn weighing less than the Manduca sexta given nothing.

Materials and Methods:
Eight juvenile tobacco hornworms are separated into two groups of four. Each group is placed in a plastic box that is separated into four compartments, giving each tobacco hornworm its own section. Holes are punched into each section to allow the tobacco hornworms to receive air. One group is designated as the control group. Each tobacco hornworm in this group is given 10g of food mixed with 10 drops of water. The initial weight of each tobacco hornworm is recorded. Each tobacco hornworm in the other group is given 10g of food mixed with 10 drops of Juvenile Hormone activator, called Precor. The initial weight of each tobacco hornworm in this group is recorded as well. Then, both groups of worms are placed in an incubator. Every day over the course of fifteen days, the weight of each of the eight tobacco hornworms is recorded, the food is changed if necessary. The two-sample t-test statistical test is used to compare the mean value of the weights from the control group and the treatment group.

Results:
Significant differences were found between the control group and the treatment group of tobacco hornworms. The differences began with appearance. The control group of tobacco hornworms had a green-yellow appearance and were very small. The maximum weight of the control tobacco hornworms averaged to 8.0g. After reaching a maximum weight on day twelve, each control group tobacco hornworm lost weight, decreasing to an average weight of 4.9g. The treatment group of tobacco hornworms had a lighter blue-green appearance, and were much larger than the control group. The weights tobacco hornworms in the treatment group steadily increased until day fifteen, reaching the average maximum of 12.9g. The treatment group of tobacco hornworms weighs significantly more than the control group. The two-sample t-test indicates that the mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 6.87, df = 6, P = 0.000467).

Discussion:
The final average weight of the tobacco hornworms not treated was much lower than the final average weight of the tobacco hornworms given Juvenile Hormone activator. The weight of the tobacco hornworms that received treatment constantly increased through the last day of measurement while that of the untreated tobacco hornworms fluctuated and decreased through the last day of measurement. The result of the heavier weight in the treated tobacco hornworms is due to the excess amount of Juvenile Hormone in their systems from the juvenile hormone activator. This being said, the hypothesis is rejected. Juvenile Hormone, while regulating the type of molt, also regulates growth duration by regulating the hormonal response to critical weight, which is the size the tobacco hornworm must be to end growth and begin metamorphosis [Mirth:2014]. When Juvenile Hormone is present in the tobacco hornworm, it allows the insect body to grow. Once the insect body reaches a certain size that will allow the tobacco hornworm to successfully molt, Juvenile Hormone levels drop resulting in a rise of Ecdysone levels. Ecdysone will stop the growth and begin the molting. This is why the control group began to lose weight around day twelve. These tobacco hornworms experienced a drop in Juvenile Hormone and an influx of Ecdysone and were preparing to begin metamorphosis. The tobacco hornworms given Juvenile Hormone activator continued to grow as the excess Juvenile Hormone in their system inhibited Ecdysone, preventing the tobacco hornworms from stopping their weight gain to begin metamorphosis. The exact age of the tobacco hornworms is unknown, but assuming they were a few days old when the experiment started, at day fifteen of the experiment the tobacco hornworms would have been at the point in time where Juvenile Hormone drops, Ecdysone increases and metamorphosis should begin. The only error in this experiment is the death of one of the tobacco hornworms in the control group. Therefore, when finding the averages there is one less worm to average out the weight with. The next logical step for this study would be to carry it out for two to four more days to determine how long the weight loss of the control group would continue until metamorphosis.
