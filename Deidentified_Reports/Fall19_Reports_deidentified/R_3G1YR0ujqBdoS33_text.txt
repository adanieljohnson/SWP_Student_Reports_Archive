Title: Effects of Moisture Level on the Energy Allocation in Raphanus sativus (Radishes)

Abstract:
Limited resources in the environment set selective pressure on plants, thus causing plants to evolve strategies for energy allocation within different plant organs. This experiment intends to investigate Radishes’ energy allocations under environments with different moisture levels. The energy allocation can be assessed by measuring the root:shoot ratios in weights and lengths. Therefore, we predict a lower root:shoot ratio with high moisture level. The results of this experiment indicate an insignificent relationship between the change of root:shoot ratios and the level of moisture in the environment. However, the notable fact that the root:shoot ratios always decrease when the level of moisture goes up suggests a potential reasoning that radishes tend to allocate resources to their roots when they are in dry environment in order to seek more water. Further steps of this experiment consequently involve using different kinds of measurement to test the significance of relationship.

Introduction:
As there is limited resource in the ecological community, plants evolve certain strategies to allocate their resources under such selective pressure. Resources required for plant growth can be divided into those acquired above ground and acquired below the soil surface. Above ground, sugars are derived from photosynthesis by plant shoots. While below ground, water and essential nutrients are taken up by plant roots. Therefore, the energy allocation in plants can be considered as the partitioning of biomass among different plant organs. Previous experiments on plants’ biomass allocation has suggested an allometric relationship between the biomasses of shoots and roots [Brouwer: 1962]. Consequently, the measurement of root:shoot ratio can be used to detect energy allocation for plants under various environmental conditions. In this experiment, Raphanus sativus, known as radishes, were used as sample plants. Radishes are fast-growing, annual, cool-season crops, which are edible vegetables and can be grown as companion plants for pest controll [Price: 2013]. We want to investigate their root:shoot ratio under different level of moisture in soil. When there is less water in the soil, radishes are likely to actively seek water, thus allocating more energy to roots and have longer roots. Radishes under high moisture condition are expected to have shorter and less weighed roots compared to those of shoots. Our hypothesis is that radishes under high moisture condition will have lower root:shoot ratios both in weights and lengths compared with those under normal moisture condition.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, the independent variable is the level of moisture and the dependent variable is root:shoot ratio. We firstly set 6 pots of radishes with 12 seeds each pot. 3 of them were controll group, which received regular watering every day, and the other 3 of them were treatment group, which were kept in highly moist condition every day. In order to get highly moist for radishes in treatment group, we put these 3 pots of radishes into a transparent box with 2-inch-water inside. We put both the controll group and the treatment group into the greenhouse and kept watering them for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, we measured data of 6 replicates of radishes from the controll group and 4 from the treatment group. We weighed the total weight of radishes and the shoots of them, and then attained the weight of roots by subtracting shoot weights from total weight. The shoot lengths and root lengths were also measured. We then calculated the both the root:shoot weight ratio and the root:shoot length ratio for each replicate. After obtaining the means of both ratios, we conducted a two-sample t test to compare both them. 

Results:
The mean root:shoot weight ratio is 0.152 +/- 0.110 for controll group and is 0.0738 +/- 0.0356 for treatment group. The mean root:shoot length ratio is 1.159 +/- 0.428 for controll group and is 0.965 +/- 0.0838 for treatment group. The mean root:shoot weight ratio in high moisture condition is not significently lower than that of treatment group (t_stat = 1.354, d.f. = 8, one-tailed p_value = 0.0624), and it is not statistically significent for root:shoot length ratio either (t_stat = 0.879, d.f. = 8, one-tailed p_value = 0.202). According to both Figure 1. and Figure 2., there are lower root:shoot ratios in weights and lengths when radishes are in high moisture condition compared to regular moisture condition.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that radishes under high moisture condition will have both lower root:shoot ratios compared with those under normal moisture condition was rejected due to non-statistically significent results. Previous research has indicated that plants’ responses to water agreed with the model that they respond to a decreased in above-ground resources with increased allocation to shoots whereas respond to a decrease in below ground resources with increased allocation to roots. However, when the resource is specifically water, the change of fractions in roots and shoots might be different in growth rate and biomass [Poorter: 2000]. Consequently, our experimental results can be alternatively explained by comparing the change of shoot or root length and change of shoot or root weight instead of using the root:shoot ratio. By interpreting our results in this way, we can find a significent relationship of changing in energy allocation in radishes. We can thus conclude that radishes indeed allocate more energy for root growth in order to get water when they are placed in dry environmental conditions. Therefore, our next step for this experiment is to investigate if more samples being tested will correspond to such significent result. If the result turns out to be significent, then the farming of radishes can be benefited from it.
