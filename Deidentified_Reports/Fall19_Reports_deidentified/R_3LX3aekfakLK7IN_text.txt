Title: Effects of E20 Hormone, Azaguard, on Weight of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Ecdysone is an insect molting hormone, secreted by the Prothoracic Gland and regulated by the hormone PTTH. Ecdysone in conjunction with the organism’s molecular clock decides when molts will occur. It is found in a delicate concentration ratio with the Juvenile Hormone. The Manduca sexta insect or tobacco hornworm, is common to the United States and is used in many biological experiments.This experiment was conducted over the course of 14 days to conclude if the Manduca sexta caterpillars treated with E20 hormone, Azaguard, would decrease in weight due to quicker development compared to the control. The findings of the experiment suggest that the treatment of E20 does in fact have these effects on the treated caterpillars. The quantitative recordings from this experiment and the conclusion from the t test demonstrate that the weights of the control group are statistically significantly different from that of the treatment group, meaning that the results found are not random. The decrease in treated caterpillars’ weights demonstrates that the Azaguard treatment causes the caterpillars to molt faster, or fundamentally, when the caterpillar doesn’t have the sufficient nutrients and other homeostatic criteria to support molting, which led to the deaths of the treatment caterpillars.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta or tobacco hornworm is an insect belonging to the Order Lepidoptera [Johnson: 2019]. “The tobacco hornworm is found throughout the United States (north to the southern portion of Canada), Central America, and the Caribbean” [Byron: 2017]. It is useful in experiments as it is a commonly found organism and easy to manipulate. Its life cycle includes four stages: embryonic, larval, pupal, and finally adulthood. The entire life cycle of a Manduca sexta spans from between 39 and 48 days [Johnson: 2019]. The insect maintains its homeostasis and regulatory qualities through the production of steroid hormones: Ecdysone (E20 hormone) and Juvenile Hormone. These two hormones are maintained and secreted in a balanced ratio, as both are needed in certain amounts to maintain the life of the organism. “Ecdysone is the major steroid hormone in insects and plays essential roles in coordinating developmental transitions such as larval molting and metamorphosis” [Ishimoto: 2010]. Ecdysone is involved in controlling the timing of the insect’s molts, as levels spike during each molting stage [Johnson: 2019]. Based on the insect’s biological clock, the corpus cardiaca, a part of the insect’s brain, will produce Prothoracicotropic hormone or PTTH. PTTH will then signal the prothoracic gland to produce and secrete ecdysone [Johnson: 2019]. Then when enough ecdysone accumulates, the insect will undergo ecdysis or molting which is the movement into a new life stage, paired with an increase in size. This experiment will explore the effects of applying E20 hormone to a treatment group of tobacco hornworm caterpillars via their food source and comparing these effects to a control group. If Manduca sexta caterpillars are treated with the E20 hormone, Azaguard, they will develop faster and display a decrease in overall weight compared to the caterpillars acting as the control.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment used E20 hormone Azaguard as the independent variable, weight (in grams) as the dependent variable, and used caterpillar type, weight of food source and the initial drops of both the water and the E20 hormone as the control variables
	On each of the two 4 celled container lids, a hole tool was used to create 2 holes approximately over each cell, creating 8 holes in total on each lid. The hole tool was used again to create 1 hole on each side of the cell walls. A marker was used to label one container “treatment” and the other “control”, and to number each cell on each container from 1-4. 10g of caterpillar food was measured for each control cell using a balance scale, and then each was individually transferred to a separate container to be mixed with 5 drops of water using a pipet. The water was then physically mixed with the food and each 10g mixture was placed tightly against each cell wall of the control container. Another 10g of caterpillar food was measured for each treatment cell using a balance scale, and then each 10g were individually transferred to a separate container where each food was mixed with 5 drops of E20 hormone Azaguard using a new pipet. Each 10g of food combined with Azaguard was placed tightly against each cell wall of the treatment container. One caterpillar was transferred to each cell for both control and treatment groups. 8 tobacco hornworm caterpillars were used in total. Each 4 celled container was then placed in a fridge. The caterpillars were then checked daily for a span of 14 days, weights of each caterpillar were recorded daily. Caterpillar food was routinely checked for moistness. If food was dry, 3 drops of water was added to the food of the control group and 3 drops of Azaguard was added to the food of the treatment group. When data was compiled a two-sample unpaired statistical t-test was used to compare the treatment and control groups. 


Results:
Over the course of the two weeks the caterpillars were intensely observed. Each group’s food was kept moistened and was replaced when necessary. During the experiment, the control group had larger excrements and excreted much more than the treatment group. The weights of the caterpillars differed drastically over the time of their growth as seen in the photos of Figure #1 and Figure #2 which were taken on Day 11. On this day the caterpillars of the treatment were declared dead, and visually one can see the extreme difference between the large living control caterpillars and the extremely small shriveled treatment caterpillars at the end of their life. The weights of both the control and treatment groups were recorded over the course of the 14 days. Using this recorded data, a table (Table #1) and a scatter plot (Figure #3) were created to describe the difference in weights between the groups. The data demonstrates that the control group’s weights steadily increased over the course of the 14 days. The average growth of the control caterpillars was about 2.3 grams for the control group and the average growth for the treatment group was about 0.09 grams. These values demonstrate the immense disparity between the weights of the groups. The calculated standard deviation of the control group was 0.169479705 and the standard deviation of the treatment group was 0.01930014. The treatment group’s weights steadily declined with the eventual death of all the caterpillars by Day 11. This table and figure are used to show  statistical difference between the test groups. Figure #4, in the form of a bar graph, shows the overall mean difference of the two groups, to aid in demonstrating the statistical difference between the groups. To further prove statistical difference a two-sample unpaired statistical t-test was calculated using the mean data. Based on the t-test results, t-stat = 0.000629, df=6, P= 0.000629. 

Discussion:
The concluded results do support the hypothesis. Based on the t-test results, the mean of the control group was found to be statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group. These values support the rejection of the null hypothesis in favor of accepting the alternative hypothesis. The statistical results proved the hypothesis, especially through the use of the p value. The p value calculated is far less than 0.05, proving that the results of this experiment did not happen by chance but are highly significant. The graph figures show how the average weight of the treatment group steadily declined, because of the Azaguard application. The control group molted regularly as shown by its steadily increasing average weights. The huge disparity between the average weight of the treatment and control groups demonstrate how the control group was able to maintain normal homeostatic conditions and thrive, while the treatment caterpillars were substantially underweight, due to the effects of the hormone treatment they were receiving. The standard deviations for both groups were very low, which demonstrate that for both groups of caterpillars, their weights all circulated heavily around the mean weight with no outliers. These interpretations of results give great support to the hypothesis as it demonstrates that applying E20 hormone Azaguard to the treatment caterpillars did cause them to develop quicker which resulted in a decrease in weight and eventually death. This is because the extra application of the E20 hormone was in opposition with the organism’s biological or molecular clock. It caused the treatment group to develop faster, without having the necessary energy or size to support the subsequent molt, or inevitably, life itself. The increased amount of E20 hormone in the insect’s system upsets the balanced concentration ratio of Ecdysone to Juvenile Hormone. The Juvenile Hormone allows the insect to stay in a certain life stage, in order to accumulate the necessary nutrients and energy it needs for molting to occur. A past scientific study was performed to assess the relationship between molting and circadian rhythms in the insect Carausius morosus. It was found that “Successful ecdysis in insects depends on proper timing and sequential activation of an elaborate series of motor programs driven by a relatively conserved network of neuropeptides. The behaviors must be activated at the appropriate times to ensure successful loosening and shedding of the old cuticle, and can be influenced by environmental cues in the form of immediate sensory feedback and by circadian rhythms” [Wadsworth et al: 2014]. The Carausius morosus insect showed “a circadian rhythm to the onset of ecdysis” [Wadsworth et al: 2014] and needed an interval of time between different stages of molt to have a successful molting in accordance with its biological clock [Wadsworth et al: 2014]. This demonstrates that insects need a proper amount of time to successfully molt in accordance with their circadian rhythms or, in other words, biological clocks. Without the necessary time in these Juvenile stages, the treatment caterpillars were not able to accumulate nutrients before molting occurred, hence the decrease in size. The control caterpillars showed molting in a normalized environment as their molts were coupled by a steady increase in size, since their molts were timed through the regulatory release of ecdysone. An observation from the experiment that can support this, is the size and quantity of excretions. The control group excreted more often and in larger proportions than the treatment group. This shows that the control caterpillars were maintaining an ideal weight and period of growth in order to proceed to the next molting stage. The treatment group didn’t have this need to store nutrients for molting and to maintain regular homeostatic metabolic rates, because of the experimental treatments. So they excreted in smaller amounts, as they were developing faster than for which their bodies could provide for, which caused a substantial decrease in weight. A past experimental study performed by scientists, Nijhout and Williams, on Manduca sexta larva deduced that a critical weight is needed for metamorphosis. The scientists found that when a larva achieved a critical weight, Juvenile Hormone production decreased, and PTTH which signals release of ecdysone, was released [Riddiford: 2011]. Their study shows that a critical weight is needed to put metamorphosis or molting into effect [Riddiford: 2011]. In this experiment, the treatment caterpillars couldn’t reach a critical weight because of the Azaguard treatment. The treatment caused the caterpillars to develop quicker and at times when molting wasn’t sufficient, which resulted in a substantial decrease in weight and then death. A possible source of error in the experiment is that when moistening the food sources during the two weeks of the study, not all drops were of equal proportions between the caterpillars. This could have caused the treatment caterpillars to be privy to a little more Azaguard than previously stated. The next logical step for this study would be undergoing this experiment with different measures of Azaguard, to see if amount of Azaguard affects the hypothesis and the degree of molting. This experiment proved that an equal balance of hormones is needed for an organism to successfully grow, survive and maintain homeostasis. If one hormone drastically outweighs the other, it could have serious effects on the health of the organism.

Figure Legends: 
Figure #1 Control Caterpillars Day 11, notice large normal excrements, which aim to show that regular metabolic functions are being maintained.  Figure #2 Treatment Caterpillars Day 11, caterpillars declared dead, notice the extremely small size of the caterpillars,  and how they produced little and few excrements. This demonstrates how the Azaguard is affecting the homeostasis of the caterpillars, as the treatment caterpillars cannot maintain normal bodily functions because of their decreased weight loss due to treatments.   Table #1 Average Weights in Grams of Control and Treatment Groups. The data used to create the Figure #3 scatterplot. Shows the daily average weights of each group.    Figure #3 Scatter Plot that coincides with Table #1. Shows the growth weight of each group of caterpillars over the 14 day period. Notice how it displays the steady increase of the control group's weights and the steady decline of the treatment group's weights.   Figure #4 Overall Average Weight of Control and Treatment Group, notice significant difference between mean weights and how this disparity correlates to the experiment itself.*************************************************************************
