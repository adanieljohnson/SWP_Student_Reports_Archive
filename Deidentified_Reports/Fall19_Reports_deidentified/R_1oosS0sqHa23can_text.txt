Title: The Effect of Differing Temperatures on the Productivity of Chloroplasts within Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
DCIP is commonly used as an electron acceptor and indicator of chloroplast activity when used in a spectrophotometer. In this lab concentrated chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea (spinach) were tested at differing temperatures (room temperature and 45 degrees Celsius) to determine if there was any statistically significent difference in chloroplast activity between the two conditions. The percent change from (0-10), (0-20) and (0-30) was calculated and compared for significance. The time (0-30) was used as an indicator of the overall percent change throughout the experiment. It was found that between (0-30) there was no significent difference between the percent change in absorbance value from the “zero-value” (t_stat= 1.88, d.f.= 4, P = .133). However, it was important to note that the percent change in absorbance between (0-10) was significent (t_stat= 6.97, d.f.= 4, P = .001). Another study could be done to focus more on this time period and maybe slightly beyond to discover just how the chloroplast productivity fluctuates. It is possible that this was caused by the inability of DCIP to hold on to electrons, so a better electron acceptor might be required. 

Introduction:
Certain leafy plants have been known to survive better in colder conditions, ie. Lettuce and spinach, while other flowering plants tend to survive better in warmer conditions, ie. Oranges and strawberries. [Gatzke: 2012] In this lab we will be testing the chloroplast activity of spinach leaves when under different temperature conditions. This will be achieved by first performing differential centrifugation, which is the process of using a centrifuge to get concentrate from the spinach leaves, to prepare enriched chloroplasts for testing. The enriched chloroplasts will then be tested using a Brad.f.ord assay for absorbance levels. A Brad.f.ord assay works by testing the absorbance levels of different solutions at different wavelengths; once a wavelength is determined for testing, the absorbance levels can be compared to determine the amount of a substance is available. In this case, DCIP is used to indicate available electrons. DCIP is a common electron acceptor that is often used as an indicator of the number of reducing agent produced by chloroplasts. As more electrons are produced by the chloroplasts, (a normally blue dye) becomes clearer. So lower absorbance levels are correlated with more productivity of chloroplasts. [Investigating the Light..| Nuffield Foundation)] By measuring the absorbance levels, we can predict the number of electrons that are able to move through Photosystem II, and thereby provide the activity levels of chloroplasts under different temperature conditions. A study done on the productivity of phytoplankton at different temperatures concluded that if phytoplankton is kept in temperatures that veer far from the temperatures that phytoplankton normally grow in, that the productivity of the phytoplankton decreased. [Neori and Holm-Hansen: 1982] From this conclusion, it is reasonable to believe that if the temperature that the spinach is kept in varies too far from the normal temperature in which spinach grows, then a significent difference in chloroplast activity will be found. 

Materials and Method:
Materials: Spectrophotometer, 7 cuvettes, 7 test tubes, 3 centrifuge tubes, cheesecloth, medium-sized spinach leaves, (3) 10 Ml pipets, 130 mM DCIP, Reaction buffer, heated container set to 45 degrees Celsius, 2 identical desk lamps, mortar and pestle. 
	Method: Began by removing the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. The spinach leaves were then combined with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer in a mortar, a pestle was then used to grind up the leaves. An additional 10Ml of cold grinding buffer was added then mixed thoroughly, the mixture was then strained through a cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. This mixture was then added to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “Tube A” and was spun at 200 x G for three minutes at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius. A balance tube with an identical amount of water was used to balance the tubes in the centrifuge. The supernaut from this tube was ten poured into another tube marked “Tube B”, making sure to leave the pellet of debris at the bottom of “Tube A”. “Tube B” was then spun in a centrifuge with an identical balance tube at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at a temperature of 4 degrees Celsius. This supernaut from “Tube B” was then poured out, making sure to leave the pellet of debris at the bottom of “Tube B”. 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer was then added to the pellets at the bottom of “Tube B” and shaken to mix up the pellets. This is was provided by the enriched chloroplasts for the experiment. Seven large test tubes were then prepared using the amounts of reagents shown in the following table. 

100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts were then added to tubes 2-7. The solutions were immediately mixed, and each was placed in a cuvette of their own for the spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer was set to a wavelength of 600nm, and a blank was set using “Tube 1”. A “time zero” value for the absorbance levels of each cuvette was then recorded after the blank. Tubes 2-4 were then placed in a water bath (making sure no water got into the cuvettes) that was set to 45 degrees Celsius. Tubes 5-7 were placed at room temperature. Both sets of cuvettes were kept under identical lamps. Every 10 minutes the absorbance levels of all 7 samples were recorded, then each cuvette was returned to their respective conditions; this was done for a total of 30 minutes or 3 rounds. The average percent changes for (0-10), (0-20), and (0-30) for both 45 degrees Celsius and room temperature test subjects were compared using a two-sample t_test to test for significent difference between the two. In total three (3) two-sample t_tests were completed, but the test comparing the (0-30) % change was used to determine the overall change in absorbance levels. 

Results:
From Fig. 2 the % change for room temperature was found to be 3.18% for (0-30) and .92% for 45 degrees Celsius from (0-30). From Fig. 3, it was found that the two-tailed p_value for (0-30) was p= .133.

Discussion:
The group concluded from the resulting two-tailed p_value from (0-30) found in Fig. 3 that overall there was no significent difference in chloroplast activity between the samples placed in 45 degrees Celsius and the samples places at room temperature (t_stat= 1.88, d.f.= 4, P = .133). This did not support the group’s hypothesis that if the temperature that the spinach is kept in varies too far from the normal temperature in which spinach grows, then a significent difference in chloroplast activity will be found. This could be due to the size of the samples tested, greater sample sizes might have provided better data for interpretation. A recent study concluded that that the photosynthetic rates of chloroplasts and protoplasts decreased as temperature increased from 22 degrees Celsius to 42 degrees Celsius. In wheat, they found that the rate decreased rather abruptly [Al-Khatib and Paulsen: 1999] It is also important to note that from Fig. 3, the two-tailed p_value for (0-10) was found to be significent, implying a significent difference in % change of absorbance levels between the room temperature sample and the 45 degrees Celsius sample. This could be attributed to the DCIP absorbing as much lose electrons as possible in that time, and then simply not being able to hold on to them. This alone is enough to warrant further testing with larger sample sizes, and possibly a better electron acceptor to conclude whether there is a significent difference in chloroplast activity at differing temperatures in spinach.
