Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone analouge, precor, on the growth of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) are two of the three hormones involved in the development if the Manduca Sexta. Ecdysterone is produced in the prothoracic glands and is responsible for the timing of the molting of the Manduca Sexta. JH is produced in the Corpus Allata and is responsible for the type of molt that that occurs. Both JH and Ecdysterone work together, in different proportions and concentrations, to controll the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the Manduca Sexta [Eaton, 1988]. This organism is considered a pest while in its larvae stage, so increasing the rate of the growth would be advantageous because it would mean that the Manduca Sexta spends less time in its larvae stage. JH levels are very high during the first four larval instar periods of the Manduca Sexta, the levels of JH start to drop at the end of the fourth instar; Therefore, by increasing the amount of JH present, there is a chance that the Manduca Sexta would reach the fifth instar faster. This would cause it to pupate and become a moth, making it less of a pest [Progress in Neurobiology, 2003]. For this experiment, our group hypothesized that by adding the JH analog, Precor, the Manduca Sexta would increase in weight and ultimately grow faster than those who were not given the extra Juvenile hormone. 

Materials and Method:
The first step is to set up the Manduca Sexta habitat. Obtain two containers, each containing four slots. This gives room for four controll and for experimental caterpillars. Next, place holes inside of each slot of the container to ensure proper airflow to the Manduca Sexta. Then, label each container as either controll or experimental and then number each slot one through four
Secondly, we set up food for the Manduca Sexta. This is important because it is how the treatment is being administered. The controll group received five drop sof water mixed with ten grams of food. The experimental group received five drops of Precor mixed with Ten grams of food. These were mixed up and rolled it into a ball. Then, we placed the mixture in the respective slot 
Next, one Manduca Sexta was placed in each container and we observed them every day for two weeks. We would come in and record the weight of the caterpillar every day. The food was remade every day to avoid dehydration and the container was cleaned as necessary. After two weeks, compare the recorded weights and run a two-sample t_test to determine statistical significance in the weights of the controll and experimental groups 


Results:
The mean of the experimental group treated with precor was significently statistically different than the mean of the controll group (t_stat = 1.74, d.f. = 28, P= 0.046)   

Discussion:

Overall, our results supported our hypothesis that the Manduca Sexta treated with the JH analogue, Precor, would ultimately grow to be larger than those without the treatment. This is as expected due to the fact that JH works alongside 20E to promote growth and development within the Manduca sexta. Similar results were found in a study conducted in the early 1980’s by Doctor Dorothy Rountree and Dr. Wallen Bollenbacher. In their study, they concluded that JH alters the response that larval tissue has to ecdysterones and affects the release of PTTH [Rountree, 1985]. In the future, it may be advantageous to look at how JH would ultimately affect the commitment pulse of the Manduca Sexta. We understand that the larval form of the Manduca sexta are considered pests and that JH increases the growth of the insect, but the addition of JH may just increase the size of the Manduca, but not actually increase rate of the molting process. Therefore, it would be advantageous to see how the JH affects the molting to process to see if it increases it, leaving the Manduca sexta in its larval stage for less time, decreasing its time of existence as a pest.
