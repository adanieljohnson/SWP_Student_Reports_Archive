Title: Increased Temperature Causes a Smaller Root to Shoot Ratio in Vigna radiata (Mung Bean)

Abstract:
The Vigna radiata is a plant that uses energy allocation to grow different parts of itself in different sizes based on its surroundings. We decided to test the effect of temperature on the root to shoot ratio for Vigna radia plants. We tested this by making two groups of Vigna radiata plants and placing one in the ambient temperature of a greenhouse while the other was placed in a heated incubator. After two weeks we measured the length and mass of the roots and shoots of both treatment groups and compared them to each other. We found the average root to shoot length ratio in the greenhouse to be 1.767 while the incubator plants had a ratio of 0.961. The greenhouse plants also appeared to be much healthier than the incubator plants by the end of the experiment. Our one tailed two sample t test proved that this difference was significant.

Introduction:
Energy allocation is when an individual divides their resources to fit their specific needs in their environment. Plants use energy allocation to adapt to a variety of different environmental factors, such as temperature, light, and soil nutrient levels, that can make it difficult for the plant to survive. This causes plants to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, which is when different plants of the same species will have different sized structures based on the challenges presented by their environments. The Vigna radiata (Mung Bean) is an example of a plant that grows different sized shoots and roots, which are the parts of the plant that grow above and below the soil, respectively, based on its environment. Shoots are primarily involved in performing photosynthesis while shoots primarily involved in taking in water and nutrients from the soil.  We decided to study the effect of temperature on the root to shoot ratio of the Vigna radiata by planting two groups of seeds in different locations and then measuring and comparing each group’s root to shoot ratio. According to a study of root to shoot ratios in terrestrial biomes found them to be negatively correlated to the average temperature (Mokany, Karel: 2005). Based on this information from a previous study, we predicted that the mung bean plants in lower temperature would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the mung bean plants in the higher temperature environment. We believe this will happen because, based on the primary function of the roots, a lower temperature will decrease the amount of water and/or nutrients available to the plant through the soil, forcing the plant to allocate more resources into absorbing these nutrients.

Materials and Methods:
We planted twelve mung bean seeds in each of six pots, then we put half of the pots in the ambient temperature (25 degrees Celsius) of a greenhouse and we put the other in an incubator with a higher controlled temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. The greenhouse plants were our control group while the incubator plants were our experimental group. Over the next two weeks, we cared for the plants as necessary, mostly meaning that we made sure to give them enough water daily. After this growth period we measured the length (in centimeters) and mass (in grams) of the roots and shoots of ten plants from each treatment group. To separate the roots from the shoots of the plant, we cut them were the stem began to change color (and in mung bean plants, there is a small bump where the root and shoot meet). We used these measurements to calculate the average root to shoot ratios for both length and mass in each treatment group. We used a one tailed two sample t-test to compare the average root to shoot ratios of the treatment groups.

Results:
When comparing mass, we found that the average root to shoot ratio in the greenhouse was 1.016 +/- 0.11 while the ratio for the incubator had an average of 0.974 +/-  0.37. We found that when measuring length, the root to shoot ratio in the greenhouse was 1.767 +/- 0.21 and the root to shoot ratio in the incubator was 0.961 +/- 0.20. As seen in figure 1, the range of values for root to shoot mass ratio greatly overlap across the two treatments; however, in figure 2 one can see that there is no overlap in the ranges of the two groups. We observed that the shoots of the plants in the greenhouse appeared to be much greener, and likely healthier, than the shoots of the experimental group. Likewise, the roots of the control group appeared much thicker and fuller than those from the experimental group. The results of our one tailed two sample t-test for mass were t=0.547, df=18, p=0.2955. The results of our one tailed two sample t-test for length were t=5.72, df=18, p=0.00001.

Discussion:
The extremely small p-value given by the comparison of root to shoot length ratios means that our hypothesis was strongly supported by our experiment. This means that the difference in root to shoot length ratios between the two groups was very unlikely to have happened due to chance, and that the difference in temperature was the primary cause of the difference in these ratios. Our results show that Vigna radiata plants prefer to grow longer roots, relative to their shoots, in lower temperatures. This is likely due to the temperatures effect on nutrients in the soil. A study showed that decreased temperature can reduce the amount of nitrogen in the soil (Leuschner, Christoph: 2007). This would explain the longer roots in the lower temperature because the plant would need to maximize the amount of nutrients that it can absorb due to the lower availability of nitrogen (and likely other necessary nutrients). In the future, we could examine the relationship between temperature and soil nutrients so that we could either confirm or refute this reasoning. In addition, we would have to test a larger variety of temperatures to find the optimal temperature for maximizing or minimizing the root to shoot ratio of a mung bean plant. This would give a real world application to someone (a farmer, for instance) who would want to naturally manipulate the root to shoot ratio of the mung bean in order to maximize their crop yield, and these results are a step towards creating safe methods of maximizing agricultural outputs.
