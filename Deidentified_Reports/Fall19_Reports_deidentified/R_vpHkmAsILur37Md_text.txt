Title: Resource Allocation During Mung Bean Plant Growth 

Abstract:
Plants use the mechanism of resource allocation to meaningfully distribute limited resources throughout the organism to prioritized organs in response to the environment that the individual experiences. To observe this mechanism in plant life Mung Beans, Vigna Radiata, were utilized and tested in two separate temperature conditions to observe if temperature would effect energy allocation in this plant. The two conditions that the Mung Beans were grown in were the temperatures of the greenhouse and the raised temperature of an incubator. As a result of experimentation, the data conveyed that plants grown in the greenhouse had a higher weight and height root to shoot ratios. Specifically, the Mung Beans grown in the incubator had longer shoot lengths in comparison to the plants grown in the greenhouse. Whereas, the Mung Beans grown in the green house had longer root lengths. This demonstrated that Mung beans grown in higher temperatures allocate more of their resources to the shoots and plants grown in conditions that are more regulated will allocate more resources to the roots.

Introduction:
Organisms, when faced with an environment with limited resources can extract a finite quantity of resources from their environment for growth and reproduction. However, extracting these resources has a cost on the organism. As more resources are acquired from the environment, more resources are expended. As a solution, organisms will distribute and use these limited resources. Plants have various methods in which they can allocate their energy and metabolic resources. Plants can allocate their resources to the leaves, the stems and the roots. Leaves are the principle photosynthetic organ of the plant and increased allocation of resources to the leaves leads to plants having a high growth rate in an environment with plentiful light and soil nutrients. Stems are the principle supporting structure of the plant which aids in light capture and competition. Plants that invest more energy into their stems have are more successful in light capture and competition. Roots function as the primary absorptive organ as well as an anchor to  the soil. In more water scarce environments plants will allocate resources to the roots to search for and acquire water. Plants have the capability to allocate resources based on environmental conditions due to phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity allows for the growth pattern to change over time thus changing the allocation strategy for new growth. The type of resource allocation can be physically observed through the height and weight root to shoot ratios in plants.
	The purpose of this experiment is to observe this behavior in two separate conditions with a specific plant, Mung Beans or Vigna Radiata. The two conditions the Mung Beans are being grown in are a heated incubator and a greenhouse. The environments of the Mung Beans are being altered to test if growing the plants in different temperatures will effect how resources are allocated throughout the growth process.Mung Beans are in the Legume family and are closely related to adzuki and cowpea. In addition, they are a warm season crop that require adequate rainfall and when grown in high temperature- low moisture environments the growth ability is negatively affected. We hypothesize that Mung Beans will have higher root to shoot ratio when grown in the environmental conditions provided by the greenhouse. Meaning, Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse will not only have a higher mass but we expect that their roots will be longer than the plants grown in the heated incubator and we expect the opposite for plants grown in the heated incubator.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we used four pots for each growing condition with 12 Mung Bean seeds in each pot. The two growing environments were a heated incubator and a greenhouse. The plants were grown for a weeklong period in their respective conditions. Then after the plants grew for an appropriate amount of time the length and mass of the roots and shoots of 10 selected plants, from each of the two growing conditions, was collected.  Then the root to shoot ratio for both mass and length was calculated. A T-test was used to determine the significant difference between the length and weight of the plants grown in the two environments.




Results:
Generally, it was observed that the Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse conditions had on average longer stems and roots in addition to having a greater mass in comparison to plants grown in the heated incubator. The average root length of the plants grown in the greenhouse was 17.89cm and the p-value was .00664. Furthermore, the masses of the plants grown in the greenhouse were higher than those grown in the heated incubator. The average length of the roots grown in the heated conditions were 13.33 cm. The average weight root to shoot ratio for Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse was 1.016 and the average ratio for the incubator was .866. The average length ratio of the plants grown in the greenhouse was 1.767 and the ratio for the plants grown in the incubator was .961. The p-value for the root length is .000208.



Discussion:
The results of the experiment supported the hypothesis that Mung Beans grown in the greenhouse will not only have a higher mass but we expect that their roots will be longer than the plants grown in the heated incubator and we expect the opposite for plants grown in the heated incubator. These results could have occurred because Mung Beans are a warm season crop that require adequate rainfall and when grown in high temperature- low moisture environments the growth ability is negatively affected. According to a study done on the effects of Co2 and temperature on plant growth and resource allocation by J. Coleman and F. Bazz, plants grown in more mild climates were able to grow larger and a higher rate. In the future, if this experiment were to be replicated, we could evolve the study into including a wider variety of plants and more extreme temperatures for the environments the plants are grown in.
