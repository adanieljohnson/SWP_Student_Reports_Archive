Title: Resource allocation and growth in common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) in response to nitrogen availability

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether nitrogen concentration in water correlated with resource allocation and growth in the common buckwheat plant (F. esculentum), a dietary staple for many communities. It was hypothesized that an increased nitrogen concentration in water would cause an increased shoot growth in the plant in relation to its roots.  This was tested by treating a group of planted buckwheat seeds with nitrogen infused water against a controll group of seeds treated with distilled water.  After growth, the root:shoot ratios (R:S) for both weight and length were calculated for samples in both groups. A significent increase in R:S ratio was noticed in the controll group in  comparison to the experimental group for both weight and length. It was determined that these results were statistically significent via a one-tailed two sample t_test, indicating that nitrogen concentration in water correlated with increased shoot growth in buckwheat.  By finding the optimal nitrogen availability for buckwheat crop yield, this study could serve as a foundation to improve buckwheat farming and production.  




Introduction:
Common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a plant species originating in Central and Western China and brought to Europe during the Middle Ages [Alberta Government: 2001].   The structure and growth patterns of this plant consist of roots embedded underground in an array growing vertically downward near the soil surface, with a stem growing vertically upward and branches producing leaves and flowers [USDA: 2019].  This highly nutritious plant is a dietary staple world-wide [Fang: 2018], found in common meals such as pasta, many breakfast foods, and flour [USDA: 2019].  With this in mind, the ability to controll the growth patterns of this essential plant could increase production in the farming industry and food levels overall.  This goal could be made possible with an understanding of resource allocation and consequently phenotypic plasticity in this plant.  
The phenomenon of resource allocation refers to how a plant dedicates more of its energy and resources to one area and less to another.  Specifically, nutrients are distributed differently within a plant during its lifetime based on its functional needs for growth and development [Bennet: 2012].  This can lead to a change in the phenotype of the organism, such as differences in growth patterns in one organ versus another.  This ability to change phenotype is referred to as phenotypic plasticity. 
There are many factors in an ecological community that can affect how a plant allocates its resources and exhibits plasticity.  These factors can be non-living abiotic factors, such as sunlight or gas exposure, or they can be living biotic factors in the form of the other organisms the plant in question interacts with in its community [Johnson: 2019].  
An abiotic factor of interest for this study is nitrogen (N2).  This gas is often present in the soil due to nitrogen-fixing bacteria and is often absorbed by plants through their roots [Johnson: 2019].  Although different plants tend to vary in how they acquire and allocate nitrogen plants with a similar morphology and growth pattern to buckwheat favor the strategy of placing more nitrogen in leaves in order to increase the photosynthetic potential and the growth rate of the plant [Johnson: 2019].  
Considering the potential phenotypic plasticity of common buckwheat, the purpose of this experiment is to study the relationship between nitrogen and the growth of the plant.  Since plants of a similar architecture exhibit resource allocation from their roots to their shoots in response to increased nitrogen, it is hypothesized that as the availability of nitrogen increases for the buckwheat plants their shoot weights and lengths will also increase in proportion to their roots.

Materials and Method:
A set concentration of nitrogen infused water was given to a group of growing buckwheat plants, which were controllled against a group of buckwheat plants growing in the same conditions but given only water.  First, 6 pots were planted with 12 plants per pot.  Three pots were placed in the controll group while the other 3 plots were placed in the experimental group.  The pots in the controll group were each given 200Ml of water once daily for two weeks, while the pots in the experimental group were given 100Ml of a 32% nitrogen solution diluted in another 100Ml of water (overall 16% nitrogen solution) daily.  During this time the plants grew in the same location in a greenhouse in which all other environmental factors were controllled.  

	After 14 days, 2 plants were randoMly sampled from each pot.  For each plant, the weights and lengths of the total plant, the root of the plant and the shoot of the plant were measured.  The weights were measured in grams (g) using a consistent beam balance while the lengths were measured in millimeters (mm) using the same ruler.  When measuring the root and shoot separately the shoot was cut from the root at the same spot on each individual plant.  The collected data was then used to calculate an average root: shoot ratio (R:S) for both the weights and the lengths in the experimental group and the controll group.  These ratios were used to directly compare the two groups and a one-tailed two-sample t_test was run at an alpha value of 0.05 (ɑ=0.05) in order to test whether the difference in R:S ratios between the two groups was significent.  







Results:
It was determined that the average root to shoot ratios (R:S) were significently greater in the controll group than in the experimental group for both length (t_stat=8.24, d.f.=10, P=4.55 x 10-3) and weight (t_stat=2.93, d.f.=10, P=0.00750).  The difference between the average R:S for length was 0.670, with the average value for the controll group being 1.21 ± 0.180
while the average value for the experimental group was 0.540 ± 0.0800 (Figure I).  The difference between the average R:S for weight was 0.280, with the average value for the controll group being 0.560 ± 0.180 and the average value for the experimental group being 0.28 0± 0.160 (Figure II).  

Discussion:
As demonstrated above, the average R:S ratios for both weight and length were significently greater in the group treated with only water than the group treated with nitrogen infused water.  These values indicated that the shoot lengths and weights were greater in the group treated with nitrogen infused water, which correlated with the hypothesis that the relationship between the presence of nitrogen and shoot growth of the plants was non-random and directly proportional.  These findings consist with the knowledge on phenotypic plasticity in plants and  their uptake of nitrogen. As discussed above, a plant’s plasticity allows it to change how it distributes its resources throughout its lifetime in order to optimize its reproductive potential in response to its environment [Bennett: 2012].  This plasticity was observed in the buckwheat plants that were exposed to additional nitrogen in this experiment.  Since an abundance of nitrogen was present less absorption of nitrogen was needed.  Since the roots are the main site for absorption of nutrients including nitrogen [Johnson: 2019], the plants resources that would have gone towards root growth were allocated to shoot growth so that the plant could have more resources dedicated to photosynthesis instead of nitrogen absorption.  The results found in this experiment were consistent with a similar study, which found that both plant height and photosynthetic output of buckwheat plants significently increased in the presence of nitrogen fertilizer  [Fang: 2018].  Although this study demonstrates that buckwheat plant growth overall may increase with the increase of nitrogen, another study found that an increase in nitrogen may be correlated with an increase in the risk of lodging, which causes growing buckwheat plants to bend and break, limiting total crop yield [Wang: 2015].  A logical next step would be to determine the optimal amount of nitrogen to maximize buckwheat growth while minimizing lodging.  Determining this ideal amount would allow for maximal buckwheat crop yield, benefiting many communities due to its important industrial and dietary role in society.
