Title: The effect of coloration cues on the agonistic behavior of male Betta splendens 

Abstract:
The study of organismal behavior is one that has greatly contributed to understanding of both intraspecific interactions and their interactions with the environment. Using a Betta splendens model, agonistic behavior between males was studied with a focus on how males of different colors interacted within different colors of water. We hypothesized that males matching the color of water would be more aggressive especially when facing a male of a different color. To test this, 9 baseline trials were run putting red and blue males against each other in clear, red and blue water. Finally, red and blue males fighting each other in both red and blue water were repeated to gain significant data.  It was found that males were most aggressive when they matched the color of the water, but overall blue males were more aggressive than red males regardless of water color. This partially supported our hypothesis, with the aggression in fish matching water color, but there was not enough evidence to say that this was due to the color of the water or the color of the other fish. Moving forward, with a more in depth experiment and further research, the importance of visual cues in aggression as well as mate selection could be discovered using a Betta model system. 


Introduction:
Individual behaviors of organisms are a common topic of research for a variety of reasons. The importance of how a species interacts within like members of the same species, intraspecific behavior, can develop an understanding of how species reproduce and coexist. In addition, studying how species interact with other organisms, interspecific behavior, contributes to an understanding of how each species is a part of the environment in which it lives. For this study, we chose to research how Betta splendens interact within the species, so a study of intraspecific behavior. In addition, the focus is on that of agonistic behaviors of the fish. Agonistic behavior refers to aggressive behaviors. Male Betta fish are known for their aggression in the presence of other males. Their agonistic behavior has been well studied so that the level of aggression shown by different movements is known. The first category of aggressive behavior is broadside movements, these include tail flicking, tail beating as well as biting. The other category movements are facing movements which are more aggressive than broadside movements. The most aggressive behavior of the facing movements is the erection of a fishâ€™s red mane [Halperin: 1997]. This behavior evolved partially based upon sexual selection so that females have preference for mating with males that they have seen win fights. So being a better fighter helps with reproductive success; therefore, males with better fighting skills have passed along more alleles than those who have not [Dzieweczynski: 2014]. In order to better understand male betta aggression, we decided to test their response to visual cues and colors by dying the water in which they live and interact blue and red. In addition, we based the color of the water based on the colors of the fish used, so we had two red males and two blue males. So we hypothesized that a male in water that matched his coloration would be more aggressive when the other male was differently colored than the water. We based this on firstly the idea that it would harder for the differently colored male to see the male that matched color of the water because he would blend it. The fish that blended in would be able to easily see the fish that was different than that of the water. Secondly, previous research has found that male bettas respond with more aggression to males that have different coloration than themselves [Thompson: 1965]. We ran many trials with every possible color combination in order to determine where aggression was most variable based on coloration, and then performed replicates of this experiment. Based on our hypothesis, the most variable aggression between fish should be with two different colored fish in both colors of water. 


Materials and Methods:
Using four Betta splendens, two blue males and two red males, we set up two different tanks. Each tanks contained two barriers creating three spaces for the fish so that they cannot physically attack each other. In addition to this, there are blinders over the glass barriers so that the fish only see each other when it is desired. To start, we ran three baseline trials in clear water, exposing the two blue males to each other, then the two red males, and then one blue male and one red male. When exposed each time, the blinder was removed but not the glass so that there was never any physical contact. In addition, the exposure was only three minutes each time, with at least five minutes between when any fish would interact with another, in order to prevent exhaustion/death. During these three minutes, the amount of time each fish spent in broadside movements as well as with its red mane erected was totaled. Fish were also moved between tanks in order to create to aforementioned pairings. Next, we dyed one tank red and the other blue using 5 drops food coloring in each section of the tank. Then we followed the same protocol as above in order to see how to fish reacted to the red water, and then the same protocol in blue water resulting in nine total trials. After these trials, we looked at the data to see where the greatest differences could be observed, and found that the red male and blue male interactions in both red and blue water were unique. Using this, we performed two more replicates of the interaction in both red and blue water. Finally, the average and standard deviations of time spent in broadside as well as the time spent with the red mane erect were calculated. Following this, four two tailed, two sample T-tests were performed comparing the sample groups, depending on the behavior (broadside or red mane) and the color of the fish (red or blue). 



Results:
By measuring the number of seconds spent in broadside movements as well as red mane, the amount of aggression was quantified. Based on all the original trials we ran, we selected to look specifically at the aggressive interactions between a red male and a blue male in both red and blue dyed water. For both broadside movements and red mane presence, when the fish was in color that matched its own color, it was more aggressive than it was in dye that did not match. This pattern is visualized in Figure 1 for broadside movements. In Figure 2, the differences for red mane behaviors is visualized.  So red fish in red water spent on average 68 seconds in broadside as opposed to the when it was in blue water and only spent 27 seconds on average in broadside. The same is true for red manes for red fish, with an average of 108 seconds of erect red mane in red dye, as opposed to zero seconds in the blue dye. The blue fish followed a similar pattern. In blue dye, they spent an average of 139 seconds in broadside while only 115 seconds in red dye. For quantifying the red mane, the blue fish spent 192 seconds with it erect in the blue dye but only 92 seconds like this in red dye. After the data was recorded, four two sample two tailed T test was run to see if the results were significant. Between red fish in blue and red dye when measuring broadside movements, the p value was 0.324, red fish in blue and red water for red mane had a p value of 0.0003. For blue fish, in broadside in red and blue water the p value was 0.67, and for red mane between blue fish in red and blue water the p value was 0.081. Only red mane between red fish was statistically significant. So while the individual aggression was greater for red fish in red water than in blue water for both red mane and broadside movements, the blue fish were overall spent more time in broadside in both water colors than the red fish as shown in Figure 1. When it came to red mane, blue fish in blue water were much more aggressive than the red fish in blue water but in red water the red fish spent more time with red mane erect as shown in Figure 2. 


Discussion:
Based on the trials of red and blue fish in both red and blue water, our hypothesis was partially supported. Each fish was more aggressive in water color that matched the color of the fish, but that does not mean that it was the most aggressive fish. So this does not support the idea that it would be harder for the fish that did not match the water to detect the other fish because the blue fish still spent more time in broadside than the red fish did, even in red water. This could be complicated by the fact that the red fish spent more time with the red mane erect in the red water, suggesting that the red fish was still more aggressive because red mane is a higher level of aggression than broadside. Whether or not the fish was more aggressive with a male of a different coloration could not be completely determined due to the lack of repeated trials of red and red male interaction and blue and blue interactions. Previous research does suggest that color variation is one of the strongest reinforcers to aggressive behavior. So it is possible that the color of the water enhanced this affect usually solely attributed to the color of the other fish, but further experimentation would be needed to confirm this idea [Thompson: 1965].  Overall, the hypothesis was supported when comparing fish of the same color in the differing water colors, with more aggression shown in matching water. The hypothesis is not supported when aggression is compared between blue and red fish. This experiment had a few errors in how it was set up that complicate the interpretation of the results. Firstly, only select trials were repeated which makes making many comparisons not possible due to the lack of significance of data from only one trial. This is most especially problematic for the lack of repetition in the clear water trials between red and blue fish interactions. Having a control to compare the interactions in red and blue water to would have made the data much more sound. A lack of time contributed to the selection of very few trials to repeat. In addition, only using two red fish and two blue fish is a sample size that is too small. This is evident when the one red fish that was used in blue water never erected its red mane, which lead to the only statistically significant figure but that could be due to other factors than color of water. Because this fish never erected its red mane in all the trials it was used in, it is possible there was a physiological problem with the fish, and since there was no other red fish used in blue water it is not possible to know if this is how all red fish would act. Finally, there are too many variables that could cause the effects to really distinguish what is going on. It could be the color of the water causing the varied aggression, it could be the color of the fish triggering the aggression or with the small sample size it could have just been individual aggression of the singular fish is greater than the others. Moving forward to complete a more thorough examination of the effects of color on betta fish aggression an experiment with color varying only with color of the fish or only with color of the water would be better. Having water color changing and running repeated trials with the same colored fish could attribute differences to the water color. Running more trials in clear water with fish color changing could show that the aggression was based on fish color. These studies could have implication in how color cues effect behavior in the betta fish, but could also be expanded to understand visual processing effects on aggression and especially that related to mating.
