Title: Intraspecies aggressive behaviors of male Betta splendins under different level of opaqueness

Abstract:
Animals exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to various stimuli. This study looks at the intraspecies aggressive behaviors of male Betta splendins in different levels of opaqueness. Two male Betta were placed and separated by a glass divider in a glass aquarium. Three conditions were applied, clear glass (controll), glass covered by one layer of film and glass covered by two layers of film. Three trails of same intervals were conducted under each condition. The number of tail beating of one male Betta was counted. Paired t test was used to compare the number of tail beating between controll and each of the treatment groups. Our hypothesis that the aggressiveness of a male Betta decreases as opaqueness increases is supported. Through the study, we obtained a fundamental understanding of aggressive behaviors of male Betta. Decreased visibility or habituation can explain our observation. The later one requires further study. Other aggressive behaviors are worthy subjects in the future, since Betta exhibits various threat movements to different stimuli. We also understand the importance of studying animal behavior, since it helps us better understand how the natural world works on individuals and the interaction among individuals. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins is known as the Siamese fighting fish, which is a good model for animal behavior study since they have clear patterns of social interactions. These social interactions are associated with aggression, which is commonly observed in the male population. Male Betta fish exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to various stimuli, such as pigments, self-reflection and the presence of another male Betta fish. The last one is known as intraspecies aggressive behavior, or agnostic behavior. A previous study discovered that the aggressiveness among male Betta fish was maximized by another male, followed by a mirror image, a moving model, and a stationary model [Rhoad et al: 1975]. The aggressiveness of  a male Betta fish can be quantified by attack movements. Both the duration and count of movements can be used for quantification of aggressiveness [Bronstein: 1983]. Some common aggressive movements include broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic flickering, tail beating and tail flashing which is the change in tail color. Facing movements include pectoral fins erection, the spread of opercular and release of a red “mane” by protruding the branchiostegal membranes under the gill covers [Halperin & Dunham: 1997]. Our study quantified a male Betta’s aggressiveness by counting the number of tail beating. In our experiment, two male Betta fish were placed in a glass aquarium, separated by a glass divider. Three trials were conducted, with increased opaqueness. One male fish’s count of tail beating was recorded and compared among trails. The goal of this study is to observe a male Betta’s response to another male, with decreasing visibility to the opponent. A previous study on the correlation of visual perception and male Betta’s aggressiveness illustrates that artificial models of fine distribution of color and brightness provokes more aggressive behaviors from the Betta, than models of vague color and shape [Bando: 1991]. Our hypothesis states that the aggressiveness of a male Betta decreases as opaqueness increases, as the male Betta’s can not perceive the presence of the other male as its visibility to opponent decreases. 


Materials and Method:
Two male Betta fish were put into a glass aquarium, separated by a glass divider. The behavior of one male Betta was observed for 2 minutes. The number of tail beating was counted. A plastic divider was placed between the Bettas. The Bettas rested for three minutes.The steps were repeated for two measurements. Film layer was put on both sides of the glass divider. The steps were repeated for three measurements of same time intervals. A second film layer was put on the glass and the steps were repeated for three measurements of same intervals. The tail beating counts from trials performed under each condition were averaged. The condition of the clear glass was the controll group. A paired t test was conducted between each treatment group to the controll group. One tail p value was obtained and compared for difference in decrease. 


Results:
Results
The mean value of tail beating number under clear glass, one film layer and two film layers were 5, 2.33 and 0.33. The one tail p value between controll and one film layer treatment is 0.047 (one tail p value &lt; 0.05).There is significent decrease in tail beating number from controll group to one film layer group. The one tail p value between controll and two film layer treatment is 0.010 (one tail p value &lt; 0.05). There is significent decrease in tail beating number from controll group to two film layer group. Since the later p value is smaller, there is decrease in tail beating number from one film layer to two film layer treatment.  


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the aggressiveness of a male Betta decreases as opaqueness increases is supported, since the one tail p values illustrate the significance of decrease in tail beating number. One explanation to our observation is that the male Betta can not perceive the existence of another male after adding film layer to the glass. This explanation is supported by less tail beating in two film layer treatment than one film layer treatment. However, the decrease in tail beating can also be explained by habituation. Habituation is the waning in response after long time exposure to a stimulus. A previous study on Betta’s response to mirror image discovered that threat movements of Betta increased in the first few minutes of exposure to mirror, but decreased rapidly during the first 24 hours [Clayton & Hinde: 1968]. In our study, the other male Betta was exposed to our subject throughout the entire experiment. Though there was rest time, the Betta could still experience habituation and thus did not exhibit as many aggressive behaviors as in the last condition. In addition, aggressive behaviors other than tail beating are worth observing in the future. One example is lateral display. A previous study claims that adult male Betta showed consistency in their right or left eye use during threat lateral displays. The consistency can be explained by fixed action pattern in the presence of stimuli [Cantalupo et al: 1996]. The results in this study explain a pattern in a different threat behavior, the lateral display. It is important that we explore different aggressive behaviors of Betta in order to improve on our understanding of the behaviors and social interactions of this species. Studying animal behavior helps us understand the interactions between animals that exhibit social activities like us. Through learning and observing behaviors of animals, we will gain insights in how our natural world operates on individuals and how it keeps them at balance.

Figure 1: The number of tail beating by male Betta splendins under different conditions. Each tail lasted for two minutes, followed by 3 minute break. The bar graph shows the average of tail beating from three trails under different conditions. The experiment was conducted in the following order: clear glass, one frost layer and two frost layers. The standard deviation values for each condition following the order  is: +/-1, +/-1.15 and +/-0.58.*************************************************************************
