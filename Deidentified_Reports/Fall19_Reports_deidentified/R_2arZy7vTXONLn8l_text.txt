Title: Effect of Visibility on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta Fish

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to test the effect of visibility on agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins fish. We hypothesized that there would be a decrease in threat displays as visibility grew more obstructed between the Betta fish. Our results supported this claim illustrating that there was a decrease in the frequency of the broadside aggressive display of tail beating as visibility was lowered between the fish. The results imply that there is a correlation between agnostic behaviors and visual stimulation in Betta splendins. The study shows that there is a broader implication of the effect of visual cues in one’s environment and the threat behaviors that are displayed potentially through the release of stress induced pheromones. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins, a common fish originating from the Southeast Asian region, are well-known for their displays of intra- and interspecific agnostic behaviors used as visual communication during social interactions. The fish use both broadside and facing displays including tail beating, tail flashing, and pelvic fin flickering as threat behaviors towards other fish [Johnson: 2019]. These displays are noted to vary in both frequency and intensity depending on visual cues within their respective environments. Previous studies have been conducted on the greater topic of visual cues in aggressive behaviors in Betta splendins dealing with variances in color and size of opposing fish [Bando: 1991]. What we aim to examine in this study is the effect of visibility on the frequency of agnostic displays as a variance in the Betta splendins’ environment. Due to the fact that the Betta fish exhibit territorial behavior only if the benefits outweighs the costs associated including energy usage, we can use changes in visibility to discern if there is a correlated increase or decrease in threat behaviors as visual cues are altered through obstructing visibility [Alyan: 2010]. As one of the most identifiable broadside displays, we used the frequency of tail beating to quantify any changes in agnostic behaviors as we decrease visibility between our two sample Betta fish. We hypothesize that as the visibility between the two Betta fish is decreased, that the frequency of exhibiting agnostic behaviors will also decrease.


Materials and Method:
Two betta splendins fish of similar color and size were places in adjacent tanks with an opaque barrier between them so there was zero visibility between the fish We then exposed the fish for two minutes with a completely transparent glass plate between them, and recorded the number of tail beatings with full visibility as our controll. We repeated this trial two more times allowing the Betta splendins to rest for five minutes between exposures to minimize injuries from stress. We then exposed the fish for two minutes with a translucent glass barrier with one level of frosting and recorded the number of tail beatings. After the rest period, we repeated this trial two more times with 5 minute breaks in between exposures. We then allowed for another 5 minutes of rest, and exposed the fish for another two minutes using a glass barrier with two levels of frosting while we recorded the frequency of tail beatings. We repeated this trial twice more with intervals for rest. We took the average tail beatings of the three trials in each visibility environment and analyzed the data with a one-tailed paired t_test.


Results:
Both conditions of obstructed visibility produced a lower frequency of tail beatings then the controll trials with full visibility. The average number of tail beatings with the one layer of frost was 2.33 and the average number with two layers of frost was 0.33 compared to the greater average frequency of tail beatings in our full visibility controll group that was 5. The difference between the controll and the experimental group with one layer of frost was significent (tstat= 3.024, d.f.=2, p=0.0471). There was a greater difference in the average number of tail beatings between controll and the experimental trail with two layers of frost, which also proved to be a significent difference (tstat= 7, d.f.=2, p=0.0471).


Discussion:
The results of our experiment supported our hypothesis that predicted that there would be a lower frequency of tail beatings in environments with lower visibility. Our findings were conducive with other studies conducted showing that there is a correlation between visual ques and agnostic displays in Betta splendins. These studies attribute the variances in threat behaviors to the corresponding release of pheromones that relate to visual cues in the Betta’s environment [Meliska: 1980]. The release of these pheromones has been shown to increase the stressors that manifest themselves within the Betta splendins as agnostic displays. Other studies in which Betta splendins were given serotonin supplements to decrease pheromone release also showed to decreased threat behaviors [Lynn: 2007]. By obstructing the view between the two fish, the differences in frequency of tail beatings could be attributed to lower levels of visual stimulation that release the pheromones that prompt the threat behaviors from Betta splendins. This study in ethology supports previously stated claims that decreased levels of visual stimulation provoke less frequency of agnostic behaviors. What needs to be considered in this study is the factor of habituation in Beta splendins. Other studies have shown that prolonged exposure of Betta fish with each other can also affect the frequency of threat behaviors between two fish [Rhoad: 1975]. Habituation is shown to lead to a waning of aggressive behaviors in which over time the Betta fish learn to avoid each other and preserve the energy associated with agnostic displays. Given that in this experiment, we conducted the trials consecutively and non-randomized, habituation could be a confounding variable in our results. As we conducted our trials from order to greatest visibility to least visibility, the decrease in threat behaviors may be attributed to habituation over the duration of our experiment.  Another experiment should be conducted with randomized trials to ensure that our results are attributed solely to varying visibility and not habituation between the samples. These findings are important to better understand how evolution has created mechanisms in animals that link aggressive behaviors to visual stimulation. This could be analyzed in other animals including humans. It remains to be important to examine visibility and visual stimulation’s effect on agnostic behaviors.

Figure 1: Average Tail Beatings in Betta splendins with Variations in Visibility
Figure 1 illustrates the difference in frequency of tail beatings in Betta spelndens fish between trials with full visibility as our controll and two increasing degrees of translucent obstruction, Frost 1 and Frost 2. The standard deviation for the controll group was 1.000, while the standard deviation for Frost 1 was 1.155 and for Frost 2 was 0.577.
