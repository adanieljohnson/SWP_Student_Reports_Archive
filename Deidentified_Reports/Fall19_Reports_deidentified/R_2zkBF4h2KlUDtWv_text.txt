Title: Agonistic Behaviors of Betta Splendins Based on Shape and Color

Abstract:
Animal behaviors are used by animals in an attempt to react to their environment and give themselves a better chance of survival, or an overall better fitness. These behaviors can be broken down into a specific natural stimulus and then into individual characteristics of that stimulus. In this lab we examined the agnostic behaviors elicited by male Betta Splendins in the presence of another male and broke down the stimulus into two characteristics, shape and color. Three males were tested being shown a live male as a controll and then two sets of cutouts in different shapes, a beta shaped cutout and a circle cutout, each with one red and one blue version. For each test the rate of habituation was recorded, and the averages were compared in a one-way ANOVA test. The test proved to have a statistically significent difference (P=0.00027) between the live beta and the cutouts, but no significent difference between the cutouts. However, based on observational data there was a clear difference between the shape of the cutouts as the beta cutout elicited short cycles of aggression and habituation while the circles elicited no response.

Introduction:
For this experiment we were interested in understanding how the rate of habituation of Betta Splendins is influenced by different stimuli. By looking at this we can gain a deeper understanding of animal behaviors and what trigger them. The study of animal behaviors, or ethology, can be used to determine factors that promote certain behaviors and observe how these behaviors better or worsen one’s chance for survival or overall fitness. These behaviors are then able to be linked back to a stimulus that is responsible for causing said behavior. [“Intro to animal behavior”: n.d.] In this lab we will be looking at a specific agnostic behavior in Betta Splendins that occurs when a male Betta Splendins sees another male. These fish react aggressively to the sight of another male and even more aggressively to the aggressive signs of another male such as a red flap under the Betta Splendins’s gill. [Elcoro: 2008] By understanding the signals of this behavior, the cause of such a behavior can be tested and broken down from the natural stimulus (the other male beta) to specific characteristics. For this lab the other male will be broken down into two characteristics, shape and color. Some animals respond more intensely to a certain shapes or colors. For example, European Robins react intensely to the color red that other males exhibit but are also responsive to the color red in general as a result of this natural behavior. [Bouglouan: n.d.] In this case however, we hypothesize that the shape of the cutouts will elicit a greater level of agnostic behavior and a longer rate of habituation than that of the color.

Materials and Method:
First three Betta Splendins were gathered and put into side-by-side tanks with the one in the middle serving as the controll. Each tank is divided from the others by an opaque divider that is lifted to expose each beta in the middle one at a time. Each fish is exposed to another male for 5 minutes and their rate and duration of habituation is recorded. After each exposure the beta are rested for 5 minutes. Next, the beta cutouts were shown each beta for 5 minutes each with rate and duration of habituation still being recorded. The fish were left to rest for 5 minutes before and after trials. After the beta cutouts, the circle cutouts were then shown to each beta for 5 minutes with rate and duration of habituation recorded. The betas were left to rest for 5 minutes in between the trials. The results of each beta were then averaged by method and then tested by a one-way ANOVA test to determine statistical significance.

Results:
The average time of habituation for the different method of agitation was 32.1 seconds for the Red Beta, 0 seconds for the Red Circle, 39.6 seconds for the Blue Beta, 0 seconds for the Blue Circle, and 233.4 seconds for the Live Beta. Under a one-way ANOVA test there was a significent difference in the rates of habituation between the five method of agitation. Further testing shows that there was a significent difference between the Live Beta and the other four method. There was no significent difference was indicated between the other four method. Observational data showed that the Live Beta tests remained unhabituated through the end of the 5-minute testing period, the Beta Cutouts elicited shorter cycles of aggression and habituation, and the Circle Cutouts produced no agnostic response from any of the three betas.

Discussion:
The data gathered in this experiment shows that there is statistical significance between the five method of agitation. However, further testing showed that the only statistically different data was the controll, the live beta, and that there was no statistical difference between the four method that were being tested. These results disprove our hypothesis that the shape of the cutouts would have a greater impact on the time of habituation of the Betta Splendins than the color because there was no significent difference. However, based on observational data we can conclude that there was a significent difference between the time of habituation for that of the beta cutouts and the circle cutouts. The beta cutouts showed to still agitate the fish, but the fish were quick to habituate and would go in cycles of showing aggression and then habituation throughout the 5-minute testing time. In contrast the fish did not react at all to the presence of either of the circle cutout. Though not statistically significent, this observational data proves the hypothesis that the shape of a cutout would elicit a greater agnostic response from the betas than that of the colored cutouts as there was no difference between colors. Based on previous experiments run on the agnostic behaviors of Betta Splendins these results are consistent with that has been shown to occur and if the live beta was allowed to run for longer it would have shown cycles similar to the beta cutout but in long durations. [Peeke: 1970, Baenninger: 1966] These results allow us to conclude that the cutout of the beta male elicits a similar response to that of the live beta, but at a smaller intensity.
	The observational data recorded in these experiments could have been significently statistically supported if more trials had been run and more data was taken. Also, data collection could have been improved if the Betta Splendins were allowed to be tested for longer periods of time and the cycle of habituation could be observed more clearly, as well as being able to see a time of habituation on the controll as it remained unhabituated through the 5-miunute time allowed. [Baenninger: 1966] However, these fish are very susceptible to becoming overstressed and having health problems or dying, making longer sampling times unrealistic. [Peeke: 1970]
	The results from these experiments can serve to help explain how Betta Splendins perceive the world around them and what specifically it is about that world that produces certain behaviors. The observational results from this lab show that the betas to respond to the shape of another Betta Splendins more than that of the color that the other male may possess. This information can help guide other studies done on any other various animal behaviors that attempt to break down an animal behavior to a specific characteristic in the natural stimulus. By doing this a greater understanding can be reached about what specifically influences these animals to behave the way that they do, and then lead to a deeper understanding how their role in their ecosystems and how they, or other animals have adapted to that behavior it ultimately increase their survivability or overall fitness.
