Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Instars

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
This lab will be examining the effects of hormones on insect growth and maturation. Hormones play a large role in the growth and development of insects from the larvae stage to adulthood [Williams: 1961]. Understanding the effect hormones have on insect development is important because then this knowledge can be used to make more effective pesticides to increase crop production. Conversely, the knowledge of hormone effects on insects could also be used to ban chemicals in products that imitate insect hormones unintentionally, having detrimental effects on ecosystems. This study will examine how hormones affect the growth of Manduca sexta in their larval stage.  Manduca sexta is a breed of moth found commonly in North America; they are regarded as pests because they eat crops [Orozco-Cardenas: 1993]. They are a good model organism because they are common and grow quickly, but are small enough to keep in a lab. Juvenile Hormone, or JH, effects the instars transition to pupa and therefore the complete metamorphosis [Williams: 1961]. A decline of JH production by the corpus allata is required for pupation to occur [Nijhout: 1974]. JH levels drop in instars as they reach pupation, and then disappear entirely [Kiguchi: 1978]. Methoprene is a JH analog [Satyanrayana: 1994].  In this lab, the effects of excessive JH on Manduca sexta instars will be tested. If Manduca sexta are treated with 10 drops of JH analog, Methoprene, in their food, then there will be a negative effect on their transition to the pupal stage and they will gain less weight.

Materials and Methods:
Our independent variable for this study is the presence of Methoprene, a synthetic JH, in the experimental group’s food. To track its effects, the caterpillars were weighed daily. Controls for this experiment were the amount of food given, 10 g, the size of the container, and location in an incubator. To begin the experiment, we randomly selected four control and four experimental caterpillars from a communal supply. The caterpillars were weighed and assigned to their designated box. Next, the food was prepared, 10 g of caterpillar food for each caterpillar. The control had 10 drops of water mixed with their food and the experimental has 10 drops of Methoprene (1:1250). For the next 14 days, the caterpillars were weighed daily, containers cleaned of poop, and were given food when food seemed dry or gone.  At the end of data collection, the total growth of each caterpillar was calculated, and an average was derived for the growth of the control and experimental group. A two sample T-test with an alpha value of 0.05 was then run to determine the probability the difference was due to chance or significant.

Results:
Over the course of the experiment none of the caterpillars died and they all continued to eat and grow. Some color changes were noted: they all started as a blue-green and then turned greener, while a few developed a frosted white exterior around day 7. By the end of the stud, all the experimentals and control 3 had developed the frosted white coloration. During the last four days of the study all the controls and experimentals 2 and 3 consumed all 10 grams of their food within one day. 
The total weight changes for each caterpillar were calculated and then the total weight change for each group was averaged. The control group had an average total weight change of 14.1g with a standard deviation of 0.66. The experimental group had an average total weight change of 13.1g with a standard deviation of 1.52. These results are shown in figure 1. To test if the difference in average growth for the groups was due to change a T-test was used. The one-tailed p-value was 0.171. This shows that our difference was not more than 95% significant.  Figure 2 shows the weight of the caterpillars in a regression of time. Figure 2 shows a trend of the experimental caterpillars growing less than the control group during days 7 to 11. At the end of the study, all the caterpillars had increased in weight by 13.3 to 14.9 grams, except for experimental 4 which grew 10.9 grams. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis JH in the food will make the caterpillars gain less weight and have an overall negative effect on pupation was not supported by the data. The data did show a difference in the average weight between the two groups but this difference was not significant, therefore the alternative hypothesis was rejected and the null hypothesis was accepted. The average weight changes not being significantly different could be because the role of JH is to delay pupation but to not disrupt growth [Kiguchi: 1978]. In the final feeding stage before pupation JH is present to delay pupation for two days, therefore allowing for more growth [Kiguchi: 1978]. 
Due to the difference between the groups being insignificant, there is a high possibility the difference was due to chance. A possible factor that affected the results was the length of the study was too short for the hypothesized result to occur. This study was not long enough for the instar to pupate. A previous study found the deadly effect of Methoprene did not significantly affect Manduca sextas until they were in the pupation stage [Satyanarayana: 1994]. This study found Methoprene did not delay the instars transition to pupation, but did cause them to die during the second pupal molt [Satyanarayana: 1994]. None of the caterpillars in our study reached pupation; had this occurred the difference in development between groups could have been significant. 
Although the averages in weight gain did not show a significant difference, the line graph tracking each caterpillars’ growth over the two weeks shows the experimental group had a larger weight gap with the control group around days 7 to 11, only after catching up more. Naturally the corpus allata stops secreting JH once the larvae weigh around 5g [Nijhout: 1974]. This would have happened on days 8 through 12 for our caterpillars. This 5g threshold for the decreased production of JH could be the reason why the control group grew faster around when their JH levels dropped off. The reason for the experimental catching back up is possibly due to the control group not having enough food to eat to sustain their growth. The time period where the experimental group catches back up is around when the control group began finishing their 10g of food every day. 
If this study were to be replicated, the study should provide the caterpillars enough time to pupate and transition to adulthood so the full effects of Methoprene on insect development could be observed. In the larvae stage the caterpillars should also have sufficient amount of food to eat so their growth is not hindered by resources.  The effects of hormones on insect development is relatively universal [Williams. 1961]. Studying these effects can aid in understanding the way chemicals will affect insect populations in situations meant to limit or protect them. Despite most people regarding insects as pests, their existence is essential in certain ecosystems as a primary food source.  In conclusion, studying insect hormones can be an effective way to control harmful insect populations from destroying crops or protecting insect populations for harmful chemicals.
