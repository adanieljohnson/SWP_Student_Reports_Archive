Title: Inhibiting Effect of 20E Hormone Blocker on Manduca sexta Larvae Growth

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that can be considered a pest to certain growing crops. One way to treat these pests is to figure out what hormones or hormone blockers can be used as a pesticide. Like other insects, the hornworm uses hormones to regulate growth and development throughout its life cycle (including the egg, 5 instar larva stages, pupa, and adult stages) [Johnson: 2016]. The hornworm is a good model organism because of the ease in handling due to their relatively large size and short life cycle. Two hormones of interest that are important for the hornworm development are the juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). Both JH and 20E are needed in development, and the effect of these hormones are based on their absolute concentrations, concentration ratios, and developmental stages of the hornworm. Usually, JH remains high until the 4th instar larva, when it starts the drop and there is a rise in 20E. From the 5th instar larva to adult, JH remains low and 20E rises and falls [Johnson: 2016].  For this experiment, we aim to study the effect of the 20E hormone in the development of the hornworms. We will be blocking this hormone and measuring the larvae mass throughout development. Past research has shown that 20E hormone is important for cuticle formation and molting through different larval stages [Truman: 1974]. Therefore, we predict that blocking 20E hormone should cause disruption in the growth of larvae and we should see a difference in growth rates. The null hypothesis is that blocking the 20E hormone has no effect on hornworm mass growth rate in the larval stage. The alternative hypothesis is that blocking the 20E hormone has an effect on the hornworm mass growth rate in the larval stage.

Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we acquired 8 hornworms at a young larval stage. We divided them into two groups, 4 in controll and 4 in experimental. All of the hornworms were fed premade hornworm food from Great Lakes Hornworm. The hornworm larvae and their food were kept inside plastic containers with holes punched on the sides for air. The containers were divided into four chambers, in which one hornworm lived in each chamber. There were two containers, one controll and one experimental. In the controll group, each hornworm was fed 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water. In the experimental group, each hornworm was fed 10 grams of food with 10 drops of 20E hormone blocker called AzaGuard (1: 1250). Food was replaced when old food was no longer moist by touch. Everyday for 14 days, we measured and recorded the mass of each larva. We used a two-tailed two-sample t_test to compare the mass growth rate between the controll and experimental groups, and compared whether there was a significent difference between the two rates.

Results:
By visual observation, the controll group larvae seem to continuously grow larger throughout 14 days, while the experimental group did not seem to grow in size. One or two experimental larvae died about 2 days after replacing the 20E blocker food. For data analysis, we used data up to Day 9, with 3 controll larvae alive and 2 experimental larvae alive. Figure 1 graphs the mean weight of hornworms each day for both the controll and experimental groups. For the experimental group, the visual trends show that the larvae weight did not fluctuate much and generally stayed the same throughout the 9 days. For the controll group, Figure 1 visually shows the general increase in larvae weight throughout 9 days. From the average mass each day, we calculated average growth of the groups per day. Figure 2 is a visual representation of the mean growth rate per day for the controll and experimental groups. The figure shows the higher growth rate of about 0.13696 g/day for controll group, and low growth rate of about 0.00024 g/day for the experimental group. Using a two-tailed two-sample t_test to compare the difference in these two growth rates, we found that the p_value is 0.020926.

Discussion:
The results of the experiments supported our hypothesis that blocking the 20E hormone will cause disruption in the growth of larvae and that there is a difference in growth rates. We reject the null hypothesis and support the alternative hypothesis that blocking the 20E hormone has an effect on the hornworm growth. Not only does the 20E blocker inhibits growth of larvae, a certain amount will eventually kill them. Figure 1 shows that the larvae treated with 20E hormone blocker did not seem to grow when compared to the controll group. This means that the blocker is correlated with growth inhibition. Figure 2 shows that the difference in average growth rates of the experimental and controll groups is statistically significent (low p_value of 0.020926). Again, this supports the hypothesis that blocking 20E hormone has an effect on growth of hornworm larvae. This experiment supports data from the past study earlier referenced, which states that the 20E hormone is an important growth hormone needed for proper development throughout the larval stages [Truman: 1974]. Blocking the 20E hormone seems to prevent the larvae from molting through the larval stages. The significance of this finding can be used in understanding what hormones can be manipulated to make effective pesticides. This experiment is evidence that 20E hormone blocker can be an effective pesticide to inhibit growth or kill hornworm larvae. Future studies can investigate the concentrations needed for 20E blocker to be effective or at what stage the blocker is most effective in killing or inhibiting growth.

Observing the data trends visually shows that average mass of experimental group treated with 20E hormone blocker did not fluctuate much throughout 9 days, while controll group mass continuously increased as they grew in size.
