Title: Treating Manduca sexta caterpillars with Precor, an insect growth regulator, shows no significent difference in growth 

Abstract:
Physiological characteristics, such as growth and development in insects, is regulated by a series of hormones. Insect growth regulators can affect the growth of insects by either inhibiting or mimicking the juvenile hormone, a major hormone involved in insect molting. In this experiment, we tested the effect of Precor, an insect juvenile mimic, on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars during a span of two weeks. The weights of the caterpillars in the controll and experimental group were recorded for 15 days. We hypothesized that the caterpillars given Precor will have delayed development in their life cycle and pupate at a slower rate. However, our calculated p_value (0.24&gt;0.05) indicates that our null hypothesis is accepted. There is no significent statistical difference between the controll and experimental group.  The results were unexpected but may be explained in factors such as the amount of Precor used and length of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) helps in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, tobacco hornworms. JH ensures growth at the larval and pupal stage before transformation, preventing metamorphosis. After a certain number of larval stages, the amount of JH in the caterpillars decreases, and therefore allows the caterpillar to become a moth. In this experiment, we will add 5 drops of Precor, an insect growth regulator and mimic of the juvenile hormone, to the experimental group’s food.  Insect growth regulators such as Precor can be synthetically made to affect insect process such as growth and development.  This affects the levels of JH and other hormones in insects [Tunaz: 2004]. We hypothesized that the caterpillars given precor will have a delay in growth thus resulting in a lower average weight per day. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided into two groups. Four received normal food with 5 drops of water (the controll group). The other four received 5 drops of precor in their food (experimental group).  Each group was placed in a container divided into 4 cells (8 cells in all), and holes were punched on the sides. After punching holes, one caterpillar was placed in each cell of the container and then the containers were put in an incubator. The weights of all the caterpillars in grams was recorded for fifteen consecutive days. Weights were recorded in order to see if there is a difference in growth in the controll and experimental group. The weights (grams) would allow us to determine if JH levels were higher in one group over another thus resulting in a greater average weight. A 2-sample t_test was used to determine if there is a statistically significent difference between the weights of the caterpillars in the controll and the treatment group. 



Results:
We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. We obtained a p_value of 0.245, which is higher than the alpha p_value of 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis stating there is no statistical significance in the weight of the experimental and controll group. According to the line graph, the average weight of the controll group was lower day 14 and 15. This can be attributed to a lower level of JH in the controll group causing them to pupate and lose weight. However, for 11 of the 15 days this experiment was conducted, there wasn’t a significent difference in the average weights. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis which stated that the group of caterpillars given precor will grow at a slower rate than the controll group, was not supported, the p_value was higher than 0.05. This suggests that the IGR had little effect on JH, and in effect, on the growth of tobacco hornworms. We only added five drops of precor per 10 grams of food. A larger amount of precor might have a larger effect on the growth of the caterpillars.  A previously conducted experiment similar to ours tested the effect of the dosage of azadirachtin, a growth inhibitor, on the hormone levels and growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars.  The conclusion of the study was that a low dosage of azadirachtin caused the caterpillars had a slight effect on the caterpillars, causing them to pupate as they normally would. A high dosage resulted to be fatal and inhibited growth [Schluter: 1985]. If our experiment is repeated in the future, it would be advisable to increase the dosage of precor in order to see if there is an obtainable difference in results.
