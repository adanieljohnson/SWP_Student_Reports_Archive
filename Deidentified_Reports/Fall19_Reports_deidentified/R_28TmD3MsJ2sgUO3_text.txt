Title: Treating Manduca Sexta caterpillars with Precor, an insect growth regulator, shows no significent difference in growth    

Abstract:
Physiological characteristics, such as growth and development in insects, is regulated by a series of hormones. Insect growth regulators can affect the growth of insects by either inhibiting or mimicking the juvenile hormone, a major hormone involved in insect molting. In this experiment, we tested the effect of Precor, an insect juvenile mimic, on the growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars during a span of two weeks. The weights of the caterpillars in the controll and experimental group were recorded for 15 days. We hypothesized that the caterpillars given Precor will have delayed development in their life cycle and pupate at a slower rate. However, our calculated p value (0.24&gt;0.05) indicates that our null hypothesis is accepted. There is no significent statistical difference between the controll and experimental group.  The results were unexpected but may be explained in factors such as the amount of precor used, length of the experiment, and outliers in data. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the impact of juvenile hormone levels in the Manduca Sexta and the effect that juvenile hormone levels have on the insect’s growth rate. Juvenile Hormone (JH) helps in the development of Manduca Sexta caterpillars, tobacco hornworms. JH ensures growth at the larval and pupal stage before transformation, preventing metamorphosis. After a certain number of larval stages, the amount of JH in the caterpillars decreases, and therefore allows the caterpillar to become a moth [Johnson: 2019]. The Manduca Sexta is an ideal model for hormonal effect on the growth rate because the insect’s hormones have been widely studied and hormone levels within the insect are relatively easily raised or lowered [Hatem:2015]. We will add 5 drops of Precor, an insect growth regulator and mimic of the juvenile hormone, to the experimental group’s food. Insect growth regulators such as Precor can be synthetically made to affect insect process such as growth and development.  This affects the levels of JH and other hormones in insects [Tunaz: 2004].  How do juvenile hormone levels affect the growth rate of the caterpillar? Would the lack of a juvenile hormone prevent the caterpillar from undergoing pupation? These questions could help determine the importance of hormones during insect growth. Our experiment attempts to determine the role the juvenile hormone (precor) plays in Manduca Sexta growth rate.  We hypothesized that the caterpillars given Precor will have a delay in growth thus resulting in a lower average weight per day.    
 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided into two groups of four caterpillars each. Both groups were placed in plastic containers with one caterpillar in each compartment of the container. Two small holes were punched on the side of each compartment. The two groups received the same diet of caterpillar food. 10 grams of food was placed in each compartment of both containers. The controll group received food with 5 drops of water added. The experimental group received the same caterpillar food but with 5 drops of the juvenile hormone, precor, added. All 8 caterpillars were kept in the same environment with temperature and oxygen levels being the same for each of the 8 caterpillars. The containers were placed in an incubator and took out to be weighed on a standard lab balance every day for two weeks and observations were recorded on the caterpillar’s appearance each day. 
Weights were recorded in order to see if there is a difference in growth in the controll and experimental group.  A two-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine the difference in growth rate of the caterpillars that received 5 drops of water (the controll) compared to the group of caterpillars that received 5 drops of precor (the experimental).  


Results:
We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. The average growth rate of the controll group was not statistically significently different from the average growth rate of the experimental group (t_stat= 0.699, d.f.=28, p=0.245). The experimental group appeared upon observation to be noticeably heavier after day 11. C4 in the controll group appeared to be bigger than the other caterpillars in the controll group throughout the experiment until the last two days, while C4 in the experimental group was observed to be smaller than the other caterpillars day 13,14, and 15.  The caterpillars showed a more observable difference in weight after day 11. The mean growth for the controll caterpillars was 5.10 grams while the mean growth for the experimental caterpillars was 6.45 grams. The standard deviation of the average growth rate per day of the controll group is 4.496 while the standard deviation for the experimental group is 5.646. This is a relatively high standard deviation. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis which stated that the group of caterpillars given precor will grow at a slower rate than the controll group, was not supported, the p_value was higher than 0.05. We observed no significent difference between the growth of the controll group and the growth rate of the experimental group, which suggests the juvenile hormone (precor) has no effect on growth rate.  It is possible that the dosage of precor was too low to have an effect on growth rate. We only added five drops of precor per 10 grams of food. A larger amount of precor might have a larger effect on the growth of the caterpillars. A previously conducted experiment similar to ours tested the effect of the dosage of azadirachtin, a growth inhibitor, on the hormone levels and growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The conclusion of the study was that a low dosage of azadirachtin had a slight effect on the caterpillars, causing them to pupate as they normally would. A high dosage resulted to be fatal and inhibited growth [Schluter: 1985]. If our experiment is repeated in the future, it would be advisable to increase the dosage of precor in order to see if there is an obtainable difference in results. The relatively high standard deviation suggests there was a source of error in our experiment. C4 appeared to be bigger in the controll group while C4 in the experimental group was smaller the last three days of the experiment. Another explanation could have been potential cross-contamination between the controll and experimental groups when food was prepared. The procedure could be repeated to determine if the decreased growth rate of C4 in the experimental group or higher weight of C4 in the controll group affected results. The juvenile hormone’s role in Manduca Sexta growth demonstrates the influence of hormones on growth rate and development.
