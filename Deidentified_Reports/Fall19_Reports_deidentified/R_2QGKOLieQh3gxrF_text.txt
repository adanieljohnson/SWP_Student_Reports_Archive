Title: An Analysis of the Effects of Different Potting Environments on the Root to Shoot Ratios of Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
The effects of different potting environments on Raphanus sativus growth was examined in order to investigate resource partitioning between roots and shoots. Fifteen radish seeds were planted in three different environments: soil, clay, and pebbles, and were placed in a greenhouse and watered each day for two weeks. It was hypothesized that the radishes growing in the soil would have the smallest root to shoot ratio because of their large access to resources in the roots and the resulting aim to grow up more through the shoots. The soil instead had the largest average root to shoot ratios for both weight and length while clay had the smallest averages for both root to shoot ratios. The hypothesis that nutrient availability would cause the radishes growing in soil to have the largest root to shoot ratio was not supported, however, it was determined that other factors such as soil density did impact the results. An ANOVA test run between the groups determined that there was a statistical difference between the groups.


Introduction:
In nature, plants of all species must determine how to allocate their resources depending on the environment in which they exist. Measuring a plant’s root to shoot ratio, or how many resources are being put into the leafy part of the plant above ground versus the roots growing below the ground, can give insight into what type of environment a plant is growing in and how the plant has grown and developed in order to adapt to certain resources that may be limited [Johnson: 2019]. Calculating a plant’s root to shoot ratio is also important in analytically assessing resource competition [Reynolds: 1993]. Raphanus sativus, root vegetables known as radishes are the perfect species to examine in order to gain more understanding about resource allocation in plants because they grow quickly and are responsive to their environment. Radishes do not need much care to grow and develop, but they are sensitive to water stress. Both a lack of water as well as an overabundance of water will produce a lower yield of plants [Wan: 2005]. The type and density of the soil that the radishes are planted in can also affect how the grow and where they decide to invest more resources, the roots or shoots [Wan: 2005]. In this experiment, radish seeds were planted in three different environments: soil, clay, and pebbles to assess what conditions allow the plant to grow the most, or have the highest root to shoot ratio after a two week period. We hypothesize that the plants growing in the soil will have the lowest root to shoot ratio because they will have access to plenty of nutrients in the soil and will therefore allocate most of their resources to their shoots instead. On the other hand, the pebbles followed by the clay will have the highest root to shoot ratios because they will not have as much access to rich nutrients and will therefore have to allocate a lot of resources into the roots in order to reach any nutrients that are available.

Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, fifteen pots were collected and filled with a variety of three different materials: soil, clay, and pebbles. There were five pots for each of the potting materials, and three Raphinus sativus, or radish seeds were planted in each pot. The pots were soaked with water and allowed to drain before being placed in the greenhouse. For two weeks, the plants were kept in the greenhouse and watered once a day. At the end of the two weeks, five radishes from each of the three experimental groups were harvested. The plants were gently washed to remove any material from the roots and pat dry. Each of the plants were weighed and the length was measured and this data was recorded. Finally, the plants were cut at the root-shoot junction and each root and shoot was weighed and measured and the data was recorded. The root-shoot ratios were calculated and this data was analyzed by taking the means and standard deviations for each experimental group. Finally, a one-way ANOVA was used to compare the means of the three groups and determine whether or not they were statistically different. 


Results:
The soil group had the greatest root to shoot ratios for both weight and length, 0.23(±0.19) and 1.56(±0.31), respectively (Table 1). The radishes grown in clay had the lowest root to shoot ratio for weight, 0.035(±0.023), and also for length, 0.34(±0.07). Finally, the plants grown in pebbles had a root to shoot ratio for weight of 0.67(±0.14) and of 1.0(±0.77) for length (see Table 1). A one-way ANOVA test was used to determine whether the three experimental groups were different from each other. There was a significant difference (P=0.011) in the mean root to shoot ratio for weight between the three groups (see Figure 1). Further tests indicated that the soil group had a significantly greater root to shoot ratio than the other groups and no significant difference was indicated between any of the other sections. There was also a significant difference (P=0.0031) in the mean root to shoot ratio for length between the groups (see Figure 2). Once again, the soil group had a significantly greater mean root to shoot ratio for length than the other groups, and no significant difference was indicated between the other sections.


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the radishes growing in the soil would have the smallest root to shoot ratio because they had plenty of access to nutrients in the soil and therefore might have allocated more resources to growing up through the shoots than growing out the roots. However, the results indicate that the group of radishes that grew in the soil environment had the largest average root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. The radishes grown in pebbles were in the middle, and the radishes grown in clay had the lowest average root to shoot ratios for both weight and height. The data does not support the hypothesis. In retrospect, there was not much reason to assume that one type of potting environment would have a higher nutrient availability over another. Therefore, these varying root to shoot ratios must have been caused by other factors. According to a 2016 article in Annals of Botany, “Root soil penetration and path optimization…” are necessary components to successful root development [Popova: 2016]. If the radish plants were unable to easily penetrate the material in which they were planted, they would not be able to grow and develop properly. Roots are a key factor in survival of the radish because of their ability to anchor the plant and forage for nutrients and water [Popova: 2016]. The radishes grown in the clay environment had the lowest root to shoot ratio over soil and pebbles, which may have been due to its roots being unable to penetrate the high density clay. Although the pebbles, on the other hand, were the least dense material, the root to shoot ratios of these radishes were still much smaller than that of the radishes grown in soil. Radishes that were planted in pebbles should hypothetically be able to easily extend their roots down through the porous environment, but some evolutionary dis-advantage kept them from doing so. It is possible that growing in this type of porous environment would cause the radishes to be at risk of being removed from the pebble environment too easily by a predator or other environmental factors. Meanwhile, the soil environment seemed to be of an optimal density for root growth and development over the course of two weeks as these radishes had the highest root to shoot ratios. An error that occurred in this experiment was an inconsistency in watering the plants. Although all of the plants were meant to be watered every day for two weeks, there were three days when the plants were not watered at all. Without enough water to keep the environment moist, the plants may have had trouble growing as efficiently as possible [Wan: 2005]. Being aware of these environmental impacts on plants is very important in planting crops and having a successful harvest. If the soil is too dense and compacted because it has been a dry season, for example, it would helpful to use proper tilling methods to turn over the soil so the roots are better able to push down through it [Unger: 1994]. This technique of turning over the soil could have been especially effective in the growth of the radish roots in the clay pots which were extremely dense and compacted. If this experiment were to be redone, planting more radish seeds in each individual pot in the beginning of the experiment may also prove useful in getting more accurate results. Only three seeds were planted in each pot and while there were enough individual plants to collect data, the experiment would be more reliable if a larger group of individual plants were tested.
