Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Weight and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, also known as the Tobacco hornworm, is an insect of the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all other butterflies, moths, and skippers [Johnson: 2019].  Tobacco Hornworms are ideal organisms for this experiment due to their relatively short timings of molts between larval stages before reaching adulthood.  The organisms are also inexpensive and practical for lab use.  The Manduca Sexta contains three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone (E20), and Juvenile hormone.  The E20 determines the timing of the molt, while the juvenile hormone determines the type of molt the Manduca Sexta undergoes [Johnson: 2019].  These are the two hormones focused on in the experiment.   In the larval stages before the Manduca Sexta reaches the pupal stage, the levels of juvenile hormone significently decrease as development progresses [Kiguchi: 1978].  This is primarily because there is consistent E20 levels throughout all the stages to allow the Manduca Sexta to develop into a pupa.
The purpose of this lab is to determine how hormone changes in the Manduca Sexta affects its growth rate and reproductive cycle.  The effects of the juvenile hormone are being examined on the development and weight of the hornworms.  The hypothesis in question is whether or not adding more juvenile hormone to the food of the hornworms will accelerate the average life cycle, therefore the average mass of the Manduca Sexta with the hormone compared to the controll group.  It is hypothesized that adding more Juvenile Hormone (precor) will accelerate the average life cycle, therefore increase the average mass of the Manduca Sexta treated with the hormone compared to the controll group.


Materials and Method:
Two containers with perforated lids and four wells each were obtained, with each container housing two controll group and two treatment group hornworms.  Ten grams of food for each well were weighed.  Five drops of deionized water were placed into two wells in each box with a transfer pipet for the food for the controll group.  The food was mixed well and clumped into the corner of the well for the hornworm to eat.  A new transfer pipet was used to place five drops of the reagent, juvenile hormone, in the remaining two wells in each box.  The food was mixed well and clumped into the corner of the well for the hornworm to eat.  Eight hornworms were obtained, weighed, and placed into each well.  The weights were recorded and the boxes were closed and placed in an incubator.  The hornworms were weighed every day for two weeks.  The food in each well was replaced and rehydrated as necessary with water or juvenile hormone.  The hypothesis is tested by analyzing the weights of Manduca Sexta to see if the juvenile hormone treated group had a significent size difference than the controll group.  After the results are collected, a statistical analysis using a two-sample t_test is conducted using the average change in weights of the Manduca Sexta in the controll and treatment groups.  Omitting the outlier from the treatment group that died on day 11, the p_value for the data set is 0.4538, the t-value is 0.1236, and the degrees of freedom is 4.  The alpha level is 0.05.

Results:
Based on the results of the experiment, the treatment group weighed less overall when compared to the controll group.   Figure 1 shows that the growth of the Manduca Sexta are hindered by an increase in juvenile hormone.  The average initial weights of the Manduca Sexta for the controll group was 0.135 grams and the initial masses for the treatment group was 0.25 grams.  The average weight for the controll group has an average weigh of 12.39 grams, while the average weight for the treatment group is 9.38 grams at the conclusion of the experiment.  The controll group has a standard deviation of 1.42 grams, while the treatment group has a standard deviation of 5.90 grams.  The controll group generally had greater net changes in weight than the treatment group.  The Manduca Sexta in the controll group grew normally as they had normal levels of juvenile hormone.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment reject the hypothesis that adding juvenile hormone accelerates the growth of the Manduca Sexta.  This is primarily because the role of the juvenile hormone in normal development stunts or stops the molting of the hornworms.  The molting process stops because to allow the Manduca Sexta to reach the next instar, there must be lower levels of juvenile hormone present.  The high levels of juvenile hormone hinder the Manduca Sexta from developing to the pupa stage, and onwards to metamorphosize to an adult.  This implies that the throughout the duration of the experiment, the treatment group was at a lower developmental stage, or instar, than the controll group.  The statistical results reject the hypothesis and conclude that adding juvenile hormone does not accelerate the growth of the Manduca Sexta.  There is evidence that there is a slight difference in weight between the controll and treatment groups, however, some error in the amount of food that each well had could have caused discrepancies in how much the hornworms ate, and therefore weighed each day.  The food was only changed if there was little to no food left in the well.  This would cause some wells to have slightly more food than others in a 24 hour period.  Additionally, the treatment group data is slightly skewed to the left because one Manduca Sexta treatment group died by day 11.  Despite these errors, the results in this experiment are parallel to the results of related studies, showing juvenile hormone levels in Tobacco Hornworms does affect growth and development. Other published studies found that an increase in JH levels does, indeed, prevent the molt of the caterpillars [Zhou: 1998]. This information is beneficial to farmers and other industries that need pest controll. With this study, people can develop effective method in controllling pests like adult moths that develop from the Manduca Sexta.   In subsequent experiments, the method need to be revised in order to acquire more accurate and precise results. One alteration in the method would be to change the food given to the caterpillars every day to ensure there is an even amount of food in each well.  This modification will allow the Manduca Sexta to move through the life cycle.  In conclusion, Manduca Sexta growth and development is affected by the increase in juvenile hormone as it results in the prevention of molting and metamorphosis.
