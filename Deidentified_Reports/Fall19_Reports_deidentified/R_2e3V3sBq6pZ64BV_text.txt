Title: The shortened inster larva development of Manduca Sexta in response to the introduction of the hormone Ecdysterone (20E)

Abstract:
not applicable 

Introduction:
Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that is formed in the prothoracic glands of the Manduca Sexta (Rybczynski 2009). Typically, this hormone is present in Manduca Sexta to signal the beginning of the molting process. Under normal laboratory conditions at a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, the Manduca Sexta develops from larva to adult in 22-23 days. The final larval instar stage lasts approximately 10 days (Rybczynski 2009). One of the important behavioral changes in the Manduca Sexta is during the pupal stage. Just prior to the pupal stage the behavior of wondering is exhibited. Wondering is During this stage the organism displays decreased and the pupa is sometimes enclosed by a cocoon. Does the hormone Ecdysterone (20E) decrease the time, in days, of development in Manduca Sexta. If 20E expedites the time it takes for Manduca Sexta to develop it would therefore cause the individuals exposed to it to mimic the pupal stage as well as a possible rapid gain in weight. The impact of the hormone 20E is important because if it expedites the development process the Manduca Sexta, that is usually considered a pest, can spend less time as a larva. If 20E effects the timing of insect development then the tobacco horn worms will gain weight quicker, indicating a faster development, than the individuals without 20E. The alternative hypothesis would be that the hormone 20E would have no effect on the weight of Manduca Sexta.  Manduca Sexta is a good model organism for this experiment because it has a short developmental period of approximately 23 days, with the last larval stage occurring in just 10 days. Because of the short developmental cycle of the organism it is ideal for this experiment. In addition to the sort developmental period of the insect the hormones that impact the development are not hazardous to humans or other mammals in small quantities. The Manduca Sexta is an organism that can also be successfully reared on an artificial diet (Morgan 2017). There are also only three hormones that influence the Manduca Sexta during development, so it would be easier to acknowledge the impact of one hormone in this organism compared to other organisms that have more hormones impacting development. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment  eight Manduca Sexta were selected, weighed and placed into two plastic bins with 4 sections and one Manduca Sexta was placed in each section. Then ten grams of the  bean paste food was measured and mixed with ten drops of water for the controll and seven drops of Ecdysterone (20E) for the experimental. This was repeated for seven days. The individuals were weighed, waste was disposed of and fresh food was added daily each day. The Manduca Sexta was kept in an incubator at 26 degrees Celsius. 

After day 7 the treatment group died, so the method were amended. The controll remained unchanged with ten drops of distilled water mixed with the food, but the amount of Ecdysterone (20E) was reduced from 7 drops a day to three drops a day. The individuals were weighed, new food was made, and hormone or water was added to the appropriate group. 

At the end of the experiment a two-sample t_test was used and a one tailed t value was selected to compare the groups to make an inference about the influence of Ecdysterone (20E) on the weight and development of the Manduca Sexta.


Results:
Overall the mass of the controll group increased each day while the experimental group increased then sharply decreased. The mass of the Manduca Sexta controll group increased each day until day six where the group gained less weight than the day before, this is the only time it happens and on day seven the growth increases exponentially compared to the day before. Given that the P value for the two-sample t test with one tail is 0.049910374, the treatment group is statistically different than the controll group.  

Discussion:
Our results indicate that the hormone Ecdysterone (20E) has a statistically significent impact on the mass of the Manduca Sexta. Contrary to our hypothesis, the Manduca Sexta actually lost weight instead of gained weight in this experiment. While the treatment group developed faster than the controll, indicated by the black spots on their bodies, the stage of development before pupation is a time of fasting for the Manduca Sexta not a time of growth. While observing the  treatment Manduca Sexta brown-black spots were present on the treatment individuals. These spots became present while the individuals were losing weight. “All individuals exposed to ecdysterone developed a distinctive double row of black spots along their dorsum…What these results imply is that the rapid decline in JH… that latter provokes a typical prodrome of pupation”(Nijhout 1974). Prior to the pupation stage the Manduca Sexta the “gut purge” (Nijhout 1974) occurs and the individuals stop eating, this is why after day 4 the treatment group began to lose weight.  Also, the presence of (20E) spurs a decrease of juvenile hormone. A decrease in Juvenile hormone causes Manduca larvae to lose weight (Nijhout 1974). With a p value of 0.049910374 this means that there is less than a five percent chance of this weight discrepancy to happen on its own. Therefore, the hormone (20E) does have a significent influence on the weight of Manduca Sexta and the decrease in weight actually indicated further development than the increase in weight. During the first trial of our experiment we had seven drops of the 20E hormone, this produced a radical chemical imbalance in the treatment group that caused them to pupate within hours of exposure to the hormone. As a result, we had to start over because we were measuring their weight and the weight of the treatment group under pupation is constant. During the second trial of our experiment we reduced the drops from seven to three, this reduced the reaction time from hours to days, so the impact of the hormone can be observed at a slower rate. Using a hormone like 20E as a pesticide on plants would be effective because it would manipulate the Manduca Sexta that are exposed to it into developing into a pupa instead of eating more of the crop(Bryon 2017). This would greatly reduce the amount of damage to crops this insect inflicts and would be a pesticide that is not harmful to humans in small amounts. The next logical step in this study would be to find the optimal amount of 20E that would only negatively impact the Manduca Sexta and not harm other insects that are beneficial to crops such as the apis mellifera or the western honeybee.
