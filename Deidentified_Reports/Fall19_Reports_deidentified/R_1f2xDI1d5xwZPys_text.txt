Title: An increase in Juvenile Hormone levels of Manduca Sexta increase the growth of larvae.

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
         The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. It has many common names such hawk moth and tobacco hornworm. They are holometabolous, they have a major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis, insects with short life cycles of about 39-48 days. They are easily accessible insects in the state of North Carolina and are considered pests during their larvae stage because they eat leaves. Two of the main hormones found in the hornworm are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). 20E regulates the timing of the molting in insect development while JH regulates the type of molt. Both are necessary for the survival and development of the Manduca (Johnson AD: 2016).
	This leads to questioning what would happen to the life cycle and development of the hornworm if the hormone levels were altered. Knowing how the worm reacts to altered hormone levels would increase our understanding of what would help this insect thrive or die prematurely. It would give us information about how it is that they hormones interact with each other, for example if one at significant levels can alter the effects of the other and stop development. This could be done by increasing the amount of one of the hormones in an experiment and comparing the growth with that of a control group. It’s been observed by scientists that “there is comprehensive body of evidence that a declining titre of JH is a prerequisite for pupation” (Nijhout:1974). Others have found that “in premetamorphic molts the JH titer, in fact, may be very low at the time of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release” (Fain: 506).So, we hypothesize that by increasing the levels of JH in the larvae, they will grow faster, and larger, than larvae with normal JH levels.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment was conducted using eight Manduca sexta larvae, Precor, distilled water, larvae food, a scale, and plastic containers. The variables would be the weight of the larvae and the Precor. It’s important to note that Precor is a hormone that mimics the effects of JH and the concentration used was 1 in 250 and 5 drops were used. The eight larvae were separated into two groups of four: the control and experiment group. They were kept in plastic containers where they were fed and contained for later weighing. The key step in the experiment was feeding the Manduca. The control group was fed ten grams of a food substance with five drops of distilled water mixed in for hydration purposes. The experiment group was also fed ten grams of food, but with five drops of Precor mixed in. This was done every day for two weeks as well as weighing the Manduca to track their growth. 

Results:
The general trend seen in Figure 1 is that the experiment group did grow larger and more quickly than the larvae in the control group. However, there was also a fluctuation in the weight. The larvae in either group did not consistently keep gaining weight. They all slowly gained weight in the first 3 days and kept gaining weight until they reached a peak. The peak for the control group was the 11th day while it was the 12th for the experimental group. The difference in weight between the control and experiment group was the most pronounced at the end of the two weeks. The biggest difference between both groups being about 7 grams (the exact value being 6.8 grams). The standard deviation for the control group was 5.7 and for the experimental group it was 9.0. The p-value was 0.046 which is less than 0.05, making the means of our control and experiment group statistically significant.

Discussion:
        The results prove that our hypothesis is correct, increasing the level of JH in the Manduca larvae resulted in them gaining more weight than those with normal levels of JH. However, it didn’t make the experiment group gain weight faster, the overall trend in both groups seems to be very similar. It also disproved the idea that the Manduca with higher levels of JH would pupate, leave the larvae the stage, quicker. The “absolute concentrations of the two hormones [JH and 20E] in hemolymph, the concentration ratio, and the insect’s developmental determine what the effects of the two hormones will be” (Johnson AD: 11). JH and 20E work together to regulate things such as “…growth, molting, and metamorphosis” (Johnson AD: 11), so it makes sense that the increase of JH resulted in an increase in the growth of the larvae. Our results also replicate those found in other studies, that the increase in JH does not result in the pupation of the larvae. It may have actually inhibited it, based on the findings that 
“During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)…” (Nijhout: 493) therefore “… the corpora allata cease to secrete JH” (Nijhout: 493) in order to begin pupating.
	It would now be interesting to study the effects an increase in 20E would have on the larvae to compare against the effects the increased JH levels had. Maybe it would make it clearer to see the main effect these hormones have on the Manduca. However, this study could also be modified by changing the point in the Manduca’s life cycle at which this experiment is ran. This could result in the JH affecting the regulation of another aspect of the Manduca such as the molting or metamorphosis. The same could be done with 20E. Both hormones work together to move an Manduca through its life cycle that more research is needed to understand exactly what each hormone is controlling at difference stages of the life cycle.
	Through this experiment we have been able to discover that an increase in the JH levels of Manduca larvae result in larvae that are heavier than average. However, the larvae did not molt or pupate faster than larvae with normal JH levels so it can be concluded that altering the JH levels of larvae will not be helpful in the pest control of these insects. If anything, it would be the opposite of pest control because it would result in larvae that do not pupate faster but grow much larger, although whether they consume more food than normal larvae cannot be concluded.  However, these results may differ if we changed the amount of Precor given to the Manduca. An increased or smaller dosage may have effects different to the ones we collected. However, it is clear that the life cycle of the insect is dependent on a careful balance of JH and 20E.
