Title: Aggressive Behaviors Exhibited by Betta Splendens in Response to Stimuli

Abstract:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, provides insight into the evolution of behaviors in response to natural selection. Betta splendens, commonly known as SIamese fighting fish (or “bettas”), are model organisms for ethology as they have a unique predisposition for intraspecial aggressive and agonistic behavior. In order to study how bettas interact with one another and in the presence of certain stimuli, we chose to investigate the response of bettas to stimuli that resemble an aggressive opponent. We did so by first presenting artificial betta fish cut-outs that were accurately colored, and either present them with or without a “red mane,” (or the branchiostegal membrane, simulating the aggressive response of another betta). In our second experiment, we presented the betta with a more anatomically realistic betta stimulus versus an anatomically unrealistic betta stimulus, presented as a cut-out with basic geometric shapes comprising the “fish body.” With prior knowledge of the famous 1950 Tinbergen study of pecking behavior in gulls, we hypothesized that the bettas will not habituate faster in response to stimuli with the red mane (regardless of stimulus shape), and will habituate faster in response to a stimulus that does not possess a red mane (as opposed to a stimulus tha

Introduction:
The expression of agonistic behaviors in animals is essential to territoriality and survival in many species. In Betta splendens, (“bettas,”) males express aggressive movements as part of intraspecific competitive behavior among other males. A study published by the University of Illinois Press identified betta aggression as a “component assessment strategy,” especially when males are in close contact [Bronstein: 1983]. Males will exhibit broadside movements to express aggression, such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, and may also exhibit facing movements such as erect pectoral fins, spreading the operculum, and protruding branchiostegal membranes (which appears as a red mane) [Johnson: 2019]. Male bettas will display these behaviors with increasing intensity, using tail flashing and protrusion of branchiostegal membranes as their peak agonistic behavior [Johnson: 2019]. Based on a 1997 study on betta agonistic behaviors, it was determined that exposure to even brief glimpses of an opponent displaying broadside movements, and even more so an opponent displaying facing movements, triggered prolonged aggression in experimental bettas [Halperin: 1997]. In the famous Tinbergen study done on Herring gull chicks, it was determined that the chicks had innate responses to certain parental stimuli, which largely consisted of very specific characteristics, namely the red spot on the parent’s mandible [Tinbergen: 1950]. In order to further investigate to what degree a stimuli must be specific in order to elicit a certain behavior, we chose to study this effect in betta fish and identify how closely a stimuli must resemble an opponent in order to elicit agonistic behaviors. It is important to consider the effects of habituation on male individuals in the presence of a stimulus, so we noted that it had been previously determined that male bettas will show less of an agonistic response after habituating to a stimulus that is presented to them through a partition [Klein: 1976]. This information allowed us to consider that we could study any changes in the rate of habituation in male bettas in response to a stimulus that is presented to them for a certain time period. Consequently, using our knowledge of the Tinbergen study and a tendency for habituation to occur in betta fish, we hypothesized that male B. splendens will habituate at the same rate in response to a stimuli that least resembles a realistic opponent as long as it possesses the “red mane,” and conversely, will habituate faster in response to a stimulus that resembles the realistic opponent, but lacks the “red mane.”


Materials and Methods:
A single male B. splendens was placed into a small aquarium. It’s isolated behavior was observed for five minutes. After five minutes, a realistically cut-out B. splendens with a red semi-circular cutout taped to resemble the branchiostegal membranes protruding in a facing display was placed outside of the aquarium within the betta’s vision. The betta’s behavior was observed and the duration of it’s agonistic behavior, both broadside and facing, was recorded for a five minute period. The stimulus was then removed and the betta rested for a five minute period. After the rest period, the stimulus was presented for two additional trials. The next part of the experiment utilized a less realistic fish cut-out, with basic geometric shapes comprising the fish body, was placed in front of the betta with a red semi-circular cut-out mane placed in a manner similar to the realistic fish. Duration of the agonistic behaviors were recorded for another five minute period, followed by another five minute period of rest, for three trials. The realistic cut-out was then shown again in the third and final part of the experiment, this time without the red mane, and the betta’s response was observed and recorded for five minutes, and repeated for a total of three trials. Our quantifiable observations were the total duration (in seconds) over each five minute period in which the betta male was exhibiting any form of agonistic behavior using a stopwatch. When our betta totally ceased any agonistic behavior, the time was noted and then noted again once agonistic behaviors were observed again. To compare our total time spent in each part of the experiment in agonistic behavior, a two-sample, one-tailed t-test was used to compare the realistic fish and unrealistic fish, both with the red mane, then again to compare the realistic fish with and then without the red mane. 


Results:
The male betta fish had an average duration of agonistic behavior for 286.667 seconds over the 300 second period in response to the realistic fish with the red mane, an average duration of 287.667 seconds in response to the unrealistic fish with the red mane, and an average duration of 289.333 seconds in response to the realistic fish without the red mane. Figure One expresses our data in comparing the average realistic versus unrealistic fish cut-out stimuli response duration. The average duration in response to the realistic stimulus had a standard deviation of +/- 15.37, whereas the average duration of response to the unrealistic stimulus had a standard deviation of +/- 11.15. The p-value from this data was 0.466. Figure Two represents the average duration of responses to the realistic fish cut-outs with both the red mane and without the red mane. Again, the standard deviation within the red mane data was +/- 15.37 and the standard deviation for the realistic stimulus (without the red mane) response was +/- 2.52. The p-value from this data set was 0.391. These p-values indicate non-significant data.


Discussion:
The two p-values should be considered individually. The first data comparison accepts our null hypothesis that there would be no change in the rate of habituation. This is consistent with our predictions as the shape of the fish did not impact the betta fish’s response as long as the stimulus had a red mane present to mimic the branchiostegal membrane. This is consistent with the class Tinbergen studies of pecking behavior in gulls [Tinbergen: 1950]. There were some interesting patterns in the betta’s behavior throughout the trials. Firstly, our first trial began while the betta fish was still in isolation and only after about 5 seconds did the betta begin agonistic movements, whereas he started aggressive behavior almost immediately for the rest of the experiments. Also, as seen in both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, there was an upward trend in duration of agonistic behaviors. Our betta did, in fact, spend almost the entirety of each 300 second period in agonistic behavior, in the presence of all three stimuli. The only time our betta took breaks at all from aggression was to swim to the surface for air, which he did with increasing frequency throughout the experiment. Our data is consistent with the Halperin findings in which bettas displayed excessive aggression in response to broadside movements in a stimulus [Halperin: 1997]. By the end of the experiment he had gone up for air eight times, as opposed to two times in the first trial. This could have been due to exhaustion (as the betta had undergone a total of 2,700 seconds of stimulation), or perhaps an unforeseen or unobservable factor presented by the different stimuli. For example, the betta fish spent more time on average displaying agonistic behavior toward the realistic fish without the red mane than toward the realistic fish with the red mane. We believed that this could have been attributed to the fact that without the red mane, the “opponent” appears more submissive than the “opponent” who is displaying a constant aggressive facing movement with the red mane showing. But a 1980 study concluded that bettas are more likely to display aggressive behaviors to another aggressive opponent than to a submissive opponent [Cain: 1980]. 
     Our data did not support the alternative hypothesis that the betta would habituate faster in response to a stimulus that lacked the mimicry of branchiostegal membrane protrusion as compared to a stimulus that did possess this characteristic, which was inconsistent with the classic Tinbergen study in gull pecking behavior [Tinbergen: 1950]. Even when the stimulus was a plain blue fish cut out, the fish responded in a similar manner to the blue fish with the red mane mimic, but our large p-value indicated non-significant results and the difference in response was not proven to be significant. This could have been due to our small amount of trials, and the fact that we only studied one betta male. Ideally, we would have performed more trials on multiple betta test subjects to produce a more accurate average duration of agonistic behavior. Although we did not have time to further study the response of the betta to plain stimuli, we presented a plain blue square in front of the betta for an additional five minutes at the end of our experiments just to observe the betta’s reaction, and he continued to express nearly 300 full seconds of aggression toward the plain blue square, indicating that shape and color or the perceived stimulus does not impact the betta’s response. Our findings in both experiments were inconsistent with the Klein study in which over time, a betta will habituate to a stimulus regardless of the nature of the stimulus as long as it is repetitively shown to the betta [Klein: 1976], as our subject did not habituate to any of the three stimuli despite being exposed to them for 900 seconds each.
     We were shocked as to how long the betta male exhibited a full display of all kinds of agonistic behavior, both facing and broadside movements including violent tail flashing and prolonged branchiostegal membrane protrusion [Johnson: 2019]. It would be interesting to study the frequency of each kind of agonistic movement (broadside versus facing) to see if that differs in response to various stimuli. We are also curious to see how an aggressive male might respond in response to a perceived male stimulus and a perceived female stimulus. In a study published in Behavioral Ecology, male bettas were found to express agonistic behaviors with more intensity when exposed to an audience of both males and females, more so than with individuals of only one sex [Doutrelant: 2001], so it would be interesting to see how the frequency or duration of broadside/facing movements vary in response to male versus female stimuli. In further studies we would also like to investigate the response of a betta exposed to stimuli with a different type of agonistic movement displayed (such as a cut-out with erect pectoral fins or a spread operculum, which may be perceived as less aggressive than the protruded branchiostegal membrane [Johnson: 2019]. Using more than one test subject may produce more precise data as our betta could have been especially aggressive compared to other betta individuals. So more trials with more test subjects could impact our results.
