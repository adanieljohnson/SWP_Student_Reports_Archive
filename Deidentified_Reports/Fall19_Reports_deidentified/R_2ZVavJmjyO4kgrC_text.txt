Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone (E20) on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
This experiment strives to explore the effects of the hormone ecdysterone (E20) on manduca sexta. It is an insect in the order of lepidoptera--including butterflies and moths. They have a holometabolous life cycle; in other words, the caterpillars will go through four major life stages including a pupa stage where the larvae metamorphosizes into the adult insect. This developmental change is mediated by hormones such as the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. The passage from one larvae stage to the next and eventually into a pupa requires a process called molting. Developmental hormones have become an interest for research and exploration in the realm of insecticides and E20 is the hormone that regulates the timing of molting and therefore regulates the timing of insect growth and development. Three factors are known to influence the performance of hormones: absolute concentrations, concentration ratio, and developmental stage. [Johnson: 2019]. This experiment attempts to explore the effects E20 inhibitors have on Manduca Sexta. Throughout the developmental stages of the Manduca Sexta all the way up to its metamorphosis into an adult, Ecdysterone should see a steady increase [Bollenbacher: 1981]. This increase of hormone concentration should be the driving factor for growth and pupation. Since it is studied that the concentration of ecdysterone increases with time and growth, it may be beneficial for the purposes of further understanding to test the effects of inhibiting ecdysterone release. Even on a cellular level, ecdysterone has been seen to influence cell development. It has shown to influence the expansion of hindgut cells in vitro, as well as cause an increase in the number of epithelial cells in any given cross section that was studied. Additionally, large pupal nuclei were observed to divide into several small adult nuclei, reflecting the effects of ecdysterone on a micro level. These effects have been shown to be unique specifically to ecdysterone, as neither distilled water nor 22-isoecdysone was able to produce similar results [Judy: 1971]. Our goal in this experiment is to explore the effects of E20 inhibitors on the development of manduca sexta in vivo. It can be hypothesized that feeding E20 inhibitors to the manduca sexta insects will slow the timing of the molting process during development, resulting in decreased mass gain, and prevent it from pupating at the proper time. 


Materials and Method:
Into 2 separate containers, 8 caterpillars were picked out and were placed into an individual compartment. Half of the caterpillars were labeled as the controll group and half of the caterpillars were labeled as the experimental group. The plastic containers were hole punched for steady air exchange. Since the goal of the experiment is to investigate the effects of E20 of the growth and development of the insect, the experimental group was given E20 inhibitors--Aza guard. Seven drops of Aza guard was mixed into the food for the experimental group caterpillars; the controll group had 10 Ml of water mixed with their food. Each of the caterpillars were given 10 grams of food to begin with, and more was added during the data recording process when needed. The caterpillars were checked everyday for mass gain, and the food was checked to see if it was still moist and if more food was needed.When feces built up, the insects were removed and the waste was disposed of. Weight gain was checked through weighing the caterpillars individually on a digital balance measured in grams. The dependent variable in this experiment would be growth rate, which was measured in mass gain, while the independent variable in this experiment is whether the caterpillars were given hormones. Mean and standard deviation were determined for the experimental and controll group, and a t_test was performed to determine the significance of the data collected.


Results:
	The mean growth rate for the controll group was 0.853g +/- 0.223g SD. The mean growth rate for the experimental group was 0.079g +/- 0.047g SD. Figure 1 presents the results for mean growth rates for the controll group and the mean growth rates for the experimental group. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the mean and standard error of the controll group and the experimental group. A t_test was run for the controll versus experimental group and the results were found to be significent (t_stat = 6.79, d.f. = 6,  p_value = 0.000249).


Discussion:
The p_value suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis, and that the difference of growth rate detected in this experiment is significent and not due to chance. The data displays a mean growth rate much higher for the controll group than the experimental group; although the controll group does tend to have more variation. This may suggest that E20 inhibitors not only suppresses growth through suppressing mass gain, but it may also reflect that E20 inhibitors suppress the natural variation in difference in growth rate across the species across the board. The standard deviation for the mean growth rate for the experimental group is much lower than the controll group. The hypothesis is supported by the results since the group given E20 inhibitors experiences significently slower growth rates. These effects can be attributed to the lack of Ecdysterone the caterpillars are experiencing. As stated earlier, ecdysterone is the hormone that controlls growth and molting[Johnson: 2019]. The full growth process and development of the manduca sexta is influenced by three major components in relation to ecdysteroid: time across change in concentration, the amount of concentration increase, and the type of ecdysteroid type, which in this experiment is E20. E20 is the predominant category of ecdysteroid, and is the hormone that was manipulated in this experiment. Since the precision of these three components are key for triggering specific developmental events, it is reasonable to see that a lack thereof will result in detrimental effects in the growth and development in the manduca sexta.  [Bollenbacher: 1981] It is reasonable to infer that inhibiting these E20 may cause a decrease in growth rate. The azo guard that was fed to the caterpillars seemed to be effectively inhibiting the proper release of the E20 hormone, which kept the growth rate of the experimental caterpillars much lower than the controll group. These effects are robust and consistent with the experimental group caterpillars. This experiment may lead to more insightful exploration on the development of insecticides containing hormone or hormone inhibiting analogues.

There were 4 caterpillars in the experimental groups, and they were exposed to E20 inhibitors for 3 weeks. Their growth rate was measured in mass change.
