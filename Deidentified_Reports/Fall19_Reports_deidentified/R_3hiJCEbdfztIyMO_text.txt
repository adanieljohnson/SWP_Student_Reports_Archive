Title: Effect of NaCl saline solution on root-to-shoot ratio in Raphanus plants

Abstract:
In this lab, we sought to validate the idea that plants may allocate their resources differently given different environmental conditions. Specifically, we tested whether or not the root:shoot ratio of radish plants would change in response to increasing salinity in the water. The experiment was conducted by simply using three treatment groups: one controll with pure water and two with differing concentrations of NaCl solution. The group hypothesized that the R:S ratio would be greater in the plants treated with the saline solution. However, with a p_value of 0.225 calculated, the experiment proved to not have statistically significent results and no concrete conclusions or correlations could be made regarding this relationship. We questioned the validity of our initial hypothesis but ultimately concluded that the experiment was worth repeating again as a variety of experimental factors could have possibly influenced our results.


Introduction:
Plants vary in how they allocate metabolic resources among their different parts. For example, shoots and leaves are primarily responsible for gas exchange as well as photosynthetic processes. The roots, however, are more specialized in regulating nutrient and water uptake from the soil. Measuring the root-shoot ratio is very indicative of the differing competitive factors among plants within a given environment. This is because they demonstrate which types of resources may be scarce and worth investing more energy into attaining within a given ecosystem. For example, scientists have observed greater root:shoot ratios in Mediterranean plants that often deal with prolonged dry spells. They surmise that their roots are larger to obtain more of what little water and other nutrients are available from the soil [Sardans:2013].  In this experiment, we investigate the impact that saltwater has on the root:shoot ratio in radish plants. I hypothesize that the ratio will be greater in the plants treated with saltwater, as more root surface area and length would likely be needed to obtain sufficient water.


Materials and Method:
Within 12 small containers of soil, about 4-5 radish seedlings were planted in each one. The 12 containers were then apportioned out into 3 separate groups of 4 containers to test each experimental group: 100% water, 1: 1 water with 1M NaCl solution, and 100% 1M NaCl solution. Once the groups of containers were all planted, each was sufficiently treated with normal water. In the following two weeks, each container was watered once daily with 400Ml of each assigned solution. At the end of the two weeks, the fully sprouted plants for each group (only around 4-5) were collected, washed, and measured by their root length and shoot length. The resulting root:shoot ratio was calculated and an ANOVA statistical test was used to analyze our results.

Results:
The mean R:S ratio was 2.46 and an sd of ±0.59 for the 100% water controll, 2.44 and ±0.38  for the 1: 1 1M NaCl solution, and 1.86  and ±0.46 for the 100% 1M NaCl solution. Using an ANOVA statistical test, the overall p_value was found to be 0.225. 

Discussion:
Given the results, we are inclined to accept the null hypothesis for this experiment and reject the alternate. There is no clear statistical evidence from this experiment to suggest that the saltwater directly affects the root:shoot ratio of radish plants. This may demonstrate that other nutrient deficiencies, such as nitrogen, may be far more impactful than water (to an extent).  However, in researching further upon the topic, a multitude of other studies (although not specifically with radish plants), evidence was found that correlates a lack of water to a greater root:shoot ratio [Lloret:2002]. Moreover, the manner in which our experiment was conducted left substantial room for experimental error. It is likely that, due to scheduling conflicts, the plants were inconsistently watered during the experiment and therefore grew inconsistently. The small sample size may have also contributed to inconclusive results.  Thus, it would be worthwhile to repeat this experiment but at a greater scale and with a more consistent methodology.
