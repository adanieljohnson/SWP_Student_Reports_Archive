Title: Effect of Water Temperature on Betta Splenden’s Aggressive Reaction to Presence of Another Male

Abstract:
Many species behave in ways that serve a physiological purpose. Ethology, the study of animal behavior, aims to understand the motivations behind these behaviors. Betta Splendins, Siamese fighting fish, are small fish known for their aggressive or agnostic behaviors when excited by the presence of another male. These behaviors are shown through broadside and facing movements. In this study, the effect of water temperature on the number of Betta Splendins aggressive behaviors was recorded in a series of trials. We examined three fish in three different temperatures: 19C, 21 C, and 16 C. We predicted that warmer temperatures would significently increase the number of aggressive behaviors. The results yielded no significent difference between the fish acclimated to 19C and 21 C, forcing us to reject the alternative hypothesis. However, it did yield a significent difference in all combinations with the fish acclimated to 16 C. The colder temperature showed that it had a deeper effect on the fish’s metabolic response and muscular performance, leading it to have a tremendous impact of the number of aggressive behaviors it showed. Warmer temperature did not have as tremendous of an impact. 

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, seek to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors through observing genetic, physiological, and learned actions of animals. Betta Splendins, more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, are small aquarium fish that originate from southeast Asia. The fish are relatively benign when at rest, but when excited by the presence of another male, they have a tendency to react in aggressive ways. This reaction is known as intraspecific behavior. These behaviors are shown in two main types of movements: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements occur when a fish turns it side toward the opponent like pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements occur when the fish faces its opponent. These include erecting the pectoral fins, spreading gill covers (opercula), and protruding the branchiostegal membranes under the opercula, showing a red mane. The opposing Betta splenden can react by ignoring the action, matching it, fleeing, or submit to it. They could also escalate by showing a behavior with a higher intensity. We are interested in investigating how a change in water temperature will affect the fish’s agnostic and aggressive behaviors to one another. We predict that if the Betta splendins are in increase water temperatures, the agnostic behaviors will increase. We believe this is going to occur because a study showed that fish in warmer waters correlate with higher muscle activity, thus allowing them to perform more aggressively when excited by another male presence [Pörtner: 2002]. 

Materials and Method:
The Betta Splendins were provided by the Wake Forest Biology department. The fish were kept in normal room temperature (19 C) in individual tanks. In our experiment, we examined one fish that was in normal temperature, one fish that was acclimated to a warmer temperature (21 C), and another fish that was acclimated to a colder temperature (16 C). We warmed the aquarium using a heating pad and cooled the cold aquarium with crushed ice. First, we examined the reaction of a male at normal room temperature when exposed to another male at room temperature for four minutes in the same tank. We then gave each fish four minutes of rest. We repeated these steps three times. Secondly, we examined the male fish that was acclimated to the warm water temperature. We placed the male fish in the same tank as the fish in the normal water temperature. We examined the reaction for four minutes. We then removed the fish and placed him back in the warm water tank and let both of the fish rest for four minutes. We repeated these steps three times. Thirdly, we examined the fish that was acclimated to the cold water temperature. We placed the fish in the normal water temperature with another fish that had been kept at water temperature and examined his behavior for four minutes. We then removed the fish that had been in colder water and placed him back in the cold tank and let both fish rest for four minutes. We repeated these steps three times. The independent variable of this test was the temperature of water in each tank. The dependent variable was the number of aggressive behaviors the fish displayed. We used an ANOVA test, include a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test to examine if there was statistical significance.  

Results:
In Figure 1, the number of aggressive behaviors was recorded by each fish that was acclimated to the three different water temperatures. The fish in the normal water temperature (19C) produced an average of 8.667±2.887 of aggressive behaviors. The fish acclimated to the warmer water temperature (21C) displayed an average of 13.334±2.887 aggressive behaviors. The fish acclimated to the cooler water temperature (16C) showed no aggressive behaviors. After conducting an ANOVA test, the Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test yielded no significent difference between fish acclimated in 19C and 21C. It yielded a significent difference between the fish acclimated to 19C and 16C and between fish acclimated to 21C and 16C. The variance component among groups was 88.77% and the variance component within groups was 11.23%. 

Discussion:
The display of aggressive behaviors only showed significance when the colder fish was placed in competition with a normal or warmer fish. There was no significent difference between the normal and warmer temperature fish, thus not supporting our initial hypothesis that warmer temperatures will significently cause aggressive behaviors to increase. Despite the lack of significance, it is apparent that temperature, in a general sense, does affect the number of aggressive behaviors. The fish that was acclimated to the colder temperature showed zero aggressive behaviors. A study found that in temperate fish, cold water temperatures lead to dormancy or other homeostatic responses to reserve energy and maintain homeostasis [Johnston: 1987]. In our initial examination, we were more focused on the effect heightened temperatures would have on the fish, rather than the extreme effect cold could potentially have. While the warmer and normal fish did not have a significent difference, the variance component amongst groups was high and reinforces how different the number of aggressive behaviors was amongst all fish. Along with this, the within group variance was low which shows that there was very little differentiation between the three intergroup trials. This could support that habituation did not have a significent effect on the fish between the four-minute intervals. Another reason for this may be the time the fish were acclimated to the new temperatures. Further research could be done on fish that were acclimated to the warmer and cooler temperatures for a longer period of time. Adaptation to colder and warmer temperatures could create thermal tolerance, thus leading to either a significent change in aggressive behavior or a return to aggressive behavior that mimicked that of the fish in the normal temperature.
