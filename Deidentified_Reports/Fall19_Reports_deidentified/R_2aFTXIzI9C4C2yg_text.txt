Title: Effects of nitrogen on the root length of cultivated Radish (Raphanus sativus L)

Abstract:
We proposed this study to test the effects of altering nitrogen level on the root length of Raphanus sativus L (cultivated Radish). We hypothesized that lacking nitrogen would result in longer root length. Radish seeds were divided into control and treatment groups and transferred to soil. Each pot contained 10 seeds and was watered with 200ml of water. Each treatment pot was added with 20ml nitrogen. After 14 days, 3 plants were selected randomly from each pot and were harvested to measure the root length. Two sample t test were performed to compare the difference in root length of the control and treatment group. The p value was less than 0.05 and indicates that our hypothesis was supported. One possible cause  is that plants compensate for the lack of nitrogen by growing longer roots to maximize their nutrient uptake in the soil. 

Introduction:
Since there are limited resources in nature, organisms adapt various strategies to maximize the use of resources. Allocation is one of the significant concepts of all the survival strategies.  In pants, allocation has been illustrated as a proportional or ratio-driven process, named “partitioning” (Weiner: 2004). Plants are able to allocate a given amount of resources to different body structures, such as root system and shoot system, in a way that different structures are invested with different amount of resources by ratio in response to biotic factors from the local habitat. For example, plants in the forest tend to develop a larger number of leaves to compensate for being overshadowed by taller trees , and thus to maximize the capture of sunlight for photosynthesis. In addition, plant species also show a “trade-off” characteristic in resource allocation. The “trade-off” indicates that certain plant species put more investment in developing one trait or body structure and reduce in other traits or structures. For example, previous study that focused on testing flood tolerance of three marsh plant species discovered that a trade-off exists between tolerance to flooding and tolerance to drought . The marsh plant with highest tolerance to flooding shows lowest tolerance to drought. The plants with medium tolerance to both drought and flood shows that highest survival rate in the experiment (Luo et al: 2008). Previous works illustrate that in response to the local habitat, plants develop allocation and trade-off strategies to maximize their survival rate. In our study, one of the most important nutrients in soil, nitrogen was the testing factor. Raphanus sativus L (cultivated Radish) was subject to experiment. Raphanus sativus is a good model plant to study plant’s response to various environmental stresses, such as temperature, light intensity, water supply and nutrient level (Kostka-Rick and Manning: 1993). The goal of this study was to learn the effects of altering nitrogen level to the root length of Radish. The Radish plants were divided into control and treatment groups. The treatment group received extra nitrogen every day during the experiment. After two weeks, three plants from each pot were randomly picked and measured for their root length. The root length of the control and treatment were graphed and compared for difference. We hypothesized that the lack of nitrogen would produce longer root length in Radish plants. One possible cause was that plants compensate for the lack of nutrients in the soil by propagating their roots. 


Materials and Methods:
Ten Radish seeds were planted in each of the six pots of fertilized soil. Three pots were labeled control and the other three were labeled nitrogen treatment. The plants were put in greenhouse, under stable temperature and light intensity. Each day each pot was watered with 200ml of water. Each nitrogen treatment pot was watered with an additional 20ml of nitrate. After 14 days, three plants from each pot were randomly selected and rinsed with water. Each of the plant was cut and the root was separated from the rest of the plant. The maximum root length was measured and recorded. A bar graph comparing the average maximum root length of the control plants and the treatment plants was constructed. Paired two sample t test was performed to compare the difference of the mean root length from two groups. 


Results:
Two sample t-tests were performed on control and treatment groups of average root length. The control and treatment groups were applied with the same water supply, with the treatment group added by additional 20ml of nitrate every day. The two sample t test results show that df=8, two tail p value = 0.0096 (p&lt;0.05). Since the p value is less than 0.05, there is significant difference between average root length of the control and treatment groups. However, since in one pot of the nitrogen treatment group, we only obtained one plant and it resulted in two zero values, which can significantly reduced the mean value. If we excluded these two outliers, the two sample t test would give us df= 14, p = 0.017 (p&lt;0.05). Since the p value is less than 0.05, the outliers did not affect the results. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that states the lack of nitrogen would produce longer root length in Radish plants was supported by the results. Though there were two zero outliers, two sample t test excluding the outliers still shows that there is significant difference between the control average root length and the treatment average root length. Thus our hypothesis was supported. However, in the treatment group, we observed a higher plant death rate. It is possible that the addition of a large amount of nitrogen is related to plant death. In a previous study that tested the response of Radish plants to different nitrogen level shows that the best root yield of radish was not found in plants applied with the most nitrogen (Pervez et al: 2004). The results indicate that adding too much nitrogen to plants would lead to low root yield and plant death. In conclusion, the Radish plants illustrated the allocation strategy, that plants distribute resources to different body structures proportionally. One possible cause of the longer average root length in control plants is that the plants compensated for the lack of nitrogen by growing longer roots and reaching deeper in the soil for nutrient uptake. In the future, the correlation of nitrogen level and plant development is a field of interest. It is important to find the optimal amount of nitrogen for a given plant species. Other factors play important roles in plant growth as well and are worthy subjects for research, such as the space between each individual plant and the quality of the air, etc.
