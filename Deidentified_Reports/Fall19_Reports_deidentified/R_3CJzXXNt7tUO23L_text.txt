Title: The Effect of Living Space on Phenotypic Plasticity in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity is an organism's ability to express different phenotypes despite having the same genome. An example of this is varying leaf numbers on plants living in the shade versus full sun or root length in competitive environments. In our experiment, we looked at the phenotypic plasticity of mung bean plants, Vigna radiata, in spacious living environments to see how it would affect their root and shoot growth. If the mung beans, Vigna radiata, are placed in a spacious environment, then they will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the normal, crowded environment due to the lack of competition between specimens for light. For both measurements, the experimental group has a higher root to shoot ratio than the control group. Our results rejected the null hypothesis, therefore supporting our hypothesis. A more spacious growing environment does cause plants to have a greater root to shoot ratio. The difference between out experimental and out control groups was significant with p values of less than 0.05 for both length and weight. This information can be applied to city crops as well as agricultural spacing in rows for large scale farmers.

Introduction:
Phenotypic plasticity is an organism's ability to express different phenotypes despite having the same genome. Both biotic, living, and abiotic, non-living, factors have an influence on an organism’s phenotypic expression [Johnson: 2019]. An example of phenotypic plasticity is varying leaf numbers on plants living in the shade versus full sun or root length in competitive environments [Johnson: 2019]. 
In trees and other plants, energy made in the leaves can go one of two routes, it can be stored in the roots, or it can be used to help the plant grow. Energy is typically directed to healthier, more important areas of the plant to increase the energy yield. In competitive environments, such as the rainforest, plants typically put more energy into stem and leaf growth to increase their access to sunlight, as the cost of their root system. 
In our experiment, we looked at the phenotypic plasticity of mung bean plants, Vigna radiata, in spacious living environments to see how it would affect their root and shoot growth. Mung beans, native to India, are common throughout the world and are a biennial crop [Gaganpreet: 2010]. They typically have long root systems and stems with many branches. 
Our hypothesis was: if the mung beans, Vigna radiata, are placed in a spacious environment, then they will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the normal, crowded environment due to the lack of competition between specimens for light. 
We will measure phenotypic change by comparing the root to shoot ratio of the plant's lengths and masses between the test and control groups.


Materials and Methods:
First, seventy-two mung bean seeds that were soaked in water, nine square buckets, and a large amount of vermiculite (soil substitute) were obtained. All of the buckets were filled three-fourths of the way. Six plants were planted equidistant from each other in six buckets. The remaining 36 seeds were separated into groups of twelve, which were then planted into the remaining three buckets in the same fashion as the group before. All buckets were watered thoroughly. The three buckets of twelve were labeled control and the six buckets of six were labeled experimental. All of the buckets were then placed in the greenhouse, kept at a constant temperature, and exposed to natural light conditions. Once a day for two weeks the plants were watered. 
After the two week time growth period elapsed, the ten plants from each group were randomly selected. Each of the ten plants was carefully removed from the vermiculite and rinsed with water. The plants were then dried and weighed. Each plant was then cut at the root shoot junction. Each half was individually weighed and measured lengthwise. Root to shoot ratios were calculated and a one-tailed t-test was performed to analyze the results. The independent variable in this experiment was the space the plants grew in. The dependent variable was their root to shoot ratio. The controlled variables were time, water amount, temperature, and light exposure. 



Results:
For both measurements, the experimental group has a higher root to shoot ratio than the control group. The experimental groups also formed a tighter data set with a smaller standard deviation and fewer outliers than the experimental group. The one-tailed t-test had a p-value of 0.00032 for length and 0.02091 for weight, meaning the results are statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Our results rejected the null hypothesis, therefore supporting our hypothesis. A more spacious growing environment does cause plants to have a greater root to shoot ratio. 
The difference between out experimental and out control groups was significant with p values of less than 0.05 for both length and weight. As seen in Figure 1, the experimental plants had higher root to shoot ratios in both the length and weight categories, likely because they had to compete less for sunlight than the control group. 
	This information can be applied to city crops as well as agricultural spacing in rows for large scale farmers. The information found highlights that plants had to complete less when spaced out. This means two things, one, that plant who compete less will need more root space, and second, it can be inferred that reproductive organs and storage organs become larger and more fruitful. This second effect is primarily due to the plant having extra energy from the lack of competition. Farmers can use this information to find a balance between plant spacing and legume production to maximize their harvests. This is especially pertinent to city farmers as home growers and minor farms cramped for space need to more readily evaluate the crops they should plant and their potential space requirements. 
	A study done in 2010 in India focuses on mung bean competition and yield against weeds [Gaganpreet: 2010]. Their results agree with ours as more competition takes away from plant resources. The 2010 study found that mung beans produced lower yields and had shallower root systems when competing with native weeds. Similarly, a 2018 study done by Birhanu and their team in Ethiopia found that not only is a maximum space needed for maximum yield, but also that there is a better ratio that includes more plants of lower yield to increase harvest yields [Birhanu: 2018].  Our experiment confirms the results of these two studies with a different form of data, furthering the idea of ideal plant spacing for Vigna radiata. 
	Further testing can be done on different species of plants to test ideal spacing. The same experiment could also be conducted, but throughout the plants’ life, testing overall growth.
