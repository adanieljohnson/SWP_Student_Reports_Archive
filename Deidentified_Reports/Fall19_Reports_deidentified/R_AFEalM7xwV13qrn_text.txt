Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manducta sexta Larva

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The Manducta sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, has three primary hormones that controll its development. These hormones include the prothoracicotropic brain hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). The two hormones investigated in this experiment are the 20E and JH. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development and additional functions in adult insects. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during development and regulates multiple functions in adult insects. JH is more present than 20E until the end of the 4th larval instar period, which then it is surpassed by 20E hormone. The commitment pulse is when a small rise in 20E occurs as JH drops very low, and it is produced when the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate [Johnson: 2016]. This experiment investigates if additional JH given to the tobacco hornworm will cause a longer developmental period before the caterpillar reaches its commitment pulse. We hope to investigate the effects that JH has on the larvae as they develop so there is a stronger understanding of endocrine function in the caterpillars. In this experiment, we hypothesized that if the caterpillar of the Manducta sexta is given 8 drops of additional juvenile hormone every time it is fed, then the caterpillar will remain in the developmental stage longer and therefore weigh less than the caterpillars not given additional hormone.

Materials and Method:
The experiment required two groups of the tobacco hornworm: the controll group and the experimental group. The controll group contained four caterpillars that were fed 10 grams of food with 8 drops of water, and the food/water was replaced once it dried out. The experiment group contained four caterpillars that were fed 10 grams of food with 8 drops of IG Regulator (JH), and the food/JH was replaced once it dried out. The caterpillars were kept in two separate plastic containers with air holes and the food was placed in the compartments for each caterpillar. The weight in grams of the caterpillars was recorded daily as well as observations of changes in the appearance of the caterpillars. After the data was collected, a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data of the two caterpillar groups. 

Results:
Both the experimental group (given 8 drops IG Regular) and the controll group (given 8 drops of water) grew at similar rates throughout the experiment. During the later days of the experiment, the average weights of the experimental group exceeded those of the controll group. There were also important differences in the coloring of the two groups: the experimental group remained a much lighter blue color than the controll group. The controll group had much more defined stripes on its body and became darker blue over time. Both groups had development of their horns, with the experimental group having a lighter pink colored horn and the controll group having a darker red horn. The p_value of the 1 tailed two-sample t_test was found to be 0.39. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was contradicted slightly in this experiment by the data collected. The average final weight of the experimental group was not less than the average weight of the controll group as expected; in fact, it eventually exceeded the weight of the controll group at the end of the experiment. However, other conditions of development did seem to be impacted by the addition of juvenile hormone, such as the coloring of the insects. The experimental group was a much lighter color, in both the body and horn, than the controll group. The time period of 14 days was enough time for the caterpillars to reach the 5th instar larva, where they are at their largest size before pupating. As stated in the University of Florida’s Featured Creatures resource guide, the Manducta sexta is an ideal species to study insect endocrinology and development. However, the larval stages of the tobacco hornworm are known to be voracious feeders. They are considered pests and difficult to controll in the environment and cause economic damage to the tobacco industry because of their affinity to eat tobacco crops. A common way for managing the pests is the use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a naturally-occurring soil bacterium that produces a protein that acts as a fatal endotoxin when consumed by the larvae [Byron: 2018]. Juvenile hormone, which we believed would extend the larval stage of the tobacco hornworm, would not be a useful agent in controllling the worm population and its habits. The hornworms given JH experienced the same developmental cycle as those without, thus leading to the conclusion that although the addition of juvenile hormone to a diet does not prevent the Manducta sexta from reaching the 5th instar larva in terms of weight and size, it does impact the development of other parts of the caterpillar, such as defined coloring, and therefore would not have an impact on the management of the tobacco hornworms as pests.

Figure Legends: 
This graph represents the average weights of each group of caterpillars over a period of four days. The experimental group, shown in blue, and the controll group, shown in red, had similar rates in growth over the two weeks. However, on the 12th day the average weight of the experimental group surpassed the average weight of the controll group.*************************************************************************
