Title: Determining the Presence of Resource Allocation of Raphanus sativus in Clay, Soil, and Gravel

Abstract:
Resources are not always in abundance for organisms in their environments. These organisms often adapt in order to obtain the necessary resources to grow and reproduce. This adaptation is referred to as resource allocation. In this experiment, Raphinus sativus, or radish plants, were tested in clay, soil, and gravel to identify which environment promoted the most necessary for resource allocation. Root:shoot ratios of lengths and weights were calculated to determine the impact of the environment on the growth of each radish plant. We hypothesized that plants in soil would have the smallest ratios, meaning their roots would grow the smallest as nutrients would be most available. The smaller root:shoot ratio indicates less resource allocation took place in that environment. Our results concluded that plants in clay had the smallest root:shoot ratio for both length, at 0.035 (± 0.018), and weight, at 0.34 (±0.1). Soil had the second smallest for weight, while gravel had the second smallest for length. An ANOVA test was run, giving us a p_value of 0.011 for the weight data and 0.0013 for our length data. The data was statistically significent meaning it did not occur by chance. 

Introduction:
The survival of organisms depend on their ability to acquire necessary resources including nutrients, sunlight, and water. An organism’s capability of obtaining resources not only affects their ability to grow, but also their reproduction and the survivability of their offspring. Resources, however, are not always readily available, which drives organisms to adapt to their environments in order to obtain the necessary components for growth and reproduction. This concept is referred to as “resource allocation”. [Boggs: 1992]. Sustenance for organisms come from either biotic or abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include temperature, weather, and/or sunlight. Biotic factors are resources derived from other living sources. Plants primarily depend on abiotic factors for survival [Lewis:2017]. Obtaining and utilizing abiotic factors can be affected by the plants environment. More specifically, a profound limiting element for plant survival could be the soils they grow in. Different textures, physicochemical properties, and spatial distributions impact the available resources and the ability to obtain these resources. Plant growth is impacted when soils have different attributes, such as density and nutrient content, since plants adapt to maximize survivability [Passioura:2002]. These characteristics of the soil might require a plant to undergo resource allocation in order to obtain the necessary nutrients from the soil. What would happen if we tested the growth impacts of different enviroments on Raphinus sativus, or radish plants? This question could be tested by comparing the root:shoot ratios radish plants in different types of soil or environments. The root:shoot ratio indicates the growth effects of resource allocation in plants. Plants with more sunlight but minimal nutrients would have larger roots to compensate, while plants with less sunlight would have longer shoots [Maskova:2018]. In this experiment, we will test how radish plants allocate their resources when growing in standard soil, gravel, and clay by comparing root:shoot ratios of both length and weight. Radish plants are suitable for this experiment because of their fast growth and easily definable root and shoot differences. We hypothesize that radish plants in soil will have the smallest R:S ratio, meaning their roots will be the shortest as common soil is abundant with nutrients. The second smallest will be clay, as the texture is denser than soil, followed by gravel as it is the least uniform environment for growth and seemingly least nutrient rich.  

Materials and Method:
5 pots each of gravel, clay, and soil were prepared resulting in 15 pots total. 3 radish seeds were placed in each pot and watered daily for the next two weeks. After the plants had necessary time to grow, they were carefully removed from their pots. All 15 plants were weighed in grams and recorded using a standard scale. Each plant was then cut at the root-shoot junctions with scissors, ensuring consistency between plants. The individual roots and shoots were weighed in grams and recorded using a scale. The individual weights of the roots and shoots were checked to ensure they add up to the initial total weight of the whole plant. The root and shoots were each measured in centimeters and recorded using a ruler. The length ratios was calculated by putting the average length of roots over the average length of shoots. The same formula was used for determining the root shoot ratio for weight, but in place for average lengths the average weights were used. The calculated rations served the dependent variable in the experimental design. An Anova test was used to statistically test our results between these ratios three groups of data were compared. 

Results:
Clay had the smallest values at 0.035 (± 0.018) for weight and 0.34 (±0.1) for length as seen in Table 1. Gravel had the largest ratio for weight at 0.67 (± 0.12), but the second smallest for length at 1 (± 0.62). Figure 1 and 2 show soil was the largest ratio for length at 1.56 (± 0.42) and the second smallest for weight at 0.23 (± 0.11). The p_value for R:S weight was 0.011. The p_value for length was 0.0031. Both of these p_values for the two data sets fall within the 95% confidence interval, meaning the data shows there were differences in the data sets due to the experiment and not by chance. 

Discussion:
	Based on the data, clay had the smallest R:S ratio for both length and width, meaning the plants in clay exhibited the least amount of root growth. Soil was the second smallest in weight and the largest in length, while gravel was the largest weight and second smallest in length. There were no definitive trends in our data aside from clay possessing the smallest ratio in both weight and length. This data did not support our hypothesis that the plants in soil would exhibit the smallest R:S ratio demonstrating the smallest amount of root growth out of the environments. Rather our data, which was statistically significent, indicates clay results in the least amount of necessary resource allocation regarding root growth to obtain nutrients. A study by S. Bokhitar provides some explanation for these results. In his study, Bokhitar tested to see what the optimal conditions would be for radish plants to sustainably grow in clay terrace soil. He found that optimal nutrient levels and frequent watering can lead to a sustainable environment for radish plants, meaning resource allocation or pressures for survival are not as great as other possible environments [Bokhitar:2006]. However, the small R:S ratios of clay could have also stemmed from experimental error. Over the two weeks, there were some inconsistencies in the watering schedule of our plants. This could have led to the plants simply not growing as much as they should have, resulting in smaller and lighter roots and shoots due to slowed development. The calculated ratios would in turn be smaller and indicate that resource allocation was not prominent, even though it was also possible that the plants were just not grown enough to demonstrate results. Though, the data being significent within the 95% confidence interval indicates this was likely not the case.
	To further our study, we could test each of these environments, but with different added nutrients to see which ones had the most profound effect on plant growth. Since our data is statistically significent, there is a difference in the environments. However, the introduction of certain nutrients such as potassium could compensate for environmental differences or be more readily helpful in one environment than others. Another helpful continuation of our study would be to test different plants to see if they demonstrate the same results as the radish plants. Furthering our experiment helps increase the understanding of the optimal conditions for certain plants to most effectively grow and reproduce. Their environment being ideal promotes survivability, which in turn increases sustainability [Boggs: 1992]. Understanding how to sustainably cultivate is important research as agriculture is the foundation and livelihood of many people. This knowledge helps increase our knowledge of plant survivability, which in turn helps increase our sustainability.
