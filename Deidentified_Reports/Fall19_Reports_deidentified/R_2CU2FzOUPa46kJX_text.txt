Title: Higher water temperatures result in increased aggressive behaviors in betta fish (Betta splendins) plants

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect increased water temperature had on aggressive behaviors displayed by Betta splendins, more commonly known as betta fish. Intraspecific behaviors, or behaviors in the presence of members of their own species, were recorded. The two types of behaviors recorded were broadside and facing behaviors. Our controll betta fish was in 19-degree Celsius water and our experimental fish was in 21-degree water. After recording baseline behaviors (between two controll betta fish) for two minutes, followed by a 5-minute break, we then recorded the behaviors of the experimental fish. Overall it was found that the controll fish displayed aggressive behaviors an average of 16.2 +/- 1.92 times whereas the experimental fish displayed aggressive behaviors an average of 29.4 +/- 3.97 times. After running a two-sample one-tailed t_test, a p_value of 0.000264 was obtained, showing significance. Our hypothesis was supported, and our findings are consistent with similar studies that attribute the increase in aggressive behaviors to increased metabolic rate and overall activity in the fish. Our studies demonstrate how increased ocean temperatures due to climate change will have the potential to disrupt and alter interactions between organisms.  



Introduction:
Betta splendins, more commonly known as betta fish, are notorious for their aggressive behaviors in the presence of other fish. Betta fish are readily found across southeast Asia in habitats such as muddy ponds, ditches and drains [Johnson, 2019]. Moreover, betta fish provide a unique opportunity to study animal behavior due to their flashy displays of aggression. The study of animal behavior, or ethology, combines various disciples from within biology. Through the use of observation skills, ethology provides insights into animal behavior, allowing researchers to better understand their environmental interactions. A critical component of ethology, is avoiding the use of human terms to describe behavior such as “nice” or “hateful.” This allows for an unbiased approach when studying animal behavior. Different animals exhibit various characters when provoked. In this experiment, betta fish will be used because of their elaborate displays in the presence of their own species. Behaviors that occur in the presence of other members of their own species are known as intraspecific behaviors [Johnson, 2019]. Betta fish exhibit many intraspecific behaviors which can be broken into two dominant types of movement: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements occur when the betta fish turns its side towards another fish. To show aggression, betta fish typically engage in pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing while turned to the side. Pelvic fin flickering occurs when the betta fish positions its pelvic fin vertically opposite to the other fish. Also, tail beating involves sudden movements with its caudal fin. The final type of broadside behavior is tail flashing which involves the opening and closing of the caudal fin. Facing behaviors involve the betta fish facing another fish. To show aggression, male betta fish will have erect pectoral fins. They also spread their gill covers and even protrude their branchiostegal membranes to show their dominance. These displays of aggressive behaviors allow for a unique opportunity to study animal behavior in betta fish. Like most sets of behaviors, the environment can play a major role in their display. For example, factors such as the presence of a mate, or food scarcity may influence the aggression shown by betta fish. In this particular experiment, we will examine the effects of increased water temperature on aggression in betta fish. We predict that the betta fish kept in warmer water, compared to the controll betta fish, will display more aggressive behaviors due to the warm water increasing its basal metabolic rate. Thus, with increased activity within the fish, more aggressive behaviors will be displayed. 

Materials and Method:
First three male betta fishes were obtained. They were housed in separate tanks and had no physical or visible contact with each other until the experiment. The controll fish’s water temperature was maintained at 19 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the experimental fishes water temperature was maintained at 21 degrees Celsius. In order to obtain baseline measurements, which was part one of our experiment, the controll betta fish was exposed to another male betta fish in the same tank, (19-degree Celsius water). They were separated using an opaque divider. The divider was removed, leaving only behind a glass divider which prevented physical contact. We chose one fish, and its broadside and facing behaviors were recorded by marking a tally for each time the behavior was observed. We solely measured the behavior of this fish. After the completion of two minutes, the opaque divider was placed back in the tank and the fish were allowed to rest for 5 minutes. This was repeated for a total of 5 trials. Then, the second part of the experiment was executed. For this, the controll fish’s tank was placed next to the experimental fish’s tank. The divider between the two tanks of the fish were then removed and broadside and facing behaviors were observed for the experimental fish for two minutes. The divider was then placed between the tanks and the fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. This experiment was repeated for a total of five trials. The independent variable in this experiment was the water temperatures (19 or 21 degrees Celsius) and the dependent variable was the display of various broadside and facing behaviors. In order to quantify the results, the total number of behaviors displayed by the experimental and controll fishes were recorded and a two-sample one-tailed t_test was used to analyze the significance of the results. We employed a p_value cutoff of 0.05 to indicate whether or not the results were significent.

Results:
Figure 1 shows the average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by the fish in the 19-degrees and 21-degrees Celsius water. The controll fish had displayed aggressive behaviors an average of 16.2 +/- 1.92 times. Moreover, the experimental fish displayed aggressive behaviors an average of 29.4 +/- 3.97 times. After running a two-sample one-tailed t_test, a p_value of 0.000264 was obtained which is significent. 

Discussion:
After concluding our experiment, our hypothesis that the betta fish in the warmer water would display more aggressive behaviors due to increased metabolic rate and activity, was supported. The higher water temperature fish had an average of 29.4 displays (+/- 3.97) of aggressive behaviors whereas the cooler, 19-degree Celsius water betta fish displayed aggressive behaviors an average of 16.2 times +/- 1.92. A p_value of 0.000264 was obtained which is below our 0.05 cutoff and thus is significent. Our results indicate that the experimental fish was more aggressive in its tank compared to the fish in the cooler tank (Figure 1). Figure 1 shows the large difference in behaviors displays and this difference provides insight into our significent p_value. In warmer waters fish typically have increased metabolic rates [Brandão: 2018]. The increase in overall metabolic rate allows for an increase in overall activity in the organism. With increased activity, the fish is more active and engaging in its environment. Furthermore, the increased temperatures result in more vivacious swimming by the fish resulting in increased aggressive encounters [Taniguchi: 1998]. With more opportunities for these encounters, an increase in aggressive behavioral displays can be noted. Our results support these previous studies as they demonstrate how the betta fish in the warmer waters display more aggressive behaviors. This study provides a picture into problems ecosystems will face when battling climate change. As our Earth continues to warm, our oceans are also increasing in temperature. Between the mid 1950’s and the mid 1990’s the heat content in our oceans increased 2 x 1023 joules [Levitus: 2000]. This large increase alters how organisms in the ocean interact with each other. Also, this increase in water temperature is not limited to just the oceans. Other large bodies of water such as lakes and streams are similarly experiencing increased temperatures. Overall this experiment will allow us to better understand how animal behavior changes in response to increased water temperature and future studies can test other types to animals and their interactions.
