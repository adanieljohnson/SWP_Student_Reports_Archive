Title: The Effects of Precor on the Growth of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
An abstract is a summary of your work that includes parts of each section of the paper. Even though it is a at the front of a report, the abstract should be the last part of the report that you write. You do not know what you need to summarize until the rest of the report has been written. In about 200 words or less, it should summarize the study's main objective(s), give the scientific name of the organism you studied, and state your hypothesis. It also will summarize the study's background, the methods, major results, and conclusions. You should not include references in your abstract.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, part of the order Lepidoptera, are affected by Juvenile Hormone because this hormone interrupts the caterpillar’s normal development. [Nijhout: 1974]. These caterpillars have two main stages of development, the pupal and larval stages, thus making them model organisms for the effects of Juvenile Hormone. As the levels of JH decrease, different stages of molting occur. Without the presence of JH, the caterpillars turn into their metamorphic phase and thus are finished developing [Browder: 2001]. In North Carolina, Manduca Sexta are considered invasive species. Precor is used as an insecticide on these species and it is an insect growth regulator that mimics hormones [Staal: 1982]. The active ingredient in Precor, Methoprene, mimics the Juvenile Hormone. Therefore, adding Precor, an IGR concentrate, interrupts the caterpillar’s normal stages of development. The purpose of this lab is to determine if Manduca Sexta caterpillar’s growth will be affected if Precor is added to their food. The hypothesis of this study is that when five drops of precor are added to each insect’s food source, their average mass will be less than the control group at the end of two weeks. 

Materials and Methods:
To set up the experiment, two containers, each with four compartments were obtained. Each compartment was labeled one through four, one as the control and the other as treatment. Then, 10 grams of food were placed in each compartment. For one of the two groups, 5 drops of water was mixed into the food. This group was the control group. The other group had 5 drops of Precor mixed into their food and this group was the treatment. These two containers were placed in an incubator. Every day for two weeks, the caterpillars were weighed and fed the same amount with the same amount of water and precor added to the perspective groups. Fecal matter was removed as necessary from the containers. 
The independent variable is the amount of precor added to the food supply. The dependent variable is the average mass of larvae. The control is the average mass of larvae not treated with Precor.
To analyze the data, a one-tailed t-test was performed to determine a p-value. This was used to determine if there was statistical significance or not. The raw data was put into a bar chart form, where error bars are added. 



Results:
The mass measurements over a two-week period of the control group was not statistically substantial from that of the experimental group (t-stat=0.983402; df=6; p-value=0.181693). Although the mass of both the control group and treatment group did increase over time, there was no notable difference between the two groups (Figure 1). The average mass gain of the treatment group was 12.178 grams and that of the control group was 9.108 grams. The average mass gained by the control and treatment groups were almost the same until day 7 when the treatment groups mass gain was more than the control group from day 7 to day 14 (figure 2). 



Discussion:
This experiment involved testing to see if the addition of Precor had an effect on the rate of growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The initial hypothesis, which was that when five drops of Precor are added to each insect’s food source, their average mass will be less than the control group at the end of two weeks, was rejected due to the statistical insignificance between the control and treatment groups. Since the p-value is less than 0.5, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is unable to be accepted. Since the caterpillars in the control group as well as the treatment group both increased in growth at about the same rate, the Precor did not appear to have an effect on the treatment group (Figure 1). Although both the control and treatment groups started out with about the same mass gain from day one to day seven, after day 7, the treatment groups mass gain was higher than the control groups mass gain, further supporting the rejection of our hypothesis (figure 2). All of the caterpillars except for one remained alive throughout the experiment. The one control caterpillar died on day 13 but was an outlier in the data from the beginning of the experiment. This outlier lowered the average mass of the control group, thus contributing to the hypothesis being false (Figure 2). The results of this experiment could be due to the low dose of the Juvenile Hormone due to the insecticide Precor [Dominick: 1984]. Precor, a Juvenile Hormone agonist, disrupts the natural development of the Manduca Sexta, thus making the caterpillars rate of growth less in the treatment group than the control group [Kingsolver,: 2007]. Studies have shown that there is a possibility that the pests in study, such as Manduca Sexta, could get used to the Precor and thus this same dosage that is continuously given to them does not affect their growth as much [Kingsolver,: 2007]. Specifically, Bruce D. Hammock’s study correlates to the results of this study because his study predicts that pests would become resistant to certain pesticides such as Precor [Hammock 1983]. This could explain why there was not a large difference between the control group of this experiment, which was just given water, and the treatment group, which had Precor added to their food (Figure 1). 
	In order to improve this experiment, one could add more drops of Precor to the treatment group. By adding even more of the hormone that affects the growth rate of these caterpillars, a greater effect might be able to be seen in the results. Another option is to measure the length as well as the mass in order to see if the length and mass growth were proportionally affected by the Precor. Additionally, one could have a bigger sample size of Manduca Sexta in both the treatment and control groups.
