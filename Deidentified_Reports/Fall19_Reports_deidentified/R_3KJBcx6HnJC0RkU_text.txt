Title: Light Dependent Effects on Growth for Vigna Radiata

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes as well as uses its limited resources. It is typically genetically determined; however, there is room for modification in response to variations in the environment from an organism's experience. In this experiment, we focused on the effect of filtering red light only on the R:S (root: shoot) length ratio and shoot length of mung beans (Vigna radiata). Our experiment aimed to determine whether or not red light would significently decrease the R:S length ratio, given that red light has been discovered to increase plant shoot growth. Mung beans were chosen as the model organism for this experiment as it grows relatively quickly, are cheap to purchase, and are able to grow in a variety of environments, making them useful in a variety of applications. We used a controll group that received all wavelengths of light and a treatment group that contained a mechanism to filter only red light for the mung beans. We found that red light does not lead to a statistically significent level, to a smaller R:S length ratio. Additionally, we found that, compared to the controll population, it does lead to longer shoot development.


Introduction:
There are many factors that affect the ability of an organism to grow into a healthy adult plant. These factors can be segregated into biotic and abiotic; biotic factors are living parts of an ecosystem whereas abiotic factors are stimuli that are nonliving components of an environment. Examples of both are fungi (biotic) and CO2 levels (abiotic). Both of these types of factors can impact how well an organism can grow, compete, and reproduce in its respective environment. Light is a specific abiotic factor that aids in a plant’s ability to undergo the process of photosynthesis. The function of roots in a plant are to absorb water and nutrients from its environment (And transporting them to the stem) as well as anchoring the plant to the soil. The stem plays a role in mineral/water transport via the xylem and phloem; finally, leaves are used to not only absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, but also for water retention as stomata can open/close in response to the organism's environment [California Foundation for Agriculture: 2019]
 A study determining the effects of red light on the growth of mung beans (Vigna radiata) has already been conducted. Previous research has shown, based on similar experimental design, that red light has a significent impact on the R:S ratio of plants. 10 (grown) plants in 3 various conditions: white, mixture red, and pure red light were tested. After an incubation period of 4 weeks, leaf area, and shoot length were measured and compared. They found that the growth under R (Pure red) wavelengths promoted stem elongation compared to W (White) and RB (Partial red). This light treatment was also responsible for the highest production of total chlorophylls [Amitrano: 2019]. This experiment is similar to ours in that we will be measuring the root: shoot lengths for Vigna radiata that were either grown in regular light or red light conditions. Mung beans (Vigna radiata) are a type of legume that grows relatively quickly during warm seasons; they are typically grown and cultivated in Asian countries and are a good source of protein, iron, and folate [L.I.S.: 2014]. The treatment group in this experiment will be exposed to the red light portion of the visible light spectrum whereas the controll group will be exposed to regular sunlight. As a result of this, we hypothesize that the treatment group will have a lower root: shoot ratio than that of the controll group as well as have longer shoots. This is because when there is less water/nutrients, resources are typically allocated to the root of a plant, so that the roots can grow longer in hopes of finding more resources, and when there is less sunlight/CO2, resources are allocated to the shoot in order to outgrow competition to receive more sunlight. Consequently, as a result of both resource allocation/the fact that the treatment group is exposed to a limited source of light, we can expect there to be longer shoots (Therefore a lower R:S ratio). 


Materials and Method:
6 nursery pots were taken and cleaned to ensure no foreign debris/material coated the surface that could potentially confound the growth for any of the plants.12 mung bean seeds (12 for each pot) were randoMly taken and dug in each pot. (Ensuring to evenly distribute the seeds across the pot). 3 Pots were randoMly selected and placed in direct sunlight, where the 3 remaining pots were placed under a red light filter, which was constructed using sticks, and red light filter paper. Plants were watered daily with 200 Ml of distilled water per nursery pot and checked each day to ensure that the 3 pots under the filter were still covered appropriately. The plants were monitored and watered over the course of 2 weeks, and after the 2 week period, were harvested. The plants were then, carefully (to ensure minimal damage), pulled from the pots. They were then washed and dried to ensure no water/dirt remained. 8 individuals were randoMly selected from both the controll and treatment populations and then weighed. The roots and shoots were then separated by cutting them at their root: shoot junction. Root shoot length, weight and R:S ratio for length and weight were measured and calculated by using a digital scale and or ruler. After values were recorded, 2, 2-sample-1-tailed-t_tests were run to compare R:S length ratio and max shoot length for the controll and treatment groups.

Results:
On average, the R:S weight ratio was determined to be higher for the treatment group (0.96 ± 0.54), compared to that of the controll group (0.57± 0.30), yielding a percent difference of 50.98%, we can see that the plants for the treatment group not only weighed more on average but also had longer shoot lengths. Furthermore, the R:S length ratio is lower for the treatment group (0.77 ± 0.2) compared to that of the controll group (0.81 ± 0.49), on average. The average root length was also found to be longer in the treatment group (10.9 ± 3.1) compared to that of the controll group (8.1 ± 5.02). Figure 1 displays the notion that the average root length was longer for the treatment group compared to that of the controll group. Figure 2 shows that the average R:S length ratio was higher for the controll group compared to that of the treatment group.  Finally, for both the treatment and the controll groups, the recorded data that had the highest calculated standard deviation is the max root length that was measured for each replicate, the lowest standard deviations that were recorded for both groups were for the weight of the roots. 2, 2-sample-one tailed-t_tests were conducted, one for R:S length ratio and one for max shoot length. For the t_test regarding R:S length ratio, a p_value of 0.449 was received. For the t_test regarding shoot length, a p_value of 0.047 was determined.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that the treatment group will have a lower R:S length ratio than that of the controll group as well as have longer shoots. After conducting the experiment as well as the appropriate statistical tests, the two-sample t_test for R:S length ratio displayed a p_value greater than that of alpha of 0.05, and as a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no statistical evidence to support the alternative. We anticipated the ratio being smaller in the treatment group since they receive less sunlight compared to the controll group and consequently will want to allot their resources into extending their shoots so that they can receive more sunlight. The opposite case can be made for the two-sample t_test for shoot length displayed a p_value less than that of alpha; consequently, we reject the null hypothesis, as there is statistical evidence to support the alternative. We can expect the shoots for the treatment group to be longer as a result of being exposed to a limited source of light (limited in wavelength) and as a result of this, having to outgrow competing plants in order to receive more sunlight. The second t_test is in accordance with the experiment conducted by Dr.Amitrano as well as they also determined that exposure to pure red light will lead to longer shoot development [Amitrano: 2019]. However, although we did expect the treatment group to have longer shoots, we also anticipated for it to have a lower R:S length ratio; after experimentation and testing, we can see that this is not the case. Although the two-sample t_test for shoot length displays that there is a significent difference between the shoot length for the treatment and controll group (in that the treatment group was larger), which would lead to a smaller R:S ratio since the denominator would be larger, we can see that the root length for the treatment group is also relatively larger (by approximately 2 cm) balancing this change. This notion suggests that not only the shoots but rather, the organisms as a whole (roots and shoots) grew under red light conditions. The large difference in p_values could be explained by the small sample size, however, more trials of the experiment would need to be conducted to say for sure. Although previous research has shown that red light leads to a statistically significent difference in R:S length ratios, our experiment is relatively inconclusive in that although, overall, shoot length was longer for the red-light group, R:S length ratio was not different between the controll and treatment groups. For furthering experimental design, in the future, one could potentially test the effect of varying the intensity of specific colors, aside from changing the wavelength of light that the organisms receive initially.
