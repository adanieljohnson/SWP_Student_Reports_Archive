Title: Effect of Martin’s I.G. Regulator on Manduca caterpillar instar growth changes

Abstract:
This experiment set out to determine the effect that Martin’s I.G. Regulator has on the growth of Manduca sexta (also known as Tobacco Hornworms) over a period of two weeks. Manduca caterpillars exposed to Martin’s I.G.R. through their food were expected to display a significantly lower change in mass than those exposed to only water. The mass of each caterpillar exposed to Martin’s I.G.R. along with the mass of each caterpillar exposed to only water was taken each day. The differences in mass over each day were then taken in order to calculate average changes in mass for each caterpillar. It was found that there was no significant difference in the average mass differences between the two groups.  



Introduction:
Insects have long since posed a threat to commercial agriculture. In response to this, professional farmers, as well as amateur gardeners, employ a wide range of pesticides and growth regulators in order to protect their crops and plants from destruction by insects (pests). Understanding the life cycle of unwanted pests can give a better insight on how to eliminate them. Juvenile hormone (JH) is able to inhibit metamorphosis caused by molting hormones in instar stage insects [Li et al: 2018]. JH signaling works by signaling an intracellular receptor, a ligand-binding transcription factor known as Methoprene-tolerant [Jindra, Bittova: 2019].  Juvenile hormone analogs (JHA) have similar morphological and biosynthetic effects on developing larvae, making them capable regulating insect growth [Fiaz et al: 2019]. Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator (Martin’s I.G.R.) is an over-the-counter JH analog, which prevents the development of larvae into adults [Fourrier et al: 2015]. In this lab, we set out to determine the effect that the ingestion of Martin’s I.G.R. would have on Manduca caterpillar instars. We predicted that the Manduca caterpillars treated with the growth regulator would display a significantly lower amount of growth, as measured through average mass change over a period of time. 


Materials and Methods:
A total of eight Manduca caterpillar instars were used in the experiment. The caterpillars were split into two groups of four, the control group (C1… C4) and the treatment group (T1… T4). The two groups were placed into identical plastic containers, each with four partitions for each of the four caterpillars per group. Two holes were poked into the outside of each partition, allowing the caterpillars to breathe. Ten grams of pre-mixed caterpillar food were measured out and pushed up against the corner of each partition. Each control group caterpillar’s food mound was treated with five drops of deionized water. Each treatment group caterpillar’s food mound was treated with five drops of Martin’s I.G. Regulator. Both plastic containers along with the eight subjects were placed in an incubator. Each caterpillar’s mass was taken every day for a period of two weeks (fourteen days). Food was replaced whenever a subject ran out, and waste was disposed of each day. The change in mass for each subject over the testing period was then taken and recorded. A two-tailed, two sample t-test was used to test for significant difference in the mass differences between the control and treatment groups. 



Results:
The data indicate that the control experienced greater changes in mass on average than that of the treatment group. The treatment group had an average mass change of 10.36, while the control group had an average mass change of 13.06 (Figure 1). The mean mass difference of the control group was not significantly higher than that of the treatment group (t = 0.748, df = 6, p = 0.483). 

Discussion:
Because the results did not indicate a significant difference between the average amount of growth experienced by the control and treatment groups, our hypothesis was not supported. While the control group did display a greater average change in mass than the treatment group, the difference in those values was not significant, implying that the changes in average mass were due to random chance and not due to the presence of Martin’s I.G.R. One potential reason for this is that one of the control group caterpillars (C3) did not grow, and remained roughly the same size for the duration of the experiment, gaining mass on some days and even losing it on others. The developmental growth process in animals is controlled by the expression of coordinated genes and microRNAs, including miR-252, a microRNA that responds to ecdysone, the molting hormone [Lim et al: 2019]. While it is difficult to pinpoint what exactly limited subject C3’s growth, it was most likely due to a mutation involving gene expression or hormone secretion. A repetition of this experiment is certainly worth performing, as it would test whether or not our results would be significant if all caterpillars displayed normal amounts of growth, as opposed to the outlier seen in the control group.
