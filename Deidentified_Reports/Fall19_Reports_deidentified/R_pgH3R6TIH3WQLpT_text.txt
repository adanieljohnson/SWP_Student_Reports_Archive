Title: Effects of High Temperatures on Photosystem II Activity of Spinach oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is an essential aspect of plant function and one effective way to measure this is the activity of photosystem II. We should be concerned with the ability of plants to utilize photosynthesis in many conditions including extreme temperatures. When analyzing photosystem II activity in Spinach oleracea there was not a significant difference found in photosystem II activity between warm and room temperature conditions.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is an essential aspect of the function of plants as it is their primary way to harvest energy. This process occurs in the chloroplasts and involves a series of chemical reactions stemmed by contact with light. These reactions can be broken into groups known as photosystems; photosystem II can be analyzed to predict the effectiveness of photosynthesis for a given plant in certain conditions. We can analyze photosystem II by using an alternative electron acceptor to be reduced as opposed to the oxygen typically used by photosystem II. This process is called a Hill Reaction and one key electron acceptor is DCIP which in its non-reduced form is blue but once reduced it becomes colorless. Therefore, we can expect that if photosynthesis is occurring, we will see less color from the samples, this can be tested using spectrophotometry [Photosynthesis:2019]. One condition of interest is the temperature at which the reactions occur and the impact they create on the rate of the reactions. One plant we can use to study this is Spinach oleracea, otherwise known as the leafy green spinach [Spinacia oleracea:2019]. Previous studies have shown that at higher temperatures the photosystem II activity to reduce DCPIP has declined [Mathur:2011]. When analyzing the effect of temperature on the photosystem II activity, we hypothesize that at higher temperatures we will see decreased photosystem II activity and therefore less decrease in absorbance readings. 

Materials and Methods:
To test the activity of photosystem II we collected 4 medium size leaves of Spinacia oleracea from a container obtained from a grocery store. These leaves were then ground for 5 minutes in 400 mM Sucrose in Tricine Buffer at pH 8, an additional 10mL was added after this period and the spinach was ground until it was a smooth liquid with no remaining leave chunks. This slurry was then strained through 2 layers of cheesecloth. This strained solution is then placed in a 50mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then transferred to a new 50mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then poured into a third 50mL tube and then the remaining pellet was resuspended in 20mL of 400 mM Sucrose in Tricine Buffer at pH 8. This solution contained the highest concentration of chloroplasts where the aspects of photosystem II are found.
 We then used this to create the samples as described in Table 1 using distilled water, 130mM DCIP, and a 100mM phosphate reaction buffer at pH of 6.5. The solution designated for 48°C was placed in a warm water bath monitored by thermometer. The samples were lit by using a table lamp with a wavelength between 380-740nm and a measured light intensity of 3595.15 lux. The remaining samples were kept at room temperature measured by thermometer as 21°C. These samples were also lit by a table lamp and at an adjusted distance to provide a light intensity of 3595.15 lux and wavelength between 380-740nm by a separate lamp. 
A spectrophotometer was set to 600nm and blanked using the listed blank solution in Table 1. Initial absorbance readings were taken using the blanked spectrophotometer at wavelength of 600nm after 10 minutes of light exposure. Absorbance readings were taken every 10 minutes for 30 minutes after this initial reading. These values were then used to calculate percent change between the initial value and the current value using the formula [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero] x 100%. Averages were taken for all percent change values at each time point. The percent change values after 30 minutes were then used in a two sample, one tailed t-test to analyze if there was a significant difference, represented by a p-value less than 0.05, between the change in absorbance for the 21°C and 48°C samples. 




Results:
The percent change between initial and 30-minute absorbance readings for the negative control sample was found to be 3.06% ± 2.69% (Figure 1). The percent change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the room temperature sample was -3.87% ± 2.74% and for the 48°C sample percent change was found to be -1.32% ± 4.93% (Figure 1). The one tailed, two sample t-test comparing samples at 21°C and 48°C gave results (p=0.138, degrees of freedom=4, and t=1.259). 

Discussion:
Data shows that there was not a significant difference between the samples at 21°C and 48°C. This tells us that roughly the same amount of DCIP was reduced to a colorless formation in each sample. This tells us that the activity of photosystem II was the roughly the same for both the warm and room temperature samples. This tells us that the proteins and other systems involved in the reactions and movement of molecules in photosystem II are still in the proper folded form to correctly function. This tells us that temperatures as high as 48°C do not cause the non-covalent interactions of the proteins to be broken. However, this goes against the results of Mathur which decreased reduced DCIP levels at increasing temperature levels [Mathur:2011]. The results of Mathur point to the proteins denaturing at 45°C which is not in line with our results. This discrepancy may be explained by error in the absorbance readings of our Spectrophotometer as when analyzing our data visually we see that the negative control tubes were significantly darker than the tubes that contained chloroplasts, however, these tubes showed absorbance readings nearly the same. This may indicate our spectrophotometer was not properly functioning, inhibiting us to see the changes occurring in our samples.
