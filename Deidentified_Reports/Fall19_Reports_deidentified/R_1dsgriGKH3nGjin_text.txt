Title: The Effect of JH Hormone on the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
.

Introduction:
Our study involves Manduca Sexta. Due to their easily accesible nervous system and short life cycle, they are a common model organism in biology. The life cycle of a Manduca Sexta is an example of a holometabolous life cycle, which  includes egg, larva stage, pupa, and finally an adult. Growth and development throughout these stages is dependent on both hormone based signaling and neuron based signaling. There are three main hormones in insects, including the prothoracicotropic hormone, the ecdysterone, and the juvenile hormone [Reinecke:1980]. Our experiment focuses primarily on the juvenile hormone which is produced by the corpus allatum, and is responsible for regulating the type of molt during development, as well as controlling many functions in an adult insect. We hypothesized that if a group of larva is fed 4 drops of precor juvenile hormone, then that group will molt slower than the larva not treated with extra juvenile hormone. [Browder: 2001]


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we used eight larva, four were used as the contorl group, and four were used as the experimental group. Each larva was separated and received 10 grams of food. The experimental group received food that had been treated with 4 drops of precor JH hormone, while the other four larva in our control group, recieved their food with four drops of water. This way, both the experimental and control groups recieved the same amount of food with the same consistency. We recordered the weight of each individual caterpillar everyday, and our results will be interpreted using a two-tailed test. 


Results:
Standard Deviation: Control- 2.68g   JH Treatment Group: 1.58 
Two-tailed P-value:  .205305 
On average, the control group weighed less at the end of the experiment compared to the experimental group which was treated with the JH hormone. 



Discussion:
Since our P-value was greater than .05, our data is not scientifically significant. However, on a more primitive level, there were noticeable differences between the control and experimental groups. We concluded that our hypothesis, which predicted that the larva treated with the extra JH hormone would molt slower in comparison to the control group, was correct because there were early signs of molting within the control group.  Based on our results, it is evident that JH hormone causes caterpillars to gain weight more rapidly. The correlation between weight and juvenile hormone is further discussed in the article cited below. Browder discusses the “critical weight” which defines the time at which JH is no longer secreted.  [Browder: 2001] Although it appeared as though the control group was beginning to molt, given the time frame of the experiment, it was difficult to confidently determine whether or not the JH hormone has a significant effect on the molting specifically. If we were to repeat this experiment, we would most likely have changed our hypothesis to predict the effect of Juvenile Hormone on the weight of caterpillars, rather than testing the effect of the JH hormone on their molting rate.
