Title: The Influence of Dyed Water on Agonistic Behaviors in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Intraspecific agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins are common in demonstrating the importance of animal behavior in ecology. These agnostic behaviors are intrinsic, and while they occur with any other member of the species, the level of aggression depends on sex and coloration. Two dark blue male Betta splendins were placed in a tank, and the duration of tail beating, tail flashing, and the red mane were observed over three trials where both fish were in clear water, and three trials where one was in water dyed red and the other was in clear water. The results of our study found a significent difference in the duration of tail beating and tail flashing for both fish, while there was no significent difference between the duration of the red mane for both fish. The results of this study show the influence of texture, coloration, and the potential impact pollution has on Betta splendins agnostic behavior.

Introduction:
One of the most studied aspects of ecology is animal behavior, and one of the most effective ways of studying behavior is through observation. Betta splendins is a fish commonly used to study intraspecific behaviors because of its natural tendency of aggression towards other members of the species, as well as its ease of access and ability to be maintained easily in a lab setting. This natural aggression of Bettas is due to males being the assigned protectors of the nest after a female has laid her eggs, so the territorial nature causes heightened aggression when any other member of the species is near, regardless if it is familiar or not, or if it is male or female [Alyan: 2010]. However, the level of aggression in males can vary depending on the sex and coloration of the other Betta [Gelacio: 2019]. Bettas express aggression, or agnostic behaviors,  in two main ways: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, while facing movements include an erect pectoral fin, spread gill covers, and an extension of the operculum membrane called the ‘red mane’. Once a Betta has exhibited one or multiple of these agnostic behaviors, the opposing Betta can either flee, ignore the behavior, match the behavior, or exhibit a behavior that is more agnostic. In this experiment, we wanted to focus on how coloration affects aggression levels in two male Betta splendins. We hypothesized that if one Betta is in a tank with red-dyed water, both of the male Bettas’ abilities to detect agnostic behavior from the other will decrease, resulting in an overall decrease of agnostic behavior when compared to two male Betta splendins in normal, clear water. 

Materials and Method:
Two dark blue male Betta splendins were put in a tank, separated by an opaque partition and a clear partition. For three minutes, the opaque partition was removed between the Bettas and three agnostic behaviors (tail beating, tail flashing, and the ‘red mane’) as well as their type (broadside or facing) were recorded, as well as their duration in minutes. The clear partition remained between the fish to prevent physical contact and potential injury to the fish. After the period of three minutes, the opaque partition was replaced for five minutes to prevent exposing the fish to excess stress. This process was repeated over six trials. In the first three trials, both fish were in clear filtered water. In the final three trials, one of the tank sections was dyed with four drops of red food dye. The fish in this section was labeled as Fish 2, while the fish in the clear section was labeled Fish 1. The duration times of the agnostic behaviors for both the fish were compared using a paired t_test with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
The results of our experiment show that Fish 1 had a significent difference in duration of tail beating and tail flashing between the controll and experimental trials with a p_value of 0.02 with two degrees of freedom, as well as Fish 2, with a p_value of 0.02 with two degrees of freedom. However, Fish 1 did not show a significent difference between the controll and experimental groups when exhibiting the red mane behavior with a p_value of 0.88 and two degrees of freedom, and neither did Fish 2 with a p_value of 0.75 and two degrees of freedom.
Our general observations found that during each trial, the two Bettas would cycle between agnostic behaviors and ignoring one another. We also found that if one was exhibiting a broadside behavior, the other was more likely to assume a facing position. We also saw a difference in the number of times the Bettas engaged in the agnostic behaviors, as well as a difference in the initial onset of recognition, followed by agnostic behavior.



Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the tail beating and tail flashing data, but the data from the red mane observations was too varied to support or reject our hypothesis. To fix this, another experiment with more trials would be better suited to find out if coloration impacts red mane behaviors. The difference in tail beating and tail flashing is most likely due to the difference in coloration. In previous studies, it has been shown that male Betta fish are more likely to exhibit agnostic behaviors towards an opponent that is more similar in color rather than one who is very different in color [Gelacio: 2019]. Although several studies have confirmed this pattern of behavior, why this occurs is not well understood. Bettas are more likely to exhibit agnostic behaviors towards an opponent who is exhibiting the same behaviors, shown in the results of a study done with several other fish [Johnson: 1973]. This could imply that Bettas of different colors are seen as less of a threat, or could be an indicator of preference in agnostic behavior between Bettas of different color, and therefore illicit less agnostic behavior. The results could also be a result of an inhibition of the Bettas’ vision. The red dye in the tank made the water cloudy, making it more difficult for the fish to see each other. Texture such as scales, color, and brightness influence the exhibition of agnostic behavior in Betta splendins, so the inhibition of the ability to detect these aspects could have influenced the decrease in agnostic behavior [Bando: 1991]. The results of this study reinforce the effects of pollution on the environment and animal behavior. Several studies have shown instances where a change in color or visibility in the water can influence other fish behaviors, such as reproduction [Jones: 1997]. Preventing pollution and taking measures to rid aquatic environments of current pollutants is important in protecting the natural behaviors of fish and the environment itself.
