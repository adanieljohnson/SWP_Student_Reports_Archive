Title: The Effects of Varying levels of Soil Concentration on the Resource Allocation in Rahpanus sativus

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a vital process to the survival and reproduction of plant life and has major implications for the agricultural industry and dietary foundations of a vast number of organisms. It was initially hypothesized that Rahpanus sativus exposed to soil with higher acidic concentration (independent variable) will have a greater shoot length (dependent variable) as compared to those exposed to lower concentrations acidic soil. Using Rahpanus sativus exposed to two varying levels of acidic vermiculite concentration and compared to that of a controlled group not exposed to acidic vermiculite, the average lengths of the roots and shoots were taken and used to calculate root:shoot ratios and conduct an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer statistical test. The result of the ANOVA test generated a p-value (p = 0.002288) which is indicative of there being no significant difference between our data for the average root:shoot ratios. The results of the Tukey-Kramer statistical test showed no statistical difference between the control group and treatment 1 group. It also showed a statistical difference between the control and treatment group 2 as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2. This data indicates that the resources in the Rahpanus sativusof this study were alloated 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is a vital process to the survival and perpetuation of plant life. It is the means by which the plants are able to obtain the necessary nutrients that they need in order to sustain life.  This study was aimed at studying the relationship between vermiculite acidity concentration and the growth of a radish plant (Rahpanus sativus). Studies have shown that certain plants maximize resource allocation and survival in certain conditions, one being determined by pH levels in the soil, [Soti:2015]. With an understanding of resource allocation and the role of acidic soil concentration on plant growth, it was hypothesized that Rahpanus sativus exposed to soil with higher acidic concentration (independent variable) will have a greater shoot length (dependent variable) as compared to those exposed to lower concentrations acidic soil because of the maximization of biomass to occur at functional regions of the plant and typically away from the acidic soil. This study is relevant in that it grapples with maximizing plant growth and the intricacies resource allocation, which are the basis for the agricultural industry and essentially food for a vast number of organisms on earth. 

Materials and Methods:
In conducting this study, the first step was to collect nine plastic trays and fill them with vermiculite. Then three Rahpanus sativus seeds needed to be placed in each of the nine trays. Afterwards, the vermiculite in each of the trays needed to be saturated with 100mL of MiracleGrow followed by a saturation of water until the vermiculite is uniformly soaked and moist to the touch. Next, the trays needed to be split into three groups and exposed to their respective treatment. For the control group, the soil was soaked with only water. For treatment 1 (pH3.01 HCL 5mL) the tray needed to be soaked with water and 5mL of pH3.01 HCL. For treatment 2 (pH3.01 HCL 10mL) the tray needed to be soaked with water and 10mL of pH3.01 HCL. The water saturation and respective treatment exposure steps were repeated daily for two weeks and the trays were kept in a greenhouse with exposure to sunlight. At the end of the two week period, the plants were removed from the vermiculite by removing the plant and soil from the tray and soaking them until water until the plants roots were free of any vermiculite. The root and shoot lengths were then precisely measured with a ruler and their respective lengths were recorded. An ANOVA and tukey-kramer statistical test was run on the average root:shoot ratios calculated from our measurements. All statistical results were recorded.

Results:
The ANOVA test generated a p-value (p = 0.002288) indicating that there is a significant difference in our data for our mean root:shoot ratios (Figure 1). Additionally, the Tukey-Kramer statistical test did not show a statistical difference between the control group and the treatment 1 group (pH3.01 HCL 5mL) for the mean root:shoot ratios. The Tukey-Kramer statistical test did, however, show a statistical difference between the mean  root:shoot ratios of the control group and that of the treatment 2 group (pH3.01 HCL 10mL) as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2 (Table 1). 

Discussion:
The results of the ANOVA test generated a p-value (p = 0.002288) which is indicative of there being no significant difference between our data for the average root:shoot ratios. Similar studies have demonstrated results indicative of the same result suggesting that plants will have root:shoot ratios similar to that of varying regions with varying soil makeups [Walters:1983]. The results of the Tukey-Kramer statistical test showed no statistical difference between the control group and treatment 1 group. It also showed a statistical difference between the control and treatment group 2 as well as between treatment group 1 and treatment group 2. This data indicates that the plants allocated more resources to the roots as compared to that of the shoots. The results of our statistical tests indicate that our hypothesis was not supported. This conclusion is believed to be the result of the root system responding plastically to the most viable external nutrient supply [Dunbabin: 2002]. The implications of these results could suggest that the acidic concentration of the vermiculite that the Rahpanus sativus plants were exposed to was not the ideal environment in which to properly study the plants resource allocation processes. In future studies, a more operationalized set of procedures could be helpful, in addition to many more trials, in drawing conclusions about the relationship between this particular plant and the acidic concentration of its soil.
