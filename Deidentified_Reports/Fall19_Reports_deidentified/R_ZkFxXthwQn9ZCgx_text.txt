Title: Effect of Phosphorus and Nitrogen on the Root and Shoot Growth of Mung Beans

Abstract:
In the agriculture industry and every day gardening, the use of added nutrient solution is widely used to efficiently and effectively grow produce. Specifically, since nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur are necessary nutrients, certain environments lack such nutrients. Under stresses, plants will allocate their resources based on costs and benefits.Thus, we measured the root and shoot length of mung bean plants, Vigna radiata, after treating four different groups with phosphorus, nitrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus, and control group. Thus, we hypothesize that if we treat separate groups of mung bean plants with nitrogen, phosphorus, nitrogen and phosphorus, or nothing, then the root length will be the greatest in the nitrogen treated group. We found there was no significant data between the phosphorus-treated group, nitrogen-treated group, and control, but there is significant data between combination treated group and control group. 

Introduction:
Plant growth is affected by abiotic and biotic factors including community plant interactions. When there is resource limitation, plants have evolved to use a growth defence  called resources allocation and trade-offs. Resources allocation describes the process in which the species limit resources to structures on the organism that do not gather enough sunlight or energy that help the organism survive, meaning it will limit resources to the structures of the plant that help survival. This is also leads to trade-off when a plant redistributes resources from one structure to another structure to reduce wasted energy. Plants allocation patterns vary based on the environment, limiting nutrients, and structures such as leaves, roots, and stems. The roots gather nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, and water from the soil. The stems allocate the water, nutrients, glucose, and energy throughout the plants for new growth and storage [Johnson: 2018]. Specifically phosphorus is used for synthesis of ATP which in turn is used for the uptake for nitrogen, and nitrogen is used for amino acid synthesis [Malik et al.: 2003]. Thus Nitrogen and Phosphorus can be used in combination or alone, depending on the plant, to increase yield and quality of the produce. For example, phosphorus is important in the formation of carbohydrates, diseases resistance, maturation of crop, and root development [Arya: 1988]. There are specific concentrations that help ideal growth without damaging the plant or causing excessive growth. 
	The plant Vigna radiata, or mung bean plant, were used in this experience for its versatility. It is ideally able to growth is dark, warm, moist environments, and they are cheap, small, and grow in compact environments. Phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are nutrient requirements for mung beans that must be added through fertilizer if deficient in soil [Oplinger et al.: 1997]. Nitrogen and Phosphorus are essential for protein synthesis of proteins and cellular function. Thus, In our experiment, we wanted to test how phosphorus, nitrogen, and a combination may affect the length of growth of roots and shoots in mung bean plants based on the fact that these are necessary nutrients. We predict that there will be a positive correlation with adding phosphorus and nitrogen separately. 

Materials and Methods:
48 mung beans were soaked in water for 24 hours. We used 2 pots for each group labeled control, Phosphorus-treated, Phosphorus & Nitrogen-treated, and Nitrogen-treated. For every pot, we filled it soil, soaked them in water, and let the excess water drain. We made three holes spread apart in each pot and placed 2 seeds in each hole then covered with soil. For the Phosphorus-treated group, we treated with water and 50 mL of phosphorus solution of 20% P2O5. For the Nitrogen-treated group, we treated the plant with water and 50 mL of nitrogen solution of 32% nitrate. For the Phosphorus & Nitrogen-treated group, we treated it with water and 25 mL of nitrogen solution and 25 mL of P2O5. We repeated this process every day. After 2 weeks of growth, we harvested the plants without tearing the roots off the stem, washed the dirt off the roots, dried them with a paper towel, and measured in centimeters the length of the roots, shoots, and calculate the root-to-shoot ratio. We made sure to measure every root up to the change in color on the stem to keep consistency. Finally after gathering the data, we used the ANOVA test to measure the significance of the data. 


Results:
According to Table 1, the results showed the control group with the greatest growth for root length ( avg=11.5±4.18 cm ) and shoot length ( avg=8.75±1.65 cm), and it had the smallest root to shoot ratio (avg=1.31±0.30). As seen in Figure 1 and 2, the control group had the most growth for root and shoot length. The combination treated group of nitrogen and phosphorus had resulted in having the least growth of root length (avg=8.5±4.09 cm) and shoot length (avg=2.5±2.17 cm) with the greatest difference in root to shoot length ratio (avg=3.4±1.65). According to the ANOVA test, for root length had no significant correlation between the 4 groups (p value = 0.565). For shoot length, there was one significant correlation between the combination-treated group and the control group, but the other comparisons had no significance (p value = 0.041). 

Discussion:
We were looking at the effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on the plant growth and how the plant will allocate those resources. However, according to the ANOVA test proving there is no significance between our data, we cannot prove our hypothesis because we wanted to prove that phosphorus and nitrogen had a significant effect on length growth. Through our data, we cannot prove there is significant effect of nitrogen and phosphorus on root length, but our shoot length data has significance, so it can be a reference in our explanation. We do know that there is a negative correlation between the combination-treated group of phosphorus and nitrogen to the control group, meaning both nutrients added together does not produce as much growth as the control group did without any additives. One of the problems that was encountered in our experiment would be the fact that certain nutrients added in certain concentrations allow the plant to grow ideally. According to previous experiments, there is a significant effect of nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizer that affects the number of grains per pod, the weight, and the number of pods [Malik et al.: 2003]. The composition of mungbean seeds are 24.0% protein, 1-3% fat, and 50.4% carbohydrates, and phosphorus accounts for 367mg per 100 grams of seed, meaning that nitrogen is needed more in concentration than phosphorus [Phoehlman 1991]. However, nitrogen and phosphorus can be used together to increase yield and improve the quality of the produce; increasing phosphorus uptake increases the nitrogen uptake and protein content of mung beans [Dewanfan, 1992]. Moreover, mung beans plants can be used for Nitrogen fixation through symbiosis, improving the quality of the soil, which may conflict with the growth of mung beans with excessive nitrogen added[Malik: 2003]. This information proves that nitrogen and phosphorus are needed in specific concentrations. 
Ours results proved to be insignificant through the anova testing. This means there could have been room for error or that nitrogen and phosphorus are not needed in that concentration. For example, there could have been other nutrients leached, too much water, too much sunlight, pests could intervene, too humid; they could have been human errors, abiotic, or biotic errors; also, this could also mean that nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus are needed in a certain concentration with a threshold that when it goes over the threshold it can actually hurt the plant and decrease efficacy for growth. For the first week, most of our plants did not grow, except for 3 seed from the control which is not enough for data, so we had to replant 3 seeds in each pot at the beginning of the second week. If we were to redo this experiment again, we would test the different concentrations of nitrogen solutions and phosphorus solutions on the mung beans plant to see which concentration gives the best growth results. 
Overall, this experiment relates to the agricultural industry because it focuses on the best way to biologically improve the growth of the plants with efficiency. Sometimes the plants may not get all the nutrients needed to grow; moreover, the root to length ratio may vary too much based on where the nutrients are absorbed and used, which is where using the optimal concentrations of nutrients would be beneficial in industrial agricultural farming.
