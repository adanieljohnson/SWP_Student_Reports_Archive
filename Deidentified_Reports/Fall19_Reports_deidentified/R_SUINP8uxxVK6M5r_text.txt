Title: Light Dependent Effects on Growth for Vigna Radiata

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes as well as uses its limited resources. It is usually genetically determined; however, there is room for modification in response to variations in the environment from an organism's experience. In this experiment, we focused on the effect of filtering red light only on the R:S (Root:Shoot) length ratio and shoot length of mung beans (Vigna radiata). Our experiment aimed to determine whether or not red light would significantly decrease the R:S length ratio, given that red light has been discovered to increase plant shoot growth. Mung Beans were chosen as the model organism for this experiment as it grows relatively quickly, are cheap to purchase, and are able to grow in a variety of environments, making them useful in a variety of applications. We used a control group that received all wavelengths of light and a treatment group that contained a mechanism to filter only red light for the mung beans. We found that red light does not lead to a statistically significant level, to a smaller R:S length ratio. Additionally, we found that, compared to the control population, it does lead to longer shoot development.

Introduction:
There are many factors that affect the ability for an organism to grow into a healthy adult plant. These factors can be segregated into biotic and abiotic; biotic factors are living parts of an ecosystem whereas abiotic factors are stimuli that are nonliving components of an environment. Examples of both are fungi (biotic) and CO2 levels (abiotic). Both of these types of factors can impact how well an organism can grow, compete, and reproduce in its respective environment. Light is a specific abiotic factor that aids in a plant’s ability to undergo the process of photosynthesis. Light absorbed by chlorophyll in the leaves and then used in the light reactions; the light energy provided by the sun is used by the chlorophyll in the thylakoid discs to generate ATP as well as NADH via photosystem 1 and 2, where the light energy is converted to electrical potential energy in the form of high energy electrons (Nature Publishing Group).
 Prior to the conduction of this experiment, previous research has already been done. Dr.Amitrano at the  University of Naples Federico II conducted a very similar experiment; they took mung beans (Vigna radiata) and planted 10 (grown) plants in 3 various conditions: white, mixture red, and pure red light. After an incubation period of 4 weeks, leaf area, and shoot length were measured and compared. They found that the growth under R (Pure red) wavelengths promoted stem elongation compared to W and RB. This light treatment was also responsible for the highest production of total chlorophylls. This experiment is similar to ours in that we will be measuring the root/shoot lengths for Vigna radiata that were either grown in regular light or red light only conditions. The treatment group in this experiment will only be exposed to the red light portion of the visible light spectrum whereas the control group will be exposed to all wavelengths. As a result of this, we hypothesize that the treatment group will have a lower root/shoot ratio than that of the control group as well as have longer shoots. This is because when there is less water/nutrients, resources are typically allocated to the root of a plant, and when there is less sunlight/CO2, resources are allocated to the shoot. Consequently, as a result of both resource allocation/the fact that the treatment group is exposed to a limited source of light, we can expect there to be longer shoots (Therefore a lower R:S ratio). 

Materials and Methods:
To start, take 6 nursery pots and clean them to ensure no foreign debris/material coats the surface that can potentially confound the growth for any of the plants. Take 12 mung bean seeds (12 for each pot) and, randomly, plant them in each pot, digging a small hole for the seed about 1 inch in with your fingers (Ensuring to evenly distribute the seeds across the pot). Randomly select 3 pots and place them in direct sunlight, then place the other 3 under a red light filter, which can be constructed using sticks, and red light filter paper. Water the plants daily with 200 mL of distilled water per nursery pot, checking each day to ensure that the 3 pots under the filter are still covered appropriately. Watch, monitor and water the plants daily over the course of 2 weeks. After the 2 week period, harvest all of the plants for both the control and the treatment group by pulling them with the provided medium out of their respective pot.  Wash and dry the plants, ensuring no dirt/water is still on them. Randomly select 8 individuals from the control and treatment populations and proceed to weigh the plant as a whole and record their weights. Separate the shoots from the roots. (Do this by cutting them at their root/shoot junction).Weigh the shoots/roots and record the data. Then calculate/record the root mass (Total mass - shoot mass). Then measure the root/shoot length and record the mean value for each group
After recording values, run 2, 2 sample, one-tailed t-tests to compare the R:S length ratio and max shoot length for the control and treatment groups.


Results:
Comparing tables 1 and 2, we can see that, on average, the R:S weight ratio is higher for the treatment group (0.96) compared to that of the control group (0.57)On average the plants for the treatment group not only weighed more, but also had longer shoot lengths. Looking again at tables 1 and 2 we are able to note that the R:S height ratio is lower for the, on average, treatment group (0.77) compared to that of the control group (0.81)For both the treatment and the control groups, the recorded data that has the highest standard deviation is the max root length that was measured for each replicate.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that the treatment group will have a lower root/shoot ratio than that of the control group as well as have longer shoots. After conducting the experiment as well as the statistical tests we found a p-value of 0.444974 when comparing the average R:S length ratio; this value is greater than that of alpha, and as a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis as there is no statistical evidence to support the alternative. The opposite case can be made for the 2nd 2 sample (one-tailed) - t-test as we received a p-value of 0.047628 (Comparing the average shoot length), since this value is less than that of alpha, we reject the null hypothesis, as there is statistical evidence to support the alternative. We can expect the shoots for the treatment group to be longer as a result of being exposed to a limited source of light (limited in wavelength) and as a result of this, have to outgrow competing plants in order to receive sunlight. The p-value indicated by the 2nd t-test supports the notion statistically in that red light will cause Vigna Radiata to have longer shoots compared to without it. The 2nd t-test is in accordance with the experiment conducted by Dr.Amitrano as well as they also determined that exposure to pure red light will lead to longer shoot development. However, although we did expect the treatment group to have longer shoots, we also anticipated for it to have a lower R:S length ratio; after experimentation and testing, we can see that this is not the case. Although the 2nd 2 - sample (one-tailed) - t-test displays that there is a significant difference between the shoot length for the treatment and control group (in that the treatment group was larger), which would lead to a smaller R:S ratio since the denominator would be larger, we can see that the root length for the treatment group is also relatively larger (by approximately 2 cm) balancing this change. This notion suggests that not only the shoots, but rather, the organisms as a whole (roots and shoots) grew under red light conditions. The large difference in p and alpha values could be explained by the small sample size, however, more trials of the experiment would need to be conducted to say for sure. For furthering experimental design, in the future, one could potentially test the effect of varying the intensity of specific colors, aside from changing the wavelength of light that the organisms receive initially.
