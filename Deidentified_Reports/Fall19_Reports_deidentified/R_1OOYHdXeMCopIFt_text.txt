Title: The Effect of Temperature on Plant Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Plant interactions, both intra- and inter-specific, largely center around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, water, and nitrogen. Environmental limitations of these resources lead species to make trade-offs with regard to resource allocation, which can be measured via root:shoot ratio. It was hypothesized that an elevated temperature would cause less resource allocation to the shoot of the plants, resulting in lower biomass and length, procuring a higher root:shoot ratio. The weight and length of mungbean plants grown over two weeks were determined for a control and experimental group, and the root:shoot ratio calculated for each. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the root:shoot ratio for neither weight nor length between the control and experimental groups. Previous studies have explored mungbean’s ability to withstand high temperatures, and further explored the synergistic effects of drought in conjunction with elevated temperatures. 

Introduction:
In all ecological communities, plants and animals interact with the biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. Plant interactions, both intra- and inter-specific, largely center around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, water, and nitrogen. Limits of these resources affects what species are present in a community. Selective pressures lead species to make certain trade-offs when it comes to resource allocation. A species may put more energy into growing a certain structure, and thus reduce energy allocation and mass elsewhere [Johnson: 2019].
	The resource allocation of species is determined genetically but is not totally fixed; there is room for variation in response to disparities in environments. Resource allocation can be measured in several ways. One common method is the root:shoot ratio, where the biomass or length of the roots is divided by that of the shoot. In environments where it behooves a plant to have longer roots, perhaps to obtain more water or nutrients, the root to shoot ratio would be larger, as the length/biomass of the roots would presumably be larger if more energy is appropriated to them. If the environment was such that the plant would benefit from having larger leaves/stem, the root:shoot ratio would be smaller, because the length/biomass of the shoots would presumably be larger with more energy allocated to them [Johnson: 2019]. 
	The effects of various environmental conditions on energy allocation can be observed in Vigna radiata, or mungbean. This experiment specifically focused on the root:shoot ratio of mungbean plants in normal greenhouse temperatures compared to that of plants in elevated temperature conditions. High temperature is a significant abiotic stressor that becomes the limiting factor for normal plant growth and productivity [Hayat: 2010]. The optimum average temperature for mungbean is between 28 and 30°C; higher temperature affects the photosynthetic function of the plant by its effect on the rate of chemical reactions and on structural organization [Karim: 2003]. It was hypothesized that an elevated temperature would thus cause less resource allocation to the shoot of the plants resulting in a higher root:shoot ratio. 

Materials and Methods:
Approximately ten mungbean were planted in each of three bins of soil as the control group. The bins were placed in a greenhouse with a temperature of approximately 29°C for fourteen days and watered daily. The plants were carefully harvested and washed/dryed at the end of this period. The individual plants were weighed and the data recorded. The mungbean were cut at the root-shoot junction, and the shoots were weighed. The root mass was found by subtracting the shoot mass from the total mass. The lengths of the roots and shoots were measured for each plant. The root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were found by dividing the root value by the shoot value. The mean value and standard deviation were determined for all components measured. The same process was repeated for mungbean grown on a heated pad, the experimental group, which elevated the temperature conditions to approximately 38°C. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine if the results were statistically significant.

Results:
The data shows that the average of the experimental group root:shoot weight ratio was not significantly higher than that of the control group (p = 0.26) (Figure 1). The data also shows that the average of the experimental group of root:shoot length ratio was not significantly higher than that of the control group (p = 0.20) (Figure 2). The control group saw more plants (n=18) than the experimental group (n=10) germinate, but this did not significantly impact the range of standard deviations. There were no discernible general trends in the data. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicate that the hypothesis should be rejected. When grown under elevated temperature conditions, the biomass of the shoots was not affected enough to significantly increase the root:shoot ratio in neither weight nor length when compared to the control. The mungbean were thus not allocating significantly more energy to the shoot structures than the roots. Upon review of other studies, it was determined that mungbean plants can survive regimens of high temperature and constant root temperatures up to 42°C with no effect. Temperature records of Pakistani soil, where mungbean grow, shows that the top 10 cm of the soil is frequently exposed to temperatures above 38°C and up to 48°C [Hafeez: 1991]. The growing conditions of the elevated temperature plant were in this range. The plants’ habituation to warm temperatures may explain why no significant change in energy allocation was measured. Further literature also explores the synergistic effect of increased temperature and drought on plant growth; the combined effect is stronger than the effects of each alone [Lipiec: 2013]. An additional logical experiment could thus be to explore the impacts of drought combined with higher temperatures, perhaps those expected to be seen in the future with global climate change, on mungbean or other plant species.
