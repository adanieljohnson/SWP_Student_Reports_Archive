Title: Effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a moth that is present throughout most of America. The moth has a relatively quick molting period and life cycle, which makes it a very common and useful model organism for an array of studies. Commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, the M. sexta goes through various pupal, or instar, stages in which its levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH) are relatively high before it molts. JH is known mostly for restricting ecdysone levels, in order to prevent the organism from molting [Safranek: 1980]. When M. sexta is ready to begin the molting process, JH levels reduce drastically and another hormone (20E) spikes which allows for the molting process to begin and for adult structures to develop on the organism. Treating the pupae with higher than normal JH levels, through food, is likely to result in a failure to begin the molting process and cause a significantly larger mass than those not treated. Rather than beginning the molting process, the treatment group is expected to enter a fifth instar phase and become larger-than-normal pupae [Johnson: 2016].  


Materials and Methods:
Eight pupae in similar instar phases were obtained and divided into a control and a treatment group, with four organisms in each. After separating the groups, the pupae were individually placed into four-welled containers. 10 grams of food for each organism was measured and placed into the respective wells. Those organisms in the treatment group received 10mL of the JH hormone mixed into their food, while those untreated received an equal amount of distilled water mixed into their food. The organisms were maintained in a chamber with appropriate temperature. Each pupae was weighed every day for two weeks. After two weeks, the mass differences between the groups was observed. Additionally, photos were taken every day to observe any obvious differences in appearance. A two-sample, one-sided t-test was used to compare the final difference in masses of the groups. 


Results:
The results of this experiment did not show a significant difference in the final masses of the experimental and control groups  (t=0.51956, df=6, p=0.310986) with an alpha level of 0.05. The graph shows the average mass of both groups after two weeks. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis. At the end of two weeks, there was no significant difference in the masses of the treated and control groups. No conclusion about  the addition of Juvenile Hormone to the organisms’ food having an effect on the growth and completion of instar phases of the organism can be made from this experiment. In addition to no observable difference in the size, there was a difference in coloration of the control and treatment groups to the naked eye; the treatment group became much more pale that the control group, which remained a brighter blue. More research and time is necessary to see the full effects of the Juvenile Hormone on the instar phases of M. sexta. Since the maximum amount of JH was given to the organisms, this could have had potentially negative effects on the organisms’ ability to even complete daily functions and sustain life. An additional study reports that JH may first delay development before it begins to accelerate development in the organism [Safranek 1980]. Additionally, the starting instar phases of the organisms were similar but not exactly the same, which could result in each individual organism preparing to molt at different times during the experiment; in an attempt to remedy this, more time could be spent treating and observing the groups, to ensure that every organism reaches the final instar phase.
