Title: Effect of Decoy Habituation on Aggressive Response Times of ¬Betta splendins

Abstract:
	Behaviors is a key aspect in the study of any species or organism. Understanding how they work can provide insight as to why or how they developed. An important part of understanding behavior is the idea of habituation to various stimuli. An important behavior in many species is that of mate selection and competition. In the species Betta splendins, betta fish, this interaction is present in the aggression of males to each other within the species. In this experiment we studied the effect of habituation to two different decoy male betta fish on the time it took the experimental fish to display aggressive behavior to another living betta fish. We predicted that after brief periods of habituation to a decoy the response time of aggressive behavior to another male would increase in comparison to controll time without any decoy habituation. Our hypothesis was not supported by our data suggesting brief habituation to a decoy does not significently increase or affect response time of aggressive behavior. This information is important in understanding both how habituation affects betta fish behavior, but also behavior of other species who display male interspecies aggression. 

Introduction:
	Understanding behavior is incredibly important in the study of any species. This can refer to any actions of an organism for any number of reasons: reaction to predator or prey, mating interaction, competition for land or mates, response to environmental change, etc. One of these that differs fairly from species to species is aggressive behavior between males of the same species usually over mate choice. One organism that displays this behavior with an agnostic sequence, a defined set of easily identifiable aggressive behaviors or indicators of aggression, is Betta splendins commonly referred to as the betta fish or Siamese fighting fish [Bronstein: 1981]. Understanding how and why organisms such as the betta fish behave aggressively in the presence of other male betta fish can help broaden and deepen the understanding of other interspecies aggressive behaviors involving mate competition or other reasons. An additional part of understanding behavior is the idea of habituation. Habituation refers the idea that organisms can become accustomed or nulled to the presence of certain stimuli after prolonged or repetitive exposure to them [Peeke: 1970]. Habituation involves the changing of certain behaviors, even natural behaviors. This idea can be applied to nearly all species including humans as this is a basic level of learning over time. In this lab we examined the time it took for Bets fish to display agressive behavior towards another male with and without periods of habituation to a decoy male. Betta fish have been shown to become habituated to mirror images of themselves over extended periods of time and have an easily identifiable agnostic sequence, so they are a model organism for this experiment [Peeke: 1970]. They additionally are fairly low maintenance and inexpensive fish, so they can be easily and safely used in a laboratory setting. Because the betta fish are expected to become habituated to the presence of another male after exposure to a decoy, we hypothesized that the time it took for the betta fish to display aggressive behavior would increase after exposure to a decoy male. 

Materials and Method:
	For this experiment we tested three conditions, two involving habituation using a decoy and one controll without any habituation. The two forms of habituation involved two different decoys; one using a blue, three-dimensional, realistic decoy, and the other using a less realistic, red, two-dimensional decoy. We carried out five trials for each condition recording the time of each first instance of aggressive/agnostic behavior. For the controll trials two male betta fish were kept in a divided tank, so they were physically and visually separated. One fish would be the experimental fish and the other would simple be used to generate aggressive behavior in the experimental fish. For to first trial of the controll trials the fish were left separated for 5 minutes after which the barrier was removed. A timer recorded how long it took the experimental fish to behave aggressively after which the fish were separated and the barrier was replaced. The fish were then left separated for three minutes before the barrier was removed again. This was repeated a total of five times followed by a rest period of ten minutes of separation. The two trial sets involving isolation were then preformed in the same manor of the controll trials except during the five minute and then three minute separation periods between each trial, the decoy was placed in section of the tank containing the experimental fish. The decoy was removed at the same time as the barrier in each trial, and another ten minute rest period was given after each set of five trials. We then placed the data from the three trial sets into two different one-tailed two sample t_tests to determine if the times of first aggressive behavior were significently greater than those of the controll. One t_test compared the controll trials to those involving the less realistic decoy, and the other compared the controll trials to those involving the more realistic decoy. 

Results:
	The mean response time for the controll trials was 18.4 sec while those of the red decoy set and blue decoy set were 6.2 and 11.6 respectively. After running this data through the two t_tests the p_value between the controll and red decoy trial sets was 0.090, and that of the controll and blue decoy trial groups was 0.22. This does not show a significent difference between either experimental set and the controll set. Additionally, there appeared to be a general downward slope in response time for each set as the trial progressed (figures 1 & 2).

Discussion:
	Our hypothesis that the two trial sets in which the experimental Betta splendins were habituated using a decoy would have longer times before exhibiting aggressive/agnostic behavior compared to the controll group was not supported by our data. Our data shows p_values greater than the 0.05 level for both experimental sets. Thus, we must reject our alternate hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis. This suggests that short periods of habituation immediately prior to interaction with other males of the same species does not significently increase or affect the time it takes to exhibit aggressive behavior. Additionally, it was interesting to see that while still insignificent, the average response times for both experimental groups were less than that of the controll set. This is the exact opposite of the trend we predicted. This is surprising considering previous experiments on the same species have shown habituation decreasing response times. These experiments, however, involved habituation using the experimental fish’s reflection in a mirror and where carried out over much longer periods of time [Peeke: 1970], [Thompson: 1965]. To better test our hypothesis, this experiment should likely be tested over a period of several days involving much larger periods of habituation to a decoy in order to gather more data. Nevertheless, this understanding of the lack of response time variation after brief periods of habituation is important for understanding aggressive behaviors and reactions in both betta fish and other species. Understanding behaviors such as these is key to understanding interactions between and among species in the wild. Many of these behaviors are critical to the survival of the species they exist in. Gaining insight into why these behaviors have developed is imperative in understanding the evolution and adaptation of various species over time.
