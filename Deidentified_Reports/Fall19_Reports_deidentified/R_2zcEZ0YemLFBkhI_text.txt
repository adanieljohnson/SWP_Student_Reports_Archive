Title: Resource Allocation and Phenotypic Plasticity of Mung Bean Seeds in Spacious and Cramped Conditions

Abstract:
Organisms rely on resource allocation to help maximize the amount of limited resources around them. Plants such as mung beans solve this problem through phenotypic plasticity which allows for them to develop different patterns of root and shoot grow. Mung bean, Vigna radiat, seeds placed into spacious environments will have both longer and bigger shoots compared to mung beans seeds placed into cramped environments. Our results had a one tailed P-value of  0.010 and 0.0003. Therefore mung beans do use trade-offs to help maximize the limited amount of resources available to them.


Introduction:
In ecological environments organisms rely on their adaptations to survive and reproduce with both the biotic, living, and abiotic, non-living, influences. These influences contribute to how organisms interact with the environment from reproduction, energy capture, and growth. Since natural resources are limited, and there tends to be high birth rates, organisms struggle with mortality. In order to overcome mortality organisms develop various niches and strategies to survive. A common strategy to solve this issue is resource allocation and trade-offs. Organisms develop patterns of phenotypic plasticity such as in the case of plants, growing deeper roots to obtain more water at the cost of less shoots for photosynthesis in a dry environment. This can be seen through the species Retama sphaerocarpa, which when placed into different competition intensities, and facilitation change along gradients of amounts of resources, showed that plant interactions in terms of growth are dynamic [Pugnaire: 2003]. In our experiments we are examining intra-species competition between mung bean plants, Vigna radiata, with other mung bean plants. We are examining how mung bean plants use trade-offs, in terms of shoots and roots when placed into cramped environments compared to spacious environments. Our hypothesis is that mung bean seeds placed into spacious environments will have a higher root to shoot ratio compared to mung bean seeds placed into cramped environments because of the lack of competition for resources. Our null hypothesis is that there is no difference in root and shoot growth.  


Materials and Methods:
Seventy-two mung bean seeds were selected at random and were placed into square planter pots.. Twelve mung bean seeds were placed into a single plant potter for a total of three sets. Six mung bean seeds were placed into a single plant potter for a total of six sets. The mung bean seeds were placed into the vermiculite while being completely submerged, and were equal distance from one another. Then the soil was moistened. The control group and experimental group were placed into a greenhouse and allowed to grow for two weeks, while watering them everyday. After the two week growing period, ten plants from the control and experimental groups were selected at random. The entire mass of the mung bean was obtained by placing in onto a scale. The roots were then separated from the shoots by being cut at the root-shoot junction. The shoot weight was obtained by subtracting the total plant weight by the shoot weight. Both the shoot length and root length were measured by using a ruler to the nearest centimeter. The root to shoot weight and length ratios were calculated. The significance of these values were measured by using a one-tailed t-test were the alpha value was 0.05.


Results:
The experimental group had both a greater root to shoot weight ratio and a greater root to shoot length ratio compared to the control group. Figure 1 shows the root to shoot weight ratio.The one tailed t-test results where: (DF: 18, t-value: 2.531, and One tailed P-value: 0.010). Figure 2 shows the root to shoot length ratio. The one tailed t-test results where: (DF: 18, t-value: 4.116, and One tailed P-value: 0.0003). Overall the experimental group had longer and bigger roots and the control group had longer and bigger shoots.

Discussion:
    Our hypothesis was supported, mung bean seeds placed into a spacious environment have a greater root to shoot ratio compared to mung bean seeds placed into cramped environments. Also our null hypothesis was rejected. Mung bean seeds that were in the experimental group of six of six had both longer and more root mass. Mung bean seeds that were in the control group of three of twelve had both longer and more shoot mass. This makes sense because the group of twelve had less resources per plant in the soil, where they all had more resources available by growing longer and bigger shoots. The group of six had more resources per plant in the soil and therefore grew longer and bigger root systems in order to maximize resource consumption.The ideal space between mung bean seeds to allow for the maximum amount of harvest is 40 x 15 cm from an economic standpoint [Birhanu: 2018]. The reason why this happens is due to phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity allows organisms that all have the same genetics to change their physical properties based on the world around them. The group of twelve grew longer and bigger shoots because that's where the most resources were available to them; the same can be said for the group of six. Natural resources are limited so species try to change and adapt to fit their current environment. The mung bean plants would trade off and use resource allocation in order to obtain more resources from the soil or from the sun. A future experiment could focus on how other plants may or may not also relies on phenotypic plasticity and resource allocation.
