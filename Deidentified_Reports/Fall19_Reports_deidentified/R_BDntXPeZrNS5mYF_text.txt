Title: JH Hormone in 3rd Instar Tobacco Hornworms 

Abstract:
n/a 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm or sphinx moth, are an excellent choice for a experiment on endocrine controll in insects, as they are easily found in this environment, and have a relatively short life cycle. They are part of a group of insects with holometabolous life cycles, which features four main life stages.  These are the embryonic stage, five larval substages, the pupa and finally, the adult moth stage [Reinecke: 1980]. In order to move from one stage to another, the insect goes through pupa metamorphosis, and in turn, no major life stages look similar. The larval stage, the main focus of this lab, is characterized by vermiform, soft bodies, blue-green in color. They have mandibles, prolegs and crochets, while the pupa is characterized by the change to a straw like mouth part, and the first development of small wings [LabManual:2019].
This development is controllled by hormones, present at different levels in the larva. Two main hormones that are responsible for development and molting in hornworms are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Riddiford:2012]. They work together, so that 20E controlls which type of molt will occur and JH controlls when the molt occurs [Wigglesworth: 1940].  The concentration ratio of the two chemical signals determines which stage of life the animal is in [Riddiford:2007]. In general, as the insect gets ready to molt, there is a rise in 20E hormone, which triggers the molt [Truman: 1981]. JH hormone remains at high concentrations during the larval stage and only begins to fall as the larva enters the 4th instar phase. This drastic decrease in JH during the 5th instar stage, triggers the final molt towards the pupa, and change in physical features. If JH were to remain present in the organism at a high level, the change to the pupal stage would be prevented [Kiguchi: 1978]. An important ratio of the two hormones is known as the Commitment Pulse, when the JH level has dropped significanlty in the 5th instar phase, but there is a slight rise in 20E [LabManual:2019]. This event allows the caterpillar to move to the pupa stage, and would only occur if the caterpillar was large enough and capable of moving forward in the life stage. Both hormones continue to play a major role in the development and behavior of the insects in both the pupa and adult stages [LabManual:2019]. In contrast, another theory suggests that JH also has an effect on 20E, acting as an inhibitor to the 20E [Safranek: 1980].
In this experiment, we hypothesized that if we treat 3rd instar horn worm larvae with 10 drops JH hormone, then they will gain more mass than caterpillars without the treatment because the JH hormone level will remain too high to signal a commitment pulse, preventing a molt into the pupa phase.   


Materials and Method:
Eight tobacco horn worm larva in the 3rd instar stage were selected for the experiment. Caterpillars were selected so that they had similar size and coloration. Four caterpillars were designated “controll group” organisms, and four caterpillars were designated “treatment group organisms”. Both groups of caterpillars were given 10 grams of caterpillar food. The controll group caterpillars’ food was mixed with 10 drops of water, while the treatment group caterpillars’ food was treated with 10 drops of 1:250 JH hormone solution. Each caterpillar was then placed in a plastic well with food for observation. The caterpillars were massed daily and the wells cleaned daily. During daily checks, if the caterpillar had eaten all of the food in the well, it was replaced with a new 10 gram block mixed with the according solution. The caterpillar wells were kept in an incubator for two weeks while being monitered, until they were properly disposed of. After two weeks, a 2 sample T-Test with a p_value of .05 was used to determine if the results of the trial were significent. 

Results:
Qualitatively, after the two weeks, the treatment group caterpillars were very pale in color and almost white. The characteristic black and white stripes were barely visible (Figure 1). The controll caterpillars remained bright teal, with defined black and white stripes (Figure 2).Between the two groups, little difference in growth was shown between the two groups. The growth, in terms of mass gained, over the two week period for each caterpillar is shown in Table 1. A two-sample t_test was used to determine the sigificance of of the results. The average weight gained by the treatment group caterpillars was not statistically significent different than the wieght gained by the controll group (t_stat = 1.49, d.f.=6, P = .039). A one-tailed P value was used.

Discussion:
Since the results are not significently signifcant, the hypothesis that the controll group will not grow as much as the experimental group can not be supported. In Rhodnius Prolixus, fifth instar juveniles that received JH hormone injections did not produce adult features but instead molted to a sixth, supernumerary instar phase. In the hornworm experiment, similar results were expected, as the treatment group would instead of beginnging to pupate, grow to be larger than that of the controll group. However, this did not occur. A possible reason for the results could be the starting instar phase of the caterpillars. Although they had similar beginning masses (Table 1), the caterpillars could have been in different developmental stages, not allowing for accurate comparison of growth. JH hormone controlls when adult features develop, and no caterpillars in our trial developed adult features, suggesting the possibility that the caterpillars did not have enough time to grow, and reach a late enough instar phase. 
	Research has suggested that JH hormone may actually act as a 20E inhibitor [Safranek: 1980], preventing the caterpillars from molting into the next instar phase. If this was the case, the treatment caterpillars would grow more similarily to the controll group, because the extra JH inhibits the caterpillar from molting to the supernumerary phase. Also, some of the treatment caterpillars did not grow as much as the controll caterpillars, suggesting that the JH may have inhibited the 20E from causing a molt to the next instar stage.  
	The treatment caterpillars became discolored after the two weeks of treatment. The discoloration could suggest a developmental issue within the caterpillars caused by the excessive amount of JH hormone they received. There is a possibility that 10 drops of the JH hormone was too much for the caterpillars to withstand, and they were unable to continue to develop. This also helps provide evidence towards the idea that JH acts as a 20E inhibitor, as the discoloration could suggest that development had been stopped. 
	The trial should be repeated to have more information on the amount of mass the caterpillars gained over two weeks, and if the treatment group would still grow similarily to the controll group. Repetition of the trial would provide more information on how the JH hormone effects caterpillar growth if 10 drops is given. Our results suggest that 10 drops is too much extra hormone for the caterpillar endocrine system to take, but further research is necessary to provide more evidence.
