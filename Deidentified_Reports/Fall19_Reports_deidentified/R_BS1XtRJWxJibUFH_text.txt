Title: Effect of temperature on root and shoot growth in Vigna radiata: a study in resource allocation 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effects of temperature on resource allocation in Vigna radiata (mungbean) plants, specifically root growth, over a two week period. Our original hypothesis stated that the mungbean group exposed to higher temperatures will have longer roots and therefore a greater root:shoot ratio than the group exposed to lower temperatures, as they will allocate resources to a greater root system in order to make up for increased transpiration rates from higher temperatures. However, this hypothesis was not supported as the lower temperature group had a mean greater root length (and R:S ratio) than the higher temperature group. This is due to the fact that mungbeans are found in higher temperature climates and are therefore acclimated to drastic changes in temperature, decreasing the need for resource allocation that often occurs as a result of sudden environmental changes. Despite these results, the data was found to be statistically significant. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of temperature on resource allocation and root growth in Vigna radiata (mungbean). Resource allocation refers to the pattern and methods in which plants distribute limited resources, often growing in the direction of the limited resource [Johnson: 2019]. Such allocation can be measured through an organism’s root:shoot ratio, or the biomass of the shoot divided by the biomass of the root, which can change over time based on nutrients available and abiotic factors such as temperature. In cases of extreme hot weather, plants tend to allocate energy to their roots in order to make up for high transpiration rates and water loss, if no other outside factors are limiting the physiological activity [Oertli: 1996]. Vigna radiata, the organism used in the experiment, is classified as a warm-season grain, meaning it must be grown in temperatures exceeding 15 degrees celsius, a factor taken into account when selected. Its primary purpose serves both as a cover crop as well as a commercial field crop [Imrie: 1996]. As growth changes are measured based on varying temperatures, the experimental group will be placed in a higher temperature environment than the control group, with temperature acting as the independent variable and root length acting as the dependent variable. The mungbean group exposed to higher temperatures will have longer roots and therefore a greater root:shoot ratio than the group exposed to lower temperatures, as they will allocate resources to a greater root system in order to make up for increased transpiration rates from higher temperatures. 

Materials and Methods:
Twenty four Vigna radiata (mungbean) seeds were planted and divided up evenly into two groups to measure the effect of temperature on resource allocation and root growth. The control group was placed in a greenhouse at room temperature while the experimental group was placed in an incubator at around 48 degrees celsius. To prep the seeds pre-planting, both groups were soaked in water 24 hours in advance. Once ready for planting, they were divided into two groups and placed in medium sized trays, each within an individual indentation, and covered with vermiculite. Each seed was watered daily and qualitatively monitored for a two week period. After the two week growth period, plants were gently harvested, washed and dried in order to be weighed. Each plant was then divided at the root-shoot junction, with the shoots and roots weighed separately and added to find the total weight of each plant (in grams). Root/shoots were also measured separately for length (in inches) and compared. The root measurement was then divided by the shoot measurement to provide a ratio representation of the comparison between root and shoot lengths (root:shoot ratio). The data was analyzed using a one-tailed two-sample t-test. 

Results:
After the two week growth period, root and shoot lengths of each group were averaged and calculated to find the root:shoot (R:S) ratio. Two one-tailed two-sample t-test were used to analyze the results of root length, as well as the overall R:S ratio, between the control and experimental groups. It was discovered that the greenhouse plants (control) had longer roots and a greater root:shoot ratio compared to the incubator plants (experimental). While the average root length for the greenhouse plants was 17.89 cm, with a mean R:S ratio of 1.77 cm, the average length of the incubator roots was 13.33 cm with a R:S ratio of 0.961. The data was found to be significant for root length (p=0.0006) and the R:S ratio (p=0.0002). While the results were significant, mean length and R:S ratio between the groups differed only slightly.

Discussion:
The original hypothesis stating that the incubator group exposed to higher temperatures will have longer roots (and therefore a greater root:shoot ratio), was not supported as the mean length of roots in the incubator group was found to be lower than the group exposed to room temperature conditions. However, our null hypothesis was rejected as the data was found to be significant. A possible reason for this result might be that while the higher temperature group may have experienced greater transpiration rates that allowed for some resource allocation and root growth, the greenhouse plants received increased amounts of sunlight compared to the incubator group which caused them to ultimately grow to be bigger over the course of two weeks, due to positive abiotic stimuli, regardless of temperature conditions. This could also be due to the fact that Vigna radiata plants are typically found in hotter areas, usually Southeast Asia, and are therefore acclimated to higher temperatures, causing them to not drastically alter allocation patterns in higher temperatures as alternative mechanisms for reserving water have been developed over time, decreasing the need for short-term root growth [Karim: 2003]. Future experiments should be conducted which measure resource allocation in identical temperatures and conditions, but with cold-climate acclimated organisms to compare growth and allocation strategies between the warm-season grain studied here. Information on root length and resource allocation is important when regarding nutrient rich agricultural plants such as Vigna radiata, which are often consumed for their high protein and fiber content. Farmers use information on such allocation when considering the best conditions to maximize crop growth and survival in varying temperature and elevation conditions.

The control group was placed in a greenhouse at room temperature while experimental group was placed in an incubator at 48 degrees celsius, each group was watered and monitored daily. The statistical difference is shown as root length (cm) was found to be slightly varied between the two groups. (t-value: 3.79, p-value: 0.0006, sd: 1.0).

Figure 2: Comparison between average root:shoot (R:S) length ratios between control and experimental Vigna radiata plants grown over two weeks. The control group was placed in a greenhouse at room temperature while experimental group was placed in an incubator at 48 degrees celsius, each group was watered and monitored daily. R:S ratios were measured by dividing average root length by average shoot length in both groups. Similarly to root length, the statistical difference can be seen as the mean R:S ratio slightly differed between the groups. (t-value: 4.32, p-value: 0.0002, sd: 1.0).*************************************************************************
