Title: Application of 16% nitrogen solution to Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) decreases root growth relative to shoot growth

Abstract:
Plants utilize multiple resources, such as nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide in order to allocate energy for use in physiological processes. We hypothesize that if Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plants are grown in a nitrogen-rich environment, then their root to shoot weight and length ratios will be lower than those of plants not exposed to excess nitrogen. We tested this with two groups of six plants. The controll group received 200 Ml of water every day for two weeks, while the experimental group received 200 Ml of 16% nitrogen solution. We found that the experimental group had lower root to shoot length and weight ratios than the controll. This was determined to be significent with a two-sample t_test that produced p_values of 4.55×10^(-6) and 0.0075 respectively. This confirmed the initial hypothesis. Future studies may examine how different concentrations of nitrogen or different sources of nitrogen affect plant growth, as this will become increasingly important due to climate change. 

Introduction:
Plants utilize multiple resources in order to allocate energy for use in physiological processes. The leaves absorb both solar radiation and carbon dioxide, whereas the roots absorb water and nutrients, such as phosphate and nitrate. Dinitrogen in the air is fixed in the soil where bacteria can convert ammonium ions into nitrate to be absorbed by plant roots. Nitrogen is a critical nutrient for plants as it serves important roles in multiple metabolic systems, such as photosynthesis and the electron transport chain, and it is essential for the synthesis of macromolecules like proteins and nucleic acids [Novoa: 1981]. 
The availability of resources such as nitrogen can affect the way plants allocate energy. One of the ways this may manifest is in phenotypic plasticity, a term that refers to the way a plant’s appearance can change in response to challenges posed by the environment [Johnson: 2019]. For example, in a process known as positive phototaxis, when plants are placed in limited sunlight, they will grow toward a light source so that their leaves can receive maximum exposure to solar radiation. This is one way plants can alter their phenotype in response to a limited resource, such as photons from sunlight [Jekely: 2009]. Our understanding of how plants adapt to extreme environmental conditions will become increasingly relevant as climate change and global warming continue to impact delicate ecosystems. 
	The concept of phenotypic plasticity based on the availability of resources in the soil has been studied extensively for decades. For example, research has demonstrated that buckwheat plants show more growth in soil with a high phosphate content [Armiger: 1957]. Buckwheat is a member of the Polygonaceae family and is a critical crop in Asia and North America [Logacheva: 2011]. Buckwheat was an ideal model system for this plant study, as it is easy to grow and is relatively inexpensive. We hypothesize that if Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plants are grown in a nitrogen-rich environment, then their root to shoot weight and length ratios will be lower than those of plants not exposed to excess nitrogen.


Materials and Method:
We gathered six planting pots full of vermiculite. Three of these containers were labelled “controll” and the other three “experimental.” Twelve buckwheat seeds were dispersed throughout each container and pushed below the soil. These six pots were then placed in a controllled greenhouse for two weeks. The three controll pots received 200Ml of water each daily. Whereas, the three experimental pots were watered with 200Ml of 16% nitrate dilution every day.
Two weeks after planting, the buckwheat was removed from its container by placing the blocks of vermiculite in water until the soil softened and could be pulled away without breaking the roots. Two plants were separated from each container (6 per treatment group) and patted dry to remove any excess water. The replicates were measured individually with a scale. Their masses were then recorded in grams. The roots and shoots were then separated using scissors, and the shoots were measured individually on the scale. These masses were recorded, and root mass was determined by subtracting the shoot weight from the total plant weight. The root and shoot weights were compared for each plant as a ratio. 
	The length of each shoot was measured in centimeters using a ruler and recorded. The length of the roots was measured as well. These values were compared as root to shoot length rations. The average root to shoot weight and length rations were compared for the six controll replicates and six experimental replicates using a two-sample, one-tailed t_test. 


Results:
In general, we found that the R:S ratios were smaller in the experimental group for both length and weight (Fig. 1). The average R:S weight ratio for the controll group was 0.56 ± 0.18, while it was 0.28 ± 0.16 for the experimental group. Additionally, the average R:S length ratio for the controll group was 1.21 ± 0.18, while the average ratio was 0.54 ± 0.08 for the experimental group. There was also less variation in the experimental group, as the standard deviation values were lower than that of the controll group. 

We compared the average R:S length ratios of both treatment groups using a two-sample, one-tail t_test and found a p_value of 4.55×10^(-6) (t_stat = 8.24, d.f. = 10, P = 4.55×10^(-6)). Our group then compared the average R:S weight ratios of the controll and experimental groups with a two-sample, one-tailed t_test. We found a p_value of 0.0075 (t_stat = 2.9312, d.f. = 10, P = 0.0075).


Discussion:
The results of this study supported our initial hypothesis. When comparing the average root to shoot weight ratios of controll and experimental plants we found that the experimental ratio was significently lower with a p_value of 0.0075. In addition, the average root to shoot length ratio was significently smaller as well, as the p_value of 4.55×10^(-6). Therefore, we were able to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that these results were significent. 
	Both ratios may be smaller because by watering the experimental plants with 16% nitrogen solution, we increased the nitrogen concentration in the soil and the amount of nutrients that the buckwheat plants were able to absorb through their roots. Because these nutrients were so readily available to the roots, the plants allocated more energy toward shoot growth, resulting in smaller root to shoot ratios. 
	In the future, this experiment could be expanded upon by evaluating plant growth ratios in the presence of different concentrations of nitrogen. For example, we could look at how root to shoot ratios change when the buckwheat is watered with 32% nitrogen solution relative to 16%. Experiments such as this are important because understanding how the environment and access to resources affects plant growth could play a major role in agriculture in the coming decades. As climate change and industrialization progresses, agricultural yields may decrease because of pollution and deforestation. For example, a 2018 study examined nitrogen deposition in the soil. Over the past century, increasing amounts of ammonium have been released by factories [Liming: 2018]. Therefore, it is important to understand how plants utilize different nitrogen sources like ammonium and nitrate. Researchers found that uptake of ammonium led to increased root growth, while the uptake of nitrate resulted in increased shoot growth. Information like this could be utilized to determine which crops could grow successfully in a particular climate.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average root to shoot ratios of Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plants. Root to shoot weight ratio was calculated from the average mass of plant roots divided by average mass of plant shoots. Root to shoot length ratio was calculated by dividing the average root length by average shoot length. This was done for both the controll group (blue) and the experimental group (orange). For both groups n=6. Standard deviation is displayed in bars for each group.  *************************************************************************
