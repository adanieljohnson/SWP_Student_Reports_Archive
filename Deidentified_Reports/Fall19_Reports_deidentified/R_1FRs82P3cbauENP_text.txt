Title: Effects of Azaguard on the Manduca Sexta Larva

Abstract:
This experiment tests the effects of the insecticide Azaguard on the insect Manduca Sexta. These insects produce hormones are certain levels in order to maintain its natural life cycle, and a disruption of this leads to abnormalities. Azaguard prevents the molting of larvae, and therefore led to minimal weight gain to those larvae that were exposed to it. Those exposed also died before the end of the observation period, showing the lethal outcome that hormone disruptors can have.


Introduction:
The Manduct Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera and is more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. The life cycle of this insect is about 19-23 days, which includes five instar phases as larvae and a pupa phase, before developing into an adult moth. The main hormones that assist in development, molting, and forming of the pupa include Ecdysterone, which regulates molting, and Juvenile Hormone, which at high levels, keeps the larvae from forming into a pupa. These hormones work together to time out the development of this insect with the insects being subjected to developmental abnormalities if levels are experimentally altered. For the larvae to begin its transition to a pupa, the commitment pulse must occur, which happens when the ecdysterone levels rise and the juvenile hormone drops simultaneously [Johnson: 2019]. The insecticide Azaguard is a chemical used to prevent the molting of larvae into a pupa by preventing a drop in the Juvenile Hormone that occurs during the commitment pulse [BioSafe Systems]. Since this product seeks to eliminate pests, this experiment will test whether the addiction of Azaguard in the life of the Manduca Sexta will alter its development. My hypothesis is that the larvae that receive eight drops of Azaguard in their food everyday will on average have a lower mass than the larvae that receive just food [Johnson: 2019]. 


Materials and Methods:
Two groups of four individual Manduca Sexta larvae were observed in this experiment. The first group being the treatment group and the second being the control group. Two plastic containers were used divided into four cells for each larva. Everyday the treatment group would receive eight drops of Azaguard via pipet which was received mixed into 10 grams of food that was spooned out and weighed. The control group received eight drops of water via a new pipet mixed into their 10 grams of food everyday. The independent variable was the presence of Azaguard in the food and the dependent variable was the mass of the larvae, which were weighed everyday. Everyday the food was changed and each larva was weighed for two weeks. The statistical test used was the two-tailed T-test, which showed if the difference in masses from the first and last day weighed of each larvae between the control group and treatment group had statistical significance or if the differences were just a coincidence. 


Results:
On average, the masses of the larvae in the treatment group that received Azaguard had lower masses than those in the control group seen in Figure 1. In addition, the treatment group larvae were all deceased by the end of two weeks as seen in Table 1. The T-test was calculated by using the difference in masses from the first day it was weighed and the last day it was alive/in the two week window. The outcome of the two-tailed T-test is 2.71 with a two-tailed P-value of 0.035. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported the alternative hypothesis. The larvae that were treated with Azaguard had lower masses than those in the control group, and had died before the end of the two weeks of observation. The P-value supports the alternative hypothesis and rejects the null hypothesis, proving a significance in the difference in mass between the two groups. The weight put on by the control group larvae were significantly greater than the weight put on by the treatment group between day 9/5 and day 9/18 (or until the day they died). The addition of this insecticide into the food of the larvae disrupted its natural development process, resisting the molting needed to progress into a pupa [Johnson: 2019]. This resistance to develop was only withstood for a few days before two of the treatment larvae died. The other two were deceased soon after, proving that these insects cannot stay juvenile for longer than nature provides them. This shows that the desired results of this insecticide Azaguard are achievable, however the exact amount needed to exterminate them was now found in this experiment because a specific amount was distributed everyday [BioSafe Systems]. However it is now known that when the natural hormones in the Manduca Sexta are disrupted, the normal development is negatively altered.
