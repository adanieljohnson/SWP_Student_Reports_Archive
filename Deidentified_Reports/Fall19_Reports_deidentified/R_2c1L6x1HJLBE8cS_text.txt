Title: Effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta growth

Abstract:
Abstract

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a species of insect with a life cycle that goes through egg to larva to pupa to an adult moth. During the different stages in the insect’s life cycle, it goes through different instar stages, which have defining characteristics. There is typically a high amount of growth during the first and third instar larvae stages, and the highest amount of growth occurs during the fifth instar stage [Reinecke: 1980]. There are a few hormones that controll development of M. sexta, one of which is the juvenile hormone (JH), which regulates the type of molting that occurs during the insect’s development in its early larva stages. In this experiment, M. sexta caterpillars that begin in the third instar stage are treated with JH and their development and growth is studied. JH is highest in concentration between the fifth larva stage and the pupal eclosion stage, but the appearance of JH esterase degrades the hormone so that its concentration declines as the insect’s life cycle approaches pupal commitment. It is at this time that another development hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), is released, stimulating the release of ecdysone, a third developmental hormone that plays an important role in beginning metamorphosis [Riddiford: 2012]. There are some studies that show the role of JH as being an inhibitor, as the presence of JH is what inhibits the release of the other developmental hormones, PTTH and ecdysteroids [Browder: 2001]. This fact coupled with the fact that metamorphosis is initiated by a decrease in JH support the hypothesis that treating M. sexta with JH will cause an increase in size, because the insects will not receive the signal to pupate, instead their bodies will continue to grow as caterpillars in the larval instar stages. The hypothesis is that treating M. sexta with 10 drops of JH will cause a significent increase in its mass measured in grams, with more growth on average over 14 days than those untreated. 


Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were selected, each was around the third instar stage. Two containers, each with four compartments, were prepared with ten grams of food in each compartment. For one container, ten drops of water were added to each food. For the other container, ten drops of JH were added to each food. Four caterpillars were selected and placed in the controll container (the food with water), and the other four caterpillars were placed in the experimental container (the food with JH). Each caterpillar was weighed and its mass was recorded, also each was given a name in order to be identifiable. Every day for two weeks, the caterpillars were observed and their weights were recorded. The differences between the initial and final weights of the caterpillars were compared using a two-sample, one-sided t_test with an alpha level of 0.05 in order to determine whether the results showed significent difference.

Results:
Both the treatment and controll groups displayed an average increase in mass over the two weeks, and the overall ranges between initial and final mass were similar for both groups. The average change in mass over two weeks for the controll group caterpillars was larger than that of the treatment group; on average the controll group caterpillars’ mass increased by 8.0767g in two weeks and the treated caterpillars’ mass increased by 6.7452g (Figure 1). However, the range in growth between each individual caterpillar in the treatment group was larger than the range in growth between individual caterpillars in the controll group. Out of all eight caterpillars, the one with the most growth and the one with the least growth were both treated with JH. Figure 2 also shows this large difference in growth between the caterpillars in the treatment group through the wide standard deviations represented by the error bars. Figure 2 shows that the difference between the mean of the treatment group with that of the controll group was not statistically significent (t-value = 0.52, d.f. = 6, one-sided p_value = 0.31). 


Discussion:
The results of the t_test are not statistically significent, therefore the null hypothesis can be accepted and the alternative hypothesis is rejected. The average mass of the treated caterpillars was lower than that of the controll group, which is a direct rejection of our alternative hypothesis which stated the opposite conclusion.

We hypothesized that the added juvenile hormone to the third-instar stage caterpillars would not only delay their continuation into the pupal stage, thus delaying metamorphosis, but that their growth would increase more than that of the untreated caterpillars, as they would continue to mature, without moving on to the next instar stage. However, additional juvenile hormone affected the cycle of M. sexta in a way that we did not initially recognize; the progression of caterpillars through the instar levels can be altered to either skip developmental phases or not enter them at all, based on their critical weights at the time of added JH [Nijhout: 1974]. This explains the large range of growth between the treated caterpillars; the effects of JH on the caterpillar with the most growth must have signaled entry into a higher instar stage than what naturally occurs after the third instar stage, and the effects of JH on the caterpillar with the least growth must have stopped maturation altogether. Thus, the range between these two caterpillars was much greater than that of the controll group. 

Other research that involves studying the effects of hormones in M. sexta focus on the interplay between juvenile hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and ecdysone. Juvenile hormone is found to have inhibitory controll on PTTH, which, when released, stimulates the release of ecdysteroids, the hormones that induce pupation [Browder: 2011]. Also, studies on the interactions between a specific type of ecdysteroid, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), and JH show that 20E is what initiates the major transitions in an insect’s life cycle, and JH determines what type of transition. The transition from larva to pupa and from pupa to adult are triggered by 20E, not JH, therefore in our experiment, adding more JH to M.sexta in the larva stage would not necessarily enhance their growth, it would just reduce the effects of 20E in effectively transitioning the larva into the pupa stage [Riddiford 1994]. If we continued to monitor the M.sexta for longer than two weeks, then we would potentially see any additional effects an increase in JH had on insect development, because typically the most growth in M. sexta insects occurs during the fifth instar stage [Reinecke: 1980]. 

A reexamination of our method, results, and further research on the effects of JH leads to the possibility that adding ten drops of JH to the caterpillars in the treatment group may have been excessive. The development of these caterpillars exhibited a wide range of results in growth, most likely because an excessive amount of JH causes unanticipated errors that relate to the nature of the hormone and its effects on the life cycle of M. sexta. One way to improve this experiment would be to test the effects of adding a lesser amount of JH at a different time, for instance, adding JH at an earlier stage than the third instar stage.
