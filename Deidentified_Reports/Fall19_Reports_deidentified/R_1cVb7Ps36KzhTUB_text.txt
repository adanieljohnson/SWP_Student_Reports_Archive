Title: How juvenile hormone increase the growth of tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) in two weeks.

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
Tobacco hornworms (Manduca sexta) have eight different transformations in their life cycle. Passage from one life stage to the next require molting. The hormones go through metamorphosis when the transition from larval stages to pupa. Passage from one life stage to the next requires molting, in which an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer, and molting allows the insect to change in size and or morphology [Johnson: 2016]. The total time it takes for the caterpillars to get from the 1st instar larva stage to the adult moth phase is between 37-46 days. Precor is a type of juvenile hormone that will be used to make the caterpillars grow through four larvae stages, the commitment pulse, the fifth larvae, pupae, and finally an adult moth. Insect juvenile hormone controlls insect larval development by preventing premature metamorphosis and also contributes to a variety of other essential physiological functions, including reproduction, pheromone production, and cast differentiation [Shin et al: 2018]. Insect juvenile hormone occur in the corpus allata section of the brain. Tobacco hornworms are a pest to farmer’s tomatoes, because they feed on the important crops like tomatoes. Scientist can speed up the molting process to get the caterpillars into their adult stage where they will no longer be a pest, and so an approach for the insect controll is in progress. Precor includes chitin synthesis inhibitors which disrupt cuticle formation, or substances that either block or overactive process regulated by JHs, ecdysteroids, and other insect hormones. During the final 5th larval instar the juvenile hormone declines to undetectable levels due to the cessation of secretion from the corpus allata coupled with the appearance of a juvenile hormone specific esterase in both the hemolymph and the tissues that degrades existing juvenile hormone. This loss of juvenile hormone allows prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) release that stimulates a small amount of ecdysone release. Ecdysone in the absence of juvenile hormone causes the cessation of feeding and the onset of wandering to find a pupation site [Abdou: 2019]. These caterpillars are good to use in this experiment because there is an abundance of caterpillars and their lifecycle is within a 45-day window which is great for measuring many replications of the experiment. 
Hypothesis
Null: If we give the caterpillars the juvenile hormone (precor), then they will stay the same as the controll group caterpillars.
Alternative: If we give the caterpillars the juvenile hormone (precor), then they will grow more than the caterpillars without the hormone.


Materials and Method:
There materials for the experiment will contain 8 caterpillars, water, precor, and two plastic containers. There were two different groups of four caterpillars, four were the controll groups and the other four were the experimental groups. The caterpillars stayed inside plastic containers separated from each other and stayed inside of an incubator with a constant temperature of 26.5 degrees Celsius. Three drops of precor was added to the treatments group’s food and three drops of water was used on the controll group’s food. The caterpillars were measured in length using centimeters. The food was replaced each day if the food was not moist. 10 grams of food were measured out, containing each concentration of precor or water and was placed in the appropriate containers for the caterpillars to eat. Mean and standard deviation of each controll and experimental group was recorded for each day. A two sample, one sided statistical test was used to analyze our data.

Results:
The average of all the controll values were 4.1583cm with a total sample size of 60 measurements which is shown in figure 1. The one-tailed p_value was 0.0017 for all of the controll and treatment values. The average of all the experiments were 5.7167cm with a total sample size of 60 measurements which was shown in figure 1. On day 6 controll 1 died and on day 12 controll 2 died. Day 1 controlls had an average of 2.08 and standard deviation of 0.25. Day 1 treatment group had an average of 2.78 and a standard deviation of 1.37.

Discussion:
The results did not support that if the caterpillars were given the juvenile hormone (precor), then they will grow more than the caterpillars without the hormone. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis was rejected because the one tailed p_value was statistically significent. The controll caterpillars were growing at a constant rate and so were the treatment caterpillars. The precor juvenile hormone was supposed to exponentially increase the growth of the caterpillars, but it did not show any adverse effects compared to the controll. Some errors that may have occurred were the death of caterpillars controll 1 on day 6 and the death of caterpillar controll 2 on day 12. After their deaths the data recorded afterwards had to be excluded from the averages which decreased the sample size from 60 to 48. On the other hand, the treatments still had a sample size of 60, so the comparison of the two averages were not consistent. Another possible error in the experiment could have been user error because three different scientists had to stretch out each caterpillar every day and sometimes the caterpillars would not stretch all the way, or the scientist would not stretch them to their maximum potential. The experiment should be replicated a few more times because caterpillars had died and sometimes the caterpillars did not stretch out all the way. A better way to measure the data of the experiment could have been to use mass rather than weight because of user error.
