Title: The Use of a Ecdysterone (20E) Inhibitor and its Effect on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
N/A

Introduction:
The process of growth and development is something that occurs in all living species and is a result of hormones released by the endocrine system. In this experiment, the group will look at the hormones involved in the growth and development in Manduca Sexta, and alter them to investigate their effects on development. Manduca Sexta larvae, also known as Tobacco Hornworms, have been used for several essential studies about insect endocrinology and development [Nijhout: 1974]. This, along with the short life span and their pest status, was the group's reasoning for choosing the Manduca Sexta as their experimental organism. To better understand the stages of development in Manduca Sexta, it must be understood what causes the transition from one stage or instar to another. Hormones are what cause the transitions from one instar to another in the life cycle of Tobacco Hornworms, specifically the hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Ecdysterone is part of the steroid hormone family and is secreted by the prothoracic gland. 20E regulates the timing of molting and metamorphosis in the development stages of insects [Johnson: 2019]. Whenever there is a spike in Ecdysterone, it signals the caterpillar to molt. JH regulates the type of molting that occurs and helps keep the insect's juvenile physical characteristics. Manduca Sexta larvae have been found to destroy crops by eating them, causing them to gain their pest status. To prevent the hornworms from being a pest for long periods, the group wanted to investigate how altering the production of 20E would affect their lifecycle. Since 20E regulates the timing of molting, the group decided to investigate what would happen if the production of 20E was inhibited. To investigate how 20E affects the life cycle of Manduca Sexta, the group created an experiment where one group ingested food with 20E inhibitor, while the control group's food contained water. The group hypothesized by inhibiting the production of 20E, the larvae will have a slower development to pupate while the control group will develop on a normal Manduca Sexta life cycle. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted using both a control group and a treatment group that ingested 20E inhibitors. To begin, the group obtained eight Manduca Sexta larvae. Four larvae were part of the control group (food containing water droplets), and four larvae were part of the experimental group (food containing 20E inhibitor droplets). Next, two containers were gathered with four compartments to place each larva into their compartment. The group punched two holes into the sides of each compartment to allow oxygen flow. One container contained the four control larvae, and the other contained the four larvae that ingested the 20E inhibitor: Azaguard. Then the group collected larvae food provided by the laboratory and placed 10 grams of food into each compartment: 80 grams in total. Before placing the food into each compartment, the group rolled the 10 grams of food into a ball to maintain dampness for more extended periods. In the control group container, the group wet each larvae's food with five drops of water from a pipet. In the 20E inhibitor container, they wet each larvae's food with five drops of 20E inhibitor from a pipet. Before placing the larvae into their designated container, their initial mass was recorded. After massing the caterpillars, they were placed into an incubator set at 24.9 Â°C. For two weeks, the group returned each day to record the mass of the larvae and clean out the compartments. Their food was replaced when it appeared dry or about every three days. Replacing the food was done by simply repeating the above steps involved in weighing and wetting the larvae food. After two weeks, the group had finished the experiment and proceeded to analyze the data by performing a two-sample t-test using the one-tailed p-value for both experiments to determine statistical significance.

Results:
 Over the two weeks the group spent recording the mass of both the control and experimental group, the group conducted the experiment twice. At the end of the first week, all larvae in the 20E experimental group were dead, while the control group was regularly developing. To test if this was a result of the use of the 20E inhibitor, the group restarted a new experiment. After the second week, the group saw similar results; all except one larva in the 20E experimental group was dead, while the control group was developing as usual. The data yielded from the control group and the treatment group revealed the control group caterpillars survived longer, on average than the 20E inhibitor group. Not only did the group notice that the vast majority of the 20E group in both experiments died, but they also grew in mass at a significantly slower rate than the control group, as shown in figure 1 and figure 2. Figure 1 demonstrates the control group in experiment one had a standard deviation of +/- 1.32 grams and the experimental group had a standard deviation of +/- 0.05 grams. Figure 2 demonstrates the control group in experiment 2 had a standard deviation of +/- 2.97 grams and the experimental group had a standard deviation of +/- 0.27 grams. Finally, the group used a two-sample t-test to analyze the first and second week's results. The results of the two-sample t-test revealed a one-tailed p-value of 0.0349 for the first week and a one-tailed p-value of 0.0112 for the second group. For statistical significance to be assumed, the p-value must be below 0.05. Both experiment's data was found to be statistically significant, meaning this data was not found simply due to chance.  

Discussion:
 The group's hypothesis that adding the 20E inhibitor will slow down the development of the larvae in comparison to the control group larvae was supported. The group did not hypothesize that many larvae whose food contained the 20E inhibitor would die. However, the death of many of the experimental group larvae still supports the group's hypothesis. Using a one-tailed p-value of 0.05 statistical significance was found, suggesting the 20E inhibitor addition to the larvae's food affects the development of the tobacco hornworms. By wetting the experimental larvae's food with a 20E inhibitor, there was no 20E hormone to tell the larvae when to molt. It also most likely resulted in higher production of JH, meaning the larvae would keep their juvenile characteristics and not develop at a proper rate. JH and 20E work together on a concentration ratio to determine the insects' development; therefore, when 20E was inhibited the production of JH most likely skyrocketed. This causes the insect to break homeostasis and eventually lead to its death [Johnson: 2019]. Based on these findings, it can be understood how the endocrine system is a type of chemical messenger system that works on a negative feedback loop. Negative Feedback loops are critical because they help organisms maintain homeostasis. Since JH and 20E work together in a ratio, when 20E is low, the large amount of JH in proportion to 20E signals the endocrine system to produce more 20E. However, in this experiment, the production of 20E was inhibited, meaning it could not be produced even when it was signaled. Because of this, homeostasis of the hornworm was disrupted, resulting in its death. Past studies have also studied the effects of the 20E hormone. It was found that if one of the development hormones, either JH or 20E, were in excess during development, death, or sterilization may result [Ellis: 2009]. Using the results found by Ellis alongside the group's findings indicates the effectiveness of using 20E to hinder the development of tobacco hornworms. These findings can also be used to create new pesticides from insect hormones, a cheaper and more natural method of pest control.[Ellis: 2009]. Moving forward, the next logical step for this study would be to complete an experiment adding fewer drops of 20E inhibitor to the larvae's food. Doing this would allow the investigation of how much Azaguard is needed to affect the development of tobacco hornworms.
