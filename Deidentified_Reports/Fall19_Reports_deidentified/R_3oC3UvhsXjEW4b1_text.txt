Title: Effects of Acidity and Alkalinity on Resource Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity, the way plants allocate resources due to changing environmental conditions, can be gauged by root and shoot growth in plants. To demonstrate, replicates of Vigna radiata, commonly referred to as Mung Beans, were grown under varying pH concentrations. Given that an average plant grows best under standard conditions, it is hypothesized, if Vigna radiata receive neutral water (pH 7.0), then they will not allocate resources to their root system and, thus, have a smaller root to shoot ratio – opposed to Vigna radiata that receive acidic and alkaline water. Three groups of five Vigna radiata plants were identically prepared, and routinely watered with different pH concentrations (pH 3.5, pH 7.0, pH 8.5) for two weeks. After the maturation period, each subject was harvested, measured, and analyzed to determine the root to shoot ratio (length and weight). Vigna radiata prepared with neutral water (pH 7.0) yielded the smallest average root length to shoot length ratio (0.583 cm; ±0.246 cm) and root weight to shoot weight ratio (0.436 cm; ±0.153 cm). An ANOVA test was performed to evaluate statistical significance between the three different environments (p_value 0.198). 

Introduction:
Selective pressures, from a changing environment, causes plants to allocate resources. Overall, an organism’s ability to adapt to this changing environment is referred to as its phenotypic plasticity. High phenotypic plasticity correlates with an ability to survive in a range of varying environments – often conferring high fitness. Low phenotypic plasticity correlates with an ability to  survive in one, static environment – often conferring low fitness [Johnson: 2019].
The acidity or alkalinity of a solution is expressed in terms of pH which is measured on a scale of 1-14. A low pH value correlates to acidity, a high pH value correlates to alkalinity, and a pH value in the middle (7.0) is referred to as neutral [Sadava: 2017]. Most biological processes are dependent on pH. Thus, an organism’s ability to regulate and maintain a constant pH that is conducive to life (~7.0) is paramount. Biological buffers, mixtures of weak acids and their conjugate bases, keep pH relatively constant [Nelson: 2017]. However, natural phenomena, such as acid rain, affects environmental pH. Environments which deviate from the biological pH reduce a plants’ ability to uptake nutrients and, subsequently, grow. Plants in acidic environments uptake nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium; Plants in alkaline environments uptake zinc, iron, and copper. Since uptake of nitrogen is vital, standard plants grow best in slightly acidic environments (pH of 5.0 – 6.5) [Bower: 2005]. Still, soil diverging from a biologically conducive pH is unfavorable to health, as well as diversification.
Vigna radiata, or Mung Beans, utilize a standard root and shoot system which makes them a model organism to study resource allocation. Although minimal research has been done, due to the triviality of the subject, one study suggests that Vigna radiata grow best in a pH environment of 7 and favors a pH environment of 6 over 8. This confirms that life is sustained at a neutral pH and, regarding plants, has a small preference to acidic environments [Cheng: 1998]. Therefore, it is hypothesized, Vigna radiata receiving neutral water (pH 7.0) will be healthier and have smaller root to shoot ratios.


Materials and Method:
Fifteen 4 in. x 6 in. pots were filled with soil and 500 Ml of miracle grow. In each pot, nine indentation holes were made in the soil, and 2-3 Vigna radiata seeds (soaked in water for 24 hours prior) were placed in each hole. The fifteen plants were separated and labeled into three groups: acidic, neutral, and alkaline, prior to being placed in the greenhouse.
Replicates were allotted 50 Ml of their appropriately conditioned water (pH 3.5, pH 7.0, or pH 8.5) every day for two weeks. After maturation, one plant from each pot was randoMly selected. These plants were separated from the soil, washed, measured (length of roots and length of shoots), and weighed (weight of roots and weight of shoots). After data was collected, it was analyzed using an ANOVA test.


Results:
The roots and shoots of fifteen Vigna radiata (5 acidic, 5 neutral, and 5 alkaline) were measured and weighed. Data was collected and analyzed by calculating/graphing the average root to shoot length ratio (see “Figure 1”) and root to shoot weight ratio (see “Figure 2”). An ANOVA test was performed to evaluate statistical significance between the three different environments. A p_value of 0.1980 was yielded.

Discussion:
Based on the results, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was not supported. Evaluating graphical data, the average root to shoot ratio for length and weight appeared to support the hypothesis since the length and weight ratios were the lowest for the plants treated with water of neutral concentration (pH 7.0). However, the ANOVA test yielded a statistically insignificent p_value. Although the results appeared to follow a trend, the results from the ANOVA test negated the implication. Since the alternative hypothesis is rejected, the null hypothesis is supported. This suggests that varying environmental pH conditions have no effect on the phenotypic plasticity of Vigna radiata.
These results oppose current ecological knowledge. Studies show that plants, including Vigna radiata, grow best at acidic, nearing neutral, conditions [Bower: 2005]. Had these results been statistically significent, an argument could be made that this experiment supported current literatures. Although the Vigna radiata preferred the neutral condition (pH 7.0), that was the condition closest to the preferred condition – slightly acidic [Cheng: 1998]. The acidic condition (pH 3.5) was too polarized. Additionally, literature does not suggest that Vigna radiata grow successfully in alkaline conditions. 
To improve this experiment, and gain insight into these discrepancies, a larger range of pH concentrations should be used. Specifically, acidic solutions closer to a neutral concentration should be used to distinguish whether Vigna radiata preferred neutral conditions or disliked highly acidic or alkaline environments. Still, this study expands knowledge of phenotypic plasticity which can be utilized to optimize conditions for plant growth, and advance agriculture.
