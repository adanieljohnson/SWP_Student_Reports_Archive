Title: The Role of Color in Aggression Response Visual Stimuli in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Animal Behavior is an almost all-encompassing term. In a general sense it can be defined as any and all responses to any stimuli an animal receives. For this reason it is easier and more useful to measure specific animal behaviors, such as intraspecific aggression. In this experiment we measured the aggression responses of male betta fish (Betta splendins) to a variety of realistic betta fish models of different colors, as well as videos of other betta fish showing aggressive behaviors. We predicted that the betta fish would show significent differences in aggression towards colors, ranging from black (controll), red, to blue in order of increased aggression. We tested this hypothesis by calculating the length of elapsed time until the first aggressive behavior displayed, and counting the number of aggressive displays during a set time interval. Even after multiple changes to our procedure and fish used, we were unable to collect any data as the fish did not respond to any visual stimuli. While we cannot conclude a single cause of the noted lack of response, we believe that the models used in the procedure did not accurately represent a real betta fish. 

Introduction:
Throughout the world, animals display all types of aggressive behaviors. The motives may differ—access to food and water, mate selection, etc.—but displays of aggressive behaviors and their subsequent violence extend far beyond your dog lunging at the poodle or squirrels in the park. Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is an important field despite its challenges and difficulties. In general, studying animal behavior can teach us about a particular species and, how to minimize harm and suffering from human intervention, both in the wild and in the laboratory [Mench: 1998]. The uniqueness and diversity of displays of aggression among animals tells us much about that species and its role in an ecosystem. Unlike more empirical measurements such as speed and distance, measuring animal behavior can be challenging as it involves a balance between objectivity and subjectivity. Completely objective physiological measurements (like heart rate or neurotransmitter levels) may be hard to collect, so it is important to subjectively define and collect behavioral data as best as possible. 
Aggressive behavior tends to be less subtle than other animal behaviors, and as it often involves confrontation (physical or not) between relatively evenly matched animals, intraspecific aggression is an easier animal behavior to measure. 
A model organism to study would be easy to maintain, small, display easily identifiable aggressive behaviors, and be easily separated in the event of an attack by one individual on another [Simpson: 1968]. The male Betta fish (Betta splendins) fulfills all of these goals for such a study, and was used to measure aggressive behavior. The betta fish is native to Thailand where it lives in small freshwater puddles in rice fields [Sriwattanarothai: 2010]. Due to the small size of these ponds, males will easily fight with another male over controll of a puddle. Literature and our own previous experimentation confirm that male betta fish will act similarly in captivity [Johnson: 1973, Miley: 1977, Thompson: 1963]. We previously found that male betta fish exhibited aggressive behavior towards other males of their own species, but not towards a male Blue Gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus). 
We therefore predicted that color was more important than shape or size in determining aggressive behavior in male Betta fish. To test this hypothesis, we observed the response of a betta fish to different colored realistic looking betta fish models.  




Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we made three realistic looking colored foam cutouts of betta fish: blue, red, and black. These cutouts were attached to a small metal wire to allow them to be positioned within a tank and not float to the surface. We placed one blue male betta (Betta splendins) in a small (~5L) rectangular glass tank. The tank had both glass and opaque dividers splitting the tank into two halves. After the betta was in one half, we placed the blue cutout in the other half, removed the opaque divider and recorded the elapsed time until the fish first showed aggressive behavior, with a cut-off point of two minutes. If there was no aggression shown during those two minutes, the data recorded was “no aggressive behavior”. Next, we recorded the number of aggressive displays from the first aggressive behavior to the t=2 minute mark (if the fish displayed any aggressive behavior). The fish was given 5 minutes of rest after the first trial. The same steps were repeated with the black, and then red cutout in that order. NOTE: After one trial of each color, the fish had not exhibited any aggressive behavior, so the same procedure was repeated with the glass divider also removed. After the blue cutout trial, we decided to move the cutout fish during the black cutout trial to elicit a response from the betta. Since this also did not cause the betta to react in anyway, we exchanged the betta for a different, red male betta fish. We restarted the procedure with the glass and opaque dividers removed, now also moving the cutouts through the water, mimicking aggressive displays such as tail flickering by shaking the wire. This did not cause the betta to react. NOTE: After two trials (blue and black) with this method we again changed our procedure to involve showing a video of a male betta fish displaying aggressive behaviors such as tail flickering and operculum flashing to the betta by placing an iPhone playing the video on maximum brightness directly on the long end of the tank nearest the betta. NOTE: As this video caused, an aggressive response from the betta, we once again redesigned our procedure to model our original procedure, expect by showing a video in place of using the cutout fish. The video showed a blue betta fish, and lasted for approximately 2 minutes. To model the black controll fish, we enabled the “Color Filter” Grayscale setting on the iPhone, and for the red model, we found a similar 45 second video of a red fish that looped for two minutes. The fish was shown the blue video, rested for 5 minutes, grayscale video, rested for 5 mintues, and the red video and rested for 5 mintues for a total of three trials per video [“AGGRESSIVE RED BETTA FISH” and “Betta fish - Very aggressive”]. Had we collected data, we would have used six paired two-tailed t_tests to compare the elapsed time to first aggressive behavior (Blue to Red; Red to Black; Blue to Black), and the number of aggressive behavior displays during the first two minutes if the fish displayed aggressive behavior, (Blue to Red; Red to Black; Blue to Black), α=0.05)

Results:
No analyzable non-zero data was collected during the study. In all iterations of the procedure, the fish did not display aggressive behavior.       
                                                                                                               
                                                 

Discussion:
As the betta did not react to model visual stimuli, the results do not support our hypothesis. We cannot conclude anything from our data other than that the two fish used in this study do not respond to cutout betta fish models, or videos of other betta fish showing aggressive behavior. The results can be partially explain by data collected in a previous experiment where we found that the presence of a relatively larger male blue gourami (Trichogaster trichopterus) did not cause any display of aggression from the male betta. Interestingly, Johnson and Johnson found that male Bettas will display aggression towards other species, but rarely attack. [Johnson: 1973]  For this reason, we expected to have had at least some response from the bettas towards the models or videos; however, the same study concluded that Bettas respond to a combination of complex stimuli, and it is possible that our experimental design in focusing solely on color of stimuli, removed other stimuli important to the Betta fish in determining when to display aggression. 
A possible source of error was lacking a positive controll. While we did have a black negative controll, the use of a real betta fish would have confirmed whether or not the betta fish used in this experiment exhibit aggressive behavior to any visual stimuli. While the red betta did display an aggressive behavior for the first few seconds of video display, this was during a preliminary testing phase during which we decided if the video would generate a response from the fish. Since the betta did respond to the video, we used the video protocol to test our hypothesis. However, the fish failed to respond to subsequent displays and it may have displayed aggressive behavior in response to an number of other factors, including the mechanical disturbance of the phone being placed on the glass when it first saw the video. This behavior could have been habituated leading to lack of aggressive displays in timed trials in which we recorded data. Also, as Johnson and Johnson note, previous experiences of the fish may be important in determining behavior. If a fish has never seen aggressive displays from another male before, it may only respond to the ensuing physical attack the first time it encounters such displays. 
A future direction for this study would involve a similar protocol, with the use of a positive controll to determine whether or not the fish will show any aggressive behavior, as well as the involvement of a more experience ethologist who may be able to note minute behavioral displays in the fish that we could have not noticed. The more we understand about Betta fish behavior, and animal behavior in general, the better we can predict the interactions between members of a species and their environment, helping to better controll them and ameliorate existing and increasing ecosystem disruption.
