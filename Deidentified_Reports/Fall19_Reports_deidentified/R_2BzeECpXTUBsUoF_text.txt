Title: Effects of alkaline water on Raphanus sativus resource allocation

Abstract:
The objective of the Resource Allocation lab is to test the effect of a PH buffer solution (Alkaline water) on 72 Raphanus sativus (Radish plants) seedlings. We hypothesize that the PH buffer will decrease the overall weight and length of the 36 treatment plants due to the fact that the solution will deprive the plant of its basic nutrients. Energy allocation is essential for a plant’s survival because It allows the plant to make strategic decisions on what and where to invest in for the most beneficial future. Environmental factors play a major role in what the plant requires and depending on the need for resources, lacking in the environment, they can change. We will be observing the growth of these plants in a controllled environment, later on calculating the shoot to root ratios of both the weight and length. Our data supported our hypothesis, showing that there was a correlation between the PH buffer and an overall decrease in size and weight. The average total weight of the experimental (alkaline water) was 0.33g, while the average total weight of the controllled was 0.27g. The ratios of the treatment both weight and length were also less than the controll. However, there could have been some human error within our experiment due to the loss of some roots, thus our data could 

Introduction:
The Plant Resource Allocation Lab tests the effects of a PH buffer solution (Alkaline water) on the energy allocation of Raphanus sativus (Radish plants) in a controllled environment. We choose radish plants because they are herbatious and small meaning that they can grow quickly, which is beneficial with a two-week time limit on an experiment. Due to the plants nature of being anchored in one place, unable to search for resources, they must make strategic decisions with what and where to allocate the amount of resources available to them. Several factors go into the crucial decision’s autotrophs reach. Environmental factors a few being, water, sunlight, and space. Within this lab we focused on altering the water factor. The lack of or change of environmental factors, impact the plants properties, such as structure and species distribution, while also effecting the overall function of the ecosystem with the nutrients retained. [JAMES: 2005] So all of which could affect the root to shoot ratio. Roots absorb minerals and water from the soil and provide support. While, the shoots provide support above the soil, transport minerals and nutrients from the roots to the leaves. By analyzing said ratio, we can determine how the plant is doing in its environment. We hypothesized that the PH buffer solution would deprive the experimental group of necessary nutrients that it would normally receive from water, resulting in the overall root: shoot ratio decreasing in terms of weight and length as a whole. 

Materials and Method:
This lab required 72 Radish seeds, 36 for the controll group and 36 for the experimental group. We then took 6 containers, filled them with soil, planted 12 seeds in each, and then saturated the soil. The first three containers became controll and the other 3 the experimental. Both the controll and the experimental were watered until saturated and were both in the same environment. The only differences between the two groups was that the experimental was also given 50 Ml of the Alkaline 9.5 Ph H2O solution. Plants were watered the same amount daily for two weeks. Then after the two weeks were over, we separated the plants from the soil, rinsed of the plants, and took several measurements. We weighed the plants total weigh, the shoot weight, as well as the root weight in grams on a scale. We then measured the root and shoot length in centimeters using a ruler. After all of the measurements were recorded, we calculated the weight and length Root: Shoot ratio by dividing root value by the shoot value and then adding those values to the shared doc. We then calculated a one tailed two sample T test to see if our data was significent or not. 

Results:
Our P value yielded .04 for R:S length ratio and .007 for R:S weight ratio, meaning our data was significent. Although, not all of our plants sprouted. We started out with 72 plants and were only able to record data for 29 treatment and 26 controll. While extracting the plants from the soil we noticed that the brittle roots of the treatment were initially breaking. The results of our lab concluded that the controll group was overall larger in size and weight than the experimental in almost every case, on average. The average total weight of the experimental (Alkaline water) was 0.33g, while the average total weight of the controllled was 0.27g. Refer to figure 1 for the representation of the data stated within this paragraph. The average shoot: root weight for the experimental 0.31 +/- 0.21, while the controllled weighed in at 0.71+/- 0.16. The trend continued with the average root: shoot length ratio of the experimental being 1.49 +/- 0.02 and the controllled being 1.77+/- 0.61. Thus, the effects of the Ph buffer are substantial with effecting the shoot to root ratio. The one tailed 2 sample T-test showed that the data we collected for the R:S of length and weight was significent within our experiment. 

Discussion:
The results of our resource allocation experiment supported the alternative and rejected the null hypothesis, due to the fact that the Ph buffer solution decreased the overall plant size of the experimental. This is due to the correlation between the plant’s energy allocation and the lack of neutral water. In another study with Chinese cabbage and radishes, within the alkaline water there was a higher concentration of metals within the soil which effected the plant growth, sometimes resulting in death. [Ai: 2016] Which could be why nine of our seeds did not germinating into a sprout. The alkaline water provides an excess of heavy nutrients that block the transport of necessary nutrient, preventing optimum growth. While, we were conducting this experiment and started to measure our controll and experimental, we couldn’t really tell a distinct difference in the root and shoot lengths. In fact, we thought at one point that the experimental group was bigger than the controll due to some that stuck out from the rest. However, when we started to look at our data, we noticed that our original thoughts were wrong, and our data was significent due to the P value being less than 0.05. Thus, there could have been some human error due to the weak roots breaking off, effecting the measurements and weights. Also, as we were extracting the plants from their containers some roots could have been loosed in the transition. For future research, scientist could perform our experiment again to see if the results are consistent and are replicable. It is important to understand the significance of how minor changes within water can affect plant growth especially with climate change stressing crop production due to ground water contamination.
