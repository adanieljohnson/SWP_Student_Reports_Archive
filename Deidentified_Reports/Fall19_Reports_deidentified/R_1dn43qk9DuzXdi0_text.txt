Title: The Effects of Inhibiting Ecdysone in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
None

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, also commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, has a standard life cycle of about 39-48 days until they become a functioning adult moth [Berkely: 2019]. The hornworm was used in this experiment because they are pests as larvae, so they destroy crops, and they also have a relatively short life cycle. As a larva, the hornworm goes through about five instar larval molts which can be measured by their approximate weight. During these instar larva phases; the insect has two main hormones that work together throughout its juvenile life to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis. These two hormones are the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and the Ecdysterone (20E) hormone [Gilbert: 1979]. The Juvenile Hormone is produced in the Corpus Allata where is spreads to target cells to regulate the type of molt during the development of the hornworm. M. Sexta knows when to molt when it reaches a critical weight [Hatmen: 2015]. The 20E hormone is produced in the prothoracic gland where they then spread through the body to regulate the timing of molting during development. Ecdysone is inhibited by a hormone called Azaguard. We hypothesize that by inhibiting the production of 20E, the development of the Manduca Sexta will be prolonged.

Materials and Method:
To test whether our null hypothesize was correct or not, two groups of four hornworms were used. One group was the controll group, so there was no change to their food, and the other group was the experimental group in which 20E hormone was inhibited. Each hornworm got their cube with two holes poked into it for airflow, and the cubes were in groups of four, so we could easily distinguish between the controll and the experimental group. About 10g of hornworm food was weighed out, and five drops of water were added for the controll group, and five drops of Azaguard to the experimental group then rolled into a ball to minimize the drying of the food. Once a day for 14 days, someone came to check on the hornworms and mass each one and recorded it in grams in a chart. The food was checked to make sure it was still moist. If the food was not moist, then the process of making food was repeated for each hornworm. At the end of the experiment, a two-sample t_test was used to determine whether to accept the alternative hypothesis or reject it. The one-tailed value was used because the hypothesis shows directionality.

Results:
Throughout the experiment, we ran into many difficulties, like our experimental group kept dying. During the first week of the experiment, both groups, experimental and controll, were the same until the fourth day. Here, the controll group started to gain weight, and the experimental group started to decrease in weight. By the seventh day of the experiment, all the hornworms that were given Azaguard were dead. Then we had to start our experiment all over again. We threw away our dead hornworms and then froze the alive ones. The second group of hornworms started slightly larger than the first group; however, almost the same result happened. The weight of the controll group took off and ended with an average of 8.08 grams on the last day of the experiment. In the experimental group by the fifth day of the second week, three of the four hornworms were dead. The one hornworm that was alive exhibited a slow increase in weight and ended with 1.42 grams. 
When analyzing these results, we used a two-sample t_test due to the directionality of our hypothesis. In our first, our first experiment, the mean weights of the experimental group were statistically significently different from the mean weights of the controll group at a 95% confidence level (t_stat = 2.34, d.f. = 14, P = .017). In our second group, the mean weights of the experimental group were statistically significently different from the mean weights of the controll group at a 95% confidence level (t_stat = 2.56, d.f. = 14, P = .011). Both p_values are one-tailed. From this, we can say with 95% confidence that diet did influence the weight of our caterpillars and the differences were not due to chance. 


Discussion:
Our experiment was an exciting one because it did not turn out exactly the way we hypothesized. Yes, the hornworms that were given Azaguard did not grow as much as the controll group that had no changes, but eventually, all the experimental hornworms died. Technically, the experiment did support our hypothesis because the development of the hornworms with 20E inhibitor was delayed, which eventually lead to death. Two hormones controll the growth of the Manduca Sexta; during each molting cycle, the epidermis responds to ecdysone [Sedlak: 1979]. 20E is the same hormone as ecdysone, so when it is inhibited the time to molt between each instar phase is inhibited. The molting of new skin allows the hornworm to grow and expand, but when this growth is inhibited, then the Manduca Sexta will have an unsuccessful growth cycle [Berkley: 2019]. Without both of these hormones, the hornworm will not be able to grow and will eventually die; this was just escalated in our experiment. To further expand this experiment to determine more effects of 20E, it would be interesting to add another group of hornworms and giving them excess 20E to see what effect it would have on the Manduca Sexta. Growth of the hornworm can be accelerated in time, and this would result in a smaller adult form [Hatem: 2015]. Time and growth are related, and since growth and hormones are related, then we can infer the hormones and time are related. By interfering with one of these components, it will interfere with another. In our experiment, we manipulated the hormones and hypothesized that the timing of their growth would be slowed down. This study of inhibiting growth hormones is relevant to the world around us because if we can accelerate the growth cycle of the Manduca Sexta, then we will be able to minimize the effects that these hornworms have. During their larval stage, a single caterpillar can easily destroy an entire tobacco plant [Berkley: 2019]. This huge agricultural threat could be eliminated simply due to the changes in hormone regulation in the Manduca Sexta.
