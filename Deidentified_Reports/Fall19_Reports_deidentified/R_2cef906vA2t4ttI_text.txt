Title: Effects of Temperature on the Agnostic Behavior of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Animal behavior can be affected by external factors since most of the behaviors are influenced by internal physiological activities, which respond to the ambient environment. Betta splendins is a fish that displays aggressiveness through obvious gills and fins expanding, rapid body color change in some cases, and patterns of movements. Behaviors of ectotherms, such as fishes, are highly affected by their surroundings, such as temperature. Our results showed that as the temperature rises, the aggressiveness of an individual increases, whereas lower temperature tends to reduce an individual’s aggressiveness (ANOVA p_value = 0.00127). The statistical results and recorded observations support our hypothesis that higher temperature provides more thermal energy and catalyzes some metabolic pathways in the fish, which allows the fish to be more active and aggressive towards their conspecific individuals. The effects of temperature on B. splendins are discussed with suggestions on future studies.  

Introduction:
Aggressiveness is one of the behavioral traits that has individual differences across a species. Aggressiveness tends to be positively proportional to an individual’s fitness; aggressive individual is more likely to pass down its alleles to the genetic pool of the next generation by mating with more females [Ariyomo: 2012]. The way animals display aggressive behavior is mostly through visual displays. In the case of Betta splendins, it displays its aggressiveness via broadside and facial movements. In broadside movement/position, in which the fish turns its side toward its opponent, the increasing order of the aggressiveness is pelvic fin flickering (fish moves pelvic fin vertically toward the opponent), tail beating (suddenly moves caudal fin toward the opponent), and tail flashing (close and reopen caudal fin). In facing movement, in which the fish faces its opponent, the increasing order of the aggressiveness is pectoral fin erects, gill spreading, and red man (branchiostegal membranes protrude). 
	Many of the physiological activities are temperature-dependent or temperature-sensitive; especially, ectothermic animals rely heavily on surrounding heat to operate their metabolism [Lyon: 2008]. Fish is a major group of ectothermic animals and typically experiences a wide range of temperatures. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, is originated from southeast Asia. Male Betta splendins are well known for being highly aggressive towards intruding conspecifics. Their general display of aggressiveness is with their expanding gills and fins, which are due to increased blood flow into the gills and fins. Blood flow, with other biological activities, in fish are affected by the external temperature [Biro: 2010]. The colorful display of the body in interspecific behavior makes it easier to recognize the aggressiveness of each individual. Since higher temperature increases blood flow and catalyzes some physiological activities, it is hypothesized that the fish stays in higher temperature may act more aggressively than the one stays in colder temperature since fish since higher temperature provides more thermal energy for metabolism. 
Through studying the pattern of the animal behavior due to temperature differences, one may gain a deeper understanding of the interactions of behavior and the ambient environment, how the environment may change behavior and, possibly, “personality,” and the relationship of behavior and an organism's physiology.


Materials and Method:
One male betta fish was put in controll water temperature (19 oC), another was put in warm water (22 oC), the other was put in cold water (16 oC). Hot water was heated with a heating pad; cold water was prepared by adding small pieces of ice. Let the fish stayed in their respective tank for 5 minutes. Then, we presented the controll fish with another fish that had stayed at the same temperature (19 oC) for 5 minutes and observed the interaction between the two betta fish that both experienced the room temperature water. After a five-minute rest, a warm fish (the one that had stayed in the 22 oC for a while) was introduced to the 19 oC tank together with the controll fish. Recorded the interactions between warm and controll fish for 5 minutes and counted the number of agnostic behaviors of the warm fish. After a five-minute rest, a cold fish (the one that had stayed in the 16 oC for a while) was introduced to the 19 oC and stayed with the controll fish. The number of the cold fish’s agnostic behavior was counted. Each interaction activity was done three times followed by a five-minute rest. The average numbers of aggressive behavior were calculated, and ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance of each comparison. 

Results:
Betta fish were placed in each temperature condition. While they were in their respective conditions, cold fish was the least active, it remained unmoved at the bottom of the tank; warm fish was the most active and swam around in the tank. As shown in Figure 1., the warm fish has the highest number of aggressive behaviors while the cold fish has the least number of aggressive behaviors; ANOVA test shows statistical difference among the three different temperature conditions (p = 0.00127). When the controll fish was put together with another fish that stayed at the same temperature, the controll fish displayed some agnostic behavior. However, when the warm fish was put with the controll fish in the 19 oC tank, the controll fish became the less aggressive one and tended to swim away from the active warm fish. At one point, the warm fish displayed red mane, which is the most aggressive form of the facial movements. While the controll fish was put with the cold fish, the cold fish turned pale immediately, none of its fins was expanded and had no aggressive behavior toward the controll fish. The cold fish could swim fast but was always facing away from the controll fish. 

Discussion:
Aggressive behavior toward conspecific individuals is believed to enhance an individual’s fitness by increasing its reproductive success and suppressing other conspecifics’ chances of passing down their alleles. Thus, it can be said that aggressiveness has evolutionary advantages and is crucial in survival as well. As shown in Figure 1., higher temperature does lead to higher aggressiveness and there is a statistical difference among the three different temperature conditions (p &lt; 0.05). The temperature difference in our experiment is 19 ± 3oC, which may not seem a lot, but did result in dramatic changes in the individual aggressiveness. Our hypothesis was supported -- the warm fish was the most active and aggressive among the three fish; the cold fish was the least active; our results imply that higher temperature may increase the metabolism of the fish, which makes the fish easier to display its aggressive identities, whereas cold temperature may decrease the blood flow and causes difficulties to look big by expanding the fins and gills. This increased boldness in activity was also observed in nature. Since the fish becomes more active in higher temperatures, it is more likely for them to make risky decisions and results in a higher mortality rate compared to that of cooler temperatures in the same lake [Biro: 2007]. However, our experimental design did not incorporate any design to observe any risky behavior that may lead to death.
	Although increases in water temperature may lead to a decrease in oxygen level in the water, B. splendins has labyrinth (a lung-like organ that allows betta fish to breathe air at the surface of the water) to counter the effects of reduced dissolved oxygen level (such as hypoxia) [Alton: 2013]. With that being said, does increasing temperature enhance the aggressiveness of an organism might depend on how their specific energy acquiring mechanism interacts with the environment? Therefore, further study may focus on the physiological changes inside the fish in response to environmental stressors. Another direction of focus may be the ecological perspective, since studies have found that some fishes have died due to climate warming because increase in activity may also cause greater vulnerability to predation, thus decreasing survivability [Biro: 2007]. Thus, on the global scale, how will each individual species be impacted by how their behavior interacts with the changes in their living environment?

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1.  Bar graph displays the number of agnostic behaviors observed in each temperature condition with ± standard deviations. The average of agnostic behaviors recorded in controll 16oC, cold 19 oC, and warm 22 oC are 0 ± 0, 8.67 ± 2.89, and 13.3 ± 2.89 respectively. ANOVA test shows a significent difference among the groups (p_value = 0.00127). Tukey-Kramer test shows that controll vs. warm is not statistically significent while controll vs. cold and warm vs. cold are both statistically significent. *************************************************************************
