Title: Impact of hand soap on electron transfer rates in photosystem II for Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts 

Abstract:
Plants capture energy from the sun in a process known as photosynthesis. There are many factors, including temperature and chemicals, that could alter this process. If we introduce soap to our chloroplast mixture, we expect the transfer of electrons in Photosystem II will decrease. We treated chloroplasts with soap to see if there would be a decrease in photosynthetic activity. Our results were significantly significant, and we found that detergents, such as soap lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity in Photosystem II. This is due to the detergent's ability to interact with noncovalent interactions and disrupt membranes. The addition of detergents was able to significantly decrease electron activity.  

Introduction:
Plants capture energy from the sun in a process known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis involves a series of oxidation and reduction reactions, collectively known as redox reactions. There are many factors that can affect these reactions, such as changes in temperature or the introduction of chemicals. Detergents, such as soap, generally have adverse effects on morphology and inhibit metabolic processes of plants [Jovanic: 2010]. This is because they are able to manipulate both the hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions that are the backbone of organelle structure and activity. They are also able to make proteins soluble, which is important as chlorophyll binds to proteins. It has been seen that chlorophyll is sensitive to detergent, as would be anticipated from detergent interruption of noncovalent interactions [Jovanic: 2010]. It follows that the distinct processes that define photosynthesis would be disrupted by detergents as well. If we introduce soap to our chloroplast mixture, we expect the transfer of electrons in Photosystem II will decrease, which can be detected by changes in DCIP color. 

Materials and Methods:
We cooled a mortar and pestle, medium-sized beaker, and centrifuge tubes on ice. We removed the central vein from 4 spinach leaves and washed and ground the remaining pieces. We added 10 mL of a 400 mM cold grinding buffer at the beginning and added 10 mL more a few minutes later. We strained the mixture through cheesecloth to remove any large pieces still remaining. We centrifuged our sample for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm. We poured the supernatant into a new tube and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. We poured off the supernatant and added 20mL of the cold grinding buffer to the remaining pellet. This was our sample of chloroplasts. We prepared 7 test tubes. One was a blank with 8 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Three contained 5 mL of water, 2mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer and 1 mL of soap. These were our three with chloroplasts and soap. The remaining three were chloroplasts without soap. They contained 6 mL of water and 2 mL of both the 130 mM DCIP and reaction buffer. We added 100 μL of the chloroplast sample to each tube. We blanked the spectrometer at 600nm and recorded the absorbance of each sample at time 0. We then took absorbance measurements every ten minutes for the next thirty minutes. We calculated the percent differences and performed 3 2-sample t-tests at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.  

Results:
The p-values resulting from this experiment at 10, 20, and 30 minutes respectively were  9.26×10-7, 1.41×10-6, and 2.34×10-6. All of these values were under .05 which is the cut off for significance. Our data was statistically significant. 
We organized our data by finding the percent difference between the data at time 0 and the data and 10, 20, and 30 minutes. This is shown in Figure 1. It is clear that there was a large difference in electron activity based on the trends seen in the figure. 


Discussion:
Due to the p-value received, we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis. Soap lowers the level of electron transfer in Photosystem II. The soap interfered with the function of the chloroplast in this process. It damaged or altered the chloroplast through the disruption of noncovalent interaction that hold together the membrane of organelles. By detergents ability to interact with hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, it can more successfully disrupt the membrane. This was seen in the experiment, when electron transfer occurred at a much lower level in the samples treated with soap. Detergents can have many effects on chloroplasts. They can remove the chlorophyll and make it soluble, split the chloroplasts into protein units, or rupture intact chloroplasts and interrupt electron flow [Vernon: 1965]. Any disruption of the normal functions of chloroplast should cause a decrease in photosynthetic activity. Even if the detergent is removed, it has been observed that chloroplasts will be unable to regain their normal function [Vernon: 1965]. This is highly significant in modern society. Runoff polluted with many kinds of harmful detergents often finds its way into the water system or more damagingly the ground water. If this pollution problem persists, it could heavily impact the photosynthesis of various autotrophic organisms. We rely on many of these organisms for things such as food and oxygen. If they are not able to photosynthesize to support themselves, we are at risk of losing essential natural resources. We need to be aware of what pollutes our water and how it affects the normal processes of vegetative life. Further experimentation could be done to determine at what level detergents are harmful. They may be less potent to chloroplasts in small amounts. It would also be interesting to see if there were any reactions that could be done to protect the chloroplasts from detergents, which may be important with seemingly no decrease in pollution levels.
