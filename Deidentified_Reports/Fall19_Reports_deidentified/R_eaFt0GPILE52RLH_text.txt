Title: The Negative Impact of Ecdysterone (20E) on the Mass of the Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The hormone Ecdysterone (20E) controlls the growth of insects and regulates the timing of their molting. This study measured the impact of 20E on the Manduca sexta and the negative effects of it on their mass. The insecticide Azaguard was used to perform this experiment and was hypothesized that the organisms that receive the Azaguard will have a smaller mass than the organisms not receiving Azaguard. Eight drops of Azaguard were used in the treatment group’s food while only water was present in the controll group’s food. It was concluded that the Azaguard did result in a lower mass and even death in the treatment group. Once performing a statistical test, this result was confirmed.

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta is a common pest to tobacco, tomato and other various crops. Although it molts into a heavy-bodied moth the larval stage is more often encountered as it causes significent defoliation to economically important agricultural crops [Byron: 2017]. Present in each hornworm is 20E and the Juvenile Hormone (JH) which controlls growth, molting, and metamorphosis. In particular, 20E regulates the type of molting during development [Johnson: 2019]. Because both of these hormones are significent in the growth of the hornworm, the excess or loss of one has the potential of cause adverse effects on the insect. For instance, it could possibly cause a decrease in molts and therefore the inability to metamorphosize into an adult form. When having 20E present in unnatural quantities in the organism, there is the potential for impacting the growth of the organism. This organism is useful to study in a lab setting because the development process is controllled by many hormones and ideal because of the ease of the biochemical and endocrinological manipulations it presents [Riddiford: 2003]. In this report, findings are presented which question the impact on the 20E hormone, Azaguard, on the hornworm caterpillar. Azaguard is marketed as a way to prevent molting between larval, pupal, and nymphal stages which reduces insect infestations [Azaguard: 2019]. This is significent because it can reduce the amount of crop death when used. It is hypothesized that the organisms that receive eight drops of Azaguard every day in their food will on average have a lower mass than the organisms that receive just the food. The organisms will be weighed to support or reject this claim. 

Materials and Method:
Two labeled containers with eight different sections were prepared to house the organisms with 10 grams of food measured out in each section of the containers. Eight drops of water were added to the food of the controll group of organisms and eight drops of Azaguard were added to the food of the treatment group. One caterpillar was placed in each section of the containers and placed into an incubator. Each day, every caterpillar was weighed, the containers were cleaned, and any dried food was replaced when needed with the same ratio of food and either water or the chemical. Daily observations were recorded, and growth and death were monitored—this took place for a period of two weeks. The organisms that had food with only water were used as the controll group. The presence of Azaguard in the food was measured as the independent variable while the mass of the organism was used as the dependent variable. A two-sample t_test was then used to analyze the average masses of the organisms once the experiment was complete. Laying out this strategical method hopes to increase the ability for reproducibility if this experiment were to be completed again. 

Results:
Each day, the caterpillars were measured and monitored, and their weights were recorded. Shown in Table 1 is the average mass of caterpillars each day—the average mass of the controll group started at 0.15 g and ended at 11.70 grams while the average mass of the treatment group started at 0.16 grams and ended at 0.43 grams. The independent variable, which was the eight drops of Azaguard in the food, stayed the same each day while the dependent variable, the mass of the caterpillars, usually varied each day. By September 15, all of the treatment caterpillars were dead. Notably, one of the controll caterpillars also died by the end of the experiment. 
Figure 1 can be used in conjunction with Table 1 to analyze the growth of the caterpillars and compare which group had a higher average mass. Using these results, a two-sample t_test was performed to conclude whether the hypothesis can be accepted or rejected. It was found that there was a p_value of 0.0352. The difference in the mass from day one to the end per caterpillar in each group were used to find this data as seen in Table 2. 

Discussion:
Throughout this study, it was hypothesized that the caterpillars that received eight drops of Azagaurd in their food will have a lower mass on average than the caterpillars that received only food with the null hypothesis that the addition of Azagaurd to the food will not affect the masses of the organisms. Based on the data shown in Table 1 and Figure 1, and further supported by the p_value, it is evident that the hypothesis can be accepted, and the null hypothesis rejected. When using the two-sample t_test, any value less than 0.05 shows that the results are statistically significent and the null may be rejected. The statistically significent result showcases this meaning that the insecticide, Azaguard, was successful in limiting growth in the caterpillars, as predicted, since it is marketed as a way to prevent molting between larval, pupal, and nymphal stages [Azaguard: 2019].
Starting with the controll group, it was evident from the first couple of days that there was a distinct difference in their growth when compared to the treatment group—the mass of the controll group was always higher than that of the treatment group—as seen in Table 1 and Figure 1. Although there was a slight dip in the masses at the end of the experiment in the controll group, it is still greater than the mass of the treatment group. The lack of growth is apparent while looking at a graph of the data as it is evident that the controll group grew rapidly—especially beginning September 9—while the controll group shows very little change in weight. The graph shows almost a flat line for the treatment group while the controll group shows a lot of change. To further confirm the results, a two-sample t_test was performed. It was found that there was a p_value of 0.0352. The difference in the mass from day one to the end per caterpillar in each group were used to find this data as seen in Table 2. However, one of the controll caterpillars ended up dying within the last few days which different from the results of the other controll caterpillars. There could have been outlying circumstances that were not being measured in this experiment that effected this caterpillar and caused it to die. For example, it could have been unhealthy before the experiment began. 
In the future, if this experiment were recreated, it is suggested to use more than four caterpillars per group to provide a larger sample size in order to confirm that these results were indeed accurate and not just a fluke. Also, in an ideal situation, other aspects of the organism’s health could be tested, other than mass, to determine the complete impact of this chemical on it. 
As stated before, Azaguard could possibly cause a decrease in molts and therefore the inability to metamorphosize into an adult form. This proves that Azaguard can be helpful in limiting insect infestations and since caterpillar can cause significent defoliation of economically important crops, it therefore increases the chances of crop survival in places where this caterpillar is present [Byron: 2017]. In total, the results showcase how Azaguard restricted molting and growth of the caterpillar and resulted in death in some situations and an overall smaller mass when compared to the controll group, proving the hypothesis.

Figure 1. The controll caterpillar mass has a general trend of increasing per day while the treatment caterpillars increased very slowly and then not at all. The treatment caterpillars, which had Azaguard in their food, did not grow at the rate of the controll caterpillars.
