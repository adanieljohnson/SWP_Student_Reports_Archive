Title: JH Hormone in 3rd Instar Tobacco Hornworms 

Abstract:
n/a 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm or sphinx moth, are an excellent choice for a experiment on endocrine control in insects, as they are easily found in this environment, and have a relatively short life cycle. They are part of a group of insects with holometabolous life cycles, which features four main life stages.  These are the embryonic stage, five larval substages, the pupa and finally, the adult moth stage [Reinecke:1980]. In order to move from one stage to another, the insect goes through pupa metamorphosis, and in turn, no major life stages look similar. The larval stage, the main focus of this lab, is characterized by vermiform, soft bodies, blue-green in color. They have mandibles, prolegs and crochets, while the pupa is characterized by the change to a straw like mouth part, and the first development of small wings [Johnson:2016].
This development is controlled by hormones, present at different levels in the larva. Two main hormones that are responsible for development and molting in hornworms are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Riddiford:2012]. They work together, so that 20E controls which type of molt will occur and JH controls when the molt occurs [Wigglesworth:1940].  The concentration ratio of the two chemical signals determines which stage of life the animal is in [Riddiford:2007]. In general, as the insect gets ready to molt, there is a rise in 20E hormone, which triggers the molt [Truman:1981]. JH hormone remains at high concentrations during the larval stage and only begins to fall as the larva enters the 4th instar phase. This drastic decrease in JH during the 5th instar stage, triggers the final molt towards the pupa, and change in physical features. If JH were to remain present in the organism at a high level, the change to the pupal stage would be prevented [Kiguchi:1978]. An important ratio of the two hormones is known as the Commitment Pulse, when the JH level has dropped significanlty in the 5th instar phase, but there is a slight rise in 20E [Johnson:2016]. This event allows the caterpillar to move to the pupa stage, and would only occur if the caterpillar was large enough and capable of moving forward in the life stage. Both hormones continue to play a major role in the development and behavior of the insects in both the pupa and adult stages [Johnson:2016]. In contrast, another theory suggests that JH also has an effect on 20E, acting as an inhibitor to the 20E [Safranek:1980]. In this lab, the JH compound given to the caterpillars was a JH analague, known as methoprene. Methoprene has a similar chemical structure to JH [Riddiford:2012], and can be used in its place in lab experiments, as done in Riddiford’s exploration. Methoprene mimics JH by binding to the same ligand receptors as JH, known as the Met receptor [Riddiford:2012]. Since it is capable of binding to the same receptors, Methoprene can induce the same effects as Juvenile Hormone in organisms with the Met gene, like Manduca Sexta. 
In this experiment, we hypothesized that if we treat 3rd instar horn worm larvae with 10 drops Methoprene solution, then they will gain more mass than caterpillars without the treatment because the JH hormone level will remain too high to signal a commitment pulse, preventing a molt into the pupa phase.   


Materials and Methods:
Eight tobacco horn worm larva in the 3rd instar stage were selected for the experiment. Caterpillars were selected so that they had similar size and coloration. Four caterpillars were designated “control group” organisms, and four caterpillars were designated “treatment group” organisms. All caterpillars received 10 grams of supplied caterpillar food each. The control group caterpillars’ food was mixed with 10 drops of water, while the treatment group caterpillars’ food was treated with 10 drops of 1:250 JH hormone solution (methoprene). Four well plastic containers were used to keep the caterpillars, with one caterpillar in each well and one container for each group (control and treatment). The caterpillars were massed and the wells were cleaned daily. During daily checks, if the caterpillar had eaten all of the food in the well, it was replaced with a new 10 gram block mixed with the according solution. The two containers were kept in an incubator for two weeks while being monitered, until they were properly disposed of. After two weeks, a 2 sample, unpaired T-Test with a p-value of .05 was used to determine if the results of the trial were significant. 

Results:
Qualitatively, after the two weeks, the treatment group caterpillars were very pale in color and almost white. The characteristic black and white stripes were barely visible (Figure 1). The control caterpillars remained bright teal, with defined black and white stripes (Figure 2).Little difference in growth was shown between the two groups. Table 1 shows the beginning mass and change in mass over the two weeks for each caterpillar. There is no clear trend between the mass gained in each group. Figure 3 shows the average change in mass between the two groups of caterpillars, control and treatment. The control caterpillars had a greater mass after the two weeks. However, the average weight gained by the treatment group caterpillars was not statistically significant different than the weight gained by the control group (t-stat = .519 , df=6, P = .311). A one-tailed P value was used.  

Discussion:
Since the results are not significantly signifcant, the hypothesis that the control group will not grow as much as the experimental group can not be supported. In Rhodnius Prolixus, fifth instar juveniles that received JH hormone injections did not produce adult features but instead molted to a sixth, supernumerary instar phase [Wigglesworth, 1969].  In the hornworm experiment, similar results were expected, as the treatment group would instead of beginning to pupate, grow to be larger than that of the control group. However, this did not occur. A possible reason for the results could be the starting instar phase of the caterpillars. Although they had similar beginning masses (Table 1), the caterpillars could have been in different developmental stages, not allowing for accurate comparison of growth. JH hormone controls when adult features develop, and no caterpillars in our trial developed adult features, suggesting the possibility that the caterpillars did not have enough time to grow, and reach a late enough instar phase [Reinecke:1980]. 
	The treatment caterpillars became discolored after the two weeks of treatment which could suggest a developmental issue within the caterpillars caused by the excessive amount of JH hormone they received. There is a possibility that 10 drops of Methoprene overwhelmed the caterpillars endocrine system, causing development to pause. There is not enough research to determine if this is what happened in the trial, however more research can be done on discoloration and its meaning in terms of Manduca Sexta development in relation to JH hormone.
	Previous research has suggested that JH hormone can act as a 20E inhibitor, which would delay molting in Manduca Sexta [Safranek:1980]. If this was the case in the trials during our lab, 10 drops of Methoprene solution could have acted as an inhibitor to 20E, stopping development as the caterpillar would not receive the signal to molt. Although the results are not statistically significant, the higher average change in mass of the control group supports the conclusions of the Safranek paper, because the caterpillars that received the Methoprene did not grow as large.  
	The trial should be repeated to have more information on the amount of mass the caterpillars gained over two weeks, and if the treatment group would still grow similarily to the control group. Repetition of the trial would provide more information on how the JH hormone effects caterpillar growth if 10 drops is given. Our results suggest that 10 drops is too much extra hormone for the caterpillar endocrine system to take, but further research is necessary to provide more evidence.
