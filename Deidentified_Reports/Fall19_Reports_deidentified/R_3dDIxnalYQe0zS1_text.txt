Title: Juvenile hormone and its effects on molting rate and mass

Abstract:
ads' fsf 

Introduction:
Our experiment focused primarily on the effects of Precor juvenile hormone (JH) on the molting rate of Manduca sexta larvae.  Manduca sexta are often referred to as tobacco hornworms and have earned the reputation of being a pest in the Southeastern United States.  In order to combat the destruction of crops, farmers have turned to pesticides in order to speed up the masturation of these insects as they are only a nuisance when in the larval state.  The Manduca sexta experiences five instar, pupal, and adult state [Reinecke: 1980]. Each step in the maturation process is triggered by a rise in ecdysterone levels above juvenile hormone levels [Riddiford: 1977].  If the juvenile hormone levels remain consistently above that of the ecdysterone, there will be no furthering of the process of metamorphosis.  Juvenile hormone is known to delay the transformation to the next instar of insects such as when it is used to combat Drosophila melanogaster [Riddiford: 1991].  Therefore, if four drops of Precor juvenile hormone solution are mixed into Manduca Sexta’s food, their rate of molting from a pupate to an adult will decrease compared to those with four drops of tap water mixed into their food.  This should lead to a decrease in overall weight of the experimental group due to a lack of development.

Materials and Methods:
In order to test our hypothesis, we utilized eight total Manduca sexta larvae with four being the experimental group and the others the control.  The eight were chosen out of the transportation container and individually placed in sections of two plastic containers.  Once each had been separated into the correct compartment, one hole was poked into the sides of each in order to allow for proper airflow.  Once each compartment was prepared for long term storage, the experimental group of Manduca sexta received 10 grams of control food that had been mixed with four drops of Precor juvenile hormone.  Furthermore, each control Manduca sexta received the same 10 gram portion of food but mixed with tap water.  Next, over the course of sixteen days, the weights of each worm was measured to the ten-thousandth of a gram and recorded on a spreadsheet.  All deceased Manduca sexta were labeled as “dead” on the spreadsheet upon discovery.  The food was replaced upon drying as the Manduca sexta refuse to consume dry food. Once the sixteen-day period was finished, a T-test was used to compare the masses of the control and experimental groups and visual differences were recorded. 

Results:
Even in the early period of the experiment, the Precor infused food group began to grow at an faster rate with an average third day weight of 0.3073 grams compared to the control group’s 0.2275 grams.  After just a week, the control groups average weight reached 1.1745 grams and the experimental group at 2.3582 grams.  At the final weighing, the average weight of the control group was 12.3230 grams and the experimental at 13.8460 grams.  The standard deviation of the final weights of the control group ended with a rather high number of 2.6812 grams, while the standard deviation of the final experimental group weights was 1.5802 grams.  The two tailed T-Test resulted in a p value of 0.3829, which is most likely due to two of the Manduca sexta dying.  This p value menas that there is no significance found in the reuslts.

Discussion:
According to the p value of the T-Test, our results were not statistically significant and there was some sort of error within the experiment.  This is most likely due to the fact that two of our Manduca sexta within the control group died prematurely.  The error was most likely unavoidable as we maintained all variable possible in order to keep them alive.  Because of the our p value is viewed as “not significant,” we are unable to rule out our null hypothesis.  Despite this, Figure , Figure 2, and Figure 3 all clearly depict an absolute difference between the control and experimental groups.  One can clearly see the beginning development of the pupal stage of the control group at the on the distal side of the Manduca sexta.  However, there is no such development on those who ingested the juvenile hormone food.  This delay in development mirrors the experiment on Hyalophora cecropia larve, who also exhibited delayed maturation when exposed to juvenile hormone [Williams: 1961].  Also, an unexpected result of the experiment was faded colors on the Manduca sexta exposed to juvenile hormone.  While the discoloration may be due to a lower exposure of light, the stark contrast is apparent when comparing figures 1 and 2.  Futhermore, the average weight for those exposed to heightened levels of juvenile hormone achieved a larger mass with the average final weighing being 1.52 grams more than those who were not.  However, despite reveiving observational results that supported our hypothesis, there are still was to further the study.  An interesting way to improve upon this experiment would be to observe the Manduca sexta for a longer period of time, especially as maturation signs become more and more prominent.  A timeframe as long as twenty days may suffice if one would like to observe the delay of metamorphosis further.  Another potential improvement could be an increase in the dosage of juvenile hormone.  Our group utilized a lower dosage which may have led to less exaggerated results.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1.  Phototgraph of experimental Manduca sexta on day sixteen of observation.  Experimental group was fed ten grams of provided food mixed with four drops of Precor juvenile hormone on a daily basis.  A lack of pupating and faded color indicates potential lack of maturation.
Figure 2. Photograph of control Manduca sexta on day sixteen of observation.  Control group was feed ten grams of provided food mixed with four drops of tap water on a daily basis.  There is clear pupation forming along the limbs of the larvae along with more vibrant color.  These indicate clear maturation by the control group.
