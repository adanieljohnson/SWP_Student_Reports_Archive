Title: Effects of HCl on the Root:Shoot Ratio for length of Raphanus sativus

Abstract:
The effect of limited resources on Raphanus sativus, or more commonly known as radish plants, was tested to see if the addition of acid in the environment would affect growth and development. To measure growth and development, the length of roots and shoots of the plants were measured. If the radish plants grow in the acidic environment, then the root to shoot length ratio will be lower than the root to shoot ratio for plants grown in non-acidic soil. To verify the hypothesis, an experiment was done over multiple class settings and included nine total groups of radish plants — three of which served as the overall controll group and two experimental groups with three plants in each group. The results showed that the experimental group with the highest exposure to acid had the highest root to shoot ratio for length. This experiment can help farmers with establishing the best area to grow crops so that acid in the soil does not impact their growth. In future experiments, it is pertinent that the plants are watered daily in order to maintain growth and development and obtain accurate results.

Introduction:
The environment in which a plant inhabits has a strong impact on not only how the growth of a plant is distributed, but the quality of growth as well. For instance, regardless of the specific surroundings, a plant will properly allocate the resources available within the environment in order to optimize growth. By doing this, plants are participating in a certain trade-off. This consists of making the crucial decision as to whether to further grow the root or shoot. The root of a plant works to not only anchor the plant within the soil, but is also responsible for absorbing water and many key nutrients. The shoot of a plant consists of the stem and leaves. The shoot is responsible for the structure of the plant as well as capturing light and competition [Johnson: 2019]. In detail, the root and shoot growth of a plant alters according to the environment and resources available for growth. One way to analyze and better understand how plants allocate to either further increase growth in root or shoot is by obtaining a root:shoot ratio. The root:shoot ratio is a strong indication of how a plant adjusts to its changing environment.

In an experiment done previously by multiple scientists in 1987, the importance of a controllled environment on the root and shoot growth of plants was tested. This study found that by reducing environmental stresses, such as controllling the temperature and pH levels of the soil, the plants consisted of similar root and shoot lengths [Koch: 1987]. Thus, further proving how the environment impacts the root and shoot growth of plants as they attempt to optimize their growth. In their experiment, the root:shoot ratio was utilized as a form of analysis. In a more specific experiment done by scientist Patricia Irving in 1984, how radish plants shift in root and shoot growth in response to acid rain in their growing environment was tested. The results revealed that the radish plants grown with the presence of stimulated acid rain had less growth in both root and shoot length in comparison to radish plants exposed to nitrate [Irving: 1984]. Therefore, insisting that acid has a negative impact on the growth of radish plants. In another experiment done by multiple scientists in 1982 also tested the impact of water and acid on field grown radish plants. The results of this experiment indicated a decrease in plant growth as well as a statistical significance in the growth of shoots for radish plants grown in acid rain versus the controll group [Troiano: 1982]. Testing the impact of acid on plant growth is highly relevant to outside the realm of science. For instance, with global warming and climate change being serious issues impacting the world today, there could be a correlation in the acidity of soil that impacts plant growth. Not only that, but some crops are grown in areas with factories or pollution that could expose the plants to acid and therefore impact the growth of the plant.

For this reason, the primary goal of this laboratory experiment was to test the impacts of acid on how plants change their root and shoot growth according to their changing environment. For this laboratory experiment, plants known as Rahpanus sativus, or more commonly referred to as radish plants were utilized because they are inexpensive and easy to grow. With common knowledge combined with knowledge gathered from previous experiments, a hypothesis was developed. The root:shoot ratio for length of the radish plants is expected to decrease as the amount of acid they are exposed to in their environment increases in relation to the controll group. This is because the inclusion of acid would inhibit root growth and in order to compensate for the  loss of resources available in the soil, the plant would utilize more resources through the shoot and further expand the shoot growth — giving an overall less root:shoot ratio for the plants exposed to acid versus the controll which only received water.

Materials and Method:
This laboratory experiment was conducted over the course of two weeks. All of the necessary materials were gathered. This included an accumulation of radish seeds, miracle growth, water, vermiculite, and a total of nine trays used to grow the plants within. Vermiculite was first added to each of the nine trays. Next, the radish seeds were placed within the soil. A hole was made by placing a finger in the soil in order to dig up a space to plant the radish seeds. Once the seeds were firMly planted, about 100 Ml of miracle growth was added to each of the containers in order to help initiate growth. All of the containers were then drenched with water. It was crucial to add a sufficient amount of water to the plants. This is because the vermiculite used to grow the plants in soaks up all of the water, so an abundant amount of water must be added to ensure that there is enough for plant growth. The proper amount of water can be confirmed by adding enough water that it overflows out of the container. Once all nine of the trays were properly set, they were divided into three groups each with three trays. One group consisting of three trays served as the controll where only water was added daily, another three trays were assigned as experimental group 1 and received 5 Ml of pH 3.0 HCl in addition to the daily amount of water. Finally, the last three trays served as the final experimental group that received 10 Ml of pH 3.0 HCl. All nine of the containers were labeled and placed in a designated spot in the greenhouse.

Over the course of two weeks, the plants were nurtured daily. This entailed watering the plants with an ample amount of water as well as adding the designated dosages of pH 3.0 HCl (5Ml and 10 Ml) in the proper plants serving as the experimental groups. After two weeks, the plants were gathered and analyzed. This was done by individually placing each container in a bucket full of water. This allowed for the roots and shoots to be sorted through the first and obtained while still in tact. Once three radish plants were obtained from each of the groups, they were separated. The root and shoot length were measured by carefully cutting at the appropriate area where the two become distinct and then using a ruler to obtain the data. Once all of the data was collected, the root:shoot ratio was calculated by dividing the root value by the shoot value. The root:shoot ratios were then all averaged and used for further analysis. The specific amount of acid added to the two experimental groups was the independent variable and the root:shoot ratio of length in the plant was the dependent variable. Additional analysis was done by running an anova. This was done in order to compare the three individuals groups in the laboratory experiment and to determine if there was a difference among the groups. An anova allows for a Tukey-Kramer to further analyze the data upon calculating a p_value to indicate where among the three groups a statistical significance lies if there is one present at all. With this data, a graph was created to properly display the findings.

Results:
The root:shoot ratios of the individual controll and experimental trials were each averaged for convenience. The average root:shoot ratio for length of the controll trial was 0.73 with a standard deviation of 0.08. The average root:shoot ratio for length of the first experimental group of radish plants with only 5 Ml of HCl added was 0.75 with a standard deviation of 0.21. The average root:shoot ratio for length of the second experimental group of radish plants with 10 Ml of HCl added was 1.37 with a standard deviation of 0.11. Through an anova, the p_value was determined to be 0.002 among the group. This p_value was below the set alpha of 0.05. The Tukey-Kramer test indicated significance between the root:shoot ratio for length of the controll and the experimental group with 10 Ml of HCl, as well as significance between the two experimental groups with 5Ml of HCl and 10 Ml of HCl. In Figure 1, the results of each trial were averaged so the difference among the growth of the radish plants could be displayed more clearly.

Discussion:
Based on the overall results, the hypothesis is rejected because there was an unexpected increase in the root:shoot ratio for length of radish plants after being exposed to acid in comparison to the controll. This is because the shoot length was found to be less than the root length upon addition of acid. This observation was most prominent in relation to the experimental group of radish plants exposed to 10 Ml of HCl. After running an anova test, the p_value was determined as 0.002. This value was below the set alpha of 0.05 which indicates there was statistical significance among the three groups. Through the Tukey-Kramer, it was found that the statistical significance lies between the controll group and the 10 Ml of HCl radish plants. Along with that, there was statistical significance among the radish plants with 5 Ml of HCl compared to 10 Ml of HCl. The trend reveals that as the amount of acid present in the environment increases, the root:shoot ratio for length of the radish plant increases as well.

In relation to the similar studies done previously by researchers, the results from this laboratory experiment do not match. The study by Troiano found an overall decrease in plant growth but it is unknown whether this was in terms of root or shoot length as they solely tested the overall growth of the plant [Troiano: 1982]. In the study completed by Irving, there was a similar result of a decrease observed in radish plant growth [Irving: 1984]. The data obtained in this laboratory experiment consisted of several errors such as inconsistency when taking measurements and lack of cautiousness when initially planting the radish seeds. These sources of error can explain the unforeseen results that were found in this laboratory experiment. If this experiment were to be replicated in the future, the plants would be watered with a fixed daily schedule. Also, it would be interesting to test basicity in the future and to compare the effects it has on plant growth in relation to acid. This laboratory experiment has importance on a grander scope than simply in the field of biology. By understanding the impacts of acid on plant growth, there can be changes made to how crops are grown to implement more optimal growth in acidic areas. Ultimately, the original hypothesis was based on the assumption that the shoot length would be greater than that of the root length as a result of limited resources available in the soil, thus giving a lower root:shoot ratio in length of radish plants with acid present. However, the opposite occurred. Although this increase in root:shoot ratio in length of radish plants with acid present in the environment was unexpected, it is supported by a possibly different biological reasoning.
The plant is investing more energy into the roots in order to further expand root growth so minerals within the soil can be found. Furthermore, with more surface area of roots present, the more nutrients within the soil could be collected. This explains the greater root length observed in the study. With this information and the biological reasoning aforementioned, there is confidence in the results obtained from this study.

Figure 1. Comparison of the averages of root:shoot ratio for the length of radish plants. In total, nine radish plants were used with three of the plants serving as controlls and solely receiving water and the other three plants serving as the experimental group 1 with having 5 Ml of HCl and another three plants in the experimental group 2 with 10 Ml of HCl added along with daily water. The graph shows the average root:shoot ratio for length of both the controll and each experimental group. The error bars indicate the standard deviation from the averages — controll was 0.73 +/- 0.08, experimental group with 5Ml of HCl was 0.75 +/- 0.21, and the last experimental group with 10 Ml of HCl was 1.37 +/- 0.11. After conducting an anova, the p_value was calculated as 0.002.*************************************************************************
