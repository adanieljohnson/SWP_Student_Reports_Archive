Title: Administering Lanthanum Chloride to Rana pipiens legs showed that blocking calcium from entering the muscle does not prevent muscle contraction from occurring. 

Abstract:
Calcium is one of the components involved in the process of muscle contraction. Its primary role is to trigger muscle contraction by binding to troponin, which in turn exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments and allows the interaction of actin and myosin to occur. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of calcium in muscle contraction of R. pipiens legs, specifically whether blocking calcium from entering the muscle will cause the twitch threshold of R. pipiens legs to increase or become non-existent. Through administering lanthanum chloride into the R. pipiens legs, we found that blocking calcium does not have a huge influence on twitch amplitude. A paired t-test indicates that the results are not significant since the p-value is not less than 0.05. Overall, we concluded that this experiment showed that blocking calcium from entering the muscle does not prevent muscle contraction from happening or have a profound effect on the twitch amplitude. However, we found possible biological explanations that further explain the insignificant results generated in this experiment. 

Introduction:
In the neuromuscular system, a nerve triggers muscle contraction through excitation-contraction coupling [Johnson: 2018]. In this process, action potentials traveling down the axon of a motor neuron arrive at the neuromuscular junction and stimulate the release of vesicles of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, from the presynaptic motor neuron terminal [Hacker: 2016]. Acetylcholine diffuses across the synaptic cleft, binds to acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic plasma membrane of the muscle fiber, and then opens up sodium ion channels [Hacker: 2016]. These sodium ion channels depolarize the cell and produce an action potential, which travels through opened T tubules deep into the muscle cell and instigates a change in conformation of the DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor [Hacker: 2016]. As a result, stored calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a calcium reservoir [Hacker: 2016]. The released calcium triggers muscle contraction by binding to troponin, which exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments, allowing myosin heads to bind and initiate a power stroke, where the actin and myosin filaments slide past one another [Hacker: 2016]. ATP then binds to myosin, causing it to release the actin filaments and return to its extended head conformation [Hacker: 2016]. While monitoring changes in the release of acetylcholine from vesicles and release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum are difficult to accomplish, the activities of a muscle or nerve can be observed through the use of a myogram [Johnson: 2018]. A myogram is a visual representation of the different stages within a single muscle twitch [Johnson: 2018]. In taking this information into account, our experimental question is does blocking calcium from entering the muscle affect muscle contraction in R. pipiens legs? In this experiment, we will use lanthanum chloride, a chemical that blocks calcium, to test the effect of a lack of calcium present in the muscle on the twitch threshold of R. pipiens legs. Lanthanum is a “rare earth element” that has been shown in several studies to be a calcium channel antagonist by preventing calcium influx into various cells [Lopez: 2010]. For example, one study determined that lanthanum chloride can prevent calcium from entering parathyroid cells [Lopez: 2010]. In relation to this experiment, another study demonstrated how lanthanum chloride can inhibit a flow of calcium into muscle cells [Lopez: 2010]. Taking into account these studies, the goal of this experiment is to analyze the effects of blocked calcium on muscle function in R. pipiens, which we will accomplish through measuring the twitch threshold of R. pipiens legs through nerve stimulation. We will first use R. pipiens legs as control groups that do not receive an injection of lanthanum chloride, and then use the same R. pipiens legs as treatment groups that do receive an administration of the chemical. Twitch threshold will serve as the dependent variable and lanthanum chloride will serve as the independent variable. We predict that blocking calcium from entering the muscle will prevent muscle contraction from happening, thereby causing the twitch amplitude to be very high or non-existent since the release of calcium is what activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. Without calcium, the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments will not be exposed, which means the sliding of actin and myosin filaments will not occur to generate a muscle contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
We selected four R. pipiens legs and used each of them as their own control and treatment group. Specifically, we found the baseline threshold for each R. pipiens leg as the control group, and then injected 0.1 mL of 1mM lanthanum chloride into each leg, as the treatment group. The legs were first dissected. We removed the skin, exposed the sciatic nerve, and detached the gastrocnemius and a portion of the Achilles tendon. After dissecting each specimen, we set up the software to perform the data collection, assigning the pulse amplitude to 0.000 V, the number of pulses to 1, the frequency to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. For statistical analysis, a paired t-test was used to compare the twitch thresholds of the control group to the treatment group. 

Results:
Based on observation of the data, it can be seen that there was either no difference in voltage or a difference of less than 0.5 volts between the control and treatment group for twitch threshold. Specifically, there was no difference in voltage for R. pipiens leg #1, a difference of 0.5 volts for R. pipiens leg #2, a difference of 0.01 volts for R. pipiens leg #3, and a difference of 0.01 volts for frog leg #4. Figure 1 shows that the twitch threshold of the treatment group (after the injection of lanthanum chloride) is slightly lower than the control group (before lanthanum chloride was injected). The t-value is 0.951, the degrees of freedom is 3, and the p-value is 0.412. The results are not significant since the p-value is not less than 0.05. 


Discussion:
Before conducting this experiment, we learned that calcium plays a crucial role in the contractile mechanism of muscle fiber, because once released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds to troponin, which exposes the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments and then initiates the process of actin and myosin filaments sliding past one another [Hacker: 2016]. Therefore, we predicted that the administration of lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, would have an important impact on the ability of the R. pipiens legs to contract. Specifically, we hypothesized that blocking calcium would inhibit muscle contraction and thus cause the amplitude to be very high or non-existent. However, our results do not support our hypothesis. The graph trends show that as a whole the administration of lanthanum chloride slightly decreased twitch amplitude. The error bars, a measure of variability associated with standard deviation, indicate that the difference is most likely not statistically significant, which is proven and supported by the p-value for the paired t-test. The p-value marks the results insignificant, therefore not supporting our initial prediction that blocking calcium would prevent muscle contraction from happening. 

Some studies examined the effects of lanthanum chloride on the calcium-sensing receptor response [Lopez: 2010]. The results of these studies reveal that not only does lanthanum chloride serve as a calcium channel antagonist, blocking calcium from entering the muscle, but also causes the calcium receptors present to become hypersensitive [Lopez: 2010]. Despite the absence of calcium due to it being a calcium channel antagonist, lanthanum chloride was also found in these studies to be an agonist of the calcium-sensing receptor response. Consequently, lanthanum chloride has the ability to bind to calcium receptors and activate them, as well as enhance their sensitivity to calcium [Lopez: 2010]. As a result, the dual functionality of lanthanum chloride as a calcium channel antagonist and a calcium receptor response agonist cancel each other out, which provides explanation for the produced raw data that shows either no difference in voltage or a difference of less than 0.5 volts between the control and treatment group (in which lanthanum chloride was administered) for twitch amplitude. Some calcium is still present in the muscle. Thus, while there is not as much calcium entering the muscle due to lanthanum chloride blocking it, the hypersensitive calcium receptors read the small amount of calcium present as a normal amount (as if the calcium were not blocked), generating the same threshold or perhaps even a slightly lower one since the receptors become more sensitive to calcium. In examining the results of our experiment and analyzing other studies, it is evident that lanthanum chloride was a poor choice for a calcium channel blocker to measure the effect of blocking calcium on twitch amplitude, since it affected the calcium receptors as well. In the end, lanthanum chloride cancelled out its dual effects in the muscle cell, making it difficult for us to analyze whether the blocking of calcium would in actuality support our hypothesis by causing the twitch amplitude to increase or become non-existent. 

Looking towards the future, the next logical steps for this study would be to modify the procedure and repeat this experiment. The main procedure step we would change if we repeated the study again would be to use a different calcium channel blocker that only blocks calcium and does not have an effect on calcium receptors. We would also utilize more frog legs to have access to additional data points and to be able to have a separate control group from treatment group. Using different legs for the control group versus the treatment group would to ensure that the muscle is not twitched to fatigue. All in all, our study revealed that blocking calcium with lanthanum chloride does not have a huge effect on muscle contraction of R. pipiens legs due to its ability to activate and hypersensitize calcium receptors, causing us to question whether the use of other calcium blockers would indeed show a greater effect on muscle contraction of R. pipiens legs, particularly examining twitch amplitude and whether it would actually increase or become non-existent.

Figure Legends: 
Figure #1 – Effect of blocked calcium on the twitch threshold of R. pipiens. 4 R. pipiens legs were used, each one as its own control and treatment group. The twitch threshold was measured before and after the administration of lanthanum chloride for each R. pipiens leg. The control group (blue) shows a slight increase in twitch threshold. The treatment group (red) shows a slight decrease in twitch threshold. A measure of variability, these errors bars indicate that the difference is most likely not statistically significant, which is validated by the paired t-test that denotes the results not significant, since the p-value is not less than 0.05.
