Title: Red “Mane” Protrusions of Betta Splendens in Shelter Environments

Abstract:
Animals utilize agonistic behavioral traits that protect themselves from threatening organisms. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if male Betta splendens who have access to shelter will demonstrate less aggression than those without shelter access. This was tested by observing the agonistic behavior of the red “mane” protruding in three male Betta splendens interacting with one another with and without a shelter in their environment. It was hypothesized that the number of times the red “mane” is used without a shelter present would be greater compared to the number of times the red “mane” is used with a shelter. There was a significant difference between the mean red “mane” protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5,p-value=0.029). This could be due to the survival behavior of fish to go to shelters in the presence of predators.

Introduction:
Behavioral traits are necessary to survive in competition with other organisms. Agonistic behaviors are aggressive responses to threats made by other organisms in the environment. There are also submissive behaviors, like hiding in their shelter, observed because some organisms do not want to attack organisms they know might kill them as a result. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if male Betta splendens who have access to shelter will demonstrate less aggression than those without shelter access. Betta splendens, commonly known as Betta fish, are used in this experiment due to their known agonistic behavior. The red “mane” protrusion is one of the most threatening behaviors a male Betta will use when interacting with another betta fish. One study found that Betta splendens had utilized their environmental shelters and decreased the agonistic response in order to survive [Forsatkar et al.,2016]. It was hypothesized that the number of times the red “mane” is used without a shelter present would be greater compared to the number of times the red “mane” is used with a shelter.

Materials and Methods:
Three male Betta splendens were acquired and placed individually into one of the three division in an aquarium. Then, a six trials were run of interactions conducted between the male Betta splendens. Three control trials were conducted to observe the average number of times the male betta presented the red “mane” in the presence of another male Betta splendens without a shelter present in their environments. In trial one, the first Betta splendens and second Betta splendens without any shelter were observed for five minutes. The observations were recorded and the Betta splendens were rested for five minutes. In trial two, the second betta and the third Betta splendens without any shelter were observed for five minutes; then rested for five minutes. Finally, in trial three, the third and first Betta splendens were observed for five minutes; then rested for five minutes. Next, the experimental three trials were conducted the same as the three control trials, but now with a shelter in each environment of the Betta splendens. One-tailed paired t-test was used to determine the relationship between the control and the experimental groups.

Results:
The mean number of red mane presented in the control group was 98.15. The mean number of red man presented in the experimental group was 3.173.71. There was a significant difference between the mean red “mane” protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5, p-value=0.029). The mean number of red “mane” presented was higher in the control group compared to the experimental group, as seen in figure 1. The standard deviation of the control group was greater compared to the experimental group because there was more variance in their data, as seen in figure 1. The third Betta splendens did not display any red “mane” protrusions when interacting with the other male Betta splendens in each of the trials. This made the range of data larger since the first and second Betta splendens exhibited very agonistic behavior with the utilization of many red “mane” protrusions, especially in the control group where the most protrusions were identified.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported because the p-value was less than 0.05 in the statistical analysis comparing the control and the experimental groups in the number of red “mane” protrusions. Therefore, there was a significant difference in the number of red “mane” protrusions between the control and experimental groups. This conclusion can be supported by the finding in another study where the intra- and interspecific relationships of coral reef fish: beaugregory - Stegastes leucostictus; ocean surgeonfish - Acanthurus bahianus; doctor fish – A. chirurgus; common squirrelfish - Holocentrus rufus. The survival of these fishes was strongly correlated with the availability of shelter sites, predation pressure, and intra- and interspecific aggression among fishes using and defending shelter sites or territories [Shulman, 1985]. There was less aggression among fish who were near their shelter sites compared to those who wandered into open territory [Shulman, 1985]. When frightened by aggressors, the fish would move into their shelter sites in order to promote their survival from predators [Shulman, 1985]. This is similar to what was seen in our experiment where less aggression was observed by the male Betta fish in the environments where there was a shelter present. However, the experiment was observed during a ten-day period, compared to our observation of only 5 minutes per trial [Shulman, 1985]. The aggression and sheltering behavior of the fish was also observed on a small corner of one reef and all interactions and shelter site uses recorded [Shulman, 1985]. Whereas, our experiment only monitored the Betta fish in the partitioned aquarium, not their natural habitat. The study also monitored multitudes of fish whereas we only monitored the behavior of only three fish. For future study, the experiment should take place in an environment like their own habitat and look at the behavior of more fish, so the data is more precise. Identifying fish behavior in environments is needed in order to improve fishing technology to reduce by-catch. The survival species to targeted by fishing companies and conserving biodiversity of ecosystems is dependent on the knowledge of the behavior of aquatic organisms and the responsibility of fisheries to meet standards that reduce by-catch.

Figure Legends: 
This figure shows a comparison between the mean number of red “mane” present in an interaction between two male Betta splendens of the control and experimental groups. The mean number of red mane protrusions in the control group was 98.15. The mean number of red mane protrusions in the experimental group was 3.173.71. There was a significant difference between the mean red “mane” protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5,p-value=0.029).
