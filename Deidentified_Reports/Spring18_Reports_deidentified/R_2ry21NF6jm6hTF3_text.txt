Title:  The Growth and Metaphorical Effects AzaMax, a Ecdysterone Mimicking Compound, has on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect that the insect growth regulator, AzaMax, has on a Manduca Sexta’s metamorphical growth and development. AzaMax is a compound that mimics ecdysterone, which is a growth hormone that is essential for molting phase occurrences. Since many biological processes rely on a specific chemical ratio, we predicted that by adding AzaMax to the natural food instead of water, these treated caterpillars would grow slower and possibly not endure another molting phase, therefore inhibiting them from completing their growth cycle. By separating eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars into two groups, a controll group and a treatment group, we were able to examine their different eating behaviors, lengths, and weights. By the end of the week, our results confirmed our hypothesis, therefore stating that adding AzaMax to the Manduca Sexta diet completely offset the ratio between the two growth hormones, therefore inhibiting the insect from its normal growth tendencies. 


Introduction:
Metamorphosis is a process that is largely dependent on the levels and emission of two growth hormones, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In Manduca Sexta, “an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers”, the collaborative effects of these two hormones is what triggers molting phases to occur. “Molting allows for the insect to change in size and/or morphology. A molt separates each of the larval instars and the pupal and adult stages.” (9). Although the collaboration of these two hormones is incredibly important in the overall progression of metamorphosis, the two hormones play different roles in the molting process. Juvenile hormone levels are what determine the type of molting that is occuring whereas ecdysterone determines the actual timing of the molting. Therefore, the ratio between these two hormones is incredibly sensitive and important in the Manduca Sexta’s morphological progress. 
	Since “this cycle can be longer or shorter under different conditions, depending on the quality of the diet and the average daily temperature” (7). In our lab, we hypothesize that if we mix the biologically normal Manduca Sexta diet with AzaMax, an ecdysterone mimicking compound, it will prevent the insect from molting, therefore, completing the insects completion of metamorphosis. We predict this because the ratios between ecdysterone and juvenile hormone are incredibly specific, meaning that if more ecdysterone is injected in their diet, it will inhibit the insect from achieving that specific molting phase. 


Materials and Method:

To test our hypothesis, we obtained eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars and split them into two groups: a controllled group and a treatment group. We used four small round plastic containers to inhabit the eight caterpillars. We used an index card to divide the container into two artificially constructed ecosystems, allowing for two caterpillars to inhabit each container, but on different sides of the divider. All of the caterpillars were incubated in a refrigerator at 23 degrees Celsius and were exposed to 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. 
 In the controll group, we fed the 4 controll group caterpillars 10 Ml of food mixed with 7 drops of water each day. In the treatment group, we fed each of the four treatment caterpillars 10 Ml of food mixed with 7 droplets of AzaMax. For all seven days, we made sure to clean the containers of any excretion or extra food, and record their weight, length, and note any alarming changes in their diet, color, or behavior. To test the precision and accuracy of our results we will average the controll and treatment group data for each day and implicate standard deviation and a T-test. 


Results:
The daily averages of the treated Manduca Sexta and the controllled Manduca Sexta, it is apparent that, overall, the controll group grew quicker and more efficiently than the treatment group. In the length diagram, even though from Thursday to Friday the treatment group was on the incline, on Saturday, their length started to decline. The length of the treatment group continued to fluctuate between increasing and decreasing throughout the week. However, although there were fluctuations in the length over the course of the week, on average, the treatment caterpillars did not have any major increases in length. Unlike the treatment group, the controll group increased consistently and rapidly throughout the week. 
In the weight diagram, a similar trend occurred, however, the treatment group average weights never exceeded those of the controll group weights. In addition, the controll group’s weight increased exponentially while the average treatment group weight slowly increased from Thursday till Monday, where it started to decline, and then showed little to no further signs of growth. 


Discussion:
The exponential and consistent growth increase in the controllled group of Manduca Sexta and the minimal growth of the treatment group supported our hypothesis. Adding the AzaMax to the natural diet did not speed up the morphological process in the Manduca Sexta, but instead slowed it down drastically. The AzaMax Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) effects on the Manduca Sexta supports the fact that “an IGR does not have to be toxic to its target, but leads instead to various abnormalities that impair insect survival” (14). In this case, the abnormality that the AzaMax triggered was a complete and devastating altercation in the ratio between the juvenile hormone and the ecdysterone. Increased levels of ecdysterone, and therefore, the disruption in this growth hormone ratio impeded the insect from being able to molt, and therefore, inhibited the Manduca Sexta from growing. The insects’ fatigue and browning exterior showed that by increasing the dosage of ecdysterone, drove the insect further away from achieving that biochemical sweet spot of ecdysterone and juvenile hormones. This experiment has demonstrated how precise and specific these chemical ratios are and how altercations of any kind can have grave and possibly lethal effects on the organism.
