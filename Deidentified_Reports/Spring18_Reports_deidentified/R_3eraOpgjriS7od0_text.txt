Title: The Effect of Calcium and the Calcium Ionophore A23187 on the Movement and Distance Migration of [Physarum polycephalum] 

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to examine the migration and direction of movement of activated Physarum polycephalum (treated with A23187) in contrast with the migration of inactivated Physarum towards a strip soaked in calcium. We predicted that both inactivated and activated Physarum would exhibit movement however we expected greater movement from the activated Physarum.  In order to conduct our experiment, we soaked 6 strips of calcium and placed each strip in a water-agar plate. We then treated 3 of the Physarum samples with 50 µL of 100µM A23187. Our results showed that the inactivated Physarum moved an average of 35.3± 5.03 mm and the activated Physarum exhibited no movement. The one-tailed two-sample t_test resulted in a p_value of 0.000131. Although our results show a statistical significance, our data didn’t support our hypothesis because our experimental sample showed no movement and we couldn’t make a true comparison of values. 

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways involve a set of reactions in which the inside of the cell responds to an external stimulus [Johnson:2018]. Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate mass (plasmodium) that essentially acts as a large cell [Johnson: 2018].  Physarum in particular is useful to study because signal transduction pathways can be easily observed by the naked eye and it’s signaling pathways are very similar to those in human cells [Johnson: 2018]. In response to certain chemicals in the environment such as calcium, Physarum exhibits either a positive or negative chemotactic response [Johnson:2018]. If it senses a molecule that is favorable, the plasmodium moves toward the chemical, whereas if the chemical is unfavorable, the plasmodium will migrate away [Johnson:2018]. Two major signaling transduction pathways in Physarum involving calcium are the Gq pathway and activation of surface Ca2+ channels [Johnson:2018]. In the Gq pathway, a ligand binds to the specific Gq, G-protein coupled receptor which causes Gq to bind to phospholipase C (PLC). PLC then cleaves a membrane protein to form Inositol Triphosphate (IP3) and Diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 then binds to an ion channel in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and causes Ca2+ to flow into the cytosol. In a second pathway, an external stimulus causes Ca2+ to flow into cells. The calcium that comes from the external environment cannot by itself alter proteins affected by calcium, but it can bind to the ryanodine receptor in the smooth ER [Johnson: 2018]. Binding of this receptor triggers a flow of calcium from the smooth ER into the cytosol. The calcium ions released from these pathways enable the interaction between actin and myosin [Holmes: 1979]. When the actin slides on the myosin filament, it allows movement of the plasmodium [Kohama:2016]. When extra calcium was added to microplasmodia of Physarum polycephalum, the microplasmodia with extra calcium grew larger than microplasmodia without added calcium [Holmes: 1979]. Furthermore, the calcium Ionophore (activator) A23187 effectively increased the uptake of calcium by the microplasmodium; the higher the concentration, the more calcium that was taken up [Holmes: 1979]. The addition of A23187 also caused the microplasmodium to grow [Holmes: 1979]. A23187 is an antibiotic that can transfer calcium across membranes, it also has the ability to activate several processes involving calcium [Luckasen: 1974]. In particular, A23187 activates the IP3- mediated intracellular calcium channels as well as calcium mediated calcium channels [Johnson: 2018]. We want to determine the addition of the activator A23187 affects the movement of Physarum. We predict the activator will cause a greater distance of migration, due to its ability to stimulate several of the processes involving the efflux of calcium rather than a single process. Furthermore, as calcium allows movement, the Physarum should exhibit a positive chemotactic response towards calcium. We hypothesize that both the activated and inactivated Physarum will show movement, however we expect greater movement from the activated Physarum. 

Materials and Method:
We first sterilized the spatula and flat- tipped forceps by dipping the materials first in a tube containing ethanol and then briefly placing the tip of the instruments in the fire from a 95% ethanol lamp. Then we obtained a Physarum stock plate and cut one side of the plate into 1 cm blocks using a flat metal spatula. We repeated this process each time we used the instruments in a different stock plate. In addition to the Physarum stock plate, we gathered 6, 100mm petri dishes of a 2% water-agar solution. We labeled 3 water-agar plates controll and the other 3 experimental. We then proceeded to cut out a 1 cm block of the water-agar medium in the middle of each plate using the spatula. After doing so, we placed one block of the Physarum in each open block of water-agar plates. We then cut 6 strips from a piece of filter paper and soaked each strip in calcium. We placed each strip of calcium at one edge of each of the 6 water-agar plates. Following this, we added 50 µL of 100µM A23187 only to the block of Physarum in the plates labeled experimental. After this we taped each plate down, covered them in foil, and placed them in an incubator at 37°C for 44h. After collecting the data, we performed a one- tailed two-sample t_test to compare the mean distance of the activated Physarum to the inactivated Physarum towards calcium. 

Results:
The inactivated Physarum (controll) moved towards the calcium strip while each of the each of the activated Physarum (experimental) showed no movement towards the calcium strip (Table 1). The average distance of migration of the inactivated Physarum was 35.3± 5.03 mm while the average distance of migration of the activated Physarum was 0 mm (Figure 1). The one-tailed, two-sample t_test resulted in a t_stat of 12.16, 4 degrees of freedom, and a p_value of 0.00013. 

Discussion:
Our statistical test showed that our data was statistically significent because our p_value was less than 0.05. However, our hypothesis was not supported because the experimental group, treated with the calcium activator showed no migration or movement towards the strip. It’s likely that the amount and concentration of A23187 we added ended up killing the three samples of Physarum exposed to the activator. We exposed our sample to 100M of A23187 however we should’ve exposed it to either 5, 15, or 50M [Holmes: 1979]. Because of this, we were unable to draw true conclusions from our experiment to determine whether or not the addition of A23187 would have increased the migration of Physarum towards the calcium treated strip or if it would’ve moved towards the calcium strip. Originally, we believed that calcium in Physarum would play the same role as it does in muscle to allow the interaction of actin and myosin. This is because older studies showed that removal of calcium from Physarum resulted in no movement, while the restoration of calcium allowed movement once more [Terry:2009].  In reality, calcium has an inhibitory role in the regulation of actin and myosin [Kohama: 2016]. This means that lower concentrations of calcium are preferred in Physarum in order to allow movement and stimulate actomyosin interaction [Kohama:2016]. Although our results seemed to contradict this data, another study showed that calcium increased the growth of Physarum for the first 48 hours of observation, however after examining the growth of the plasmodium in the next 24-hour block, the results showed that extra calcium inhibited the growth of Physarum [Terry:2009]. The larger the concentration of calcium, the more inhibitory affects were seen [Terry: 2009]. It is probable that our sample of inactivated Physarum moved towards the calcium treated strip because of the initial positive effects of increased calcium such as growth. Had our activated Physarum sample not died, it is likely that the experimental sample would have moved toward the calcium and a larger distance of migration. The addition of A23187, has shown an ability to intensify the effects of calcium and since we collected our results within 44h of exposure to the extra chemicals, calcium should not result in inhibitory responses [Uyeda: 1986]. If we were to repeat this experiment again, we would make sure to treat the activated sample with a dilute concentration (10-15L) of A23187 to examine the response. Also, we would conduct the experiment for a longer period of time in order to see the inhibitory effects of calcium. While this experiment in particular, may not have profound conclusions about signaling in human cells, different pathways exhibited by Physarum can be used to aid in cancer research and other research regarding human cells [Dove:2017].
