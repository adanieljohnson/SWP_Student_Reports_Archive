Title: An Analysis of the Negative Affect of Juvenile Hormone Mimic on the Mass of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of Precor, a Juvenile Hormone mimic, on Manduca sexta caterpillars. In nature, Juvenile Hormone plays a role in determining when and if the caterpillar will molt or transition into the next phase of its life. Therefore, an added JH mimic should have an effect on the growth cycle of the caterpillar. In this experiment, Precor was added to the caterpillars’ standard GLM diets to see if it affected their mass over a week-long period in comparison to a controll group. The caterpillars were fed and massed each day in order to obtain suitable results. Overall, this experiment was successful even though it disproved the hypothesis which stated that mixing 5 drops of Precor into 10g of GLM diet each day would have a positive effect on the caterpillar’s weight. At the end of the week, the controll group gained an average of 9.02g, more than the 6.1g the experimental group gained on average. A two-tailed T-test was used to compare this data and, with a P-value of 0.309, it was determined that the controll and experimental groups were not statistically different, and the original hypothesis had to be rejected.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta moth, also known as the sphinx moth or tobacco hornworm is an example of an insect with a holometabolous life cycle. The organism goes through four completely different life phases that are controllled by multiple hormones that are made by the insect. The Manduca sexta begins its life as an egg before growing into a worm-like larva. In its last larval stage, it forms a cocoon in order to grow and develop wings before it emerges as an adult with winds and reproductive organs [Johnson: 2018]. This multi-phase life cycle can be vary depending on the concentrations of two hormones, Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone, present in the insect’s body. These hormones aid in controllling when the insect will molt and transition to the next stage of its life [Riddiford: 2003]. 
	There are multiple hypotheses concerning the way juvenile hormone works in an insect naturally. However, evidence suggests that the Critical Period Switch hypothesis is the most accurate. The Critical Period Switch hypothesis states that what matters is whether juvenile hormone is present or not at certain “critical periods” during which the decision is made as to whether or not the insect will molt into another of what it previously was or transition into the next phase of its life. If there is too much juvenile hormone, the insect will remain in the same phase (ie. Larva molts into another larva). But if there is too little juvenile hormone, it will advance to the next phase of its life cycle (ie. Larva molts into a pupa) [Nijhout: 2014].
Precor is a juvenile hormone mimic which will be used to test whether the addition of this chemical can be beneficial to the caterpillar’s maturation. It is hypothesized that adding a specified amount of Precor to the normal GLM diet will promote an increase in weight and benefit the insects’ overall appearances compared to a controll group where only distilled water is mixed into their standard GLM diet.

Materials and Method:
First, the eight Manduca sexta caterpillars that were provided by the lab were separated into two groups: a controll group and an experimental group. Four plastic containers with perforated lids were prepared by dividing each one into two sections using a 3x5 index card and tape so that two caterpillars could share a container, but remain separated. Each container was labelled with initials, lab section, and either controll or experimental. The controll group was fed 10g of GLM food with 5 drops of distilled water mixed in while the experimental group was fed 10g of GLM food with 5 drops of Precor treatment mixed in. Every day for a week, the caterpillars’ containers were completely emptied and each one was massed and the data was recorded. Each one was fed about 10g of their standard GLM food with either water or Precor mixed in thoroughly. At the end of each daily feeding and massing of the caterpillars, the containers were placed back in the incubator. A two-tailed T-test was used to compare the data 
between the controll group and the experimental group. 


Results:
As showed in the data in Figure 1, the controll group’s mass changed an average of 9.04g while the Precor group’s mass changed an average of just 6.1g. However, it should be observed that in the JH mimic group, caterpillar 2A was an outlier. Instead of gaining weight, it ultimately lost .45g over the course of the week and brought down the overall average. But even without the outlier calculated in, the average for the Precor group would be 8.2g which remains lower than that of the controll group’s 9.04g. Figure 2 shows that between the controll group and the experimental group, the P-value was 0.309 for a 2-sample, two-tailed T-test. The mean of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (P = 0.309). Figure 4 shows the average mass changes over the course of the week along with the standard deviations from the data in Figure 1. It shows that the JH mimic group has an extremely large standard deviation when compared to that of the controll group which indicates the larger range of data in the JH mimic/Precor group. 


Discussion:
Overall, this experiment was successful even though it disproved the hypothesis that the experimental group that was given Precor would gain more weight than the controll group. Instead, over the course of the week, the controll group gained of average of 9.02g while the experimental group only gained an average of 6.1g. This data shows that the Precor ultimately negatively affected the Manduca sexta caterpillars instead of boosting their weight as we thought the JH mimic would.  The data was slightly skewed by the outlier in the experimental group. Caterpillar 2A actually lost .45g by the end of the week, which lowered the average grams gained by almost 2g. This caterpillar was most likely already unhealthy due to some unrelated cause and likely would not have grown or developed even if Precor had not been mixed into its diet. However, even if the outlier were removed from the data analysis, the experimental group’s average weight gained would remain below that of the controll group. In another, hypothetical test using Manduca sextas, a very small amount of Precor or another JH mimic may prove to be beneficial to the caterpillars however, the ratio of 5 drops of Precor to 10g of GLM food used in this experiment was evidently too high [Johnson: 2018]. 
However, it does makes sense that too much of the JH mimic would be harmful to the insects as it would not allow them to molt into the next phase of their life. In a caterpillar’s natural life cycle, declining JH levels is necessary for a transition into the pupal or larval phase and the presence of JH can actually keep this change from happening [Riddiford: 2003]. In fact, previous studies have shown that certain plants create a JH mimic themselves and use it as a natural pesticide. In this situation, if an insect eats the plant and its JH levels rise too high, it would not be able to molt or develop into an adult and would therefore not be able to reproduce, ultimately limiting the number of insects that would eat and destroy the plant.
