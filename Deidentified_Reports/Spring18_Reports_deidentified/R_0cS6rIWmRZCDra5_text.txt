Title: The Effects of Introducing Precor into the Diet of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we observed the effects of introducing a Juvenile Hormone mimicking solution, precor, into the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars during the larval stage of development. We fed and measured the weight (in grams) of eight caterpillars for seven days to compare the impact of precor on the development of the Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that if we incorporated Precor into the diet of Manduca sexta, then they would grow larger. The results showed that the caterpillars that were fed a diet with Precor were smaller in mass compared to the caterpillars that were not fed precor in their diet. Overall, the experiment suggests that feeding precor along with the regular diet of Manduca sexta does not facilitate development and seems to inhibit growth. 


Introduction:
Insect development is controlled primarily by three hormones: Juvenile Hormone (JH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Prothoraciocotropic Hormone (PTTH). Juvenile Hormone, is one of the hormones, along with Ecdysterone, that controls growth, molting, and metamorphosis in Manduca (Hatem, 2015). Because Juvenile Hormone impacts the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, changing the levels of Juvenile Hormone in a ManducasSexta in the larval stage of development could cause a change in growth patterns.
The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of adding precor to the diet of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Precor is a solution that mimics the effects of Juvenile Hormone. We hypothesized that because Juvenile Hormone facilitates growth and delays the commitment pulse, the addition of Precor into the diet of the Manduca sexta would cause them to grow more in terms of weight than caterpillars without diets including Precor. Juvenile Hormone levels are low at the end of Manduca development, initiating the commitment pulse, before the Manduca begins to pupate (Hatem, 2015). We hypothesized the addition of Precor would increase the Juvenile Hormone levels of the caterpillars, delay the commitment pulse, and allow the Manduca sexta to continue to grow in the larval stages. 


Materials and Methods:
We divided eight Manduca sexta into two groups, four controlled (caterpillars 1, 2, 3, 4) and four experimental (caterpillars 5, 6, 7, 8). Each caterpillar was put in a plastic container with one other in its group, divided by a paper notecard, and kept in an incubator at 27ºC to control temperature. The four caterpillars in the control group wer fed 10g of food with 5 drops (roughly 50 µL) of water mixed in to match the added moisture of the precor in the experimental group. The four caterpillars experimental group were fed 10g of food with 5 drops of Precor solution (1:1250) mixed in. For seven days, each caterpillar was fed and weighed in grams. We used an unpaired t-test to measure statistical information about the data collected over the seven days.


Results:
The Manduca sexta in the control group grew consistently larger in mass than the Manduca sexta in the experimental group (Figure 1). The smallest Manduca in the control group (caterpillar 2, 10.66g) was only 0.09g lighter than the largest Manduca in the Precor group (caterpillar 7, 10.75g) on the seventh day of testing, and caterpillar 7 had a starting weight of 1.41g, 0.42g heavier than caterpillar 2 on the start date (Figure 1). The addition of precor to the diet of the experimental group inhibited the growth of the caterpillars. The average change in mass of the control group was higher than the average change in mass of the experimental group (Figure 2). There was not a statistically significant difference (p >0.5) between the caterpillars that were not fed precor and the ones that were fed precor (t=0.67, df=12, p =0.5137). It is important to note that on the seventh day of testing caterpillars 3 and 4 of the control group chewed through the divider in their container, so the data may be switched for this one day in weight; though, this does not affect the initial findings based on the data. 


Discussion:
The results do not support our original hypothesis that the addition of precor into the diet of the ManducasSexta would increase their size. The Manduca in the experimental group were consistently smaller (in grams) than those in the control group. This suggests that the precor may have inhibited growth as opposed to facilitating it. This also may be due to the seven-day experimental period in which they were measured. If we had a longer time table, the caterpillars may have had more time to grow. Also, we could have watched for differing pupation times in the two groups due to change in Juvenile Hormone levels. The commitment pulse, the indicator that initiates pupation in Manduca sexta, is driven by Juvenile Hormone levels and a critical weight (Nijhout, 2006). Therefore, the change in Juvenile Hormone levels due to ingestion of precor could effect pupation during the fifth instar of Manduca development, but we only tested for seven days and did not reach pupation in either group. These results also could have been attributed to the concentration or amount of precor incorporated into the food. It is possible that there was not enough change in juvenile hormone to cause a significant difference in size between the two groups because the concentration of precor was not enough effect Juvenile Hormone levels in the experimental group. The difference between the mass of the control and experimental group could be by random chance. Overall, the results suggest that the addition of precor to the diet had no statistically significant effect on the growth of Manduca sexta in the larval stage of development.
