Title: The effect of saline water irrigation on the resource allocation pattern of mung beans

Abstract:
Plant resource allocation of biomass and energy are strongly related to biotic and abiotic factors, like irrigation water and soil salinity, for nutrient acquisition and plant fitness. The main objective of the study was to determine the effect of salinity on the resource allocation pattern of mung beans. It was hypothesized that soil salinity would increase the root to shoot ratios in both weight and length. I examined the weight and length of roots and shoots for mung beans watered with pure water (0 g/L NaCl) and salt water (1.3 g/L NaCl). Comparing the controll and experimental groups, there was a large percentage increase in weight and length ratios but both failed to reach significance (p>0.05). Hence, salt water treatment did not significently affect the resource reallocation to root and shoot. This result opposed the hypothesis because of the small sample size, and the effect of salinity on resource allocation remains to be explored.

Introduction:
All plants and animals face a limit to the amount of usable resources in any ecological community. Although the pattern of resource allocation is largely genetically determined, there are phenotypic plasticity for pattern modification in response to variation in environmental conditions [Johnson: 2017]. Hence, plant resource allocation plays an important role in mediating physiological processes like nutrient acquisition according to changing abiotic factors like soil salinity. To be more specific, different species can expand various proportions of biomass and reproductive or vegetative processes [Wilson: 1983]. 
Since roots are the vital sites for water and essential nutrients uptake, they are the first organs detecting changes in the soil water potential induced by salinity stress [Schmidt: 2014]. Subsequently, the increase in salt concentration and decrease in water content in the root medium results in a decrease in leaf water potential and turgor pressure [Farhangi-Abriz: 2018]. Through root-to-shoot communication, these changes act as signals for adjusting the distribution of biomass and energy to the growth of different organs. 
Therefore, it can be conjectured that soil salinity may alter the relative allocation of biomass to root and shoot. Thus, in this investigation, I examined the effect of salt water irrigation on root: shoot ratios in weight and length. To be more specific, my hypothesis was that saline soil condition would increase both weight and length root: shoot ratios. The regular or salt treatment was the independent and categorical variable, and the weight and length root: shoot ratios were the dependent and measurement variables. Mung beans were selected as subjects because of their appropriate size and fast growth rate. Three pots of mung beans were the controll group, and the other three acted as the experimental group. 


Materials and Method:
After filling 6 pots with soil, similar amounts of mung bean seeds were carefully placed in each pot respectively. The seeds were then covered by approximately 0.5cm dry soil. Three pots were watered with pure water (0 g/L NaCl) and labeled with ‘regular treatment’. The other three pots were evenly moistened with salt water (1.3 g/L NaCl) and labeled with ‘salt treatment’. All pots were stored in the greenhouse for two weeks and group members took turn to water them with water or salt water. 
Plants in a pot were gently pulled out of the tray and washed in a prepared container of water. Three plants for replicate were selected randoMly and patted dry with paper towels. The dry weight and length from the end of the longest root to the top of the longest leave were measured and recorded in a raw data table. The root and shoot were separated by cutting the plants at the root-shoot junction where color transition occurs. The root and shoot parts for each plant were weighed respectively and recorded into the raw data table. After that, the maximum shoot and shoot lengths were measured to the nearest mm. For the single pot, the average weight and length in total and for roots and shoots, and average root: shoot ratio in weight and length were calculated and recorded in the table. The same procedure and calculation are repeated for the other pots. 
Finally, the mean values for the two treatments- regular and slat- were calculated from the averages calculated before and recorded into Figure 1. Also, the mean weight and length root: shoot ratios were displayed in a bar chart to visualize the comparison between the two treatments (Figure 2). One-tailed two sample t_test was used to compare the controll and experimental groups, and the level of significent was set to p<0.05.


Results:
According to Figure 1, the experimental group has higher mean root weight and length compared to the controll group (21.6% increase in weight, 25.4 increase in weight). And the mean shoot values decreased by 16.8% in weight and 22.8% in length for the salt treatment group. Overall, the average percentage change in root: shoot ratios between the regular and salt treatments is positive, indicating the general increase of root: shoot ratio by 66.8% in weight and 66.2% in length. Also, Figure 2 showed that soil salinity largely raised the average weight and length root: shoot ratios. Comparing the experimental group to the controll group, the one-tailed two sample t test revealed that p= 0.214>0.05 (t_stat = 1.48, d.f. = 4) for the weight ratio, p= 0.00910 (t_stat= 4.73, d.f.= 4) for the length ratio. 

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a significent increase in weight and length root: shoot ratios under slat water treatment would be shown. But data opposed this hypothesis and showed that there was no effect of soil salinity on root: shoot ratios, as the values of both weight and length ratios for experimental group were not significently higher compared to the controll group (p>0.05). 
The practical significance of the result is vague and questionable, since there was a relatively large increase in ratios in weight (66.8%) and length (66.2%) in response to soil salinity. This was possibly because of the limited sample size of subjects and relatively low concentration of salt water, so improvements could be made by testing on a larger number of mung bean pots and preparing NaCl solution with a higher concentration. 
The rise in mean weight and length root: shoot ratios was primarily caused by the effect of salinity stress on resource allocation pattern. The redistribution of more biomass and metabolic energy to the formation of roots over shoots helps overcome the salinity stress. When salt concentration of irrigation water increases, the water potential across root hair membrane decreases, resulting in the drop in the potential gradient which determines the rate of water movement. The reduction in water uptake induced by osmotic stress functions as a signal for the formation of ethylene which mediates leaf abscission [Acosta-Motos: 2016]. Also, as soil NaCl concentration increases, the accumulation of Cl- in the aerial part of the plant initiates the production of ethylene [Acosta-Motos: 2016]. Hence, this resource-reallocation mechanism works to minimize water loss by transpiration and to eliminate extra salts which mainly accumulate at the tips of premature leaves [Robin, Matthew: 2016]. Besides, the decrease in leaf water potential results in a sharp drop in water availability for cell extension process, and therefore shoot weight and length. For root, saline soil condition enhanced elongation and formation of roots. A larger root proportion could favor the retention of toxic minerals and absorption of water, which are vital to plant survival and fitness under a saline condition [Acosta-Motos: 2016]. 
The effect of soil salinization on resource allocation pattern is comparable in different plant species. A study by Robin and Matthew explored the salinity effect on wheat- density of live leaves and adventitious roots which sprout from non-root regions to enhance chance of survival and ability of expansion. And it turned out that the number of adventitious roots for the 100mM NaCl treatment was 12.2 per tiller, which was significently higher than 0mM and 50Mm treatments [Robin, Matthew: 2016]. Contrasting shoot response to salt stress was observed- 100Mm NaCl plants were lowest in number of live leaves. Moreover, Acosta-Motos directly revealed rise in the root to shoot ratio in Myrtus communis plants irrigated with an 8 dS m-1 NaCl solution for a month [Acosta-Motos: 2016].
The main limitation of this research was the small sample size and therefore low reliability of the results, so further investigation would be based on a much larger sample size (over 20 trays). Apart from this modification, enough and even space between pots must be guaranteed so that no plant would be overcrowded by others and light energy is equally available. Also, the categorical variable (absence or present of NaCl) will be replaced with a quantitative variable (concentration or electrical conductivity of salt water), allowing finding the correlation between concentration or EC of salt water and root to shoot ratios. Other measurable root characteristics, including the number and diameter of roots, would also be taken into consideration. 
Even though there are strong evidences suggesting that most plants have high phenotypic plasticity to variation in soil salinity, salinity in irrigation water is still a major abiotic constraint triggering harmful and irreversible effects on plant growth and development. Ion toxicity, especially Na+ accumulation, may interfere with main physiological processes and triggers severe chlorosis and necrosis [Acosta-Motos: 2016].
