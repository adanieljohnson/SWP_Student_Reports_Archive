Title: Decreased Light Spectrum Environment has no Significant Effect on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Mung Beans (Vigna radiata)

Abstract:
The phenotypic plasticity of plants is exemplified by their capacity to allocate resources dependent on environmental variations. As environments change, organisms possess the potential to alter their functional relationship with their habitat in order to maximize growth potential. This is achieved by allocating energy resources differently depending on resource availability in the environment. Throughout our experiment, we sought to gauge the potential for different groups of Vigna radiata to allocate energy towards shoot growth in different intensities depending on the availability of light in their differing environments. We hypothesized that if we grew one sample group under red film and one under clear film, holding other factors constant, then the plants growing under red film would allocate more energy to shoot growth and hence display greater shoot length and mass than those grown in the clear film environment. We allowed approximately 60 mung beans to grow under a transparent red film tipi, and approximately 60 mung beans to grow under a transparent clear film tipi, each in the same soil, watering cycle, and temperature conditions, for a period of two weeks. We believed this to be the case because plants growing in the light deficient environment would need to...

Introduction:
Abstract continued from previous section:
compensate for the lesser availability of light by growing closer to the light source, while those growing in the full light environment would have less of a need to extend shoots toward the light source because they receive a greater quantity of the light spectrum. After allowing two weeks of growth, it became apparent that the mung beans grown under red film allocated more energy to the lengthening of their shoots than those in the clear film, however, a lack of statistical significance nullifies our hypothesis that plants growing in conditions of limited light spectrum will lengthen their shoots so as to increase their proximity to the light source, increasing their access to light and compensating for the environmental deficiency.    

Introduction:
The phenotypic plasticity of plants is exemplified by their capacity to allocate resources dependent on environmental variations in light accessibility, temperature, and other biotic and abiotic factors. The energy allocation, and the subsequent growth a plant experiences, is largely affected by abiotic factors such as the quality of light spectrum and access to light [Kelly: 2015]. Furthering our understanding of plant growth performance under various conditions is important to the field of agriculture. Farmers can manipulate the conditions in which their crops are grown so as to maximize their production, and testing the affect of light availability on shoot growth could help farmers maximize the yield of their crop. Our team of experimenters sought to determine whether decreasing the spectrum of light available to a population of mung beans by preventing its access to a particular wavelength of visible light would increase or decrease the plants allocation of energy resources towards the production and lengthening of above ground shoots. We calculated the root to shoot ratios (R:S) of plants from each test group to assess the extent to which plants in each environment allocated energy towards the lengthening of their subsurface roots or their above ground shoots, as previous literature assumes that variance and change in root to shoot ratio is “primarily related to the allocation of biomass and energy” [Liu: 2015]. We hypothesized that if we grew one sample group under red film and one under clear film, then the plants growing under red film would allocate more energy to shoot growth and hence display greater shoot length and mass than those grown in the clear film environment.  Patterns in energy allocation strategy differ greatly by species, and are typically found in a species’ life-history traits such as age and life span [Husákuvá: 2018].


Materials and Method:
To assemble the experiment, we filled 6 containers with equivalent quantities of vermiculite. We allowed each tray to absorb water. In each of the 6 containers, we planted approximately 20 mung bean seeds, making sure to cover each seed with soil. To assemble the tipis, we affixed films, one transparent red and one transparent clear, to a tripod, allowing a point of access in the film through which we could access the plants for watering. We placed each the tipi over 3 trays of mung beans each, and placed the tipis in the greenhouse. We made sure to water the plants with equivalent quantities of water each day for 14 days. After this period of growth, we removed the plants from the greenhouse setting. We took 3 samples from each tray, cutting at the point of coloration change denoting the transition from root to shoot. The roots and shoots of each sample were calculated by measuring the length of the sub-surface portion of a particular plant and the above ground portion of the same plant, and dividing the latter by the former. We ran a one tailed, two sample T-Test to determine whether our results bore statistical significance. 

Results:
The root to shoot ratio for length of the mung beans grown under the red film tipi was less on average than that of the beans grown under clear film (figure 1). The average root to shoot ratio for mass showed the opposite trend, however, as the roots of the plants grown in full spectrum light environments proved to be heavier than those of the plants in the partial spectrum environment (figure 1). Statistical tests showed that neither the root to shoot length comparison nor the root to shoot mass comparison were statistically significent at .05 significance. In comparing the root to shoot ratios for length, we found t_stat=1.59, P=0.187 d.f.=4. When comparing the root to shoot ratios for mass, we found t_stat=0.101, P=.925, d.f.=4.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that plants growing under red film would allocate more energy to shoot growth and hence display greater shoot length and mass than those grown in the clear film environment, was not supported. Although the root to shoot ratio for length was greater for the plants in the clear environment (1.119) than those in the red environment (0.927) these results were not found to be statistically significent. Likewise, the hypothesis was not supported by the root to shoot ratio for mass being greater for the plants in the red environment (0.981) than those in the clear environment (0.962). It is known that seeds grown outside and with full, uninhibited access to sunlight show the largest peak in root to shoot ratio [Kelly: 2015]. This information, that shoot length is correlated to light availability, is pertinent to the agriculture industry. With this knowledge, farmers and growers can maximize the yield of their crops and plants by ensuring their access to full spectrum light environments. Additionally, some crops gain comparative advantage by increasing their root to shoot ratio, such as winter wheat, which can “improve itself [sic] salt resistance by enhancing root/shoot ratio” [Yu: 2017]. With this knowledge, farmers and growers can increase a certain plants fitness to its environment and allow for a greater variety of growing conditions.
