Title: Levels of aggression in Betta splendins may decrease in blue-tinted water

Abstract:
This study focused on the physiological mechanisms in animals that controll costly agnostic behaviors. Such mechanisms are necessary in order to prevent indiscriminate wasting of resources in such costly behaviors. In male B. splendins, visual cues are known to play a role in determining whether or not to engage in aggressive display behaviors when confronted with another male. We compared the number and degree of aggressive actions in B. splendins in clear water and in darkened (blue-tinted) water, in which an opponent’s color and movement was less easily visible. The results showed a trend towards more aggressive behaviors in clear water consistent with our hypothesis that lower visibility would decrease aggression. However, the results were statistically insignificent.

Introduction:
Animals that engage in costly agnostic behaviors must weigh the benefits of such behaviors against costs of time and energy. Physiological mechanisms for determining the extent and nature of a threat or rival are therefore necessary to prevent undue expenditure of resources against an unworthy opponent. Sensory cues, often visual ones, play a key role in determining agnostic behavior in many fish species [Guthrie: 1986, Rowland: 1999]. In particular, species such as Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish) rely on visual cues of coloration and body movement to a great extent in their social activities [Blakeslee: 2009]. This study examined the role of visual perception in the stimulation of aggressive behavior in male B. splendins by comparing aggressive displays of individuals in clear and blue-tinted water. We hypothesized that the blue-tinted water, by dulling color contrast and thereby making recognition of visual cues difficult, would decrease the males’ levels of aggressive behaviors.

Materials and Method:
In order to measure the aggressive behaviors of male B. splendins we first created a scoring system for agnostic behaviors, ranked according to their levels of aggressiveness. We assigned points to each of the selected behaviors in the following way: pelvic fin flickering = 1 point, tail beating = 2 points, tail flashing = 3 points, “red mane” = 3 points. Each time a B. splendins individual performed one of these behaviors, they were assigned the corresponding number of points.
	The male B. splendins used in this experiment were kept visually isolated from other fish for several hours beforehand. We tested them in five minute intervals, during which the barriers separating two males were removed. Two pairs of males were tested for each condition. Each pair was put together for five minutes in each condition, then isolated again and allowed to rest before the next trial. If the males came into physical contact during the five minutes, they were separated and the trial ended early. When this occurred, the observations of the trial were weighted according to the time that had elapsed when the males were separated. (For instance, the results of a trial that ended at four minutes were multiplied by 5/4.)
	For the first condition, the fish were allowed to interact in a small aquarium filled with uncolored, clear tap water. During the second condition, blue food coloring was used to tint the water of the aquarium. The fish were given several minutes to acclimate to the new water condition before their barriers were removed. 
	Each individual fish received a total point score for each five-minute interaction. The average differences of these scores were then compared using a paired t_test with an alpha value of 0.05.


Results:
The results showed no statistically significent difference between the tinted and clear water groups [Fig. 1]. The P value was well over our alpha value of 0.05 at 0.161545. Nevertheless, there was a trend towards higher aggression in clear water. The average score of males in clear water was 12.9375, higher than that in blue-tinted water at 8. The average difference was -4.9375. (t = 1.84925, d.f. = 3) One trial was ended early at four minutes, and its data were multiplied accordingly by 5/4.

Discussion:
Though our results were insignificent, they showed a slight trend towards higher aggression in males in clear water than in blue-tinted water, which is consistent with our hypothesis. If further research can produce more significent results, it may be taken as evidence that visual perceptions and color act as primary cues for aggressive behaviors in B. splendins. In this case, the highly discriminative nature of the cue, prompting males to engage in agnostic behaviors only when they can be certain of a rival’s activity, indicates that B. splendins physiology has evolved to minimize unnecessary expenditures of time and energy, in which benefits are not certain to outweigh costs. 
However, even if  a significent link can be established between water color and lowered levels of aggression in male B. splendins, we cannot assume that the effect of water color is solely based on its obstruction of visual cues. One limitation in our study was the use of only one color, as a previous study has shown that different colors of water can elicit different behavioral responses in other fish species [Merighe: 2004]. We cannot, therefore, be certain that any observed differences in behavior were the result of poorer vision and not of the specific color blue itself. Dimmer water could also alter fish behavior by means other than simply altering visual cues. For instance, many fish rely on light cues to adjust their behaviors to a diel cycle [Helfman: 1986]. Exposure to a darker environment could induce diurnal fishes to be less active, thus reducing aggressive behaviors to the extent that it reduces all types of responsiveness. 
	In addition to the small size of our sample, several factors may have worked to render our results insignificent. The first is the condition of the fish we observed, which had undergone numerous similar studies over the course of the preceding weeks. Certain of the fish may have been fatigued or have become habituated to the presence of other fish, making them unwilling to show any signs of aggression at all, although another study has indicated that much longer term exposure is necessary for habituation [Peeke: 1970]. Our method of quantifying aggressive behavior may also have been flawed. Though we based our points system on a known hierarchy of aggressive behaviors in B. splendins, the specific values we assigned to each behavior may not have lined up with the actual level of aggression intended or with the relative costs of each behavior to the individual. We could also have expanded our study to include other known agnostic behaviors in male Bettas, apart from the four we observed in this experiment, such as erection of pectoral fins, spreading of opercula, darting, or arching the back.
