Title: The Effects of Martin's IGR on Manduca sextas

Abstract:
Understanding how hormones mediate the life cycle of insects is essential to understanding why insects grow and survive in the ways in which they do. One of these specific important hormones in many different insects is IGR/ecdysone. To test the effect that ecdysone has on insects, specifically the Manduca sexta, we raised eight different Manduca sextas. Four caterpillars were fed a normal control diet, while four were fed a diet with added IGR hormone. Average weight and length gain for these caterpillars were determined after a week, and using two, two sample T-test, it was found that IGR does have a significant effect on Manduca sexta ability to gain weight, but does not have a significant effect on Manduca sexta ability to grow in length. These results suggested that IGR has an effect on Manduca Sexta as an acting anti-juvenile hormone.
Keywords: Ecdysone, Manduca sexta, Anti-juvenile hormone


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is better known as the tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta are large green caterpillars that follow the typical stages of life that most caterpillars do. They start their lives as eggs before spending about three weeks going through five instar phases of being a larvae. They then spend about three weeks in a pupa before becoming an adult moth. All of these body formation changes (metamorphoses) are signaled to occur due to hormonal shifts in the body. The main hormones that are used to signal for large scale changes in the Manduca sexta are prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Ecology and Evolution 114 Laboratory Manual, 2018].
The prothoracicotropic hormone is produced by the corpus cardiacum which is located just behind the brain. This hormone is used to regulate the release of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone and the juvenile hormone work together to make the major changes in the Manduca sexta. Ecdysterone are secreted by the prothoracic glands, and are used mainly to regulate the timing of molting in Manduca sexta. The final major hormone, the juvenile hormone are produced by the corpus allata, and mainly regulate the type of molt that occurs [Riddiford, Hiruma, Zhou, Nelson, 2003].
 	The four main times that these major growth hormones are used to regulate the changes in the Manduca sexta are near the end of the 4th instar, the commitment pulse, before pupation and as a developing adult [Ecology and Evolution 114 Laboratory Manual, 2018]. At the end of the 4th instar ecdysteroid levels increase significantly and juvenile hormone levels drop slightly. At the commitment pulse there is a very small rise in ecdysteroid levels, these indicate the caterpillar has become large enough to become a pupa. Before pupation ecdysteroid levels spike while juvenile hormone levels only increase slightly. During developing adulthood juvenile hormones are not needed, and ecdysteroids levels first rise before then falling to almost zero before adulthood.
If steroid levels are altered in the Manduca sexta it can have drastic changes in the life of the caterpillar. For instance, it has been found that changes in amounts of any of these hormones can prevent growth, development, and survival of many types of insects [Staal, 1975]. IGR in previous studies has been found to be a growth inhibitor [Baker, Miller, Tsai, Jamieson, Cerf, Schooley, 1986]. These previous tests led us to wonder if we would have similar results if we were to feed these caterpillars a diet mixed with Martin's IGR. We predicted for our experiment that the Manduca sextas being fed a diet with Martin's IGR added to it would grow to be significantly smaller in length as well as weight than those being fed a normal diet.

Materials and Methods:
We began this experiment by acquiring eight young Manduca sextas, four of which were 4 centimeters in length, and 4 of which were 4.5 centimeters in length. All eight Manduca sextas were of similar weights, with a standard deviation of only ±.37 grams. The eight Manduca sextas were then separated into two groups, a control group and an experimental group. Two of the 4 centimeter long Manduca sextas and two of the 4.5 centimeter long Manduca sextas were put into each group. Two Manduca sextas were then put into each container, one on each side being separated by an index card. The individual diets for the experimental and control groups were then created. Two portions of food for Manduca sextas were weighed out. One portion was mixed with five drops of water while the other was mixed with five drops of Martin's IGR. The potions were then divided into eight 10 gram portions, and the water mixed food was given to the control caterpillars while the Martin's IGR mixed food was given to the experimental group. The Manduca sextas were checked on daily for a week, and new food was restocked if needed. At the end of a week each Manduca sexta was weighed and measure and data was analyzed by using two separate two-tailed T-tests.


Results:
The average length gained by the control group of Manduca sexta was 3.18±.63 centimeters.
 
The average length gained by the Martin’s IGR group(experimental) of Manduca sexta was 3.0±.41 centimeters.
 
The average weight gained by the control group of Manduca sexta was 8.35±.435 grams.
 
The average weight gained by the Martin’s IGR group(experimental) of Manduca sexta was 7.1±.87 grams.
 
When interpreting the results of this experiment a two sample T-test was used for both weight and length differences in the control and experimental groups. The T-test for weight proved significant (t=2.54, df=6, p=.044). The T-test for length proved to be insignificant (t=.333, df=6, p=.75). This means that Martin's IGR proved to have a direct correlation when it comes to a lower weight, but did not prove to have a direct correlation when it came to length of the Manduca sextas.

Discussion:
When it came to our experimental results, we found that Martin's IGR had a significant effect on the weight gain of Manduca sextas but did not have a significant effect on the length gain of Manduca sextas. These results meaning that the weight gain for the Manduca sextas affected with Martin's IGR was different enough from the weight gained by the control caterpillars that we could determine it was not a random coincidence. However, that the length gained by the Manduca sextas affected with Martin's IGR was not different enough from the length gained by the control caterpillars that we couldn't determine it was not a random coincidence.
These results support the first prediction of our hypothesis, while they reject the second prediction of our hypothesis. This meaning that it is very likely there is a direct correlation between the Martin's IGR hormone and a lower weight gain, but no correlation between Martin's IGR hormone and lower length gain. While only eight caterpillars were used in this experiment, the experiment was done with a fair amount of accuracy and was simple enough to get reliable results.
While we found our results to be fairly reliable, they simply could have been contributed to error. There were several places in this lab that sources of error could have occurred. Many of these errors point to inaccurate length gain results. For instance, caterpillars have a tendency to shrink or curl up when they feel stressed or under attack. When a human attempts to pick a caterpillar up this would certainly be a reason for them to attempt to curl up [Heads, Lawton, 1985]. This meant that our initial and final length measurements of these caterpillars cannot be viewed as completely accurate. Another source of error was that two of our caterpillars in our control group chewed through their barriers. This means that it is difficult for us to determine with certainty that we compared our initial measurements and final measurements to the right caterpillars. However, this error would not have affected the averages of the group in anyway, so overall for experimental analysis purposes would not have been a major problem. If this experiment were to be repeated a stronger barrier that a caterpillar could not chew through would be used.
When it came to differences between control fed Manduca sextas and Martin's IGR fed Manduca sextas not all differences needed exact measurements to be seen. One extremely obvious difference was coloration of the caterpillars. The IGR fed Manduca sextas were much lighter greenish-white in coloration. In fact, the black stripes on a healthy Manduca sexta were non existent on the IGR fed caterpillars. All of these coloration differences can be seen in figure 3. These results are fairly opposed to what was found by Staal, in an experiment that he undertook. Staal found that adding extra IGR to the diet of corn planthoppers (Peregrinus maidis), the normally light colored insect began to produce black coloration in the cuticles [Staal, 1975]. However, Staal's results still emphasizes how IGR can in fact cause coloration changes in insects.
This experiment while simple could lead to some long term uses. With our results showing that IGR has a significant effect on slowing or stopping the maturation of Manduca sexta caterpillars many new uses can be thought of for IGR. While Manduca sextas are more of a pest when they are a caterpillar than they are when they are moths, not all insects follow this trend. Many insects that are affected by IGR are far more harmful as adults than as larvae. Take for instance the Culicidae, also known as mosquitos [Shaw, Robbins, Jones III, 2010]. When mosquitoes are larvae they are fairly harmless, however as adults not only are they an irritant, but they also are vectors for diseases such as malaria. If an IGR pesticide could be created to affect only mosquito larvae, it could be a significant aid in stropping larvae from growing into pests.
