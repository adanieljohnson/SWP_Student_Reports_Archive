Title: The Effect of Solution Salinity on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinach Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Certain environmental conditions should be established in order for photosynthesis to occur efficiently. Soil salinity is one of these environmental conditions that may alter photosynthetic activity if it exists unnaturally due to its interaction with plant enzymes. To test this theory, the process of photosynthetic electron transfer was measured by the Hill reaction in order to observe the experimental rate of photosynthesis. It was found that the increase in salinity did not significantly decrease the photosynthetic rate within the chloroplasts even though theoretically, it should have. Several experimental errors may have contributed to these results. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a vital biological process for plant survival because it ensures that plants have the necessary nutrients in order to carry out growth and other functions. However, certain environmental conditions should be established in order for this process to be fully effective and beneficial. While is has been observed that some plants are able to alter their gene expression for various photosynthetic genes in response to various environmental stressors, like drought and NaCl stresses, this ability does not remain true for all plants. The presence of NaCl also creates ion toxicity within the plant’s cells which may severely affect the plant’s metabolic and photosynthetic pathways because a high concentration of Na+ inhibits many enzymes. Some plants are able to avoid these effects by preventing the NaCl’s entry into the cell or by trapping it in the vaculus but again, not all plants are able to do so. [Chaves: 2009]. Thus, it is important to test the effects of NaCl stress directly on cholopslapt activity in order to observe the effect for plants that are unable to change their gene expression or prevent the salt’s entry into the cell. 
During photosynthesis, light is absorbed by the chlorophyll molecules and the reaction induces a series of several electron transport complexes initiated by carriers such as NADPH to create a proton gradient. This proton gradient powers ATP synthesis and the ATP is then used to synthesize glucose. This process of electron transfer will be measured by the Hill reaction in order to observe the experimental rate of photosynthesis. Additionally, DCPIP will be used as the alternative electron acceptor for this experiment. DCPIP allows us to visualize the activity of photosynthesis because it’s reduction during the process of participating in photosynthetic reactions causes its color to slowly change from blue to colorless. This change in color can then be used to measure the solution’s absorbance which correlates to photosynthetic activity. [Johnson: 2017]. A  positive control of solution with chloroplasts and 0 mM NaCl concentration as well as a negative control of solutions with no chloroplasts and 0 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM NaCl concentrations will be used. We hypothesize that with an increase in NaCl concentration, photosynthetic activity in the chloroplast will also decrease and eventually stop altogether. 


Materials and Methods:
Part 1: Enriching the Chloroplasts
Remove the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves, rinse the leaves, blot away excess moisture.
Add the spinach leaves and 10 ml of cold grinding buffer to a mortar and pestle and grind the contents into a thick paste. Add an additional 10 ml of grinding buffer and mix the mixture into a slurry then strain it through three layers of cheesecloth into a beaker. 
Transfer 50 ml of the filtered liquid from the beaker to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spin it at 200 x G (1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4℃.
Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked A into a second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B” and centrifuge tube B at 1000 x G (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4℃.
Pour the supernatant out of tube B into another 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “C”, be sure not to disturb the pellet. 
Add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet, this solution will be used for part 2 of the experiment. 
Part 2: Hill Reaction to quantify reduction in photosynthesis.
Label 13 large test tubes as in table 1 below (prepare 3 tubes of each reaction mixture and 1 tube of the blank mixture)

Table 1. Reagent combinations for the preparation of the 13 test tubes. 
Add 100 ul of the enriched chloroplast solution to the blank tube as well as tubes 4-12 and miz each immediately after adding them.
Transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes.
Immediately blank the spectrophotometer with tube 0 then measure the absorbance of all other tubes for “A (t=0)”
Place all of the samples in adequate lighting and measure the absorbances again after 10 minutes (at 600 nm)
Measure the absorbance of all samples again after another 10 minutes A (t=20)
Analyze the results using a Tukey-Kramer one-way analysis of variance for the three experimental groups. 


Results:
The experimental results were found to be insignificant (p = 0.584)

Discussion:
The experimental results were found to be insignificant (p = 0.584) because the percent change in absorbance, which is reflective of the percent change in photosynthetic activity, varied for all of the solutions meaning that photosynthesis was occuring. These results also show that the variation in the photosynthesis which was occurring at different rates depending on the NaCl concentration present was insignificant as well. In conclusion, this experiment showed that the increase in solution salinity does not inhibit photosynthetic activity within spinach chloroplast even though theoretically, it should do so. 
However, this process is not immune to human and experimental error and several aspects may have contributed to these results. Firstly, the NaCl solutions may have been too dilute and thus the NaCl was unable to have an impactful effect on the biological processes within the chloroplasts. The process of NaCl entry into the chloroplasts may have required more than 30 minutes meaning that the effects may have not been observed because the NaCl didn't have a chance to react within the organelle. Additionally, the photosynthetic activity within a tube containing chloroplasts and DCPIP at normal environmental conditions should have also been observed in order to insure that the chloroplasts themselves were not defective [Seemann: 1985]. 
In order to make this experiment more effective, chloroplasts should be extracted from a plant that is known to be affected by salinity to insure that the plant’s defense mechanisms do not alter the observed data. The concentration of the NaCl solutions and the wait time of the reaction should also be increased to ensure that the NaCl is able to fully interact with the chloroplasts. Exploring these effects is significant in the grand scheme of environmental consciousness because soil salinity levels have been increasing due to the presence of heavy metals in unregulated industrial and agricultural wastewater runoff [Yan: 2018]. With this increase in salinity, it is important to understand the effects on plant photosynthesis in order to ensure that the growth of natural vegetation can be sustained while our environmental conditions continue to change.
