Title: The inhibition of the electron transport chain and photosynthesis by NaCl in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis relies on light dependent reactions that consist of an electron transport chain (ETC). The movement of electrons in this ETC is very sensitive to the presence of ions. In this study we determine the effects of NaCl at 100mM and 200mM on enriched Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts in vitro. We used the hill reaction to measure the amount of photosynthesis present in the chloroplasts, specifically the redox reactions in photosystem II (PSII). We found That photosynthesis was significently inhibited by the 200mM NaCl solution. These findings are supported by the findings of other literature which also suggest that the NaCl is interfering with the ETC. This has significent real world applications since desertification and overutilization of water resources are making high salinity soils less avoidable for our crops.



Introduction:
Many producers rely on reactions fueled by sunlight to produce their own glucose. Plants utilize chloroplasts to harness solar energy for producing glucose. Photosynthesis uses solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. The glucose produced by photosynthesis is later used in by the cell for energy production, structure, etc. Glucose production is essential to plants since they do not take in glucose as consumers do. Plants contain specialized organelles called chloroplasts to facilitate photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is comprised of two parts: the light reactions and the dark reactions. The light reactions require light and occur in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. The first part of the light reactions is a protein complex called Photosystem II. PSII captures light energy and uses it to excite electrons and transfer them down an electron transport chain. PSII acquires its electrons through redox reactions, it oxidizes or removes electrons from water to form molecular oxygen and hydrogen ions. The production of hydrogen ions leads to an electrochemical gradient that is later used to produce energy. The electrons moving through the electron transport chain ultimately end up in NADPH and are later used to produce additional energy. 
Salinity stress within photosynthetic cyanobacteria results in a significent decrease in photosynthetic activity [Congming et al: 2002]. Congming et al demonstrated that the presence of NaCl could reduce the efficiency of electron transfer from the primary quinone electron acceptor of PSII to the secondary quinone electron acceptor of PSII [Congming et al: 2002]. In unicellular green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta the presence of NaCl has been shown to inhibit photosynthesis by osmotic and ionic stress [Gilmour et al: 1984]. 
In this study we are using spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea) as our model species. Spinacia oleracea is ideal for this experiment because it is widely available and easy to purchase in the amounts we require. Spinacia oleracea is inexpensive making it cost effective. Additionally, enriched chloroplasts can be easily obtained from Spinacia oleracea which simplifies our procedure. 
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of salinity on photosynthesis, specifically the redox activity of PSII in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts in vitro. Photosynthesis activity can be determined by measuring the activity of the electron transport chain. The activity of the electron transport chain can be measured with the Hill reaction. The hill reaction utilizes an electron acceptor such as 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) which undergoes a color change when reduced. The color change of DCPIP can be quantified by taking readings at 600nm with a spectrophotometer. Our hypothesis states that high salinity will inhibit photosynthesis in isolated Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts. 


Materials and Method:
Our Spinacia oleracea was obtained from a grocery store and stored in a refrigerator for several days prior to the start of our experiment. We enriched our chloroplasts with a mortar and pestle and centrifuge. We added 10Ml of cooled grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to the mortar and pestle then added the Spinacia oleracea making sure remove the stems and veins from our Spinacia oleracea. When our Spinacia oleracea was crushed into a slurry we added an additional 10Ml of grinding buffer and strained it through a cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. We centrifuged this solution (200x G or 1200rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4°C. We extracted the supernatant and discarded the pellet then centrifuged it at (1000x G or 2800rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4°C. We discarded the supernatant and resuspended the pellet in 20Ml of grinding buffer. This final solution was our enriched chloroplasts. We prepared 15 cuvettes according to Table 1 and recorded their absorbance’s at 600nm four times with 10 minute intervals (the first being at time 0). All samples were placed under a lamp during this process. We calculated the percent change in absorbance with the equation in Figure 1. Treatment was conducted with high salinity (200mM NaCl) and low salinity (100mM NaCl).
	We analyzed our data using a Two-Sample t_test Assuming Equal Variances. We used a critical value of 0.05. A Q test was performed to identify outliers. 


Results:
The data show that the percent change decreased as the salinity increased. The chloroplasts in the low salinity 100mM NaCl treatment with outliers did not have significently decreased photosynthesis (t(4)= -0.431, p=0.689). The chloroplasts in the low salinity 100mM NaCl treatment with outliers removed did not have significently decreased photosynthesis (t(4)= -0.700, p=0.556). The chloroplasts in the high salinity 200mM NaCl treatment with outliers did not have significently decreased photosynthesis (t(4)= -1.143, p=0.317). The chloroplasts in the high salinity 200mM NaCl treatment with outliers removed had significently decreased photosynthesis (t(4)= -8.973, p=0.0029).



Discussion:
The data support our hypotheses that high salinity will inhibit photosynthesis in enriched Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts. Our 200mM high salinity treatment data with outliers removed demonstrates that photosynthesis was significently inhibited by the salinity. The low salt 100mM treatment did not have a significent decrease in photosynthesis however it did still follow the same trend as the high salinity treatment suggesting that the effects of the salinity are increasing as concentration increases. 
Previous studies have also demonstrated that salinity can inhibit photosynthesis. Salt stress applied to the soils of spinach plants in vivo resulted in a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis [Downton et al.]. A potential explanation for the inhibition of photosynthesis was suggested by Gilmour et al. and is that the salinity decreased the binding affinity of plastoquinone, which is located in the electron transport chain just after PSII [Gilmour et al: 2002]. If this was true it would decrease the amount of energy produced by the light reactions since less electrons would pass through the electron transport chain. It is also possible that the high salinity triggered a protection mechanism in PSII of the Spinacia oleracea that inhibited photosynthesis, similar to that found in Spirulina platensis by Vonshak et al. [Vonshak et al: 1996]. 
	Despite taking care to use younger healthier plants there is some room for error. Our Spinacia oleracea leaves were several days old when we conducted the experiment. We assumed that the leaves were all of similar age but we can’t be completely sure of this. Another confound is the health of the Spinacia oleracea leaves used. Externally all of the leaves appeared to be equally healthy but we do not know this for sure. Leaves made unhealthy by their age, storage, or other factors could have affected our results. 
	Future experiments could be conducted with higher salinities to further observe the effects of a saline environment on photosynthesis. Additionally in vivo studies using Spinacia oleracea could be conducted to determine what NaCl concentrations in soil if any lead to inhibition of photosynthesis.
	This study was focused on the effects of salinity on Spinacia oleracea but our findings have implications beyond our model species. Other plants rely on the same Photosystems and light reactions for photosynthesis meaning that high salinity likely inhibits photosynthesis in these plants as well. The crops we depend on for food might have decreased photosynthesis in soils with higher salinities. Overconsumption of water supplies and desertification is making ideal soils and dependable water sources more scarce. It is important to study the impact of these environments to gain a better understanding of how our food supply will be effected and take preventative measures.
