Title: The Effect of Ecdysone-Blocking Hormone on Manduca sexta Molting

Abstract:
Ecdysone is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting in Manduca sexta caterpillars and is essential for organismal development. The hypothesis was that if Manduca sexta consume an ecdysone-blocking hormone, they will not molt because a jump in ecdysone levels, called the commitment pulse, triggers pupal eclosion and causes the insect to molt [Johnson: 2018]. If AzaMax blocks the release of ecdysone, Manduca sexta will not molt. 
The controll group was fed Great Lakes Manduca while the treatment group was fed Great Lakes Manduca with eight drops of AzaMax mixed in -- each group contained four caterpillars. After seven days, the weight gain of each of the caterpillars was recorded as well as an assessment of the caterpillars’ physical appearance.
The mean difference in weight gain between the controll and treatment groups showed evidence that the controll group gained a statistically significent amount of weight greater than the treatment group over the seven day period (p = 0.00272). The restriction of ecdysone secretion in Manduca sexta caterpillars using AzaMax significently reduced the growth of the caterpillars and caused their appearance to look sickly. Growth and development was prevented when the ecdysone-blocking hormone was introduced.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect that undergoes holometabolous development. In this life cycle, an insect goes through four major life stages (egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult) and experiences major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. The hormones that controll Manduca sexta development throughout this cycle are juvenile hormone and ecdysone, also known as ecdysterone. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt the insect undergoes, while ecdysone regulate the timing of molting as well as additional functions. Juvenile hormones and ecdysones work together, and it is stated that if either is eliminated entirely, an insect will die [Johnson: 2018]. .The absolute concentrations of both hormones, the concentration ratio, and then insect’s developmental stage determine the effects of juvenile hormone at each point in development [Johnson, 2018]. In the cell cycle of Manduca sexta, an ecdysone-dependent controll point in the G2 phase exists; however, high levels of ecdysteroid trigger irreversible arrest arrest and myofiber differentiation [Champlin, Reiss, Truman: 1999]. Ecdysone is mandatory for regular tissue growth at low concentrations; but at high concentrations, ecdysone can potentially stop growth [Grunert, Clarke, Ahuja, Eswaran, Nijhout: 2015].  This experiment will test the effects of an ecdysone-blocking hormone, called AzaMax, on Manduca sexta molting and overall survival. The hypothesis is that if Manduca sexta consume AzaMax in their daily diet, they will be prevented from molting because a jump in ecdysone levels, called the commitment pulse, that triggers pupal eclosion and causes the insect to molt.  Therefore, if ecdysone is blocked by the hormone introduced in the experiment, Manduca sexta will not molt. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of roughly the same size (0.60g - 0.75g) were selected and divided into two groups of four caterpillars each; one was labeled the treatment group and other the controll group. Within each group, two caterpillars were placed into two plastic containers with perforated lids and separated using an index card. 
	Each of the two groups was fed a different diet. The controll group was fed approximately ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca diet with eight drops of water mixed in and the treatment group was fed approximately ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca diet with eight drops of ecdysone-blocking hormone (AzaMax) mixed in. All eight of the caterpillars were kept in the same twenty-five degrees Celsius incubator in a twelve hour dark: twelve hour light cycle. Each caterpillar was fed their assigned daily diet, and the mass of the food fed to each caterpillar and the caterpillar itself were recorded daily. The physical appearance and comportment of the caterpillars was also noted.

Results:
On average, the weight gain of the Manduca sexta caterpillars who were fed the diet containing ecdysone-blocking hormone was much less than that of the controll group, who were fed a normal diet (Table 1). The mean weight gain of the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the controll group was 5.4250 grams, and the mean weight gain of the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the treatment group was 0.3000 grams (Table 1). The Manduca Sexta caterpillars that
were fed the AzaMax did not look as healthy as the caterpillars that consumed solely the Manduca Great Lakes diet, and they did display as much growth.

Discussion:
There is statistically significent evidence suggesting that the mean weight gain of Manduca sexta caterpillars in the treatment group is less than the mean weight gain of Manduca sexta caterpillars in the controll group; the null hypothesis that these results were due to normal chance was able to be rejected (p =  0.00272). The caterpillars fed the diet containing ecdysone-blocking hormone did not grow as much as those who were fed a normal diet of just Manduca Great Lakes food. Because the slight spike of ecdysone levels that causes the commitment pulse telling allowing the caterpillar to molt was prohibited, the caterpillar was incapable of undergoing proper development; therefore, the hypothesis was correct.
Throughout the seven-day experimental period, the restriction of ecdysone secretion in Manduca sexta caterpillars using AzaMax significently reduced the growth of the caterpillars and caused their appearance to look sickly. This reveals the importance of having proper levels of just one hormone in an organism in order for said organism to function properly. The homeostatic mechanisms of Manduca sexta work to keep the caterpillars in optimal condition, and when those mechanisms are altered, severe detriment to the wellbeing of the caterpillar occurs. This also suggests that AzaMax would be an effective pesticide used to prevent Manduca sexta growth.
