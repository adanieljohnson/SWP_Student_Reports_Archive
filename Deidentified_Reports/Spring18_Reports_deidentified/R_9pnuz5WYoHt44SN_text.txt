Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the length of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The ManducaSexta is know as the Tobacco Hornworm and has many developmental stages throughout it’s growth cycle. The Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, 48-56 week life cycle is influenced by two main hormones, Juvenille Hormones and ecdysteroids Specifically JH is a determinent in the type of molting a larvae goes through. In this lab, the affect of an increase JH, through added IGR in the caterpillars food, was observed to see its influence on length. It was predicted that the presence of IGR in the caterpillars food would result in a greater average length of the treatment group compared to the controll group. It was concluded that there is no relationship between increased JH levels and length. Through a 2-sample T test, it was found that the P-value was 0.762445, which is greater then 0.05 which concludes that this study was not statistically significent. A way that this study could have been improved would have been through a greater concentration of IGR and a greater sample of caterpillars. 

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta’s, commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, growth and life cycle are influenced by two main hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. Their growth cycle is about 48-56 weeks which entails 5 instar phases of larvae, a pupa phase, and finally adulthood. [Johnson: 2018] The presence of ecdysteroids controlls the timing of molting, while JH controlls the type of molting. JH is produced in the corpus alta, while ecdysteroids is secreted by the prothoracic glands. [Johnson: 2018] In this lab, the levels of JH were manipulated in order to see its effect on the Manduca sexta’s growth. The JH was manipulated in the form of IGR, or Insect Growth Hormone which inhibits certain hormones and affects “physiological regulatory processes” in order to controll the progression of growth and maturity in an insect, commonly used as an insecticide. [Johnson: 2018] Manipulating the JH hormone, allows one to view the effects of hormone levels on develop and growth. According to a previous study, manipulating the JH hormone in a Manduca Sexta can predict effects on the catepillars overall being, for instance their future reproductive success. [Hatem:2015] It also allows for a better understanding of the relationship between “developmental timing and growth rate”[Hatem: 2015] . It was hypothesized that if 4 Manduca Sexta in the 4th instar phase were fed food with manipulated JH levels (in the form of Marvin’s IGR), then they would have stunted growth and be shorter compared to the Manduca Sextas that are fed normal food. 


Materials and Method:
Eight 4th instar Manduca Sexta caterpillars were divided into two groups of four and each labeled a number. One group was designated for treatment, and the other was used for the controll group. The caterpillars were separated by a notecard in order to keep them from eating each others food. Caterpillars 1-4 were labeled the controll group. They were then each fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with 10 added drops of water every day for 8 days. Caterpillars 5-6 were labeled the treatment group. They were then each fed 10 grams with 10 drops of Marvin’s IGR (which contained a 1: 1250 chemical ratio) each day for 8 days. Every day the caterpillars were removed from the incubator (which was set to 23C) and measured using a ruler (measuring by centimeters), these measurements were then recorded onto a data table. Then, their food was changed; the same amounts of grams and drops of IGR or water were consistent throughout the 8 days. The caterpillars were then returned to the incubator after each feeding and measurement. Both the treatment and controll group were under the same conditions of temperature and light. The treatment and controll groups lengths were them compared. The statistical test used was a 2 sample T-test.


Results:
The degree of freedom was 3, the t-value was 0.330958, and the P-value was 0.762445, which is greater than 0.05. treatment had more variation in its average growth, while the controll had a steadier growth rate seen by its almost straight line in Figure 2. In figure 1, it is clear that there was not a significent difference between the average lengths as there is not a big difference between the average lengths/height of the bars. The controll group and treatment group were not very statistically different. Both the controll and treatment, on average, had a general trend of increasing length as the 8 days passed. The treatment had a slightly higher average growth among its caterpillars. Throughout the 8 days, it was observed that the controll group was more dark/black lines on their body while the treatment group seemed to maintain an all blue.


Discussion:
From the results, the conclusion can be made that the manipulation of the Juvenile Hormone, through Marvin’s IGR, does not make a significent difference on the length of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. Since the p_value was greater than 0.05 it can be concluded that the data is not statistically significent. Our hypothesis was proved inaccurate due to the fact that we predicted that the presence of IGR and an increased amount of JH in the treatment caterpillars would cause them to be greater in length then the controll caterpillars. It is seen in Figure 1 and 2 that there was close to no variation between the growth/length of the Manduca Sextas caterpillars. The growth was consistently similar between both the controll and treatment groups, both groups had an outlier that failed to show a significent increase in length.  It can be concluded that the presence of an increased amount of JH does not predict a larger length. According to Hatem, “the final body size of a Manduca Sexta is influenced by the time between the critical weight attainment and the ecdysteroids” [Hatem, 2015] The JH is not a determinant of the length of the Manduca Sexta. In a previously done study, feeding JH-deficieny larvae rapamycin caused the larvae to significently increase the peak size. [Hatem, 2015] An alternate explanation to our data, was that the sample size was too low to be able to find a statistically significent relationship between the length and the JH. In a future repetition of this study, the sample size should be greater. Another modification that could be made is a greater concentration of IGR in the food. Since the p_value was greater than 0.05 it can be concluded that the data is not statistically significent.
