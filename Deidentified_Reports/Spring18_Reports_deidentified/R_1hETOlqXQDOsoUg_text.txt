Title: The Effects of an Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on the Somatic Neuromuscular System and Muscle Contraction             

Abstract:
In this study, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor was investigated by studying how it affects muscle contraction. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ACh) must break down acetylcholine resulting in muscle relaxation. It was expected that the acetylcholinesterase would increase the amplitude and lower the threshold of the contractions of gastrocnemus muscle. After studying 3 frog legs, used initially for the controll and then used as experimental group, it was found that the gastrocnemus muscle injected with AChE inhibitor contraction had lower amplitude and higher a threshold. Due the results of statiscal analysis, it cannot be conclusively stated that the gastrocnemus muscle injected with AChE inhibitor has contraction with lower amplitudes and higher a thresholds.


Introduction:
A neuromuscular junction is a chemical synapse where there is contact between a motor neurons and muscle fibers. For muscle contraction to occur, an action potential must first reach the neuron’s axon terminal. The action potential opens Ca2+ voltage gated channels, allowing Ca2+  to rush into the axon terminal. Then the Ca2+ ions fuse into vesicles causing the vesicle to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and spill their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicles contain neurotransmitters; the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction is acetylcholine (ACh). When ACh is released into the synaptic cleft, it binds to an ACh receptor which activates cation channels which allow Na1+ to flood into the postsynaptic membrane leading to depolarization and an action potential. The action potential activates the t-tubal which changes the shape of a DHP receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases Ca2+ needed for muscle contraction. While this is occurring, the ACh in the synaptic cleft is being split into acetate and choline due to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The acetate diffuses out while the choline is transported back into the axon terminal to be used to make ACh. Enough breaking down and reabsorption will cause the muscle to stop contracting [Sadava: 2017].
An AChE inhibitor inhibits the AChE which keeps the ACh released by the vesicles stay in the synaptic cleft. Due to not being able to break down ACh, the ACh accumulates in the synaptic cleft forcing the muscle to continue to contract thus leading to constant firing of action potentials in the muscle [Johnson:2018].
 After being injected and applied with the AChE inhibitor, the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog will have contractions with higher amplitudes and lower thresholds. If constantly stimulated, tetanus will occur, eventually leading to fatigue.  


Materials and Method:
To start this lab, 3 frog legs and a dissecting tray were obtained. As seen in figure 1 and 2, after each leg was skinned, the sciatic nerve was dissected till it was visible. The nerve is located between the gastrocnemus and the peroneus muscle in the leg.  As seen in figure 3, the achilles tendon was then cut. Next, a string was attached to the end of the gastrocnemus end of the achilles tendon; the gastrocnemus muscle should still be connected to the tendon. As seen in figure 4, he other side of the string is attached to a transducer, which measures the muscles tension and contraction (muscle should be suspended in the air). Then, two electrodes are placed directly on the sciatic nerve; the electrodes can not touch each other. Also, the frog leg should be pinned down into place to ensure it does not move during the contraction. For the controll group, the contractions of the muscle were measured using a myogram using the program LabScribe3. The threshold and amplitude of each contraction was measured and recorded for each leg. For the test group, 0.1Ml of AChE inhibitor was injected via a syringe into each leg after the legs were used for the controll group. Before stimulating, three minutes were allotted for the chemical to be absorbed by the legs. Next, the thresholds and amplitudes were recorded and measured via LabScribe3. The frog legs, dissection tray, transducer and dissection tools were all provided by the lab.


Results:
Figure 5 shows that when a frog leg is treated with 0.1Ml of the AChE inhibitor that the magnitude of the amplitude of the contraction decreases. Figure 6 shows that when a frog leg is treated with 0.1Ml of the AChE inhibitor that the threshold of the neuron will increase. The standard deviation for controll in figure 5 was 0.019655. The stand deviation for the experimental in figure 5 was 0.014364.  In figure 6, the standard deviation is 0.073711 for the controll group and 0.072111 for the experimental group. A paired t_test was run to analyze our data. The P value for figure 5 was 0.807072. The P value for figure 6 was 0.605423. For data to statistically relevant data, the P value must be lower than 0.05 therefore are data is not statistically relevant.


Discussion:
Despite what was predicted, the recorded contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle containing the AChE inhibitor had lower amplitudes and higher thresholds [Johnson: 2017].The decrease in amplitude may have been due to a reporting and reading error. When analyzing the myogram from LabScribe 3, summation may have not been accounted for.  Not accounting for where the starting threshold is would dramatically alter the recorded results. As shown in figure 7, it would be possible that recorded amplitude would read lower than original despite being higher in reality.  The increase in threshold may have occurred due to not waiting long enough for the axon of the nerve to recover and rest. During the refractory period, the threshold increases because more stimulation is needed than normal to overcome the threshold. Because the neuron was stimulated while in its refractory period, the threshold found is larger than expected due to the ion channel gates not having recovered yet.  Since the P values for both figure 5 and figure 6 were greater than 0.05, the data collected in this lab is not statistically relevant. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively concluded that AChE inhibitor make gastrocnemus muscle contraction have lower amplitude and higher a threshold.
