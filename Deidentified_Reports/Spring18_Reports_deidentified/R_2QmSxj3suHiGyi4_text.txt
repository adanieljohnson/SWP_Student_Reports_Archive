Title: The Effect of Lidocaine, a Sodium Channel Inhibitor, on the Sciatic Nerve Amplification Threshold of Rania Pipiens 

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to use Rania Pipiens, a Northern Leopard Frog often used in experimental laboratories, as a model system to better understand the nervous system and the role that sodium ions play in neuromuscular junctions. Sodium channels open inside the presynaptic terminal once the nerve is stimulated to threshold which triggers Calcium channels to open as well. This is required for the release of acetylcholine into the synapse, which stimulates gastrocnemus muscle contraction. This experiment attempts to determine how injecting Lidocaine, a sodium channel inhibitor, into the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle effects the sciatic nerve threshold amplitude when stimulated by a force transducer. Our hypothesis was that, when injected with Lidocaine, the threshold amplitude would increase due to the inhibition of sodium ion influx into the presynaptic cell. Our results concluded that, while the amplitude threshold did increase in the frog leg injected with Lidocaine, the average threshold amplitudes were not statistically significent so our hypothesis cannot be supported and null hypothesis cannot be rejected. 

Introduction:
Rania Pipiens is a Northern Leopard Frog found widely across the United States and Canada. (Fryer: 2004). This experiment used this amphibian as a model system for neuromuscular function because it is an animal often used in physiological research due to an understanding of its basic physiology and relative similarity to mammals. (Burggren: 2007). We are specifically interested in determining how injecting Lidocaine, a sodium channel inhibitor that is commonly used as a local anesthetic (drugbank: n.d.), effects the Rania Pipien’s sciatic nerve stimulus threshold for gastrocnemus muscle contraction when stimulated by a force transducer. The synaptic transmission between the sciatic nerve and contracting gastrocnemus muscle occurs once the nerve is stimulated to threshold, which results in the opening of sodium channels. This causes sodium ions to rush into the presynaptic cell and depolarize the cell. These triggers an influx of calcium ions, which bind to presynaptic vesicles and allow them to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release a neurotransmitter, Acetylcholine, into the synaptic cleft. The binding of Acetylcholine to the post synaptic membrane receptors, through further process, leads to the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. (Johnson: 2018). By using Lidocaine to inhibit the opening of sodium channels, we expect the nerve threshold amplitude to increase because calcium will not be stimulated to enter the presynaptic cell, and in return acetylcholine will not be as easily released into the synaptic cleft to stimulate muscle contraction. Our experimental independent variable will be the threshold amplitude determined of the frog leg not that did not received a lidocaine injection, and our dependent variable will be the resulting nerve threshold with a lidocaine injection. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we were given a left and right frog leg and the lab was conducted in one class period. To prep the frog legs, we peeled away the skin and located the sciatic nerve which is found in the upper thigh and is white in color. We used a cotton string tied around the Achilles tendon to suspend the gastrocnemus muscle above the lab table for better observation. We then placed a silver wire that was connected to the force transducer under the nerve in two places and made sure the wires did not cross over one another. We stimulated one frog leg without lidocaine injection as our controll group beginning at 0.5 volts  at one pulse and increased the voltage by 0.5 volts until an action potential was visible both on the computer screen attached to the transducer as well as in the movement of the suspended frog muscle. We repeated three trials for the controll leg. For our experimental group, we repeated the procedure with the other leg but before testing threshold we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.1Ml of 35mM lidocaine. It is important to wait five to ten minutes after injection before testing threshold amplitude. We repeated three trials for the leg and recorded resulting data of average threshold amplitudes, again beginning at 0.5 volts with one pulse and increasing stimulus by 0.5 until an action potential was recorded. We will compare the controll average threshold amplitude and experimental average threshold amplitude with a two sample T-test. 


Results:
We found that in the frog leg injected with lidocaine, the stimulated sciatic nerve had a higher average threshold amplitude than the frog leg not injected with lidocaine, as seen in Figure 1. However, when compared in a two sample T-test, the two means were not statistically significent (t_stat= 1.484, d.f.= 4, P= 0.2119).


Discussion:
Our results showed that when the frog was injected with Lidocaine, it had a higher average threshold amplitude. This could be due to a lack of sodium ions that enter into the presynaptic cell, as the lidocaine inhibited sodium channels from opening. This inhibition decreased an influx of calcium ions and release of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which causes the gastrocnemus muscle to contract. This was found in a previous similar study using Lidocaine injections into rat skeletal muscle (Chen: 2000). However, the average threshold amplitude of the frogs given lidocaine and not given lidocaine were not statistically significent. Due to this, our hypothesis was not supported and null hypothesis cannot be ruled out. This could have been due to the fact that the lidocaine may not have been able to reach and effect every neuromuscular junction, and in result did not inhibit enough synaptic sodium channels to make a significent difference between threshold amplitude. In the future, this experiment could be improved by injecting the muscle with more or a stronger dilution of lidocaine in order to affect more neuromuscular junctions and inhibit more sodium channels, so that less acetylcholine is released and the threshold is sufficiently significently higher.
