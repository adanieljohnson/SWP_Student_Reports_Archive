Title: The Effects of Different Levels of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effects of different levels of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta. In the same way, the study focuses on the specific pathway characteristics that JH regulates during growth and development from larval stage 1 to 5, and then from pupa to adult. A possible way to determine this is by observing the effects of different JH modulators. We believed that high levels of JH affects the growth and development of Manduca Sexta, which can be measured by an individual organism’s weight. During the study, the hornworms weight was measured throughout a seven day period. The hornworms should have received food every day but instead were given food only on the first day due to discrepancies in directions. The experiment should be completed again for more accurate results in the future. Our hypothesis that there is a statistical difference in the weight of Manduca Sexta compared to insects not exposed to high levels of juvenile hormone was inconclusive. 


Introduction:
The complex development process that turns insect larvae into adults is controllled by many hormones. During this study, we will use Manduca Sexta as a means to determine the effects of hormone regulation on insect development. Manduca Sexta is an insect known as the tobacco hornworm that has a life span of about 30 to 50 days. These insects are in Order Lepidoptera and Family Sphingoidea. Juvenile hormones are vital to regulating the physiology of these insects and are long chain organic molecules. Insect molting and metamorphosis are governed by the ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) with ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) orchestrating the molting process and JH determining the nature of the molt [Riddiford: 2003]. JH regulates metamorphosis, or the radical transition from the worm-like larval stage to the pupa, by preventing Manduca Sexta from developing into a pupa (to transition to adult). It is important to note that JH only regulates the type of molt during metamorphosis. Based on our previous knowledge and other studies, we hypothesize that there is a statistical difference in the weight of Manduca Sexta compared to insects not exposed to high levels of juvenile hormone.


Materials and Method:
	To conduct our experiment, we first selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars from the Bio 114 lab that weighed between 0.75 and 1.75 grams. We then divided the caterpillars in two groups: a treatment (experimental) and a controll group. From there, we placed one from each group into each container, which was separated by an index card. For each group of caterpillars we gave one of two diets: the controll group had 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet—recommended by the manufacturer, with 4 drops of DI water; and the experimental group had 10g of GLM diet, supplemented with 4 drops of the reagent 1: 1250 Precor. After the initial preparation, we kept all of our caterpillars in the same incubator, after properly labeling their containers with the group name and ID number. Over the next seven days, we recorded the weight of all of the caterpillars on a scale in the lab. We then compared their weights over the span of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, we performed a two-tailed t test with an alpha level of 0.05.


Results:
	After running a paired t test, it is evident that the three groups are not statistically significent (1.2483, 6, 0.2584). For the controll caterpillars, or the caterpillars that had not had any added reagent to their  food, the average weights in containers 1,2,3, and 4 were 1.61 g, 1.13 g, 1.32 g, and 1.00 g, respectively. The weights mentioned increased until day 5 then decreased. This is due experimental error and not re-feeding the caterpillars after day 1. For the experimental caterpillars, or the caterpillars that were fed food with the reagent, the starting weights for containers 1,2,3 and 4 were 1.33g, 0.94g, 1.32g, and 0.8g, respectively. These weights increased until day 4, but then started decreasing for the same reason: the caterpillars were not re-fed. Container 4 for both the experimental and controll caterpillars were presumed dead, which results in the error in the weight differences. Therefore, the results were inconclusive. 


Discussion:
	Our results were rendered inconclusive due to multiple sources of error in the study and our inability to accurately complete the study. Therefore, our hypothesis can neither be supported nor denied. We were supposed to feed the hornworms everyday; however, we did not know this and instead only fed them on the first day. Although our results for our particular hypothesis were inconclusive, we ran the data we collected. The data that we did collect was not statistically significent. In this way, the results were most likely due to chance occurrence. We were able to find similar studies that were related to our hypothesis in order to determine the effects of different levels of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta. A similar study to ours also questioned how the juvenile hormone controlls insect metamorphosis and reproduction. The study found that the juvenile hormone does in fact regulate body size [Riddiford: 2003]. Another study focused on the cessation of juvenile hormone secretion as a trigger for pupation and found that during the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm, the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibited the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone and thus regulated its body size (PTTH [Nijhout: 1974]. Sources of error in this study include not feeding the Manduca Sexta everyday. Other possible sources of error include incorrect meal preparation for the hornworms, incorrect handling of the insects when weighing them, and putting more than four drops of the reagent in the food. This study would beneficial to scientists who want to understand the role of hormones in the development of animals and humans.
