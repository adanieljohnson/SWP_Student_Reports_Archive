Title: The Effects of Tetraethylammonium Chloride on Gastrocnemius Muscle in Contractions in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Voltage-gated Potassium channels play a vital role in the relaxation stage of muscle contractions. This study examines the effects of a K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC), on the length of the relaxation period for the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. It is predicted that the muscles treated with TEAC should have a longer relaxation period than the controlls because nerve cells will remain in a depolarized state for longer. To perform this study, the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus were isolated from the frog leg and attached to an electrophysiology machine. Three myograms of normal muscle contractions as well as muscles injected with TEAC were measured. This was conducted on five different legs. The controll group produced a mean relaxation period of 194.66 ms +/- 72.75, while the treatment group was 1,011 ms +/- 654.08. The p_value for the data was 0.04. These results supported the hypothesis and led to the conclusion that TEAC inhibited nerve cells from immediately hyperpolarizing and going back to their resting potential, causing a prolonged relaxation period. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is the basis for all body movements in vertebrates and some invertebrates. Neurons generate action potentials in response to an environmental stimulus, which are then transduced along other neurons until the electrical signal eventually reaches a skeletal muscle fiber. At this point, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released, triggering calcium from the muscle’s sarcoplasmic reticulum to bind to actin sites. This process results in muscle contraction. After contraction, a muscle will enter its relaxation period in which it elongates to its resting length. Concurrently, potassium channels in the nerve cells open to allow K+ ions to flow out of and hyperpolarize the cells so that the neurons can go back to their resting potential [Johnson: 2018]. Tetraethylammonium Chloride (TEAC) is a compound known to block voltage-gated K+ channels in nerve cells, which has been observed when injected into the axons of squid [Armstrong: 1971]. This experiment will be investigating the use of TEAC on contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, commonly known as the Northern Leopard frog, and more specifically will focus on the relaxation period of the muscle. If TEAC is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, then the relaxation period should last for a longer period of time compared to normal relaxation times. This is due to nerve cells remaining depolarized as K+ cannot reenter the cell and will inhibit the reuptake of acetylcholine elongating the relaxation period of the muscle cells. 

Materials and Method:
Using five freshly severed Rania pipiens legs, place a leg in a dissecting pan, and peel the skin off and gently separate the inner thigh muscles to reveal the sciatic nerve. The nerve is a thin white strip located in the middle of the thigh. Free the sciatic nerve from its attachment to the structures in the thigh. Next, disconnect the gastrocnemus muscle from its insertion to the foot of the frog using scissors. Making sure the muscle stays attached to the knee, cut the tendon so that the entire muscle can be used in the experiment. Once the muscle is disconnected, tie a piece of string around the tendon, making sure a loop is present at the other end of the string. Place two strands of silver thread across the thigh and lay the sciatic nerve over the threads using a pair of forceps. The strips should not be in contact with each other. Clamp the thread and frog leg to the pan with pins so that only the gastrocnemus can move. Connect the red and black wires to each of the silver threads and hang the gastrocnemus from the hook on the force transducer. Adjust the height so that the muscle is taut. See figure 1 for setup. Make sure the leg stays moist by squirting it with ringer solution every couple of minutes. Once assembled, turn on the electrophysiology machine (1 amp, 1 pulse, 5 W, 1 F, 0 HP) and record three myograms of the muscle. Next, inject the gastrocnemus with 0.1 Ml of 100mM tetraethylammonium Chloride, and record another three myograms. Find the time of the relaxation period. Repeat this procedure for each leg.

Results:
The treatment group experienced relaxation periods longer than the controll group. The mean relaxation period for the controll group was 194.66 ms +/- 72.75 and the treatment group was 1,011 ms +/- 654.08. This data is represented in figure 2. Furthermore, the treatment group had a relaxation period over five times longer than the controll group. The differences in relaxation periods is seen in figure 3, which displays the myograms for one controll and one treatment muscle. It was also observed that one of the muscles began twitching when injected with TEAC. The mean of the controll group was statistically different than that of the treatment group (t_stat= 2.878, d.f.=4, P= 0.04).

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported by the data in this experiment, P=0.04. It was predicted that when injected with TEAC, the muscles should see a longer relaxation period; this did occur. The presence of TEAC in the nerve cells, as predicted, blocked the voltage-gated K+ channels in neurons, significently prolonging the relaxation period which caused the gastrocnemus to stay contracted for a longer duration. Figure 3 shows this, as the relaxation periods of the gastrocnemus without TEAC are very short, whereas the myograms showing the muscle with TEAC slowly decrease in voltage until eventually reaching the resting potential. This is consistent with other experiments concerning the effects of tetraethylammonium on skeletal muscles. It has been shown that TEA prolongs action potentials in toad muscles and produces very similar myograms to those produced by the treatment group in this experiment [Hagiwara: 1955]. The observation that the muscle began to twitch after being injected with TEAC is supportive of additional outside findings. TEA is known to block Ca2+-dependent K+ channels in skeletal muscles [Lattore: 1982]. The blockage of these channels causes calcium to be released from binding sites on nerve endings, which increases the instability and excitability of these structures, resulting in muscles twitches. This has been demonstrated on the Sartorius muscle of frogs [Beaulieu: 1967]. In these trials, it was impossible to controll the length of the relaxation period, as well as muscle twitching. Further testing should focus on these aspects of TEA’s interaction with the neuromuscular system. TEAC could have a role in treating overactive nerves and muscles. It might also help induce prolonged contractions or nervous signals in situations where this might be beneficial. Further research should also focus on these biological interactions with TEAC.
