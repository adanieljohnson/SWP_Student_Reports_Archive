Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Blocker  on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta (also known as the tobacco hornworm) is considered a pest. Its growth is regulated by several hormones. In this study we analyzed the effects of Ecdysterone on Manducas. To do this, we utilized an Ecdysterone  blocker and delivered it to Manducas mixed in their food. We compared the growth of these Manducas to the growth of Manducas that were eating untreated food. We hypothesized, from prior knowledge, that the Ecdysterone blocker would drastically inhibit the growth of the Manducas. After concluding the experiment we confirmed that the Ecdysterone blocker does inhibit growth of the Manducas. The data we collected through the experiment shows that the untreated Manducas grow at a more rapid pace than those that were given the Ecdysterone blocker.

Introduction:
Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) affect processes in insects regarding molting, growth, and progression through stages of life. Manduca sexta has IGRs that affect molting and each instar stage. Ecdysterone is a hormone that controlls the stage of development after each molt in Manduca sexta. IGRs were first discovered by accident when paper towels cause low hatch rates in linden bugs. These became popular to study since IGRs are less harmful to the environment than broad-spectrum insecticides and are more compatible with pest management systems (Krysan and Dunley 1993). In our study of Manduca sexta, we will be utilizing an IGR that blocks Ecdysterone called Azamax. The Manducas will be in the fourth larval stage. Naturally, they would molt into a larger fifth larval stage. During the fifth larval stage, the Manducas should have a mass ranging between 1.1 to 11 grams (Johnson 2018). We will be examining Manduca sexta treated with Azamax to confirm that Ecdysterone regulates the larval stages. We are studying these effects in order to better understand how this IGR impacts the Manduca sexta and to determine if Azamax would be useful in pest controll.

Materials and Method:
We began the experiment by utilizing a plastic container and a balance to measure 10 grams of food for each experimental caterpillar. Then we used a new transfer pipet for each 10 grams of food, and added 40 µL , per 10 grams of food, of Azamax and stirred it well to ensure the Azamax is distributed evenly throughout the food. The Azamax was at a concentration of 1: 1250 of 4 Ml of reagent in 100Ml of water. Next we created the environment where the Manducas were kept. This was done by dividing clear plastic containers in half with an index card and taping the ends to the walls to ensure there is no transfer of food and that the Manducas could not cross over into the other half of the container. Then the food treated with Azamax was added to one half of each of the containers. Turning to the controll groups, we again measured out 10 grams of food per caterpillar using the same method as before. 4 µL of water were added to each 10 grams of food to ensure that moisture was not the determining factor in the effects. The controll food was then stirred well and then placed in the other half of the containers.                   All of the caterpillars were massed and then placed in the containers, one caterpillar per section. The containers were housed in an incubator at 27 degrees Celsius. We replaced the food daily and recorded both the mass of the caterpillars and the amount of food eaten. With all of the data, we used a two-sample t_test to determine if our results were due to our experiment or a result of chance.

Results:
In the experiment, we found that treated groups did not grow as large as the untreated controll group. In the trials conducted, it was observed that the controll groups were larger than the groups treated with the Azamax as shown in Fig. 1 below. Both groups began at approximataely the same mass, however the controll group grew to nearly twice the size of the experimental group. The controll group also had a healthier green color. The controll group did begin to eat more as the experiment progressed.

Discussion:
        Our hypothesis was supported by the results and we calculated a P value of P=0.04, and therefore confirm our hypothesis. The experiment concluded that the blocked Ecdysterone prevented the Manducas from growing and molting into the next larval stage. This is shown by the significent delta in size between our controll group and the experimental group. The controll groups grew to the expected size of a fifth instar Manduca sexta, between 1.1 to 11 grams, while the experimental groups did not reach this size (Johnson 2018). The Ecdysterone never dropped in the experimental group and as a result, their bodies did not grow and prepare for the next stage. In the controll group, the Ecdysterone was not altered and they grew in preparation for the molt. In future studies, the experiment should be extended to include the molt of the Manducas. As a result of time constraints, we terminated our study prior to the molting of the Manducas. Observing how the controll and experimental groups are affected by Ecdysterone during the molts will even further the understanding of the effects on growth and molting.
