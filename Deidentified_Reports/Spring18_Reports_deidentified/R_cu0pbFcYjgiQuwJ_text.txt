Title: The Relationship Between Methoprene and Weight Gain in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta require certain hormones, such as Juvenile Hormone, in order to go through their lifecycle completely and correctly. However, methoprene can interrupt this process by mimicking Juvenile Hormone, and thus not allowing the Manduca sexta to become adults. By feeding Manduca sexta methoprene, it may have an effect on the weight gain of Manduca sexta. We believe that by feeding Manduca sexta food mixed with methoprene, it will cause this group of Manduca sexta to gain more weight than Manduca sexta fed with their normal diet. We fed a group of Manduca sexta their normal diet, and we fed a different group their normal diet with methoprene (brand name Precor) mixed into the food. Our results show that feeding Manduca sexta methoprene may decrease the weight of the insect, but we do not know for sure if there is no difference in weight when fed the different diets. These results show that a long-term study on the effects of methoprene on Manduca sexta should be completed in order to determine the true effects of the Juvenile Hormone Analog on Manduca sexta weight. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (hornworm) is an insect that goes through the larva, pupa, and adult stages of life. The Manduca sexta has a hormone called Juvenile hormone that determines what type of molt the Manduca sexta will have. [Johnson: 2016] For example, when JH levels are high, the Manduca sexta will molt into another larva. When JH levels are very low, the Manduca sexta will molt into a pupa or adult [Johnson: 2016]. Methoprene has the same effects on Manduca sexta as Juvenile hormone, but it is easily found and can be injected or feed to the Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2016]. There have been previous studies on the effects of Juvenile hormone and methoprene on Manduca sexta. The methoprene has been seen to cause Manduca sexta to gain weight in the past because the methoprene “inhibits larval-pupal differentiation” [Shaaya: 1993]. This is important because Manduca sexta are considered “pests” in their larval stage, and studying the effects of methoprene can lead to the development of insecticides for Manduca sexta. In this experiment, we plan to feed methoprene (Precor) to Manduca sexta while they are in the larva stage. We believe that by feeding the Manduca sexta the methoprene, it will cause them to gain more weight than the Manduca sexta that are fed their normal diet. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta hornworms were separated equally into two different groups. One group was labeled as the controll group, and the other group was labeled as the treatment group. The controll group was fed Manduca sexta food with 12 drops of water mixed into the food. The treatment group was fed Manduca sexta food with 12 drops of methoprene (Precor) mixed into the food. The Precor dilution was 2 parts Precor per 48 parts water. We fed every hornworm approximately 10 grams of food, and we stored them all in the same conditions at 23 degrees Celsius in an incubator. The weight of each Manduca sexta was recorded each day, and the food was replaced as needed in the same way previously described. This process was repeated every day for one week. When the week was over, the hornworms’ total weight gained was measured. 

Results:
All of the caterpillars grew during the week. We had a fairly wide range of weight gain throughout the group. Our results show that the controll group, on average, gained more weight than the treatment group (Table 1, Figure 1; Two-Sample T-Test: p=0.067). Also, the standard deviation of the controll group was lower than that of the treatment group (Table 1, Figure 1). We also made observations of the hornworms each day. There was one hornworm, in the treatment group, that struggled to gain much weight (it only gained 1.37 grams), and it did not look healthy throughout the week. There was a hornworm, in the controll group, that gained much more weight than any other hornworm. This hornworm gained approximately 1.5 grams per day, and ended up weighing 13.05 grams. At the end of the week (between days 5 and 7), every caterpillar gained much more weight than in previous days.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our results. We believed that the methoprene would cause the Manduca sexta to gain more weight than the controll group, but the controll group ended up gaining more weight than the treatment group. However, because our p_value (p=0.067) was greater than 0.05, these results were not statistically significent, and we cannot say with certainty that there is a difference between a diet with methoprene and a diet without methoprene. Our results differed from the results of previous studies. In previous studies, there was a clear sign of more weight gained by the hornworms being fed methoprene [Shaaya: 1993]. There may have been these issues because our experiment only lasted one week, and we were not able to see the results of pupation. If we were to improve on this procedure, we should have done it over a period of a few weeks, rather than just one, in order to get less discrepancies in our data. Using our results, feeding Manduca sexta its normal diet is a better way to gain weight than feeding them methoprene mixed in the food. The treatment group may have weighed less because they were going to molt into another larva stage because of the high levels of Juvenile hormone (methoprene), whereas the controll group was preparing to molt into a pupa because of the lower levels of Juvenile hormone [Johnson: 2016]. In order to determine if the methoprene (Precor) could be used as an effective insecticide, we would have to spend more time with the procedure in order to see the results of the molting of the different groups of hornworms.
