Title: The Effect of Azamax on 20E Production in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a pest that pupates and becomes a moth when it matures. Both juvenile hormone and ecdysone are growth hormones in Manduca sexta and are necessary to the growth process. The blocking of ecdysone through the natural insecticide Azamax will inhibit the growth process and keep the caterpillars from maturing. Subsequently, caterpillars that are fed a diet treated with Azamax will weigh less and will have a smaller change in weight than caterpillars that are fed a control diet.  

Introduction:
Insects molt, or change state and mature, into adults by the release of hormones. Manduca sexta caterpillars molt as a result from the release of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20E) [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysone regulates timing of molting and controls additional functions in adult Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2018]. The Manduct sexta is a pest that turns into a moth after it pupates [Johnson: 2018]. The necessity of ecdysone was found through experiments by Nijhout, who slowly defused ecdysone into Manduca sexta and observed that it elicited a physiological response of prodromal symptoms of pupation, even in the absence of juvenile hormone [Nijhout: 1976]. The experiment done by Nijhout demonstrate that the hormone 20E must be present in order to begin maturation of the caterpillars [Nijhout: 1976]. Blocking ecdysone would result in abnormal amounts of growth and development hormones in the Manduca sexta. This organism is good to use in this experiment because it is easily kept in a lab and can easily be weighed. A decrease in 20E levels would cause the caterpillars to be smaller in weight than if the hormones were not inhibited. Azamax is a natural insecticide that blocks 20E in Manduca sexta. We hypothesize that if we treat Manduca sexta with Azamax, the treated caterpillars will be smaller in weight than the control caterpillars that are fed a normal diet. We believe that the blocking of 20E will inhibit the caterpillars’ growth. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to perform this experiment, we placed eight Manduca sexta into two groups of four. We used an index card and tape to section off four plastic bins in which we kept the caterpillars. We fed the control group an untreated diet of ten grams of food with seven drops of water in every ten grams of food. We fed the treatment group ten grams of food with seven drops of Azamax in every ten grams of food. Each caterpillar was weighed to obtain an initial weight and subsequently weighed everyday for a week and documented. Throughout the week, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator in the lab. At the end of the week, the day eight weight of each caterpillar was obtained and the change in weight from day one to day eight of each caterpillar was calculated. 

Results:
The starting weight of the Manduca sexta before they were given either treated or control food was between 1.00 and 1.28 grams. On the last day of weight measurements (day eight), the weight of the treated Manduca sexta was between 1.48 and 3.67 grams, while the weight of the untreated Manduca sexta was between 8.28 and 10.06 grams. The mean change in weight of the treated caterpillars was 1.155 +/- 0.9219 grams, while the mean change in weight of the untreated caterpillars was 8.33 +/- 0.7115 grams. The mean change in weight of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat: 12.32, df= 6, p=.0000174). These values were obtained through a two sample t-test.

Discussion:
Based on our results, the hypothesis that the Azamax treated caterpillars would be smaller in weight than the control caterpillars was supported. This means that the Azamax did indeed inhibit the growth hormone 20E and therefore inhibited the treated caterpillars’ growth. The inhibited caterpillars were not able to mature and therefore weighed less than the control caterpillars. The ability to inhibit maturation in Manduca sexta is important because they are pests, and they pupate into moths. These results are consistent with Nijhout’s study that found that 20E was necessary for maturation in Manduca sexta.
