Title: The Effects of Various Temperatures and Lanthanum(III) Chloride on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
In this experiment we will be testing the effects of different temperatures and Lanthanum (III) Chloride on the rate of photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea. Using a spectrometer to measure absorbance and solutions with chloroplasts from the test species, we were able to calculate the rate of photosynthesis and compare the experimental groups. We hypothesized that Lanthanum (III) Chloride would decrease photosynthetic rate and that the rate of photosynthesis would be highest at room temperature. Our results showed that Lanthanum (III) Chloride decreased absorption rate and that the optimum temperature for absorption of light was at 0 degrees celsius. 

Introduction:
In this experiment we will be testing the effects of various temperatures and Lanthanum (III) Chloride on the rate of photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea over time.  By keeping the light intensity constant, we will have the ability to determine the individual effects of Lanthanum(III) Chloride and temperature on the rate of photosynthesis. Lanthanum(III) Chloride is an inorganic compound that is commonly used to block the activity of cation channels, specifically calcium channels.  Calcium plays a large role in the regulation of photosynthetic electron flow and light-dependent metabolism [Hochmal: 2015].  Calcium appears to modulate activity of the phosphatase enzymes in the carbon reduction cycle and also to regulate chloroplast NAD+ kinase activity through a calmodulin-like protein.  Some evidence supports a calcium function in the water-splitting complex, and other evidence indicates a reaction center function in photosystem II [Becker: 1984].  As a result, we hypothesize that Lanthanum (III) Chloride will decrease the photosynthetic rate since it blocks the calcium channels.  Organisms use enzymes to carry out biochemical reactions and these enzymes are specifically folded to bind to a molecule in a certain way.  At low temperatures around 0℃, enzymes cannot work efficiently and photosynthetic rates decrease.  At medium temperatures around 20℃, enzymes work at their optimum levels and photosynthetic rates are high.  At high temperatures around 40℃, photosynthetic rates decreases because enzymes do not work as efficiently [Markings 2018].  For this reason, we hypothesize that the greatest photosynthetic rates will be at room temperature. 

Materials and Methods:
The materials we needed for this experiment were as follow: Mortar and pestle, 50 mL centrifuge tubes,a centrifuge, 4 medium sized kale leaves, 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (pH 8.0), a 150-250 mL beaker, cheesecloth,water, 1 nM Lanthanum(III) Chloride,10mM phosphate reaction buffer, 130mM DCPIP, and a spectrometer.
First we made a pellet solution. Second, we allowed the mortar & pestle, medium-sized beaker, and 3 centrifuge tubes to chill in crushed ice, we removed the veins from 4 kale leaves and rinsed them in water. Third, using the mortar and pestle and 10 mL of grinding buffer, we grinded the spinach to a paste and mixed 10 more mL of grinding buffer into the mixture and strained it using a cheesecloth. Fourth, we transferred 200 micrometers of the liquid into a and labeled it “Sample of A” and put it on ice, then transferred the rest of the liquid to a centrifuge tube marked “A”. Fifth, we spun the tube at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. After spinning and pouring the supernatant out of tube A into another centrifuge tube labeled “B” (leaving the debris in tube A). We removed 200 μl of liquid from tube B and put it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B”. Fifth, we centrifuged this tube at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. After pouring the supernatant into a clean tube (leaving the pellet in tube B), we place tube B on ice.Sixth, we labeled 20 large test tubes and placed them on a rack. We used the reagent tables below to fill the test tubes. We also conducted treatments as shown in the second table. Seventh, we began our assay by adding 100 μL of chloroplast from the prepared B pellet solution to tubes 4-18 and mixed the solutions. We transferred all of the mixtures to spectrometer cuvettes and measured the absorbances of all of the samples at 600 nm. Eight, we placed the samples in their respective locations (according to the second table), and measured their absorbances 3 times at 10 minute intervals. Ninth,we recorded all of these absorbances along the way. Tenth, we calculated the percent changes of the absorbances for each tube using the following formula. (absorbance at time0/absorbance at time t)x100.




Results:
Our results show that the Lanthanum(III) Chloride caused the average absorbances over the 30 minute period to decrease at the fastest rate.  Over the 30 minute period, the average absorbance decreased from 0.255 to 0.040 and there was a  percent change of 84%.  In addition, the chloroplast in light at 0℃ had an overall percent change of 54.7% which is greater than the chloroplast in light at 20℃ which had an overall percent change of 33% and the chloroplast in light at 40℃ which had an overall percent change of 11.9%. 


Discussion:
Our results do not match our hypotheses for either the 1mM lanthanum (III) chloride decreasing the rate of photosynthesis or that photosynthetic rates are better at room temperature than at 4˚C and 40˚C.  We think that the reason for why the lanthanum (III) chloride treatment did not go the way we thought it would is because there was either not enough concentration or there was not enough time allotted for the 1mM lanthanum (III) chloride to take effect on the calcium channels.  There was an experiment done testing the inhibition of TRP3 channels via lanthanides and it was found that lower concentration tend to not inhibit channels as well [Halaszovich, Zitt, Jüngling, Lückhoff : 2000].  This could be the reason to why our hypothesis for 1mM lanthanum (III) chloride was not supported and could lead to an experiment where we determine at what concentration does lanthanum (III) chloride decrease photosynthesis best.  As for temperature, it is unknown why our hypothesis was not supported by the data.  However, we can do further testing to see if time exposed to varying temperatures have an effect on photosynthetic rates in B. oleracea. Overall, the experiment did show that there was a difference between the treatments’ and controls’ photosynthetic rates.  Even though they were not what we expected there must be a reason for why we got this data and this would require more testing, maybe a repeated experiment with more samples or focus on one of the treatments separately.
