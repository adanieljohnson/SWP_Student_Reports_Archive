Title: Effects of Azadirachtin on Weight gain in (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
The effects of azadirachtin on (Manduca Sexta), which has been under study for many decades since the discovery of IGRs in the 1950s, is what will be looked at in this experiment. After a 7-day round-up of the weight for both the treated and control groups, it was discovered that the treatment of azadirachtin had no significant effect on the weight of the treatment groups. Previous studies have shown that effects should have been elicited but this discrepancy in data can be attributed to errors in the experiment. It was thus accepted that the addition of azadirachtin compared to control holds no meaning. 

Introduction:
Belonging to the order Lepidoptera, which includes all the butterflies, moths, and skippers, (Manduca Sexta) in a common insect with a multitude of common names including Sphinx Moth, Hawk Moth, Tobacco Hornworm, and the Carolina Sphinx (Johnson, 2018). The life cycle of the Tobacco Hornworm follows five larval instars, a pupation, and metamorphosis into a grown adult moth. The transition between these phases is controlled by a variety of hormones in the (Manduca Sexta) physiology, including Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20-hydroxyecdysterone (20E) being the most common form), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). 
	Tobacco Hornworms generally weigh 1 gram at the outset of the final (5th) larval instar and, according to Nijhout & Williams (1974), the decision to release PTTH occurs at certain critical weights (Nijhout & Williams, 1974). PTTH is formally released by the Corpus Cardiacum, a neurosecretory organ just behind the brain of the insects, and serves to regulate the release of Ecdysterone by the prothoracic glands. Most importantly, the release of Ecdysones, specifically 20E, regulates the timing the insect will molt by shedding the outer cuticle (Johnson, 2018). JH serves to postpone metamorphosis of insect larvae until they have “attained an appropriate stage and size,” then, when the concentration of JH drops, the pupation of the instar into adulthood commences (Smykal, et al., 2014). It is through the combined work of both JH and 20E that the life cycle of a Manduca Sexta is regulated. When JH concentration and 20E concentration are at specific critical periods, the larva will molt to the next instar while low concentrations of JH facilitates pupation. This experiment will look at the proliferation of one of these mechanisms through Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs). 
	IGRs, a better alternative to the environment-destroying insecticides in controlling pest species, or otherwise known as “insect hormone mimics,” effects certain physiological regulatory processes essential to the normal development of insects or their progeny (Tunaz & Uygun, 2004). Their selectiveness in their mode of action make them extremely useful in controlling a specific pest of an insect. Ideally, understanding the effects of key IGRs is critical in this experiment, especially for insect pest control in real world situations. The IGR active ingredient used in this experiment was Azadirahtin. It is known from previous experimental observations Simon Ascher that molting of all instars during postembryonic development is interfered with, bringing about various forms of premature adults through incomplete ecdysis (Ascher, 1993). 
This experiment analyzes the effect on varying concentrations of azadirachtin in the (Manduca Sexta) species by looking at the weight development over a period of one week. It is predicted that the administration of azadirachtin, depending on the concentration administered, will cause a generally smaller weight value in the last instars. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight similar (Manduca Sexta) larvae were collected and separated into two groups, the control group and the experimental group. The control group will be given 10 g of the regular food, which was weighed exactly and mixed with 8 drops of diluted water through a transfer pipet. The food was also kept in as big a clump as possible, and slightly damp, so that the larvae can easily eat it. The experimental group were also given 10 g of the regular food, but the drops of diluted water varied with the drops of the IGR azadirachtin. For the first experimental larva, 2 drops of azadirachtin were administered as well as 6 drops of diluted water. The next experimental larva was given 4 drops of azadirachtin and 4 drops of diluted water. This pattern follows through until the fourth experimental larva which was only given 8 drops of azadirachtin and no water on the food. Four containers were used, separated by a stable index paper wall, pinned down by tape, where the control group larva environment will be separated by the experimental group larva environment as shown in Figure 1. 

Four perforated lids were placed on each of the containers after the larva and food with azadirachtin treatment were administered. The weights of the larva prior to feeding were recorded using a digital balance and were measured every day until the 7th day. The containers were kept in a 24-H light fridge with constant light exposure and temperature to reduce the risk of confounding variable error. After the 7 days, a two-sample T-test will be conducted to compare the control group with the experimental group. Since the hypothesis was one-sided, a one-tailed two-sample T-test will be used to confirm or deny the null hypothesis. 

Results:
After the weights were calculated for the 7 days of the experiment, it was noted that on days 3 and 5, the experimental group larvae climbed into the control environment, which may or may not have adversely affected the results. It was also observed that the experimental group, at the beginning of the week, tended to excrete more feces than did the control group larvae. As shown in Table 1, the weight values of the experimental group increased faster than the control group at the beginning of the 7-day period, but the control group ultimately grew exponentially faster than the experimental near the end of the 7-day period. 

According to Table 1, which shows the average weights of the larvae, the growth from the 6th and 7th day for the control larvae differs great from the experimental larvae. This may or may not be due to infrequent restocking of the food in the containers, which was supposed to be refilled every day.

        A one-tailed two-sample T-test for both the control and experimental mean weight values shown in Table 2 was indicated that there is no real significance in weight difference between the control and experimental groups (P = 0.32, T = 0.46). Since the one-tailed P value is greater than the chance factor of 5%, the null hypothesis of no significant difference is accepted. Figure 3 below shows the error bars in terms of a bar graph for the averaged weights in the specific days. 

Discussion:
The results of the one-tailed two-sample T-test for the treatment of Azadirachtin vs. Control provided in the results section indicate that the manipulation of IGR Azadirachtin have no significant effect on weight in (Manduca Sexta). Thus, the null hypothesis is accepted while the variable hypothesis, introduced in the introduction, is denied. The reason for the weight variation between the control and the experimental near the last 2 days can be attributed to (1) limited feeding schedules that were not followed by the experimenters, and (2) effect of azadirachtin. In a previous study conducted by U. Schluter et al., the observed weight gain, related to molting, decreased as the administration of azadirachtin increased and the chances of molting simultaneously decreased as a result. The significant weight gain for the control group in this experiment can be attributed to increased molting while, as the experimental group consumed more azadirachtin, the chances to molt significantly decreased and thus the weight stagnated at around 3±0.21 g (Schluter & Grewe, 1985). 
        The observed effects of azadirachtin on previous studies, especially Schluter’s study in 1985, demonstrates that azadirachtin, for hemimetabolous insects, acts on the release of eclosion hormone, a neurohormone in charge of adult ecdysis (Schluter & Grewe, 1985). This study is applicable to agriculture as pest control by insecticides have been shown to elicit a multitude of negative effects on the environment, other species, and the crops themselves. With IGRs, the effects of insecticides can be completely reduced, and it has also been shown that IGRs are not poisonous / venomous at all for humans if somehow consumed (Ascher, 1993).
