Title: Insect Growth Regulators Effect on (Manduca Sexta) Caterpillars

Abstract:
The (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar, like most insects, relay on hormones to make developmental changes. Three main hormones, prothoracicotrophic hormone, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone, are found in insects and are responsible for most developmental changes in a caterpillar’s life style. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are hormone mimics; they are commonly used to control pests in a non-toxic way by altering the pest’s developmental physiology. Azamax is a commercially sold IGR which is mimics JH’s affect. Azamax is the treatment used in this experiment. It was hypothesized when (Manduca Sexta) caterpillars were treated with doses of Azamax in their food, it would initially prove to be beneficial to the caterpillars (increasing their growth), but then, as more IGR is consumed, it would become harmful to the caterpillar’s life cycle- stunting their growth and transformation into a pupa. According to the results, this hypothesis was refuted. There was no significant difference between the control groups and the experimental groups. The most probable cause of the experiment failing is the lack of proper feeding throughout the week. For this reason, it was concluded that the IGR Azamax did not affect the growth or any developmental processes of the (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar. 


Introduction:
(Manduca Sexta) are a type of tobacco hornworm in the order Lepidoptera, along with other butterflies and moths. According to the Wake Biology Comparative Physiology Manual (2018), the life cycle of a (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar is approximately 35 days, spending 2-5 days in each instar and around 20 days as a pupa. Like all animals, these caterpillars use hormone and neuron signaling to control physiological processing, such as growth. Because insect hormones play a significant (and visual) role in their development, insects like the Manduca caterpillar are good model organisms to use in hormonal research. 
	There are three main hormones related to growth, molting, and development in insects, such as the Manduca caterpillar: Prothoracicotrophic hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH and 20E work together to affect the Manduca’s metamorphosis rate and type. However, not all developmental factors are controlled naturally by hormones. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are synthetic growth hormones that can alter the physiology and life cycle of insects. IGRs are not toxic to the targeted pest, but rather, alter the physiology of the pest to affect its life cycle (Tunaz, 2004). Tunaz further states that there are currently two types of IGRs: chitin synthesis inhibitors and ones that over-stimulate or interfere with hormonal processes. Azamax, the IGR used in this experiment, is an insecticide that interferes with developmental processes. According to PubChem (2005), the active ingredient is the insecticide azadirchtin, a mimic of JH in insects. 
In this experiment, we will be determining if IGRs affect the Manduca’s growth over a period of seven days. We hypothesize that, since the IGRs are a JH mimic, it will be beneficial to the caterpillars in smaller doses (in the first few days), but harmful in the following days, stopping the rapid growth and preventing the caterpillar to change into a pupa.  


Materials and Methods:
Materials
•	Four round containers and lids
•	Index cards
•	Tape 
•	Caterpillar food
•	Spoons
•	Plastic containers 
•	Pipettes 
•	Balance
•	Reagent (Azamax IGR)

Methods
1.	Divide all containers in half with index cards and tape. Label the containers. 
2.	Place one caterpillar in each side of the containers. 
3.	Measure 80 grams of food. 
4.	Take 10 grams of food out per half-container.
5.	In plastic containers, mix 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water (per container) for the control groups and 10 grams of food with 5 drops of Azamax IGR and 5 drops of water (per container). Place food in containers. 
6.	Record the weight of each caterpillar and continue weighing them daily for 7 days. 


Results:
The results of this experiment are shown in two charts: a bar graph depicting the different weights of the treatment versus control caterpillars. According to Figure 1, one the first day, the controls weighed more than the treatment groups. On days two through 5, the mean weight of treatment groups was slightly greater than the control groups. While there was a difference in the two groups’ weights, based on the error bars, the difference is not considered significant. On day six and seven the weight of the control groups was greater than the treatment groups, but only day seven is considered a significant difference.

Discussion:
In this experiment, the goal was to determine how and IGR (Azamax) affects the (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar’s growth and development. We hypothesized that the administration of the IGR would possibly benefit the caterpillars’ growth, but as the days progressed, the IGR consumption would become harmful, which would stop the growth of the caterpillars. According to Figure 1, one the first day, the controls weighed more than the treatment groups. On days two through 5, the mean weight of treatment groups was slightly greater than the control groups. While there was a difference in the two groups’ weights, based on the error bars, the difference is not considered significant. On day six and seven the weight of the control groups was greater than the treatment groups, but only day seven is considered a significant difference. This outcome could have been due to a number of limitations: the most probable one being improperly feeding the caterpillars. The caterpillars were given 10 grams of food on day one (with the corresponding amount/type of drops), but their food was not switched out daily. This lack of feeding possibly led to the unexpected outcomes. On day six the caterpillars were given fresh food, which could have accounted for the significant increase in weight of the control group and insignificant, yet noticeable increase in the treatment group’s weights. 
The p-value for this experiment is 0.226 (Figure 2). Because this p-value is over 0.05, the alternative hypothesis that IGR will prove to be beneficial and then harmful to the caterpillars is rejected. This means that the null hypothesis is supported; so it is concluded that the IGR does not affect the development of (Manduca Sexta). Further experiments on this topic may prove otherwise, if the caterpillars receive the proper amount of food and treatment.
