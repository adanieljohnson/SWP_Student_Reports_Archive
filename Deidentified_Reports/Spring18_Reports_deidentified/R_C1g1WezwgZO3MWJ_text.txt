Title: Increasing Stimulus Threshold in Rania pipiens due to Sodium Channel Blocker, Lidocaine 

Abstract:
	This experiment studies the effects of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the threshold stimulus of the Rania pipien. Muscle contraction in the frog is triggered by a depolarization. The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens were initially tested to find the threshold stimulus with no manipulation. The nerve and muscle were then injected with lidocaine. Again the threshold stimulus was found. We hypothesized that this would increase the threshold stimulus. This was shown to be true and the threshold with the lidocaine treatment was consistently higher in all three Rania pipiens legs than without the treatment. The lidocaine blocked sodium channels in the Sciatic Nerve, greatly slowing the depolarization necessary for an action potential. The slower depolarization of an action potential prevented the quick release of acetylcholine. Therefore muscle required a stronger stimulation to contract. Lidocaine impaired the ability of the nervous system to create an action potential and send messages to the muscular system, slowing the reaction process. 


Introduction:
	Muscle contraction vertebrates is caused by an action potential generated by the nervous system. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released by the action potential to the muscle cells, initiating a reaction [Johnson: 2018]. The depolarization in the nervous system is a crucial step in muscle movement. An action potential occurs in neurons when sodium channels open and sodium flows into the neuron causing depolarization. This causes the release of acetylcholine in the postsynaptic membrane, causing the muscle to react [Kai: 1993]. The Gastrocnemius Muscle in the leg of the Rania pipiens is controllled by the Sciatic Nerve. The stimulation and depolarization of this nerve causes the muscle to contract. When sodium channels open in the Sciatic Nerve, the action potential occurs and the muscle contraction process is initiated.
	In order for muscle cells to contract, a threshold stimulus must be reached. If the stimulus falls below the threshold the muscle cell will not react. Once the action potentials summate and and sufficient stimulation has occurred the muscle will react. 
	Lidocaine is a common sodium channel inhibitor. It is used on market to treat (arrhythmias) irregular heartbeats and relieve pain by numbing skin. By blocking sodium channels, the nervous system cannot create the depolarization necessary for action potentials [Davis: 1969]. We want to see how injecting lidocaine into the Gastrocnemius Muscle and Sciatic Nerve affects the stimulus necessary to reach threshold for a muscle contraction. We believe the injection of lidocaine will increase the necessary stimulation threshold. The blocking of sodium channels will prevent the depolarization necessary to release acetylcholine to the muscle fibers. This experiment will test the effectiveness of lidocaine as a sodium channel blocker. 
The independent variable is how much lidocaine is injected into the muscle. The dependent variable is the threshold stimulus.


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were used in the experiment. The legs were first dissected. We removed the outer layer of skin then isolated the white sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle. We then began to apply stimulus to the nerve until we saw contraction of the muscle and charted the reaction on a myogram. Using the myogram we found the threshold stimulus to the tenths place. After the threshold for each of the three legs was found we injected each with 0.1Ml of 25mM lidocaine. 0.05Ml was dropped onto the nerve while the rest was injected into the muscle. Leg 3 was injected with 0.2Ml of lidocaine because it was harder to reach the muscle and nerve in this leg. After injection we waited five minutes for the lidocaine to take full effect. We then repeated the same stimulation process with the legs, increasing the stimulation until a threshold for muscle contraction was found. We then analyzed the data using a paired t_test. 


Results:
Table 1 shows that the threshold stimulus for each leg increased once the lidocaine had been injected. There was consistent and dramatic increase in all the samples. Although each threshold increased by different values, all increases were a minimum of 0.70 volts. Leg 3 experiences the greatest threshold increase of 3.27 volts. The muscle that received the higher dose of lidocaine experienced the greatest change in the threshold for contraction. 
Figure 1 shows that the average controll threshold was 0.19∓0.11 volts. The threshold for the lidocaine treatment was 1.83∓1.07 volts. The treatment threshold was 963% higher than the controll threshold. The average difference in threshold between the controll and lidocaine treatment was 1.64∓1.12 volts and our results are not statistically significent. 


Discussion:
	In the beginning of this experiment we hypothesized that injecting the muscle and the nerve with lidocaine would increase the threshold stimulus for muscle contraction. Our results partially supported this hypothesis, not fully because they are not statistically significent. Once the legs were treated with lidocaine, each required more stimulation to initiate a detectable contraction (Table 1). Lidocaine blocked the sodium channels in the Sciatic Nerve of the Rania pipiens leg. This made it harder for a summation of depolarization great enough to cause an action potential to be created [Johnson: 2018].  Sodium could not move into the cell as easily as before, resulting in a higher threshold stimulus (Table 1). It took longer for the muscle to receive the message from the nervous system. We were also able to observe that the more lidocaine added the more the threshold increased. As shown with Leg 3, the threshold for a double dose of lidocaine was much higher than that of the single dose (Table 1). 
	Our results are supported by two other experiments. The first, conducted by the Circulation Research Journal, determined that the action potential in the nerve tested was not as large once it had been treated with lidocaine. The lidocaine made it more difficult for depolarization to occur [Davis: 1969]. This supports conclusion that our lidocaine injection does, in fact block sodium channels in the Sciatic Nerve. 
	An experiment conducted through Europe PMC similarly supported our findings. This study found that once a motor unit had been treated with lidocaine, the release of Ca 2+ was inhibited. They determined this was a result of a lack of depolarization in the nerve [Kai: 1993]. Without that action potential acetylcholine was not released to the muscle cell therefore calcium could not be mobilized and the muscle could not contract. These results mimic our own. The lidocaine prevents depolarization and therefore muscle activation. 
	Our experiment could be supplemented by testing the effects of different levels of lidocaine. Do they cause different thresholds? Is there a dosage that closes all sodium blockers, or makes it impossible to create muscular contraction. This information can be important in the medical world where lidocaine is used as medicine.
