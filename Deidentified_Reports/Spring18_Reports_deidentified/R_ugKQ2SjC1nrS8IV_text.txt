Title: Aggressive Behaviors in Betta Splendens With and Without Shelter

Abstract:
Aggressive behaviors can be used by organisms to deter threats, signal a territory, or escape danger. Betta fish (Betta splendens) are a species well known for exhibiting try aggressive behaviors. We hypothesize that with the addition of shelters in our betta fish environments will lead to less aggressive behaviors. The first round of tests we presented each combination of betta fish (i.e. 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc.) to one another so that we could get a baseline for their aggressive behaviors without the presence of shelter. We measured the number of times each fish flared their red mane. In the second round we tested each combination like before, but we added shelters to both fish's sections. We then collected our data and ran a one-tailed, paired t-test to compare each combination with and without shelter. After running our one-tailed, paired t-test we found our p-value to be 0.029. According to our statistical tests we were able to determine that our results were statistically significant! Our numbers showed that these particular betta fish displayed less aggressive behaviors when the presence of shelter was added to their environment. Replicating this test could allow for a better understanding of domesticated betta fish behavior, and how to most effectively preserve them.

Introduction:
Aggressive behaviors can be used by organisms to deter threats, signal a territory, or escape danger. Betta fish (Betta splendens) are a species well known for exhibiting try aggressive behaviors. Domesticated betta fish display a wide variety of brilliant colors which, in the wild, can be a clear indicator of aggressiveness. In this lab we will be conducting experiments about betta's aggressive behaviors in the presence of shelter. We believe this will be true, because a shelter could hide the presence or the signaling of threat from another betta fish. Knowing the natural environment betta fish originate from also might suggest how shelter could help. Betta fish are typically found in rice paddies in Southeast Asia which lack much natural shelter (Panijpan, Kowasupat, Laosinchai, Ruenwongsa, Phongdara, Senapin, Wanna, Phiwsaiya, Kühne, Fasquel:2014), so the introduction of shelter could prevent their naturally occurring aggressive behaviors. Shelters are very common within domesticated fish tanks to decorate their habitats, but we hypothesize that with the addition of these shelters betta fish will display less aggressive behaviors. This would lead me to believe that introducing these betta fish to shelters would allow them an alternative to facing another betta fish, therefore, lessening the afore mentioned behaviors. Alternatively, if one betta fish was submissive it would have the opportunity to retreat to a shelter. Data from this experiment could tell us more about aggressive behaviors in other fish, and we could learn more about how to prevent intraspecies agonistic behaviors.

Materials and Methods:
These experiments called for the use of three male betta splendins (betta fish) which were separated into three separated environments. Males were used because domesticated betta fish tend to display more aggressive behaviors than their female counterparts. We used two clear, and two solid dividers to separate our medium sized tank into three sections. The solid dividers prevented betta fish from seeing each other or interacting with others, however, the clear divider allowed them to only see each other without interacting. We used the three separated sections to put the betta fish into, one in each section. We then labeled each of our three fish based on its initial section. The first round of tests we presented each combination of betta fish (i.e. 1 and 2, 1 and 3, etc.) to one another using the clear divider so that we could get a baseline for their aggressive behaviors without the presence of shelter. We measured the number of times each fish flared their red mane, so every time they retracted their mane we were able to count a new number. In the second round we tested each combination like before, but we added shelters to both fish's sections. We were provided a small bridge like structure, and a small skull-shaped structure for the bettas. We then collected our data and ran a one-tailed, paired t-test to compare the number of times red mane was displayed for each combination with and without shelter.

Results:
After running our one-tailed, we found significant difference between number of times red mane was displayed with and without shelter (t = 2.44 df = 5 p = 0.029). The overall pattern in our data showed less frequent red mane appearances in the presence of shelter, so much so that none of the numbers in the second round with shelter exceeded the numbers from the first round without shelter. Figure 1 shows the graphed form of these means with standard deviation. The bar on the left represents the tests done without shelter. The group on the right shows the aggressive responses in the presence of shelter. Our mean for the first group was 9.0 ± 7.44, and the mean for the second group was 3.167 ± 3.39. Figure 2 shows fish #3 (our least responsive fish) which had the unique phenotype of spikier fins around its body. This particular fish was also interesting because of its lack of responses which totaled to be zero throughout all the experiments. Figure 3 is a photo of our skull-shaped structure. In our raw data we marked which structure was used for each fish.

Discussion:
According to our statistical tests we were able to determine that our hypothesis was supported, and our results were statistically significant. If we look at another study done on isolation in relation to aggressive behaviors, we can begin to see our results might suggest something else. The study in question hypothesized and claimed that longer periods of isolation would cause these betta fish to display more aggressive behaviors (Hinkel:1972). If we think about this statement with a little more context of shelter, we can see that isolation (i.e. being cooped up in the shelters we provided) in our experiment did not suggest more aggressive behaviors. In Hinkel's experiment they looked at these particular aggressive behaviors and isolation periods in longer increments of time (15 minutes, 24 hours, 72 hours, etc.), so perhaps our experiment is only accurate on a smaller scale. Regardless, our numbers did show that these particular bettas displayed less aggressive behaviors when the presence of shelter was added to their environment. The only outlier was our third fish which expressed zero displays of red mane during the entire experiment. We originally, before the tests even began, had swapped our third, inactive fish for the fish we ended up using. It just so happened that this fish was just as inactive. We suggested that this fish might have been submissive. Alternatively, it was brought up that this fish could have been blind. During our tests we thought of ways to make improvements. Our medium sized tanks weren't big enough after we divided them into three portions, but if future experiments used larger tanks that could improve the test. It would also be wise to record which types of structures are being used for each fish in each experiment, so that repeated experiments could repeat it most accurately. Through this experiment we were lead to believe that the introduction of these shelters allowed each fish to distance themselves from the others, therefore reducing the frequency of aggressive behaviors, and the restriction in the “ease-of-access” to the other male betta likely promoted less provocative responses. It would be interesting to see if these shelters would have the same effect in a scaled-up or more authentic environment. Since we know the natural environments of the fish are cramped similar to our medium sized tanks, then it is very possible that non-domesticated male bettas would follow our predictions if we introduced small shelters to their ecosystem.

Figure Legends: 
 Figure 1: This graph shows the number of red mane responses shown by the betta fish in the absence and presence of shelter. The error bars represent the standard deviation for each of the two groups. This was quite high in group one with a value of ± 7.44, and lower in group two with ± 3.39 red mane displays. Figure 2: One of our three betta fish (#3) can be seen in his section of the tank. Figure 3: One of our two structures can be seen. This particular structure mimics a skull of some kind.
