Title: Betta splendins Aggression Behaviors Decrease in Turbid Water.

Abstract:
In this lab we examined Betta splendins ethology.  We hypothesized that the Betta splendins would exhibit less aggression if they were placed in turbid water.  We tested this by placing to male fish on either side of a divided tank in clear water, then in murky, examining each fish’s behaviors.  The hypothesis was supported as the Betta splendins displayed a large difference in aggressive behavior in clear versus turbid water.  It was concluded that this happens due to the Betta splendins’ natural habitat and comfort levels, and also decreased ability to see the other fish. 


Introduction:
While studying ethology, the goal is to try to understand the animal’s world and try to explain the evolutionary basis for their behavior.  To study ethology, we used Betta splendins. Betta splendins are common aquarium fish that originated from southeast Asia and are indigenous to Thailand.  There, they lived in sluggish and muddy water and were dull in color, whereas in the United States they typically live in clear water in aquariums and have been bred to retain bright fighting colors.  Betta’s display intraspecific agnostic (or aggressive) behaviors in the presence of other male Bettas.  These behaviors are classified into two categories: broadside and facing.  Broadside movements include, in increasing aggressiveness, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing.  In pelvic fin flickering, the fish moves its pelvic fin vertically opposite the opponent.  In tail beating, the fish makes sudden movements towards the opponent using the caudal fin.  Tail flashing is where the Betta opens and closes the caudal fin.  Facing movements, from most aggressive to least, include erect pectoral fins, the spreading of their gill covers (opercula), and creating a red mane.  A red mane is created by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane which is located under the opercula.  A Betta can respond to another’s agnostic behaviors in a few ways, they can ignore, match, flee, or intimidate.  Encyclopaedia Britannica Online notes the pugnacity between Betta splendins males as they have such an aggressive relationship.  


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we took two male Bettas and put them in a tank with two dividers: one transparent and one opaque.  First, they are observed in clear water.  We lifted the opaque divider, leaving only the transparent one.  We noted every time an agnostic behavior was displayed then determined a point value of aggression using the following scale: pelvic fin flickering(1pt.), tail beating(2pts.), tail flashing(3pts.), erect pectoral fins(1pt.), the spreading of their gill covers (2pts.), and creating a red mane(3pts.).  After 5 minutes, the opaque divider was put back and the males were given 5 minutes to rest.  This was repeated 2 more times, making 3 trials total.  Then, a small hand.f.ul of soil was placed into each side of the tank and stirred into the water.  We repeated the trial 3 times in the turbid water.  


Results:
The difference between clear and turbid water was vast.  In the clear water, fish one exhibited a total of 130 points for facing and 89 points for broadside.  Fish two exhibited a total of 35 points for facing and 26 points for broadside.  In the turbid water, fish one exhibited a total of 57 points for facing and 38 points for broadside.  This is shown in figures 1 and 2.  Fish two exhibited a total of 4 points for facing and 36 points for broadside. In the paired T-Test with 3 degrees of freedom and an alpha of 0.05, the T value was 2.055 and the P value was 0.132.

Discussion:
In this lab, our hypothesis was supported.  Due to the results of the paired T-Test, it can be concluded that there is statistical significance.  The difference between agnostic behavior in clear water is much greater than that in turbid water.  This can be explained by the Betta splendins natural habitat.  In an article written by Verbeek it is noted that the domestic Betta is more aggressive than the wild type [Verbeek: 2008]. Since the domestic Bettas are habituated to clear water but the wild type is habituated to turbid water, there may be a certain level of comfort in the natural habitat or it can more simply be explained by decreased visibility.  The decrease in visibility makes it harder for the Bettas to see each other and therefore they would not exhibit agnostic behaviors.  In another paper written by Verbeek, he explores the specific aggression patterns of both wild type and domestic Bettas.  He found that the difference in aggression is context dependent therefore supporting the theory that the wild type and domestic have similar tendencies, however the differences are due to the context they are in, such as water visibility.  Overall, this improves our understanding on how Bettas can cohabitate in the wild and helps to explain aggression differences.  Although not all Bettas will fight, they will display aggressive behaviors if another male enters their territory.
