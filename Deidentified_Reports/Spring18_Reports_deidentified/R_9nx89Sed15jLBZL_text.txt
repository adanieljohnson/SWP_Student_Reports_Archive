Title: The Effects of a Potassium Blocker on the Contractions of a Muscle in Rania pipens

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab was to determine if blocking potassium channels would affect the relaxation times of the leg muscles of a Rania pipens.  We hypothesized that the relaxation times of the legs would be longer after they had received an injection of the potassium blocker because the potassium helps the repolarization of the neurons in the leg and the leg will take longer to repolarize.  This means that the neuron will stay activated and the muscle will stay contracted for longer.  3 legs were used and tested, once before, and then once after they had received an injection of the potassium blocker.  The t_test shows that the data was statistically insignificent, but we believe our hypothesis was supported based on raw data and that the t_test was incorrect because of low degrees of freedom.  



Introduction:
The nervous system is an important biological process in all living creatures because it helps the body communicate across long distances very quickly.  Like the endocrine system, the nervous system helps the body communicate, but while hormones work on a scale from minutes to days, neurons work in milliseconds.  This allows for quick movements such as muscle contractions, and other high-speed activities in the body (Johnson: 2018).   In order for these movements to occur, an action potential must be produced and the best way to see these action potentials is with a myogram.  A myogram can show many different parts of the action potential such as the amplitude, contraction time, and relaxation time.  The important part of this for our experiment is the ability to measure relaxation time.  When a neuron receives and action potential at the axon hillock, sodium channels begin to open and depolarize the cell by rushing into the axon.  As this is happening, potassium is let out of the cell.  After this, the two ions have to return to their initial positions, this is called the relaxation time.  The potassium goes back into the cell and the sodium goes back out of the cell (Bio 114 Lecture).  Our experiment is to see if the relaxation time of a muscle will change after being given an injection of a potassium blocker.  Our hypothesis is that the relaxation time of the frog leg muscle will be longer after it has received an injection of the potassium blocker.  One similar study by Physiol shows a similar occurrence in squid.  When a squid was given a potassium blocker, tetraethlammonium Cl, the same blocker in our experiment, the myograms shown seemed to have longer relaxation times than before the injection (Physiol: 1965).  Another similar study with tetraethlammonium Cl in frogs was done by Kyozo Koketsu.  This experiment showed that repolarization after an injection of the potassium blocker was much longer than repolarization without the blocker (Koketsu: 1958).  Both of these two studies would support our hypothesis.  
	


Materials and Method:
The computer program was set up and connected to the computer in order to take myograms.  The leg was then skinned and hung on the hook by the calf muscle.  The frog leg was then given different stimuli of Amps and the latency time, contraction time, relaxation time, and the amplitude were all measured.  After this, the same frog leg was injected with a potassium blocker, 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl.  The leg was once again given different stimuli and the same data was recorded.  This same procedure was done with 3 different frog legs.  After this was done, the 2 sets of data were compared with a paired T-test.  



Results:
On average the relaxation times of the frog leg muscles after the injection of the potassium blocker seemed to be much longer than the relaxation time before the injection.  On the other hand, the paired t_test gave a p value = 0.138468 which means that the data is technically insignificent.  Figure 1 is a chart that shows the average relaxation times of the frog legs before and after the injection of the potassium blocker.  Figure 2 is a table that shows the values and results of the paired T-test.  In general, the relaxation times of the muscles after the injection seemed to be much longer than the relaxation times before the injection.  

Discussion:
While the paired T-test shows that the data was technically insignificent, I still believe that our hypothesis was supported by the data.  Our paired T-test might not have been completely accurate because there were only 2 degrees of freedom allowed.  While the t_test does not show it, we believe there was a very large distinct difference between the data of the controll and experimental groups.  While the T-test does not support our hypothesis, two studies, one by Physiol and one by Koketsu, do support our hypothesis.  Both of these studies showed that the relaxation time, or repolarization of the cell took significently longer after it received an injection of the potassium blocker.  The Physiol study showed that the relaxation times in squid after receiving the potassium blocker were much larger than before (Physiol: 1965), and the Koketsu study showed that repolarization in frogs took a longer time after receiving the potassium blocker.  Each of these experiments helps support our hypothesis, so we believe that the potassium blocker did in fact have an effect on the relaxation times of the frog legs.
