Title: Betta Splendens show reactive behavior towards guppies

Abstract:
All animal behaviors have a purpose. There are risks or benefits to every behavior an animal shows. We looked to see the behaviors of the Betta splendens , also known as the Siamese fighting fish.  Males of this species cannot live together as they are really aggressive towards one another. The goal of this lab is to see how a male betta fish react towards a guppie. It was predicted that the betta fish will not react towards the guppie. The guppie and the betta fish were in the same tank with a glass divider. The betta fish behaviors were observed and given a number based off the behaviors it exhibited. The behaviors of the betta fish were also observed when the betta fish could not see the guppie. The betta fish showed aggression to the guppie and was significant after a paired t-test was ran. With the betta fish showing aggressive behavior towards the guppie it did not support the initial hypothesis. The aggression the beta fish showed that they are very territorial creatures and will put themselves at risk of fighting another fish in order to protect their territory. 


Introduction:
Animals all have a reason for their behaviors. They might demonstrate behaviors in order to protect their selves, their territory, or their young. The model organism in this study was the Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish. They were chosen as our model organism because of their colorful displays make it easy to categorize their behavior. Betta fish have interspecific and intraspecific behaviors. Intraspecific behaviors are the behavior of the betta fish in the presence of a member of their own species. While interspecific behaviors are the behaviors that the betta fish does in the presence of a member of another species. The Betta fish have aggressive behaviors toward each other when they feel threatened as they are very territorial creatures. Male betta fish are particularly aggressive towards other male betta fish. One would think that betta fish would be aggressive towards other species since they are aggressive to their own species but Bettas can form schools of fish with other fish[Simpson:1968]. The goal of this study was to see if a betta fish is aggressive towards a guppy. This study is relevant is because many people want to put betta fish in the presence of other fish in a large tank and we want to see if the betta fish will expend energy to show an aggressive behavior to a non-aggressive fish like the guppy. It was predicted that the Betta fish will not act aggressively towards the guppy.


Materials and Methods:
First, a male Betta splendens were placed in the presence of a guppy with a glass divider.  The Betta fish was observed for five minutes. Then, based on the chart below, a number was given to them based on the behaviors the betta fish demonstrated. This was repeated three times, with a five minutes rest in between with an opaque divider. When the Betta splendens was resting, we observed them and recorded if the Betta fish demonstrated any behaviors on the chart. After a paired t-test was ran to determine the data was significant.     Pelvic Fin Flickering 1 Tail flickering 2 Tail flashing 3 Pectoral fins erect 4 Spreading gill covers 5 Red man 6 Raising dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, and darkening the skin  7 Demonstrates none of the behaviors above 0. 


Results:
The data showed that the Betta fish with the guppies demonstrated aggressive behaviors toward the guppy . The mean of behavior score of betta fish by itself was 0 +/- 0 . The mean behavior score of betta fish with guppy was 25.67 +/- 6.5.There is no significant difference  between groups( t=6.8326,df=2, and P= 0.0208). 


Discussion:
Since the data was significant, the data did not support the initial hypothesis. With a P-value of 0.0208 it is lower than the ideal P-value of 0.05.   According to Alyan, Betta splendens are equally aggressive to intruders in their territory[Alyan:2010].  This could have been a reason why the Betta splendens reacted so aggressively towards the guppy. The color of the guppy could of have been a factor of the aggressiveness of a Betta splendens.  Todd showed that Betta fish react more aggressive when the fish is a brighter color [Todd:2008].  The guppy was bright purple and that could have been the reason why the Betta fish reacted so aggressively to the guppy. The behaviors of the betta fish in this study shows how strong the betta fish’s interspecific behaviors were.  The betta fish showed the maximum aggressive behavior it can show towards the guppy. This study demonstrates how a betta fish will use their energy in order to protect their territory even if the fish is a nonaggressive fish.  In the future, an experiment can be done with a gray guppy and brightly colored guppy to see if the Betta fish react in the same aggressive manor to all of the colors including dull colors.
