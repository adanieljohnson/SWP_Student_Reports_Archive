Title: The effect of blocking acetylcholine in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens 

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are governed by motor neurons that extend from the nervous system and connect to muscles at a neuromuscular junction. The muscle and nervous system comprise the motor unit, the functional way in which organisms react to external stimuli. Our experiment seeks to understand how blocking neurotransmitters sent from the brain affects muscle contractions. The primary objective of this experiment was to examine the effects of a neurotransmitter blocking agent (the chemical Sevin, in this case) on the minimum contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle of a Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens). Specifically, we hoped to find out if blocking acetylcholine would raise this minimum threshold value. Our experiment was done by connecting the sciatic nerve from the frog leg to a force transducer that delivered a stimulus. We then measured the force of the resulting contraction. We hypothesized that injecting our specimen with the acetylcholine blocking agent Sevin would lower its minimum contraction threshold. The results of our experiment did not support our hypothesis as the change was not statistically significant.


Introduction:
The Northern Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is an amphibian that is found throughout North America and is unique in its ability to travel considerable distances away from water (which many amphibians depend upon for survival). The neuromuscular system of the Leopard frog (Rana pipiens) functions as a cohesive unit that sends messages from the brain to the muscles telling those muscle to contract or relax. The axons of motor neurons branch out from the spinal cord and innervate individual myofibrils in the muscle which allows for nervous system control of the skeletal muscles [Johnson: 2018]. In order for a muscle to contract, an action potential must be sent down the axon to the synaptic cleft where acetylcholine is released and diffused into the muscle fiber allowing for the release of Ca2+. This chemical then initiates the contraction of the muscle. Our experiment seeks to examine the effects of the chemical Sevin on the myoneural function of the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of a Rana pipiens frog. We want to find out if blocking the neurotransmitter acetylcholine will prevent muscle contraction by not allowing an action potential to fully innervate the muscle. In a study done by S.D. Gergis that looked at the effects of neuromuscular blocking agents, it was found that that blocking the neurotransmitter acetylcholine caused weaker muscle contractions in the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens frogs like our subjects [Gergis: 1971]. This experiment is very similar to the one we conducted in that it looks at how blocking neurotransmitters can alter muscle contraction. We expect that injecting the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg with the acetylcholine-blocking chemical Sevin will raise the minimum amplitude required (the threshold) to stimulate the sciatic nerve in the frog leg and cause the muscle to contract.

Materials and Methods:
First, we prepared two Rana pipiens legs by removing the skin and separating the thigh muscles so as to expose the sciatic nerve. Next, we cut the gastrocnemius muscle at its lower insertion point and tied a string to the free end so that we could attach it to the stand that attached to the force transducer that was used to record myograms resulting from frog leg stimulation. Once this was all set up (see figure 1) we used the iWorx computer software program to stimulate the muscle until we found the minimum contraction threshold. This was repeated three times. Next, we injected the muscle with 0.1 mL of a 100% Sevin solution, waited 5 minutes and stimulated the muscle 3 more times, again looking for the minimum contraction threshold. This process was repeated with a second, third, and fourth leg for statistical reasons. A paired t-test was used to analyze our data and compare the control and treatment. 

Results:
We found that injecting the muscle with the acetylcholine blocker Sevin increased the minimum threshold for muscle stimulation. We tested two subjects (and used data from two more) and observed that the minimum contraction threshold was raised in each specimen when the muscle was injected with Sevin. Although our test and control groups showed a difference, it was not statistically significant as our P-value was 0.075826. The average minimum threshold for the control group was 0.0825 +/- 0.0340343 and the average minimum threshold for the treatment group was 0.1375 +/- 0.0340343. The average difference between the minimum contraction threshold for the control and treatment group was 0.055 (v). The P-value was 0.075826 and the t-value was 2.667892 (See Figure 2). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because the P-value was 0.075826
and was therefore not statistically significant. By obstructing the flow of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine in this case) from the neuron into the muscle cell we made it harder for the muscle to contract as a much weaker signal was reaching the muscle than if all the neurotransmitters had been allowed to signal muscle contraction. Even though our hypothesis was technically not supported due to a P-value of over 0.05, it was very close to this number and the results of our experiment do show that the treatment of the frog leg with the chemical Sevin did in fact raise the minimum threshold required for contraction. This finding is in line what we know about acetylcholine and its effects on muscle stimulation [Rasmusson: 1994]. In Rasmusson’s experiment, he found that sending an increased amount of acetylcholine neurotransmitters from the brains of rats increased the force of muscle contractions in muscle innervated. In our experiment, we saw a general trend towards this idea even though it was considered significant enough for our hypothesis to be correct. This experiment went as planned, however using more subjects in our testing may prove the statistical significance of our hypothesis by showing (to a greater degree) the effect of blocking acetylcholine. By preventing the proper innervation of the muscle due to a weaker signal being sent to the muscle we can see how important the unobstructed flow of neurotransmitters is to the contraction and thus potential force exerted by a muscle. Knowing this information about how neurotransmitters can be blocked is important to the scientific community because it helps us understand how weaker signals sent by the brain produce weaker contractions that will thus lead to less force exerted by the muscle. Since neurons have a gap between them, neurotransmitters are essential to conducting action potentials, so blocking those neurotransmitters prevents proper muscle innervation and can lead to conditions such as paralysis.
