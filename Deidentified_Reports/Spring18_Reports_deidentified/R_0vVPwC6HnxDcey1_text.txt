Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta Experiment

Abstract:
 The main objective of this study is to view the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. The experiment will be performed by separating eight caterpillars into two groups of four, with one receiving a basic diet while the other is being fed that same diet except with six drops of Martin’s IGR. We hypothesize that the Martin’s IGR would make the caterpillars grow longer in length and heavier in a shorter amount of time compared to the control group due to Martin’s IGR mimicking Juvenile Hormone.

Introduction:
The purpose of the lab was to observe the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Manduca sexta, a member of the Lepidoptera order, undergoes a metamorphosis from egg to larva to pupa to adult [Reinecke, 1980]. Martin’s IGR is an insect growth regulator that functions by mimicking the production of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the caterpillar [Oberlander, 1997]. It is a hormone essential for the growth and pupation of caterpillars. The life cycle of caterpillars depends on the different ratios of JH and Ecdysterone (20E), which is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting. A caterpillar must go through the commitment pulse before it can pupate and turn into an adult, which is signaled by a large drop in JH and an increase in Ecdysterone (20E) [Takeda, 1970]. By mimicking the production of JH in the caterpillars, Martin’s IGR causes the caterpillars to enter the commitment pulse earlier, which, in turn, makes the process of becoming adults faster. We believe that the caterpillars with the Martin’s IGR drops in their food will grow more in length and in weight than the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
We were provided eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, numbered 1-8, in the 4th and 5th larval stage for the lab. We also separated the caterpillars into two groups of four and were provided 10 g of a pre-made solution to feed them every day for a week. We gathered the caterpillars and placed them into plastic tupperwares, two per tupperware, and divided them with a flashcard. The four caterpillars of the control group, 1-4, were fed a basic diet, while the experimental group, 5-8, were given the same food except with six drops of Martin’s IGR added to it. The food was prepared by weighing the 10 g of food per caterpillar and then adding the treatment to the food. Each caterpillar was placed in an incubator and weighed in grams and measured in centimeters at the start and every single day throughout the week to track their growth until the final day. We also took pictures of the caterpillars at the beginning of the experiment, as well as the end of the experiment to compared size and color. Finally, we obtained all our values to find statistical values, such as the average, standard deviation, p-value, and t-value.

Results:
Some observations we made include the control group caterpillars, as the week went on, turned a bright green with a red tail. This differs compared to the experimental group who, as the week went on, became a lighter teal color and their tail faded slightly to a pinkish color. There were also days where the caterpillars displayed much more movement and energy. For example, the second day of the experiment the caterpillars displayed minimal movement and even lost weight, but towards the middle of the week when their growth increased substantially they were much more active. Also, after taking measurements of the caterpillars, we calculated statistical data to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment on the growth to determine whether out hypothesis was accurate or not.
The figure above represents the average difference in the mass of the caterpillars in both the control, red, and the experimental, blue, group. The average value we obtained for the control group caterpillars was 4.3728 g  0.4775 g and the experimental group weighed 4.3424 g  0.2611 g. We also received a standard deviation of 0.477506 g for the control group, along with a value of 0.261063 g standard deviation for the experimental group. The p-value for the difference in mass was recorded as 0.9615. The average difference in mass was also calculated to have a t-value of 0.0485
The figure above represents the average difference in the length of the caterpillars in both the control, red, and the experimental, blue, group. The average value we obtained for the control group caterpillars was 5.622 cm  0.43661 and the experimental group measured at about 5.7851 cm  0.51430. We also received a standard deviation of 0.43661 cm for the control group, along with a value of 0.51430 cm standard deviation for the experimental group. The average difference in length of the caterpillars was calculated to have a p-value of 0.7963. Finally, the average difference in length was calculated to have a t-value of 0.2593.

Discussion:
According to our results, the average length and mass differences between both groups are not statistically significant. Since the p-values we obtained we both greater than 0.05, we failed to reject the null hypothesis because the evidence against it was too weak. The p-value for mass was 0.9615, which is over the 95% confidence interval as well as the length which was at 0.7963. These p-values show that it is still possible that these results could have been obtained by chance. The data shows that Martin’s IGR had little effect on the mass and length of the experimental group compared to the control. Furthermore, the average difference in mass of the caterpillars was 4.4373g  0.4775g for the control group and 4.3424g  0.2611g for the experimental group. Also, for the average difference in length, the control group reported an average of 5.6220 cm  0.4366 cm and the experimental group had an average of 5.7851cm  0.5143 cm. Based on these values, the control groups when compared to the experimental groups had very similar averages and did not differ much even with the range given by the standard deviation. Considering the possible errors made during the lab include one day accidentally measuring the caterpillars in inches instead of centimeters which could throw off the accuracy of our data by a few decimal places. If I were to repeat this procedure, I would modify it by making it span over two weeks to obtain more data points, as well as make more observations. In turn, this could make it possible to give the IGR a chance to possibly make more of a difference than observed. I would also attempt to obtain more caterpillars to study along with increasing the variety of diets amongst multiple groups.
