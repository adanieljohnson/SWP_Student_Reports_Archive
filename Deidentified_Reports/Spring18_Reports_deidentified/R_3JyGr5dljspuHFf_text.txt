Title: The Effect of Caffeine on the Muscle Contraction of the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Excitation-contraction coupling is the process through which a nerve stimulates a muscle to contract. This process involves acetylcholine (Ach) and calcium, without which, contraction would not be able to occur. Muscle contractions can be enhanced or reduced by toying with any of the components involved. Adding different chemicals could also alter the outcomes of excitation-contraction coupling. In this experiment, the goal was to enhance the muscle contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens by injecting the muscle with caffeine. It was hypothesized that the caffeine would promote calcium flow in the muscles. Three legs were tested stimulated at different voltages, once without the caffeine, and once adding the caffeine. The results were collected using a myogram. It was proven that due to chemically induced tetany, the caffeine did increase the amplitude of the muscle contractions, and therefore facilitated the flow of calcium in the muscles. 



Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is what supports and moves the body. Muscles are made up of hundreds of thousands of myofibrils. Each myofibril contains sarcomeres, which are the units of contraction for muscles. Muscle contractions are controllled by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The axons of motor neurons extend into muscles and connect at points known as neuromuscular junctions. Muscle contractions begin with an action potential that depolarizes the neuron which then causes the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine diffuses to the muscle fiber which then opens sodium channels. The activation of of the sodium channel creates an action potential in the muscle fiber that stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium allows for the binding of the actin and myosin filaments in the sarcomere which is what creates the contraction. The force generated by the action of multiple motor units to produce muscle tension is called summation. There are two types of summation. In spatial summation, the number of axons carrying action potentials increases which causes the number of active motor units to increase as well. Temporal summation is the repeated stimulation of a given number of motor units. If the axon is stimulated frequently enough, a new twitch starts in the motor unit before the relaxation phase of the last twitch finishes causing a fairly continuous pull of the muscle. Temporal summation leads to tetanus which is the maximum force possible that a muscle can sustain. Tetanus leads to muscle fatigue because if a muscle is sustained for too long, the muscle will run out of ATP and no longer be able to contract. There have been multiple studies done that test the the effects different chemicals have on the contraction of muscles. Many of these studies have used varying method to trigger the release of calcium to cause stronger muscle contraction [Endo: 1970]. Caffeine has been one of the method tested, and has been proven to increase muscle contraction [Itoh, 1981]. This lab will explore the the muscle function in the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens, especially after the addition of caffeine. The added caffeine will optimize the flow of calcium into the muscle, which will also cause the amplitude of the contractions to increase.



Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were taken and their skin was removed to enable direct access to the muscle. The gastrocnemus of the first leg was stimulated at different voltages to find the threshold voltage. Once the threshold voltage was determined, the response from that stimulus was recorded. Next the response was recorded on the same leg from a stimulus of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Volts. A caffeine solution was acquired and 0.1 Ml of the caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus of the same first leg. The threshold stimulus was found again to see if the threshold with the caffeine was different, and the responses were again recorded at the threshold and stimuli of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 Volts to see if the caffeine had any effect on the amplitude of the contractions. This whole process was repeated again for the other two legs. Also, any observations of differences in the gastrocnemus were noted, and a paired T-test was used to find the statistical significance of the results. 


Results:
The experiment showed that caffeine did, in fact, increase the amplitude of the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens. Due to chemically induced tetany, this is possible even though the raw data shows higher numbers for the contractions of the controlls. For example the average amplitude of the response for the controll was 0.4147 ± 0.2822 V. The average amplitude of the response for the caffeine-injected legs was 0.2623 ± 0.1903 V without accounting for the chemically induced tetany. Once adding in the amplitude that the myogram showed from chemically induced tetany, the average contraction for the caffeine-injected leg trials was 0.8766 ± 0.2227 V. It was also observed during lab that as soon as caffeine was injected into the muscle, the muscle became very firm. The muscle stayed firm throughout the remainder of the lab. A paired T-test was used to determine the statistical significance of the data, and the P-value found was 0.1546. 


Discussion:
Caffeine was added to the three Rania pipiens legs to see if it would intensify the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. Caffeine opens the calcium channels in muscles which then facilitates the contraction of a muscle. Although the amplitude values of the contractions for the controlls were larger than the amplitudes of the trials with the caffeine-injected legs, chemically induced tetany explains that the caffeine causes an immediate contraction of the muscle which must be considered when analyzing the data. The ITXA and SMT-220 does not start recording during the initial contraction caused by the caffeine. Instead, the three smaller contractions following the initial contraction were the data recorded. Upon consideration of chemically induced tetany, it is clear that the amplitudes of the responses for the caffeine trials were, in fact, higher as stated in the results. As soon as the caffeine was injected into the muscle, the muscle began to contract until it approached tetany (maximal contraction a muscle can attain). The three smaller contractions recorded on the myogram must be added to the tetany value to produce the true amplitude of the contraction after the injection of caffeine. Also, as seen in Figure 1, the standard deviations are fairly larger than would be desired. One of the legs was much larger than the others which likely contributed to the larger standard deviation and the P-value. For data to be considered statistically significent, the P-value must be 0.05 or lower. The amplitudes of the response was higher for the larger leg than the two other legs. As noted in the results, the caffeine caused the muscles to be hard for the remainder of the lab. Due to these results, it can be inferred that the relaxation period of the muscle would also be longer due to the addition of caffeine. To conclude, while the numbers say caffeine did not enhance the muscle contraction, chemically induced tetany and observance of the myogram showed that caffeine greatly increased the amplitude of the muscle contractions. The response recorded was the muscle contracting more on top of the tetany, and when adding the tetany and the second contraction, the response to the stimulus was much higher after the injection of caffeine.
