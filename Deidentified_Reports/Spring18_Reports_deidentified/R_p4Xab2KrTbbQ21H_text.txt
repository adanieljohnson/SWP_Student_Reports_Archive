Title: Impact of calcium blocker on contraction strength of Rana pipiens leg muscle

Abstract:
In this study, we are researching the effect that calcium has on strength of muscle contraction. Because calcium begins the process of muscle contraction by binding to and changing the conformation of actin which allows in to bind to myosin, we hypothesized that the Rana pipiens legs would have a lower amplitude of contraction after being injected with a calcium blocker. Each leg was used as its own control and experiment. The amplitude of contraction was measured at stimulus 0-0.4V before the injection and after the injection and then used a paired t-test to compare the results. The experimental amplitude was an average of 0.019V lower than the control, but these results were not found to be significant (t = 1.786, df = 4, p = 0.149). Although it was not significant, there was a trend with each of the average experimental amplitudes being lower than the control. The results serve as evidence to support that calcium plays an important role in facilitating the contraction of muscles, but these results should be further studied and the experiment recreated to find more consistent results.


Introduction:
The muscular system is a vital part in organism functioning and movement. Movement of muscles is caused by contraction, whether voluntary or involuntary. This contraction occurs by the binding and sliding together of actin and myosin filaments [Johnson - 2018]. This process begins with an action potential in a neuron, causing the release of calcium which binds to troponin on actin and begins the contraction process [Sigelman - 2018]. This indicates that calcium plays an important role in the contraction of muscles. Calcium blockers have been shown in past research to reduce amount and intensity of muscle contraction in animals [Panchal – 2017]. Animals work as example organisms for scientific research and frogs have leg muscle structure that is similar to humans. In this study, we will be using the rear leg of the Rana pipiens (northern leopard frog) to test the effect of a calcium blocker on the amplitude of muscle contractions. We are hypothesizing that the amplitude of muscle contractions of the frog legs will be significantly lower after being injected with the gallopamil calcium blocker compared to the original state of the leg, which will be the control.


Materials and Methods:
Obtain three Rana pipien frog legs that had been killed the same day in order to maintain maximum muscle functioning. For the first leg, place it on the dissection tray and then gently peel the skin off the leg with your fingers. Identify the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg and pull it away from the bone and then clear the connective tissue between the muscle and the bone. Use scissors to cut the achilles tendon at the bottom of the gastrocnemius muscle, cutting towards the foot to ensure that some of the tendon remains attached to the muscle. Tie a string around the remaining piece of tendon and tie the other to the hook on the LabScribe stimulator. Pin the leg onto the dissection tray with metal pins in the thigh and the tibialis. Put the probes from the LabScribe machine into the gastrocnemius with the red probe on top and the black on the bottom. While the leg is on the table, make sure it stays moist with frog leg ringer that mimics its extracellular fluid. When the probes are in the muscle, use the iWorx LabScribe software to stimulate the muscle in increments increasing by 0.1V each time starting with 0 and reaching 0.4V and measure the amplitude each time. Settings in LabScribe should be set to 1 pulse, 5 w(ms), and 1 F(Hz). Once this has been done, inject 0.2mL of gallopamil calcium blocker into the muscle with a syringe. Wait ten minutes and then stimulate the muscle again with the same settings and same increments, recording the new results. Repeat this preparation and stimulation for the other two frog legs as well. Compare the amplitudes using a paired t-test with the average of the control and the experiment at each amplitude 0V-0.4V. 

Results:
The results of the paired t-test revealed that there was an average difference of 0.019V amplitude between the control and experiment, with the control having the higher amplitudes. In addition to the average difference, the statistical test showed the results of t = 1.786, df = 4, and p = 0.149. As shown in Figure 1, the average amplitude of the control group was higher than the average amplitude of the experimental group. 


Discussion:
The results are consistent with our hypothesis that the frog legs that had been injected with a calcium blocker would have weaker amplitudes than the control legs. When averaging the amplitudes of the control and experiment at each stimulus level, we found that the control had a higher average contraction amplitude than the experimental group at each stimulus level excluding the zero values at 0 and 0.1V. While these results were consistent, the p-value indicates that they were not significant because the p was not less than 0.05. Even though the results weren’t statistically significant, this study indicates a trend in what happens when calcium is blocked in the muscle. The results are logical because as previously stated, calcium must be released to change the conformation of actin, which allows it to bind to myosin and contract the muscle. In the lessening or absence of calcium, the actin remains in its original conformation or changes slower, which would prevent or weaken a contraction [Sigelman – 2018]. A study done by Panchal [2017] tested calcium blockers as a way to reduce hypertension in rabbit hearts. The study concluded that the use of a calcium blocker weakened contractions of the cardiac muscle in the heart and therefore reduced hypertension in rabbits [Panchal – 2017]. This finding is consistent with the results that we found in our study since the experimental contractions were weaker on average than the control contractions. This study would have to be conducted again for more concrete results and this time we would be more precise with the tension of the gastrocnemius muscle because this can affect contraction and should be held completely constant. Although this study was done on frog legs, the principles can be applied to human muscles as well. In cases where the muscle contraction should be weakened, such as hypertension or muscle spasms, we can use data from studies such as this to develop a calcium blocker that targets the muscle needing to be affected to help reduce negative harmful effects of too much muscle contraction.
