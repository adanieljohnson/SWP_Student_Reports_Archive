Title: Effect of increased CO2 on photosynthetic activity in enriched kale chloroplasts

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to test the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the photosynthetic activity of enriched kale chloroplasts. We hypothesized that there would not be an increase in photosynthetic activity with above normal concentrations of CO2. Three groups were prepared, one controll group with no additional CO2, one experimental group with a partially increased CO2 concentration, and another experimental group with a 2x the concentration of CO2 than the first experimental group. An unpaired, one-tailed sample t_test yielded the p_value of 0.43 when comparing the % change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the controll group against the partially increased CO2 concentration group, and a p_value of 0.30 when comparing the % change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the controll group against the highest increased CO2 concentration group. This data supported our hypothesis that increased levels of CO2 decrease photosynthetic activity. A graph of the % change in absorbance comparing the three groups over 30 minutes supported our null hypothesis.


Introduction:
This study examined the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the photosynthetic activity of kale chloroplasts. The study of the effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis is extremely relevant due to the increasing atmospheric pressure of CO2 experienced throughout the globe. The Nation Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) website shows a dramatic increase of global atmospheric CO2 over the past 60 years, leading the current level of just over 400 ppm (“Graphic: The relentless rise of carbon dioxide,” 2017). The effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis has been studied extensively, with more focus being put on plants that utilize C3 carbon fixation, one of the three metabolic pathways for carbon assimilation. Most studies focus on the effects of CO2 on carbon assimilation reactions of photosynthesis, and conclude that “…short-term increases in CO2 supply at [CO2] below 600 µmol mol-1 tend to increase leaf CO2 assimilation” (Nowak, Ellsworth, & Smith, 2003). However, this study focused purely on the light-dependent processes of photosynthesis, specifically photosystem I. During photosystem I, light photons are absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, which causes electrons to “leave the chlorophyll and travel through a multisubunit complex to NADP+, to produce NADPH” (Johnson, 2016). The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH is what we will be measuring for the effects of CO2 on photosynthetic activity. This said, NADP+ reduction is extremely difficult to measure so we will be using the compound DCPIP as an alternative electron acceptor. When reduced by the electron transport chain, DCPIP changes colors from dark blue to a lighter blue, and the absorbance can be measured using a spectrometer at 600 nm. The decrease in absorbance DCPIP then directly correlates to an increase in photosynthetic activity (Johsnon, 2016). The main effect of CO2 on photosystem I has been observed. A study measuring the effects of enriched CO2 levels on the photosynthesis of cotton plants found that the CO2 caused a decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Delucia, Sasek, & Strain, 1985). If chlorophyll concentration is decreased by elevated levels of CO2, then there would be less transfer of electrons to NADP+, or in this case, DCPIP. This would result in a decrease in the reduction of DCPIP, which would directly correspond to smaller decreases in DCPIP absorbance. We hypothesize that the controll group will have larger decreases in absorbance than both experimental groups. Additionally, we hypothesize that the partially increased CO2 group will have larger decreases in absorbance than the group with 2x the concentration of CO2. 


Materials and Method:
Six kale leaves were purchased from a local grocery store and deveined before being ground with a cold mortar, pestle, and two 10Ml additions of grinding buffer. Once a paste, the kale solution was strained through three cheese-cloths, before being added to a chilled 150Ml beaker. Next, 50 Ml of the strained kale leaf solution was moved to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A,” and centrifuged at 1200 rpm and 4°C for three minutes. The liquid contents of “A” were transferred to another 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B” avoiding the inclusion of any pelleted debris found in “A”. Centrifuge tube “B” was then centrifuged at 2800 rpm at 4°C for ten minutes, and the liquid component of “B” transferred into a chilled 50 Ml tube labeled “C”. This concluded the preparation of the enriched kale chloroplasts. The first step in the assay was to label ten test tubes, beginning with a “blank” tube which contained 8Ml of water, and then labeling the remaining tubes #1-9. Tubes #1-3, the controll group, contained 6Ml water, 100 ul of enriched chloroplasts, 2Ml DCPIP, and Hill Reaction buffer. Tubes #4-6, the 1st experimental group, contained 5Ml water, 100 ul of enriched chloroplasts, 2Ml DCPIP, and Hill Reaction buffer with the addition of CO2 in the form of seltzer water diluting the Hill Reaction buffer. Tubes #7-9 contained the same solution as the 1st experimental group, but with 2x the amount of CO2 in the form of seltzer water diluting the Hill Reaction buffer. We mixed the contents of each tube and moved 1 Ml from each tube to ten cuvettes. We blanked the spectrometer at 600 nm using the micro-tube containing the “blank,” then proceeded to measure the absorbance for the following nine micro-tubes at 600 nm. This initial measurement represented absorbance at time zero. After this measurement, the ten micro-tubes were placed under direct light, and their respective absorbances were measured again at ten minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes.  All the absorbance data was collected in Microsoft Excel and the percent change (% change) between time zero and times 10, 20, and 30 were calculated respectively. For analysis, we used unpaired, one-tailed, two-sample t_tests. This test was unpaired because we were comparing two independent groups. It was one-tailed because we expected a significent change in absorbance lower than that of the controll; we were not testing for a difference in the positive and negative directions. The first t_test run compared the % change in absorbance of the controll group to the % change in absorbance of partially increased CO2 group after 30 minutes. Next, we compared the % change in absorbance of the controll group to the % change in absorbance of the highest increased CO2¬ group after 30 minutes. The last analysis compared the % change in absorbance of the partially increased CO2 group to the % change in absorbance of the highest increased CO2 group after 30 minutes. To visualize the data graphically, we used Microsoft Excel to graph the % change in absorbance for the controll group, the partially increased CO2 group, and the highest increased CO2 group, respectively.

Results:
The graph comparing the average % changes for the three groups of data had a noticeable trend. The average % change in absorbance increased from time zero to time 20 minutes for the controll group, the partially increased CO2 group, and the highest increased CO2 group. The average % change in absorbance then decreased from time 20 minutes to time 30 minutes for all three groups. The controll group had the highest average % change in absorbance from time zero to time 30 minutes (31.93%, s.d. 0.30). The partially increased CO2 group had the second highest average % change in absorbance from time zero to time 30 minutes (25.93%, s.d. 0.20), while the highest increased CO2 group had the lowest average % change in absorbance of all three groups (15.91%, s.d. 0.14). The p_value, obtained using unpaired, one-tailed, two-sample t_tests, was 0.43 comparing the % change in absorbance of the controll and partially increased CO2 groups after 30 minutes. The p_value comparing the % change in absorbance of the controll and the 2x increased CO2 groups after 30 minutes was 0.30, and for the % change in absorbance of the partially increased and 2x increased CO2 groups was p=0.17. 


Discussion:
With no p_values below 0.05, we cannot say that there was a significent difference in the decrease of photosynthetic activity in photosystem I with increased CO2 concentrations. This is not consistent with primary literature which stated “In immature leaves, the total chlorophyll content per unit dry weight and the chlorophyll a:b ratio are significently lower in plants grown at 0.10 vol% CO2. Although fully expanded mature leaves partially overcome the deficit in chlorophyll content, the chlorophyll a:b ratio remains substantially lower in these high CO2 grown plants” (Caves, Tolley, Strain, 1981). Despite these p_values, the graph showed that overall, the two experimental groups had lower decreases in absorbance over time than the experimental. Additionally, the 2x concentration CO2 group overall had the smallest decrease in absorbance of all three groups, which was consistent with our hypothesis.  Primary literature, including the two referenced above, do not discuss the biological process that results in a decreased chlorophyll concentration. One interesting trend to note is that the absorbance of all three groups actually increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. It is possible that increased CO2 concentrations alter the structure of the chlorophyll pigment molecules, or somehow signal the activation of some molecule that damages chlorophyll molecules. The effects of increased CO2 concentration appear to have decreased after 20 minutes, and could be attributed to all the CO2 being used in the inhibition or damage of chlorophyll molecules. Additionally, the standard deviations were very high for each 10 minute measurement of change in absorbance. This suggests more varying amounts of active chloroplasts in each 100ul addition of enriched kale chloroplasts to the tubes. This could also contribute to the relatively high p_values that disproved our hypothesis. Because of the possible error in this study, we must support the conclusions of other studies that have strong evidence for decreased chlorophyll concentration/activity with increased CO2. This said, it is important to recognize that this does not mean photosynthetic activity is reduced overall. Despite the decreased chlorophyll concentrations, studies have shown that overall photosynthetic properties of chloroplasts increases. “The consensus of these early reviews was that increases in [CO2] will have direct and relatively immediate effects on two physiological processes in plants: (1) it increases the rate of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation; and (2) it decreases stomatal conductance” (Nowak, Ellsworth, Smith). Increased carbon assimilation leads to increased glucose production, which is physiologically beneficial for plants due to its use as energy. In a repeated study, there is major improvement to be made. Because the experiment used seltzer water, it was impossible to measure the actual increase of CO2 that was introduced to the chloroplasts. The only way to measure the amount of CO2 in each experimental group was to compare the volume of seltzer water added to the Hill reaction buffer, which still gives no indication of the actual concentration of CO2 in the chloroplast solutions. One suggestion might be to use bicarbonate ions as opposed to seltzer water, which might make it possible to calculate the relative concentrations of CO2. In relation to current increased atmospheric CO2, on could suggest that increased CO2 does not appear to have any negative effects on plants, specifically. This suggestion is primarily based on the literature that supported increased carbon assimilation, and thus glucose production, with increased CO2 concentrations.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 compares the % change in absorbance of the three different groups in the study – the controll group, the partially increased CO2 concentration group, and the highest increased CO2 concentration group. Error bars show the standard deviation, which is clearly high based on the graph. The main general trend is that all three groups showed an increase in absorbance from 20 minutes to 30 minutes.
