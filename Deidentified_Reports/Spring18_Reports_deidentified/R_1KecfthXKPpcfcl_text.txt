Title: The Effects of Dibutrylyl cAMP and Curcumin on Protein Kinase A Activity in Physarum

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to measure the effects on Dibutrylyl cAMP and Curcumin on the Protein Kinase A activity of Physarum, a common slime mold. Because of its simple structure and similarity to the signal transduction pathways of other simple organisms, this test gives insight into how these other organisms react to stimuli. By soaking water agar plates with the two test compounds, and watching the growth of the Physarum over a 24 hour period, it was concluded that Dibutrylyl cAMP activated PKA within the physarum, allowing it to grow towards the food source, while Curcumin inhibited PKA within the physarum, evident by its growth away from the food source. The student t_test was used for both test compounds to support the significance of the results, and it was found that only the results for the Dibutrylyl cAMP were significent. Possible error in the controll samples could include inaccurate preparation of one controll water agar plate, as one of the controll plates displayed a migration distance much greater than the other two controll plates. 


Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways allow for cells to respond to both the external and internal environments. These pathways are well represented by Physarum polycephalum (Physarum), a single-celled slime mold that can react to various stimuli by chemotaxis, or the ability of the cell to sense nearby molecules and travel towards or away from them based on stimuli. Because of the basic nature of Physarum, we are able to use its simple mechanism to study its behaviors in response to environmental stimuli. In a study by Alimab et al., Physarum was tested as a “novel model used to explore emergent dynamics”[Alimab et al. 2017]. By tracking the mechanism of signal transduction, it was concluded that despite its simple and small size, Physarum is still able to find the shortest route between food sources using a combination of fluid flows and signaling molecules. The slime mold can ideally be used to provide insight into the behaviors of similar organisms [Alimab et al. 2017]. 
This experiment specifically focused on the effects of Dibutrylyl cAMP and Curcumin on the growth of a Physarum sample over a 24 hour period. These substances target Protein Kinase A, which is integral to the signal transduction pathway that occurs in the Physarum. Dibutryl-cAMP has been found to activate Protein Kinase A while Curcumin has been found to inhibit Protein Kinase A. In an experiment by Reddy and Aggarwal, Curcumin inhibition was tested on various types of Protein Kinase in tumor cells, including Protein Kinase A, which could be responsible for the inhibition of tumor initiation and promotion [Reddy and Aggarwal 1994]. Applying this logic to our experiment, it was hypothesized that the water agar plates treated with Curcumin would exhibit little to no growth towards the food source, and plates treated with Dibutrylyl cAMP would exhibit growth towards the food source. 


Materials and Method:
Nine water agar plates—three for the controll, three for the Curcumin, and three for the Dibutryl cAMP—were each soaked for 10 minutes with the respective 20X diluted test compound (except for the controll), from which two squares were cut from each. Oatmeal, the food source, was placed in one square on each plate, and a sample of Physarum was placed in the other. Each plate was wrapped in aluminum foil, taped, and labeled with the test compound and group name. A 24 hour incubation period allowed the Physarum to grow based on the unique conditions of each plate. The average distance traveled by the Physarum over this period was measured with a ruler, and the direction of the growth was noted as well. A two sample T-test was performed for the test compounds. 


Results:
Our gathered data shows that the Physarum traveled the furthest in the water agar plates treated with Dibutrylyl cAMP, with an average of 36.3 mm (t_stat=2.86, d.f.=4, P=0.046) between the three samples, most commonly towards the food source. Curcumin plates exhibited an average distance of migration slightly lower at 30.7 mm (t_stat=1.91, d.f.=4, P=0.129) between three samples, most commonly away from the food. In the controll plates, the average distance of migration was 9.3 mm away from the food source, despite two controll plates displaying a Physarum migration distance of 0 mm. 


Discussion:
As expected from our initial hypothesis, the water agar plates treated with Dibutrylyl cAMP experienced growth towards the food source and plates treated with Curcumin showed growth away from the food source. A P value of 0.046 for the Dibutrylyl cAMP samples makes these results significent. This data supports Dibutrylyl cAMP as an effective activator of Protein Kinase A in Physarum, while Curcumin is not an effective inhibitor of Protein Kinase A in Physarum. A study by Atmar et al. specifically aimed to activate a polyamine dependent pathway in the nuclei of the Physarum that also involved a Protein Kinase. The polyamines spermidine and spermine were found to activate Protein Kinase acitivity in Physarum through a similar mechanism as Dibutrylyl cAMP [Atmar et al. 1981]. 
Possible error in one of the controll plates, in which the Physarum grew 28 mm away from the food source, could have been the accidental addition of Curcumin to the plate by failure to sterilize the forceps or spatulas properly before using them on this particular controll plate. This could also be due to an inconsistency in the preparation of the water agar plate, which was supposed to contain 2 Ml of water and 18 Ml of melted agar (2% water agar). This outlier in the controll samples is evident by a standard deviation of 16.2 mm between the three controll plates, as the other two controll plates did not indicate any migration of the Physarum at all. 
Physarum’s ability to serve as a model for other organisms of its size and complexity, evident in the study titled “Mechanism of signal propagation in Physarum polycephalum,” acts as grounds for future experiments that incorporate other inhibitors and activators, perhaps ones that act on other molecules important to the signal transduction pathway in Physarum [Alimab et al. 2017].
