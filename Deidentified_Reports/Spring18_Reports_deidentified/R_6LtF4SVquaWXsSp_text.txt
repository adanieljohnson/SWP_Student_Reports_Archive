Title: Effect of Ecdysterone Blockers on the  Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment examined the effect of Ecdysterone hormone blockers on the weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. Manduca Sexta's have two main hormones in their bodies, Juvenile Hormone, which is more prominent from birth to the fifth in-star larva stage, and Ecdysterone, which is more prominent from the fifth in-star larva stage and throughout adulthood. We hypothesize that the addition of Ecdysterone hormone blockers will cause a significent decrease in the weight of the caterpillars receiving the treatment compared to those not. Four experimental Manduca Sexta's received seven drops of AZA Guard: 20E Blocker in each of their 10g of food. Another group of four controll caterpillars received seven drops of DI water in each of their 10g of food. The caterpillars were weighed every day for a total of eight days. Results include a 2 Sample T-Test and comparisons of the average growth and means of each group, deviations included. The hypothesis was supported by this experiment; the Caterpillars in the experimental group were significently smaller than those in the controll group because the Ecdysterone Blockers did not allow a commitment pulse to take place therefore not allowing the Manduca Sexta's to grow to an appropriate size and store enough nutrients to partake in metamorphosis.

Introduction:
Hormones are substances found in organisms that allow different bodily processes to take place. Alternating hormones has shown to alter the bodily regulations of certain organisms. In a case study done on Linden Bugs, an insect growth regulator (IGR) was shown to lower egg hatch rates and decrease the maturation process into adults of all bugs that the IGR came into contact with. The IGR present was Juvabione, a substance present in the paper towels used during the experiment (Tunaz, 2004). We tested our own IGR on a different organism: the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta has two main hormones of its own: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone. In the beginning of a Manduca Sexta's life, up until about the fifth instar larva stage, JH levels are high, while besides a few pulses early on in a Manduca Sexta's life, ecdysterone levels are high from that fifth instar larva stage, to the full grown adult stage. I hypothesize that if we administer ecdysterone (E20) blockers to the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, there will be a significent decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sextas with the 20E blockers, compared to those without it in a given period of time.

Materials and Method:
Select eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars and divide them into two groups, an experimental group and a controll group. Gather four, round, clear plastic containers and place an index card horizontally across the container, separating the container in half. Tape the index card into place by folding the edges approximately 1 cm in. Label each "half" of the container by identifying each caterpillar (number, letter, name etc.) and whether the caterpillar is controll or experimental. Pair the controll caterpillars together, and the experimental caterpillars together to limit cross contamination of food. Weigh out eighty grams of caterpillar food: ten grams for each caterpillar. Stir the food well with a clean metal spoon. From the eighty grams of food, separately measure ten grams for each caterpillar, and place on each side of the index cards in the containers. With a clean transfer pipette, add exactly seven drops of DI water to the CONTROL caterpillar's food. With a new and clean transfer pipette, add exactly seven drops of AZA Guard: 20E Blocker to the EXPERIEMENTAL caterpillar's food (the original ratio of AZA Guard: 1-part AZA Guard to 1250-parts of deionized water). Once added, stir both very well with a new and clean metal spoon to ensure blocker and water are evenly distributed throughout the food. Obtain caterpillars and weigh each separately on a scale. Record beginning weight and visual observations and place each caterpillar in desired section of the containers. Cap the containers and store in an incubator that allows for constant temperature and light for each organism. Every day for one week, record the weight and visual observations of each caterpillar. If, throughout the week, the caterpillar's food appears to be less than half, repeat the process above and give each Manduca Sexta ten more grams of food with the appropriate dilution of water or 20E blocker. Run a 2-Sample T-Test to compare the means from the experimental group to the controll group. The p value indicates the chance that the results were all from chance. 

Results:
Over the course of the eight days the experiment took place, the controll group caterpillars weighed significently more than the experimental caterpillars. They saw a greater change in weight as well. The average weight for the experimental caterpillars on day one was 0.99g with a standard deviation of 0.21g, while on day eight it was 1.74g with a standard deviation of 0.62g. The average weight for the controll caterpillars on day one was 1.28g with a standard deviation of 0.17g, while on day eight it was 9.06g with a standard deviation of 0.79g. Through the Two Sample T-Test, we were able to find the mean of the controll group to be 1.74 and the mean for the experimental group to be 9.06. The variance for the controll group was 0.38, while for the treatment group it was 0.62. The observations value for both groups was found to be 4.00. For the controll group, the hypothesized mean difference was found to be 0.00, the t Stat was found to be -14.63, and the d.f. was found to be 6.00. Also, for the controll group, the P (T<=t) one-tail value was found to be 3.20 x 10-6, the t Critical one-tail was 1.94, the P (T<=t) two-tail was 6.41 x 10-6, and the t Critical two-tail was found to be 2.45. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported by this experiment; I stated that if we administer ecdysterone (E20) blockers to the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, there will be a significent decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta with the E20 blockers, compared to those without it in a given period of time, and that is exactly what happened. The ecdysterone blockers did exactly what the name implies: they ceased the release of ecdysterone from the Manduca Sexta's hormone secretors. Throughout a Manduca Sexta's life, from birth to the fifth instar larvae stage, Juvenile Hormone levels are high, while ecdysterone levels are found to be low. However, there are sections of time during this period where ecdysterone levels spike extremely high, and become higher than the release of Juvenile Hormone, these are called Ecdysterone pulses. The most significent Ecdysterone pulse to a Manduca Sexta's life cycle happens during the fifth instar larva stage; it is called the Commitment Pulse. The commitment pulse occurs when a Manduca Sexta caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate into a normal size moth. The commitment pulse signals a series of changes that start metamorphosis including behavioral, genetic, morphological, and physiological changes. By supplying our experimental Manduca Sexta Caterpillars with E20 Blockers, we cut off the Ecdysterone levels which allowed the continual release of Juvenile Hormone, with no Ecdysterone pulses, including the commitment pulse, taking place. The absence of the commitment pulse prevented the caterpillar's hormones to be able to signal whether or not it is of capable size and health to continue through metamorphosis. The excess levels of Juvenile Hormone signaled the Manduca Sexta's bodies to continue to grow into the next stages of instar larva, even if they were at the appropriate fifth instar stage. The controll Manduca Sexta's did not have the alteration and therefore were able to properly signal whether or not they were ready to start the transformation into metamorphosis. The controll Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were significently larger and grew significently more. This can be shown in Figure 1. with the average mass of the experimental caterpillars on day one being 0.99g with a standard deviation of 0.21g, while on day eight it was 1.74g with a standard deviation of 0.62g. The average weight for the controll caterpillars on day one was 1.28g with a standard deviation of 0.17g, while on day eight it was 9.06g with a standard deviation of 0.79g. Through the Two Sample T-Test, we were able to find the P (T<=t) one-tail value for the controll group to be 3.20 x 10-6, and the P (T<=t) two-tail to be 6.41 x 10-6. These are great values that validate our statistics and results by verifying a very little oppritunity for chance to occur. The controll Manduca Sexta caterpillars were larger because their hormones, (specifically the Ecdysterone commitment pulse), were signaling that they were getting toward the end of the fifth instar larva stage, and nearer to metamorphosis. They were then able to continue to grow to a substantial size, and store ample nutrients to be able to make the necessary biological change, explaining the substantial weight difference between the controll and the experimental groups. As shown here, and in the Linden Bug study mentioned previously, altering an organism's hormones may affect its growth and/or bodily regulations. The Linden Bug study displayed how alternating one of a Linden bug's main hormones caused them to have significently less egg hatch rates and decrease the rate of the maturation process into adults. (Tunaz, 2004). This shows how vitally important hormone levels and the specific timings of those hormone levels are to each individual species' progression of life. Each stage of the life cycle an organism goes through relies on the proper releasing of hormones in the body. Altering these hormones can have a drastic, and sometimes even a deadly effect on organisms.
