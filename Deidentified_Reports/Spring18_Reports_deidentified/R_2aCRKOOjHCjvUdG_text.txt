Title: Effect of Fish Decoy Authenticity on Aggression Levels in Betta splendins  

Abstract:
Our study analyzed the effect of fish authenticity on aggression levels. I hypothesized that the more authentic the fish the more aggression would be shown. In order to test this, we imposed a fish to an unauthentic and authentic betta fish decoy and a live fish in 5 minute intervals with 5 minute rest periods. We separated them in an aquarium with a glass and an opaque white wall.  We used an one-way ANOVA test to test the significance (p=.051), proving the results insignificent. My hypothesis was not supported and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected; although there was a trend in the average of length and weight root to shoot ratios being smaller, through an ANOVA test, the results proved insignificent.

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is important in understanding the world as an animal sees it to try and explore the evolutionary basis for their behavior. Betta splendins, betta fish, have been bred into domesticity, increasing bright colors and aggression levels. There are two types of intraspecific (between bettas) aggression displays, also known as agnostic responses: broadside movements (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) and facing movements (erect pectoral fins, spreading gills/ covering opercula, protrude branchiostegal membrane). The other fish can respond to these agnostic behaviors with four possible responses: ignore it, match it, flee, or escalate. 
Serra, Wolkers, Mello, Urbinati’s (2016) experiment measured the effect of the imposition a mirror on aggression levels in B. amazonicus fish. They measured aggression in latency, bites, rushes, locomotion, plasma glucose, and serum cortisol and compared them between the winning fish and the losing fish. The results showed that escalation of aggressive behaviors was similar in real and mirror trials, although the magnitude was smaller against a mirror. On the other hand, number of rushes, locomotion, and glucose levels after the fight against a mirror were significently lower. The results showed that the absence of an opponent that flees from an attack causes a lower fight cost in terms of energy mobilization. This study helped me form my hypothesis that in the presence of fish decoys the aggressive response would be minimal.
In this lab, we will be looking at the effect of fish decoys authenticity on betta fish aggression levels. I hypothesize that that the more realistic the fish the more aggression will be shown. This has a biological importance because fish ability to analyze whether or not something is a threat allows them to conserve their energy.  


Materials and Method:
We subjected betta fish to three different experimental treatments: an unauthentic decoy, an authentic fish decoy, and a real fish. The unauthentic decoy, fake fish 1, was a cut out of a red foam paper in the shape of a betta with drawn on lines to represent tail. On the other hand, the authentic fish decoy, fake fish 2 was a red metal fish with scaly texture and a movable tail. The fish were separated into three compartments of an aquarium by a glass wall and an opaque white wall. We then would pull up one of the white opaque walls, revealing the fish to the other. We observed its behavioral responses for a period of 5 minute intervals. Our trials were repeated 3 times per experimental group. Our objective scaling was based off of a point system: 1 point was given for pelvic flickering, 2 points for an erect pectoral fin, 3 points for tail beating, 4 for spread gills, 5 for tail flashing, and 6 for red mane. 
The same people observed the fish each time while another tallied the points they called out to minimize bias. Using excel we employed a one-way ANOVA test in order to identify a potential significance in the difference in the number of points of aggressive behavior observed of the betta fish in the presence of the three different variables.


Results:
As seen in figures 1, the average betta fish aggression level for fake fish 1 was 1.33±.1, and the average mean for fake fish 2 was 0±0. On the other hand, the mean aggression level when in the presence of an actual betta fish was 58.67±1. Our ANOVA test followed by a Tuckey Kramer test suggested that there was not a significent difference between the aggression displays in the presence of fake fish 1, fake fish 2, and the real betta [F (2, 6)= 5.095, p=0.051]. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was not supported that there would be a difference between the mean aggression levels for a fish exposed to an unauthentic and authentic fish decoy and a live fish. With our p value of .051, our data proved insignificent, but if one more aggressive behavior was noted, this would not be the case. Even though my hypothesis was not supported, there was a drastic difference between the aggression levels shown in the presence of the decoys and those shown in the presence of a live fish, suggesting that there is some biological importance in being able to identify the authenticity of a fish and analyzing its potential danger. It's a way to conserve energy. A possible reason for this insignificance in our data could be that the fish tested habituated to the lab environment. To avoid this problem in the future, we could use fish that have not been exposed to experimental design.
In Alyan’s experiment Male Betta splendins are equally aggressive toward neighbors and strangers (2010), we can see that male Siamese fish reacted similarly to familiar and stranger males. Like our experiment, a male betta fish, the familiar fish, was placed into an aquarium separated from another male betta fish. Then, another male betta fish, the stranger fish, was placed in a small glass jar in the corner of the other side of the aquarium. After 24 hours, the glass wall was removed. This experimental design was set up to show a lack of dear enemy effect. Possible explanations for this behavior are an inability to discriminate between neighboring males and non-neighboring males. Males could be equally aggressive to all intruders because they all can produce equal danger. Overall, there is a biological importance of fighting competition for resources such as food, territory, and mates.
