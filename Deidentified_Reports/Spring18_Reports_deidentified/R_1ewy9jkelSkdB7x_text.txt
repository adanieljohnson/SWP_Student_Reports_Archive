Title: Effect of ACH-Esterase Inhibitor on the Contractile Process of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana Pipiens.

Abstract:
Six frog legs of Rana pipiens were used to determine the effect of Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitor (ACH inhibitor), on the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. It was hypothesised that the  ACH inhibitor would lower the threshold in the frog leg andbthe amplitude for the frog leg would increase. Each frog leg was dissected, and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated from the rest of the leg. The contraction of the muscle was recorded through the use of a myogram. The siatic nerve was stimulated, which caused the sarcomere in the frog leg contract. ACE esterase inhibitor was injected into the leg. The siatic nerve was stimulated after treatment, and the amplitude and threshold were measured. The observations for the first two frog legs of Rana pipiens contradicted the original hypothesis, as both variables—the threshold and amplitude— decreased for the first two muscles. On the other hand, the third frog leg showed an increased threshold with a higher amplitude, unlike the first two legs. Also, a two-tailed t test yielded P-values of 0.6 and 0.8. When considering the high p-value alongside observations, it can not  be said with certainty the ACH inhibitor lowered the threshold or increased the amplitude in the legs of Rana pipiens .

Introduction:
In the terminal button of a neuron at the neuromuscular junction, an action potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, which allow calcium to enter the terminal button and hyperpolarize it. As a result, vesicles containing ACH bind to the membrane of the terminal button, releasing ACH into the synaptic cleft. The ACH then binds to ligand-gated sodium channels on the muscle membrane, causing them to open and allow sodium to enter through the membrane. (Legay C: 2018) This causes an action potential to travel down the muscle membrane into T-tubules, which contain DHP receptors. As a result, the DHP receptors open and allow calcium to enter the sarcoplasm. (Methfessel C: 1986) After calcium is released into the sarcoplasm, in short, the sarcomere shortens which constitutes a muscle contraction. After the muscle is finished contracting, ACH is released from the ligand-gated sodium channels back into the synaptic cleft. (Legay C: 2018) The ACH is removed from the synaptic cleft by ACH-Esterase, which removes ACH-Esterase from the synaptic cleft and recycles it into acetate and choline. The acetate and choline is then reabsorbed back into the terminal button to be used again as ACH. (Methfessel C : 1986) Frog legs of Rana pipiens were used in this procedure, as they contain skeletal muscle that functions in the manner described above. An ACH-Esterase inhibitor inhibits the function of ACH-Esterase. (Legay C: 2018) By using and ACH-Esterase inhibitor, ACH will not be released from the synaptic cleft. As a result, ACH will continue to bind to ACH receptor sites on the ligand-gated sodium channels and calcium will remain in the synaptic cleft. This will eventually result in a lower threshold for an action potential in the motor end plate of the frog leg. Also, the amplitude for the frog leg will increase as a result of this lower threshold.

Materials and Methods:
The amplitude and threshold were measured for three frog legs of Rana pipiens , while only the threshold was measured for two legs performing a similar procedure.  Each leg was skinned, and the sciatic nerve was dissected from the leg until it became visible. Scissors were placed between the gastrocnemius muscle and the thigh in order to separate them. After cutting the Achilles tendon, a string is tied to the end of the Achilles, which was connected to the gastrocnemius muscle. The other side of the string was attached to a transducer, which is suspended above the frog leg by an apparatus. The string was kept at a high tension while still keeping the frog leg on the ground. Two electrodes were then placed along the sciatic nerve. It was imperative that the two electrodes did not touch each other. The muscle was pinned down, and the gastrocnemius muscle is suspended by a string attached to the transducer. The probes were taped to the tray containing the frog leg in order to prevent the probes from touching each other or from sliding off the siatic nerve. The muscle was connected to a force transducer and that measured the contraction of the frog leg. Each leg was attached to the probes for testing in order. Then, 0.1mL of ACE esterase inhibitor was injected into each leg, and three minutes elapsed before any further stimulation was performed. Also, a small amount of ACE inhibitor was injected directly into the siatic nerve. Upon waiting, the threshold and amplitude were again measured via the electrodes stimulating the siatic verve. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the legs that were not treated to the legs that were treated with ACH esterase inhibitor.

Results:
After the AChE inhibitor was injected into the frog legs, the thresholds of two frog legs of Rana pipiens decreased while the amplitude of contraction was higher than previously recorded. For the first leg, the threshold decreased by 0.08 Volts. The threshold for the second frog leg decreased by .10 volts. For the third frog leg, the threshold increased by .01 Volts. When observing the amplitudes of all three legs, similar patterns were observed. The average amplitude of contraction for the first leg decreased by an average of 0.1546 volts, the second leg decreased by .0854 volts, while the third leg decreased by .1202 volts. In addition to the values for these three legs, the threshold was recorded for two additional legs. The first leg in the decreased by .05 volts after injection of the ACH esterase inhibitor, while the second leg decreased in threshold by .05 volts after injection. After a two-sample t test was performed to compare the frog legs of Rana pipiens  that were treated with ACH esterase inhibitor to the legs that were  was not treated, a p-value of 0.8 was calculated for the frog legs of Rana pipiens before being treated, while a p-value of 0.6 was calculated for the frog legs of Rana pipiens treated with ACH esterase inhibitor.

Discussion:
The Presence of ACH inhibitor influenced the threshold of the frog legs of Rana pipiens because it inhibited the ACH esterase in the synaptic cleft. As a result, the thresholds and amplitudes changed both positively and negatively. This is not consistent with the initial expectation that the amplitude would increase, as the amplitude of contraction decreased after the injection of ACH esterase inhibitor for all three frog legs. Although the amplitude did not increase for two frog legs, the expected result did occur in one frog leg. In this leg, results show that upon stimulating the siatic nerve, the threshold decreased during the refractory period, which made it easier for an action potential to arise and stimulate the muscle to contract. As a result, the muscle contracted. The opposite effect was observed in the other two frog legs, where the threshold increased. As a result, these two frog legs of Rana pipiens could not contract. The observations recorded during this procedure do not confirm the hypothesis of this procedure, mainly because of the vast variability of the results when compared to the hypothesis. With this in mind, the data recorded for this procedure cannot confirm the hypothesis, that the addition of ACH esterase inhibitor will decrease the threshold of the sarcomeres in frog skeletal muscle. The main reason for this being that the threshold actually increased for two frog legs, while the expected result occurred in the third frog leg. With this inconsistency in mind, it would only be safe to confirm that the hypothesis—that ACH esterase inhibitor will lower the threshold— is not correct for this procedure. Furthermore, with a p-value of 0.6 for the treated legs and a p-value of 0.8 for the legs before being treated, the hypothesis is not supported.
