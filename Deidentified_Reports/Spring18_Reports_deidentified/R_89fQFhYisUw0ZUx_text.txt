Title: The Effect on the Growth of the Manduca sexta using 20E Blockers

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is an insect whose growth is highly effected by its levels of hormones such as Ecdysterone(20E) and Juvenile hormone. These hormones inform the insect when it’s time to go from larva to pupal and on to being an adult. In order to analyze this statement, we inputted 20E blockers into the food of 4 different caterpillars. We then compared the growth of these 4 caterpillars to the normal growth of 4 untouched caterpillars over the course of eight days to see the effects. We found that yes there was a significent difference between the growth of the controll and treatment groups used, resulting in the treatment group not growing nearly as much as the controll. The overall growth of the controll group was statistically different than that of the treatment group (t stat = -14.63, d.f.=6, P = 6.4072E x 10-6). This supported our hypothesis that the 20E blocker would highly effect the production of 20E in the caterpillar and slow its growth. 

Introduction:
The growth of an insect is heavily dependent on the hormone levels in the body. An insect goes through different life stages in order to get to its full-grown state and hormones have a large influence on how long this process occurs. The Manduca sexta goes through what is called a Holometabolous life cycle meaning it has four major stages; egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, adult. In order to get to a full-grown adult, the Manduca sexta relies on the use of two major hormones; Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone (20E). The Juvenile hormone determines what type of molt (the change from larvae to pupa) occurs. 20E determines the timing of the molt. Together they help the Manduca sexta properly change from a 5th instar larvae to a pupa. If the levels of hormones are manipulated it will affect the molt of the caterpillar. A study was done on a similar insect to the Manduca sexta called the Linden bug (Pyrrhocoris apterus L.), that analyzed the effect of “Insect growth regulators” on the lives of the bug. The study found that in response to being in an environment where insect growth hormone was present the Linden bug had a harder time maturing and reproducing (Tunaz: 2004). This lead to the use of insect growth inhibitor as an insecticide because they can “interfere with or over-activate processes regulated by the insect hormones (i.e. JHs, ecdysteroids)” (Tunaz: 2004).  In this experiment, we will be exploring the connection between 20E and the growth of the Manduca sexta. We will be using 20E blocker to stop production of 20E during the insect growth from larvae to pupa. We hypothesize that because the production of 20E will be blocked it will take longer for the insect to reach the pupal stage and adulthood.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we used 8 caterpillars. We took 4 round plastic containers and used index cars and tape to split the containers into separate homes for each caterpillar. We weighed out 80 grams of food for the caterpillars. We separated it into 8 sets of 10 grams of food each. For 4 sets of 10g of food we used a transfer pipet to add 7 drops of the 20E blocker, AZA Guard, with 1 part 20E blocker to 1250 parts deionized water. For the other 4 sets we added, also with a transfer pipet, 7 drops of water to each. We mixed each set until the food looked smooth. We then weighed each caterpillar before placing them inside the container and shut it with a perforated lid. The caterpillars were then placed in an incubator overnight. For eight days we came in and recorded the weight of each caterpillar. In order to analyze the data collected we used a 2 sample T test. 

Results:
The average change of the controll group was statistically different than that of the treatment group (t stat = -14.63, d.f.=6, P = 6.4072E x 10-6). From table 2 we know both test groups resulted in an overall increase in weight. From figure 1 we can see how the overall change in weight was significently higher in the controll group than in the treatment group. 

Discussion:
Ecdysterone (20E), like other insect hormones, are the main factors in insect growth. 20E along with juvenile hormone are the main hormones in the regulation of the growth of a Manduca sexta. Without 20E the timing of the Manduca sexta’s change from larvae to pupal would be skewed and it may not reach adulthood. This experiment tested the effect of 20E blockers on the growth of the Manduca Sexta and compared it to the regular untouched growth of Manduca sexta. According to our data represented by the bar graph in figure 1 our hypothesis is supported in that the untouched caterpillars grew much faster and bigger than the ones where 20E was added to their food. This means that our experiment supports the thought that 20E can have a sizeable effect on growth timing of a Manduca sexta. It also further supports the Linden bug report which found a connection between the reproduction and life span of bugs that were exposed to Insect Growth Regulators which inhibited the production of certain hormones in the bugs. Both the Manduca sexta and the Linden bug are what are commonly called pests. But, from what we have learned from this lab and through the Linden bug experiment is that these pests can in some way be regulated and contained by use of insect growth hormone (Tunaz: 2004). By using insect growth hormone in insecticides or pesticides it could potentially help lower the total number of pests in the world.
