Title: E20 Inhibition and the Developmental Cycle of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Growth and development of manduca sexta is primarily governed by two hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Through a mechanism based on concentration ratios, the two hormones alternate in spikes at key stages of development.Using azamax, the study inhibits ecdysone via azamax ingested by the larvae to measure the effects of the absence of ecdysone and larval development. The experimental group was found to be significantly smaller as an overall population; therefore, we can concluded that, at least in early stages, ecdysone is necessary to initiate and promote growth (i.e. molting) from one larval stage to the next.


Introduction:
The hormonal pathways that regulate the development of the tobacco hornworm are well documented and understood. Two hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and and ecdysone (E20), govern life cycle development which is dependent upon relative concentration ratios (Johnson 2016). Given our understanding of the nature of hormones and their functions, this study attempts to understand the specific function of the hormone E20 in governing the manduca sexta life cycle. Schwartz and Truman (1983) found that in the first three stages of larval development of manduca sexta, E20 promotes growth and development; however, after the third stage, E20 becomes inhibitory in nature (Schwartz and Truman). Therefore, the inhibition of E20 during the first three larval stages should inhibit development and prevent the larvae from developing normally (retarded growth).

Procedures
First, eight larvae were selected and divided into two groups, experimental and control. The two groups were separated into separate rearing containers and kept in the same incubator. Each day, both groups were fed. The control diet consisted of ten grams of food per larva with seven drops of water per ten grams of food. The experimental diet is the same with seven drops of aza max substituted for the seven drops of water. At each feeding, the larvae were weighed. At the end, a mean was calculated for the control and experimental groups and a two sample t- test was used to evaluate the significance of the E20 inhibitor.


Results:
 As demonstrated by the the figures above, on average the control group grew bigger and faster than the experimental group with the notable exceptions of control 2 and experimental 4. The mean weight table (figure 3) was used for a two sample t test. The t test returned a t value of 2.48884 and a p value of .013001; thus, these results are significant.


Discussion:
Given the significance of the findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the delayed growth of the experiment group was due to the E20 inhibition and the alternate hypothesis is supported by the data. Given the finding of Schwartz and Truman (1983), this would indicate that E20 is necessary for early larval development. In the data, it is necessary to note that the mean weight table (figure 3) is calculated without the data from control two and experiment four because there is incomplete data for experiment four and control two is such an outlier that it would impact the results. Ultimately, this suggests further study of the mechanisms of E20 that initiate cellular growth responses.
