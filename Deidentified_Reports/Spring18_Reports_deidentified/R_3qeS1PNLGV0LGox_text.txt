Title: Raphanus raphanistrum move to Aruba as they discover sand does not impact resource allocation.

Abstract:
In this lab we took a look at resource allocation.  We hypothesized that plants grown in sand would allocate more resources for root growth resulting in a higher root:shoot.  We tested this by measuring weight and length of plants in different growing mediums.  Plants were grown in sand and soil respectively for two weeks then measured and root:shoot were determined.  This hypothesis was rejected as we found that there was no large difference between the two mediums in terms of weight and length of the plants.  It was concluded that if a plant has all of the abiotic factors needed, it will not allocate additional resources no matter where it is growing.


Introduction:
Biotic and abiotic factors impact everything in a plant’s life.  Biotic interactions shape the community, whereas abiotic factors dictate much more.  Sunlight, nitrogen, water, and other nutrients are limited and vary environment to environment. Resource limitation encapsules trade-offs and resource allocation.  Selective pressure leads species to make trade-offs and expend more resources or energy on a specific life history or structural growth.  To do this, though, the plant must cut back on resources or energy to other sections of itself.  Resource allocation is that pattern in with the species uses its limited resources.  As Johnson wrote, allocation is genetically determined, however it is not completely fixed [Johnson:2006].  Plasticity also is a determinant in how well the species can adapt and survive when their resources are limited.  Plants will vary how they allocate resources between their different parts, depending on what is limited.  Leaves are the main photosynthetic organ and when allocation is increased, so is the growth rate.  Stems support the shoot structure, are involved in light capture, and they compete by lifting leaves.  Roots are the sole absorptive organ and anchor the plant. Bazzaz found that allocation maximizes fecundity and the plant’s fitness throughout its lifetime [Bazzaz:1997].  In terms of our experiment, we looked at resource allocation in the form of root to shoot ratios in Raphanus raphanistrum.  Soil and sand were the two growing mediums used.  Soil is made from clay, sand, and silt.  It absorbs water well and holds in nutrients without them being flushed out quickly.  Sand, on the other hand, does not retain water or nutrients.  It was expected that the Raphanus raphanistrum grown in sand would have a higher root:shoot than that in soil due to a limited amount of water.  Since the roots are responsible for absorbing water, resources must be allocated to them in order to grow and absorb a larger amount of water. The Raphanus raphanistrum in soil would not have to allocate resources because they are getting proper nutrients and amounts of water.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment we tested two groups.  Three Raphanus raphanistrum plants were put into soil with an additional 10-15 Raphanus raphanistrum seeds, and the same was replicated for sand.  Miracle grow was placed on each condition for an equal chance at nutrients.  The two conditions were placed inside a greenhouse under the same sunlight conditions.  Everyday for two weeks the plants were watered with tap water, then we harvested the plants to measure root:shoot.  The ten plants from each condition were weighed together then cut at the root shoot junction.  The shoots were then all weighed together then subtracted from the total to determine the root weight.  Then, the root:shoot weight ratio was determined and recorded.  The longest root and shoot in each condition was measured in centimeters and then the root:shoot length ratio was determined.


Results:
The difference in the root:shoot wight and length ratios is not that notable.  The sand root:soot weight mean is 0.33±0.068 with the soil root:shoot weight mean is 0.37±0.034.  The root:shoot length means are as follows: sand is 1.14±0.51 and the soil is 1.33±0.11. The t-value for weight is -0.95072. The p-value is .197793. The result is not significant at p &lt; .05.  For length, the t-value is -0.64955 and the p-value is .2757. The result is not significant at p &lt; .05.  Between the two conditions the weight and length means were not far enough from each other to notice allocation differences, as shown in Figure 1.


Discussion:
Although we expected the root:shoot ratios for sand to be greater than that of soil, that is not what we found.  Our hypothesis was rejected.  There was no vast difference between root:shoot weight and length ratios between the different mediums, the weight difference was merely 0.04 and the length difference was merely 0.14.  This is interesting because in dry climates with little water plants tend to grow deep roots to access more water.  Even though the sand does not absorb water and nutrients, rather they drain right through the sand, the roots did not need to allocate resources to grow deeper, longer roots. This could be due to our own errors.  Since the sand was watered daily and kept in a container it might not had the proper amount of time to drain as it does in nature.  Therefore, the water and nutrients were readily available for the plant.  Contrastly, the soil is what we expected.  The similar weights and lengths between the root and the shoot explains that they got the proper nutrients from the soil.  This improves understanding of resource allocation by allowing us to see that if all the abiotic factors are present, the specific growing medium is not relevant.  The plants will not allocate resources if they do not need to.  In Dou’s paper on the effect of substrate on biomass allocation in Oryza rufipogon, they found similar results to our lab.  They tested sand and clay differences and saw little difference [Dou:2010].
