Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine Injections on Twitch Threshold and Twitch Amplitude in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania Pipiens 

Abstract:
Muscular stimulation post death is often achieved by creating a voltage differential through the addition of ions such as salt or through electrical current, however theoretically calcium release could be triggered through the application of acetylcholine to the neuromuscular junction. This study sought to investigate the effect of injecting acetylcholine on twitch threshold, amplitude and the change in amplitude over various amperages. Two legs were prepared, tested at various amperages, and injected with acetyl choline before being tested again. The data provided inconclusive evidence that acetylcholine had any effect on twitch threshold or twitch amplitude. More trials are recommended for future trials. 

Introduction:
Muscle tissue consists of myofibril bundles bound within a nucleated sheathe and powered by the binding and subsequent rearrangement of myosin filaments. Myosin bound to ADP binds to actin once the myosin binding sites are exposed by the binding of calcium to tropomyosin. Calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs once acetylcholine is received from the neuromuscular junction by the nicotinic receptors (Merlie: 1978). While typically muscle stimulation post death is accomplished through creating a voltage difference through ionization such as salt or electricity, theoretically muscle stimulation could be achieved or enhanced by the application of external acetyl choline. The pathway of acetylcholine requires acetylcholine to be applied to the neuromuscular junction in small amounts to trigger a response. Excess acetylcholine inhibits muscle contractions. In enervated muscle fibers, acetylcholine receptors are located only in the neuromuscular junction, meaning that acetylcholine has no effect on muscle performance elsewhere. (Merlie 1978). The strength of muscle contractions is measured through a myogram, which measures the current generated by the muscle contraction in terms of voltage. Stronger contractions are often a result an increased voltage being applied to the muscle, resulting in more force, and a greater current observed by the myogram.


Materials and Method:
Before beginning the lab, ensure that the following are available: A specimen of Rania Pipiens, a dissecting tray and necessary components, a machine capable of creating electrical shocks and reading them as a myogram, at least 10 Ml of 10mg/Ml acetycholine/water solution, a hypodermic needle, and a computer capable of recording and displaying myograms.
Begin by obtaining a pair of Rania Pipiens legs from the same specimen of R Pipiens. Prepare them for contraction analysis by degloving them and then exposing the sciatic nerve. Next separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the leg at the angle and raise it by tying it with string. Apply the silver wire to the underside of the sciatic nerve. For both legs, find the twitch threshold and record the amplitude. Set the amperage to 1 A and test for the amplitude. Repeat at amperages 2,3,4, and 5 A. Once done, inject a mixture of 10mg/Ml acetylcholine/water solution into the middle of the muscle and wait 10 minutes. After doing so, repeat finding the twitch threshold, and measuring the amplitude at 1,2,3,4, and 5 amps. Test for significance using a 2 figure T test.


Results:
Twitch threshold either increased by .1 or decreased by .6 A depending on the leg after injection. In leg one, the effect of injection of acetylcholine on amplitude had a P value of .2382 and was deemed statistically insignificent. The change in amplitude over amperage had a p value of .8381 and was deemed statistically insignificent. For leg 2 the effect of the injection of acetylcholine on twitch amplitude was significent with a P value of .0001. The change in amplitude over amperage was significent with a p value of .0159. In total, the effect of acetylcholine on amplitude was statistically significent with a P value of .0055. The change in amplitude over amperage was statistically insignificent with a P value of .1351. As seen in figure 1, Leg 2 controll showed extreme deviation from the other 3 tests, most of which vary by under .2 mV with Leg 2 test around .6 mV at most. Twitch threshold had no discernable pattern and contradicted itself. Figure one demonstrates the relative similarity between the two legs at each stage during the trial, apart from Lab 2 controll. Figure 2 demonstrates a curious high low cycle for even and odd amperages, however the reason for this is unknown.


Discussion:
While the experiment was deemed partially significent, this was mostly due to the vast difference between leg 2 controll and the rest of the specimen. This deviation continued across multiple tests and occurred before the muscle came into contact with any acetylcholine. After the injection of Acetylcholine and a 10-minute time period, the leg 2 test came to resemble the first leg. It is currently unknown why this occurred. The hypothesis was proven correct for all but leg 2. Most likely, a lack of significance is primarily due to acetylcholine not reaching the neuromuscular junction and therefor having no effect on the muscle (Merlie: 1978). Furthermore, the injection of water could have had a serious unknown effect on the contraction strength of the muscle.  Twitch threshold had no discernable pattern and contradictory results were seen each time. More tests would be necessary to see if there was any correlation between twitch threshold and acetylcholine injections.
