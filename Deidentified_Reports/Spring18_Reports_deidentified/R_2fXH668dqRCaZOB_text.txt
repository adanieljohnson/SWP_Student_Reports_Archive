Title: The Effects of Salt Water on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Vigna Radiata (Mung Beans)

Abstract:
To allocate the resources a plant requires, like carbon and nitrogen, mung bean plants germinate certain ways depending on their environment to effectively and efficiently do so. We measured mung beans root to shoot ratio when their seeds were grown in two different conditions: salt water and tap water. We predicted that because salt affects the plants ability to obtain the resources it needs, it will grow larger and longer roots to be able to effectively obtain the resources it needs to grow. In our experiment, we watered these mung bean plants with the appropriate type of water for two weeks and then measured the length and weight of their roots and shoots to see if there was a difference between the way the plants grew in the two different conditions. Our results show that there was a difference in the plants that grew in the salt conditions, as their roots were longer and heavier. Overall, our results show that when mung bean plants grow in salt water, they will respond by growing bigger roots to obtain the resources it needs. 


Introduction:
When surviving and growing it its environment, plants must interact not only with environmental stimuli, but also stimuli coming from non-living sources, such as temperature, soil type, etc (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, nitrogen, or water (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Each species’ pattern of resource allocation is genetically determined, but it is not completely fixed (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Therefore, plants can modify their typical allocation pattern somewhat to allow them to adapt to variety of conditions (Johnson, A.D. 2006).
	In this experiment we test the ability of mung beans to cope with its environment and change its growth patterns to more effectively obtain the resources it needs to survive. Because salt hinders plants ability to obtain nutrients from the soil, we expected the plant to grow larger roots to create more opportunity to obtain the resources it needs, as it is affected by the salt. 


Materials and Method:
We first filled six dishes with soil. Next, we added around 50 mung beans to each dish to ensure enough plants grew to conduct our experiment. We then labelled three dishes “salt” and the other three with “no salt.” We poured about 500 Ml of regular tap water into the three dishes labelled “no salt.” We poured 500 Ml of a salt concentration that was 1.3 g/liter into the three dishes labelled “salt.” Next, we poured 50 Ml of miracle grow in each of the six dishes. We then watered all of the dishes with the appropriate water type once a day for two weeks to stimulate their growth equally. At the end of two weeks, we measured the length and weight of the roots and shoots of three mung bean plants from each of the dishes of mung beans.

Results:
Mung Bean plants responded to salt by increasing the size of their roots. Root to shoot ratio was higher in both the weight (Figure 1) and the length (Figure 2) of mung bean plants. However, when we averaged all the trials of salt and all the trials of no salt, we conducted a two sample t_test that found that p value was greater than .05, therefore, there was not a significent difference (t = 1.48, d.f. = 2.47, p > .05). General trends do show that the roots did grow larger and longer in salt water conditions compared to that of regular water conditions. 

Discussion:
The results supported my hypothesis of mung beans having a greater root to shoot ratio in the salt water condition. The mung bean plants grew larger roots because the salt was blocking their ability to obtain the nutrients it required. Therefore, their energy went into expanding its root network to compensate for the lack of nutrients it was obtaining in hopes of obtaining more with a greater network. The plant adapted to its environment and changed its growth pattern to allocate its resources appropriately. Though there a difference is present between the plants that grew in the salt conditions and those that did not (as shown in Figure 1 & 2), the p_value is above .05, which means there was not a significent difference. This could be due to the fact that we did not run enough trials or the fact that the averages of the roots were simply just not significently different enough. There was a small error in the experiment. In trial 1 for the salt condition, the plant had noticeably wimpier and smaller roots and shoots in general due to the fact that it was shaded and overcrowded by the other plants. Also, we noticed that the leaves of the salt plants were very wimpy. This is possibly due to the fact that the plant was using the energy it had to grow roots to obtain the lack of nutrients it was acquiring due to the blockage by the salt. Because of its lack of nutrients, the leaves were not getting the nutrients it needed to grow and thrive. If we were to continue this experiment, the plants most likely would have died from the salt water and the plants growing in the normal water would have survived. This would be a good hypothesis and design for a future experiment. Overall, plants are able to adapt to their environment when allocating their resources, which is shown by the mung bean plants in the salt water conditions.
