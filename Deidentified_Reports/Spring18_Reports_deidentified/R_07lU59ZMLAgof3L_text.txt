Title: The Effects of Azamax on 20E Hormone in Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
Ecdysone (20E) is the main hormone involved in the regulation of the time of molting for insects such as Manduca sexta, an insect that feeds on foliage in its pupal phases. Insecticides such as Azamax have been utilized to stifle insect activity and growth.   If Manduca sexta is exposed to Azamax, then the growth and development of the insect would be inhibited. Through our experiment using a control group and an Azamax treated group, we noted each of the caterpillars weights everyday for a week.  While all of the caterpillars looked and weighed relatively the same at the beginning of the week, their final weight and activity levels were very different.  The weight of the control group nearly tripled that of the treated group, ultimately supporting our hypothesis that Azamax would hinder insect activity and growth.


Introduction:
Insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are controlled mainly by the hormones Ecdysone (20E) and the Juvenile Hormone (JH).  20E and JH are steroid hormones secreted by prothoracic glands and regulates timing of molting and controls additional functions in adult insects.  JH regulates the type of molt, whereas 20E regulates the timing of molting.  Insects need both of these hormones in order to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca sexta, a type of moth that passes through 5 larval stages and a pupa phase before becoming an adult.  Commonly viewed as a pest, it would be beneficial to determine what stifles their growth and activity.  It is important to understand and regulate their growth patterns and factors that could possibly inhibit their growth and transition into adulthood [Johnson: 2017].  Certain inhibitors such as proteinase inhibitors I and II have been found to stifle Manduca sexta activity [Johnson: 1989].  Similar to that, Azamax is a natural insecticide that blocks 20E in Manduca sexta.  If the Manduca sexta is exposed to Azamax, then the growth and development of the insect would be inhibited.  


Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, we gathered 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars of the same age and divided them into 2 groups: our control and our treatment groups.  We placed each caterpillar in a clear plastic container and provided each group with a different diet.  For the control group, we gave each one 10g of food containing 7 drops of distilled water, and for the treatment group, we gave each one 10g of food containing 7 drops of Azamax. After putting each caterpillar in its allotted container and giving it its specified food, we put them in the incubator.   We then came in every evening for 7 days to record the weight of each of the caterpillars.  We used a two-sample t-test where the p-value was < .00001, meaning that the two groups are statistically different from one another.  


Results:
At the beginning of the week, all of the caterpillars looked relatively the same in regards to their shape and size.  However, as the week progressed, the control group grew exponentially compared to that of the treated group.  The weights of the control group nearly doubled between days 5 and 6, continuing to grow and increase in activity during this period.  The treated group, however, maintained almost their original size, and exhibited little activity as the week progressed.  The total change in weight for the treated group averaged 1.16g with a standard deviation of 0.92, compared to the controlled group with a total change in weight averaging at 8.33g and a standard deviation of 0.71.    


Discussion:
This experiment supported my hypothesis that when exposed to Azamax, the growth and development of Manduca sexta will be inhibited. Azamax serves as a blocking element to Ecdysone, the the hormone that regulates the timing of molting, which proves to be very critical to the development of the insect. Throughout the experiment, we were able to see that by blocking 20E, the treatment group grew very little compared to the control group that grew very large at a rapid rate.  The blocking of 20E does not allow the caterpillar to develop properly, prolonging the pupal state and ultimately affecting its transition into adulthood.  If given a larger dosage of Azamax, it is reasonable to conclude that the insect would die, but future tests would be necessary in proving this assumption.  While there was not a decrease in weight for the treatment group, the change in weight was considerably less than that of the control group.  Insecticides such as Azamax are important to note as Manduca sexta and a variety of other insects cause feeding damage on a vast variety of crops.  Scientists have done a variety of similar experiments in hopes of discovering an effective method of protecting plants against pests.  Similar to an experiment done with protease inhibitor in plants, we noticed a decrease in activity in the insects that had been introduced to an insecticide.  It has been commonly seen that with the over-expression of an insecticide such as protease inhibitor or Amazax, the overall amount of plant damage may decrease [Thomas: 1995].  It is critical that pests such as Manduca sexta are monitored, as they their feeding habits ruin crops and plants in their pupal phases.
