Title: The Effects of IBMX and caffeine on the slime mold Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
When giving a response to a stimulus all organisms rely on some sort of signaling to determine their response. In many organisms G-proteins with cAMP as a second messenger, is a common method of signaling. We tested the effects of IBMX and caffeine on the growth of the slime mold Physaruym polycephalum since these chemicals inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase. Inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterase, should cause P. polycephalum to aggregate together and cause a mass of P. polycephalum. We calculated the average percent change of the controll group to be 18.87 and the experimental groups had an average percent change of 193.59. We were not able to determine any statistical significance from the data. Signaling should be continued to be studied, because it allows us a better insight into the daily mechanisms of organism movements and biological processes.  

Introduction:
Signaling is the process by which an organism can exhibit a behavior in response to environmental stimuli. Cells can be stimulated by certain chemicals or through physical contact thus causing them to illicit a behavior in response to that stimulus. One of the notable protein complexes that allow signaling to happen is the G-protein complex. There are differing mechanisms for different G-proteins, but each contain a heterotrimeric protein complex with α, β, and γ subunits. When the receptor of a cell binds its appropriate ligand, this causes a conformation change in the protein complex allowing the α subunit to detach from the βγ complex by hydrolyzing ATP. The α subunit binds and activates adenyl cyclase which synthesizes the second messenger molecule cAMP. This causes an amplification of the signal and allows the cell to illicit a response (Alberts, et al: 2013). After cAMP is produced in the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, receptors for cAMP are transported to the membrane of the cell. This allows for extracellular cAMP to be detected by other D. discoideum which signals for the organisms to cluster together and aggregate. When aggregating, many of the D. discoideum follow a concentration gradient of cAMP in order to determine the location of other D. discoideum. To regulate and degrade cAMP, D. discoideum produces phosphodiesterase (Tyler: 2010). In a study, using D. discoideum, researchers found that using caffeine and adenosine, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, caused D. discoideum to create large and small aggregations (Jaiswal: 2012). These findings show that cAMP is an important intra and extracellular signal molecule in unicellular organims that can be manipulated to demonstrate the growth of slime molds. 
We decided to examine the inhibitory effects of caffeine and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) on the second messenger cAMP. During our experiment, the model organism we used was Physarum polycephalum since it is a unicellular organism that is visible with the naked eye, thus making it easy to observe. In the presence of IBMX and caffeine, P. polycephalum should cluster and aggregate together due to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase by IBMX and caffeine, which would keep cAMP levels high. This should cause P. polycephalum to stay in an aggregated mass rather than moving away from its original location on the plate. 


Materials and Method:
Prior to the beginning of our experiment we prepared our own stock plate of P. polycephalum. We prepared the plate by cutting a block out of a water agar plate, placing an already cut 1x1 cm block of P. polycephalum into the well with oats sprinkled in the plate, and left the stock plate in an incubator for five days at 37 °C in darkness. Water agar was used over other media, because this would allow for only the oatmeal to serve as the nutrient source. When preparing the mixture of IBMX and caffeine we used 100 mM caffeine and 20mM IBMX. We then diluted the caffeine stock solution to approximately 20mM and made a 20Ml solution of IBMX and caffeine. Three water agar plates were each covered with approximately 3-4 Ml of distilled water and three other plates were each covered with 3-4 Ml of the IBMX and caffeine mixture. The excess liquid was wiped away, wells were prepared inside all the coated plates, and blocks of P. polycephalum from the stock plate were put into the wells, and flakes of oats were sprinkled onto the plates following proper sterilization with a flame and alcohol lamp. Each of the plates were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent the P. polycephalum from displaying phototaxic effects. The growth of each plate was observed every twelve hours over a 36 hour period. Their growth was assessed by taking pictures of the slime mold and their surface area was measured in millimeters as an indication of their aggregation using ImageJ. A statistical paired two-tailed t_test that assumes equal variance was used to compare the growth of P. polycephalum in distilled water and in the mixture of IBMX and caffeine.

Results:
From our data we calculated the average percent change of P. polycephalum growth in distilled water to be 18.87 ± 32.60 %. The experimental group in IBMX and caffeine had an average percent change in growth of 193.59 ± 203.06%. We were not able to determine any significent difference between the aggregation of the controll and experimental groups, T-stat(4)= -1.47, p = 0.22. 

Discussion:
Signaling not only affects an organism’s movement, but its growth as well. From our experiment we were not able to determine any significance between the aggregation of the P. polycephalum in distilled water and the mixture of caffeine and IBMX. Even though P. polycephalum demonstrated greater growth there is not enough statistical significance between the growth of P. polycephalum in distilled water between IBMX and caffeine. In a study published in 1979, researchers found that some inhibitory chemicals can have mild attractant effects in low concentrations (Kincaid, et al). Since slime molds can follow a concentration gradient when they are trying to aggregate, this could mean that we did not have enough caffeine and IBMX to cause proper inhibition. Which explains the branching observed in some of the experimental plates containing IBMX and caffeine (Tyler: 2010). This also could mean that the caffeine and IBMX mixtures were not spread out evenly across the plate. Which could mean that some parts of the plate were inhibiting branching of P. polycephalum while others were attracting P. polycephalum. Unless phototaxis are being tested, P. polycephalum must be covered when observing growth due to negative phototaxis in P. polycephalum (Schreckenbach: 1984). When putting the plates back into the incubator the plates could not have been rewrapped completely following each measurement. This could have caused some of the growth experienced in one of the controll plates. During our preparation of the agar plates, the plates were wiped of excess liquid with Kimtech wipes. This could introduce chemicals from the Kimtech wipes onto the plate, since they are not sterile wipes. In future experiments it would be interesting to see if a much higher concentration of IBMX and caffeine would have more of an effect since our results showed no significance. It would also be interesting to see if the observed effects of cAMP on P. polycephalum and other unicellular organsims can be applied to more complex eukaryotic organisms. This could lend more support to the function of cAMP as an integral signaling molecule in not only P. polycephalum and other slime molds but in more complex eukaryotic organisms. Signaling is not only important for single cell organisms but studying an organism’s response to their environment gives a better insight into that organism itself.
