Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on Neuromuscular Contractions

Abstract:
The main objective in this experiment focused on how lidocaine would reduce the amplitude of contraction in frog legs, which would cause sodium channels to become nonexistence, and in turn, force muscle contractions to occur at a higher stimulus. Because sodium receptors are vital in terms of muscle contraction and movement and since lidocaine is a muscle relaxer that slows muscle contractions, we decided to test what the direct impact would be if we were to inject three frog legs with a syringe filled with 25mM of lidocaine while given a voltage throughout the muscle. We hypothesized that the inclusion of lidocaine chemicals in the Rania pipiens frog's system would block the sodium channels and cause an action potential to never be fully reached as opposed to a group not subjected to the inclusion of lidocaine chemicals. Furthermore, our alternate hypothesis was supported in the sense that lidocaine did play a direct role in how sodium receptors were able to operate because the controll group reached higher levels of voltage as opposed to the group subjected to the stimulus even though we could not reject the null hypothesis from a statistical standpoint.

Introduction:
The topic of this lab addressed the idea that muscular functions can be subjected to nerve stimulation and various myoneural blocks, which would impede muscular reactions and functions. The neuromuscular controll is proportionally and in directly related to neuron firing through the branching axons with synaptic terminals which reach the muscles and cause them to move. Action potentials are fired through the axon terminals that come into contact with the muscles [Simkin: 2011]. Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential in the generation and propagation of action potentials and proper activity of these channels is imperative in order for neural firing to occur and muscles to contract [Kai: 1993]. Na+ channels are a necessity to muscle contraction because voltage-gated sodium channels are large integral membrane proteins at neuromuscular junctions [Simkin: 2011]. At these junctions, they selectively conduct sodium ions into the muscle fibers, resulting in muscle contraction. The biological question we are posing is that if Na+ receptors are blocked, will this have any effect on the reaction of muscle contractions when still subjected to a neuron stimulator. In addition, using the frog legs to demonstrate this experiment was beneficial because they are small enough see muscle twitchings and were easy to observe. Also, frog legs do not require a large amount of stimulation or injected substance in order to make them move, making them a good subject to be tested on in this experiment. The lidocaine would reduce the amplitude of contraction, which would cause the sodium channels to become not as affective, and in turn, the muscle contractions would occur at a higher stimulus. This lead us to hypothesize that the inclusion of lidocaine chemicals in the Rania pipiens frog's system would block the sodium channels and cause an action potential to never be reached.

Materials and Method:
This experiment was carried out by taking 3 frog legs, skinning each frog leg, separating and isolating the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from the frog legs, placing pin electrodes around the nerve, and by taking a syringe filled with 25mM of lidocaine and injecting it into the muscle. One end of the muscle, which was not connected to the knee joint, was tied off at the end by a string that was attached to a higher apparatus above the frog leg. This string was taunt, which allowed us to visually see the muscle of the frog leg contract when we changed the amount of voltage supplied to the muscle. The electrode pins were connected to a BNC conductor [Johnson: 2016]. With this conductor, we were able to manipulate the amount of voltage supplied to the muscle of the frog legs and this, in turn, allowed us to view the threshold amplitude. With nerve stimulation technology, we were able to determine thresholds and overall movement. The variables were the stimulus level, exposure time, and amplitude which allowed us to find the thresholds and maximum amplitudes. The statistical tests which were used was a paired t_test. This paired t_test allowed us to compare the controll group of the frog muscles which were not injected with lidocaine while given a stimulus to the frog leg muscles which were given a stimulus and injected with lidocaine.

Results:
A result from this experiment was that lidocaine blocked sodium receptors and caused the muscle in the frog’s leg to react at a higher voltage each time demonstrated by Figure 2. In Figure 2, the controll group of frog legs experienced a higher average voltage as opposed to the group of frog legs which were subjected to the addition of lidocaine, as demonstrated by the error bars representing standard deviation. There was a wide spread in the error bars in Figure 2. In Table 1, the muscles of the frog legs reached very low levels of voltage as opposed to the controll groups which reached higher voltages. Also, a paired t_test gave us a p_value of 0.267 which was not significent. The two groups tested (controll frog legs vs. the frog legs subjected to lidocaine) are not statistically different from one another. 

Discussion:
In conclusion, the experiment demonstrated results that aligned with our main hypothesis. However, from a statistical standpoint, our hypothesis should not have resulted in the way it did. Because we got a p_value of 0.267, which was not statistically significent, our hypothesis should not have been accurate. For our hypothesis to have been fully supported in the results that occurred, the p_value should have been much smaller. Therefore, we cannot reject the null hypothesis from a statistical standpoint. A reason the p_value was so off could have resulted from too small of a sample size which was injected into the frog legs, and this in turn could have made it too difficult to obtain an accurate reading. This inaccuracy is demonstrated in Figure 2, specifically with the error bars of the standard deviation. Nonetheless, our main hypothesis that the lidocaine injected legs reached threshold at a higher stimulus than the controll legs was still demonstrated. In other prior studies, they also experienced the same results when the sodium receptors were blocked; however, they always had a p_value which was smaller [Simkin: 2011]. The next logical step of this study is to conduct more experiments in order to get more accurate results, and in our case of this experiment, I believe using a larger sample size would help because it would allow for a more accurate reading.

(this is placed in method section but submitted under results section because there was no place under method to submit it) Figure 2. The Effect Lidocaine has on Sodium Receptors in Frog Muscles. This figure demonstrates the main findings of the lab and fully depicts that our main hypothesis was supported because the lidocaine levels were much lower than the controll group because their sodium channels were not blocked. Each bar represents 3 frog legs, and the error bars represent standard deviation. The fact that there was such a wide spread in the error bars is a result from too small of a sample size of lidocaine being injected into the frog legs, creating a technical error, and gave us too small of a sample size to get an accurate reading.  Table 1. Table showing Average Values of Voltages Frog Legs Reached After Experiencing Voltage. This table demonstrates how lidocaine had a direct impact on the voltage reached for the frog muscles which were injected with it because the muscles only reached very low levels of voltage because of the blocked sodium receptors as opposed to the controll groups which reached higher voltages because their sodium channels were not blocked.
