Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine on Muscle Contractions in Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
Skeletal muscles consist of thousands of myofibers, which ultimately play a role in muscle contraction. The application of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist, in which tubocurarine competes with acetylcholine for the acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. The experiment was conducted on three frog legs, which we conducted 3 myograms for each to test their muscle contractions. If the tubocurarine competes with acetylcholine for the acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, then the amplitude of muscle contraction will be lower. The results determined that there was significent difference in contractile amplitude between the controll and treatment. The experiment proved that tubocurarine affects the contractile amplitude in the frog legs, causing a decrease in muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are made of thousands of myofibers, which are fused aggregates of cells. The skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. These neurons contain axons connected to the neuromuscular junction of the myofibers. Once the action potential travels through the axon, ACh is released from presynaptic terminal. The Ach binds to the sodium channels and then calcium is released, which makes the muscle shorten. Ultimately, allowing muscle contraction to occur. The calcium is eventually taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. [Johnson, 2018] 
In this experiment, we used a species of frog called Rania Pipiens. The application of substances can affect muscles contractions such as tubocurarine. The action of tubocurarine has an influence on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, which has been considered a competitive antagonism. It has been suggested that the effect of tubocurarine could be accounted for entirely by competition with acetylcholine for the acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. The tubocurarine has an influence on the ability of the muscle contractions to occur, probably inhibiting the action or slowing the contraction. [Colqhoun: 1979]
 The experiment we conducted involved the application of tubocurarine. The nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist is expected to have an inhibitory effect on the contractile amplitude. If the tubocurarine competes with acetylcholine for the acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane, then the amplitude of muscle contraction will be lower.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we conducted an experiment on three different frog legs. We degloved the frog legs and detached the gastrocnemus muscle with a pair of scissors. A thread was then tied tightly to the Achilles tendon. The tendon was attached to a force transducer. We also used pins that were placed in various areas of the leg to keep it stable throughout the experiment. The Ringer’s solution was used to keep the leg moist and in a stable condition. We made sure to expose the sciatic nerve. The proper probes were attached to the nerve to stimulate the nerve. We used nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist and injected 2Ml of it into the gastrocnemus muscle of each frog leg. 
The probes attached to the nerve transferred volts from a simulator box. A myogram was used to record the controll and treatment data. We also used a software called Labscribe3 to record the myograms. Once the tubocurarine solution was injected, we waited approximately 5-8 minutes for it to settle into the muscle before conducting the myograms. Three myograms were recorded for each frog leg. A paired t_test was used and based on the average amplitude of the muscle contraction.


Results:
Higher averages of the amplitude of contraction were observed before treatment (controll column 0.139 ± 0.105) than after the treatment (tubocurarine column 0.507 ± 0.565). The tubocurarine was determined to have an effect on the amplitude of the Rania Pipiens. (t_stat= 5.37, P= 0.00067)

Discussion:
Results supported the hypothesis. The amplitude decreased significently in the frog legs treated with tubocurarine. The tubocurarine impacts the ability of ACh ability to bind to its receptors. In this case, the contraction was not inhibited fully, but the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist showed to affect the amplitude of the contraction, slowing it down. As seen in Figure 1, the contractile amplitude averages were lower when compared to the amplitude average of the controll. Tubocurarine has this effect​ because it attaches to acetylcholine receptors on the post-junctional membrane and reduces the amplitude of the end plate potential, causing a decrease in contraction. [Hubbard: 1973] We found no discrepancies throughout the conduction of the experiment. These experiments allowed us to comprehend muscle contractions at the neuromuscular level. From those findings, we could interpret that the application of a manipulating substance such as tubocurarine affects the Rania Pipiens physiologically by decreasing the amplitude of muscle contractions in the gastrocnemus muscle.
