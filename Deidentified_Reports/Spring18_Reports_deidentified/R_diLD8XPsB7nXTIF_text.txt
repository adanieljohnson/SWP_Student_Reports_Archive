Title: How Inhibiting Ecdysterone Influences Manduca sexta Development

Abstract:
In this experiment, we hoped to find a correlation between the inhibition of Ecdysterone, an insect growth hormone, and the growth cycle of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. We believed that the introduction of out Ecdysterone inhibitor, Azaguard, would prevent the caterpillars from further developing. We incubated several caterpillars over the course of a week, half as a control group and half receiving the Azaguard treatment, and we measured their change in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end. The caterpillars, in both the control and experimental, lost some mass in the week’s time. This means that the Azaguard had no significant impact on the growth of Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
This lab will focus on hormones and their interaction with the body, specifically the influence of JH and Ecdysterone on the development cycle of Tobacco hornworms, or Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta grows in several stages, going from an egg, to a larval stage, to a pupal stage, and on to adulthood. This cycle is heavily influenced by JH and Ecdysterone. When JH levels drop, it signals an influx of Ecdysterone, which signals the animal to move to its next developmental cycle. Our group decided to test how using a chemical known to block the production of ecdysterone and how it affects Manduca sexta development through instar stages into pupal and adult forms. Research has shown that introduction of ecdysterone at a late stage has caused growth into the next pupal stage [Weeks: 1986]. Therefore, we believe that the introduction of an ecdysterone blocker will prevent the specimen from receiving the signal to move to its next stage of life, thus inhibiting Manduca sexta development.


Materials and Methods:
We first created two groups: a control group and an experimental group. We began by measuring the mass and length of each caterpillar, though we will be using mass as our variable for finding our t-statistic. We also took note of the color and presence or absence of pupation. We placed 2 caterpillars each into 4 plastic containers that were partitioned into individual habitats. For our control group, we mixed 10 drops of water into 10g of caterpillar food and put it in the container with the caterpillar. For the experimental group, we did the same process but used Azaguard (an ecdysterone blocker) instead of water at a ratio of 1:1250. We would come each day to empty and refill the food, as well as to record our data. We then used our data, the masses of the caterpillars, to find a t-value and a p-value.


Results:
It seems like there was no change in the overall results between the control and experimental groups. The t-value is 1.06, and the p-value is 0.33, which tells us that the results are statistically significant. The average change in mass of the experimental group is a loss of 3.71 g, and the average change of mass in the control group is a loss of 2.08 g. This large difference is only due to the outlier in the control group that grew in the course of the experiment. As figure 1 shows, the introduction of Azaguard does not change the growth of Manduca Sexta. There are 6 degrees of freedom. In the control group, the standard deviation is 2.97, and in the experimental group it is 0.77.


Discussion:
The main trend in the data is that the caterpillars got gradually smaller. This, however, does not support our hypothesis. Despite the caterpillars getting smaller, they did not stop their life cycles. All of the caterpillars, control and experimental, moved on to their cocoon stage. Our experiment, in conjunction with other scientific studies from the past [Weeks:1986], leads me to believe that inhibition of Ecdysterone production has little to no ill effect on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Weeks’ study found that the absence of JH is what triggers the growth of Manduca sexta. This means that an influx Ecdysterone would not affect the growth of the caterpillar.
