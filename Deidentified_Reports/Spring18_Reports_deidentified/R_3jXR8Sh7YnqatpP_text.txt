Title: The Effects of Different Levels of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effects of different levels of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta. In the same way, the study focuses on the specific pathway characteristics that JH regulates during growth and development from larval stage 1 to 5, and then from pupa to adult. A possible way to determine this is by observing the effects of different JH modulators. We believed that high levels of JH affects the growth and development of Manduca sexta, which can be measured by an individual organism’s average weight. During the study, the weight of hornworms was measured throughout a seven day period. The hornworms should have received food every day but instead were given food only on the first day due to discrepancies in directions. The experiment should be completed again for more accurate results in the future following the correct procedure. Our hypothesis that the weight of the Manduca sexta would be affected over a seven day period as a result of the juvenile hormone in their diet was inconclusive. The null hypothesis that there is no difference in average weight size of the Manduca sexta in the control and experimental group was rejected since the data we did collect was statically significant. 


Introduction:
	Manduca sexta is an insect known as the tobacco hornworm that has a life span of about 30 to 50 days. These insects are in Order Lepidoptera and Family Sphingoidea and are a good model organism for the experiment because their body’s responses to hormones can be compared to many organisms on a wider scale. During this study, we will use Manduca sexta as a means to determine the effects of hormone regulation on insect development. The complex development process that turns insect larvae into adults is controlled by many hormones; therefore, these insects are a good model organism for the experiment. Juvenile hormones are vital to regulating the physiology of these insects and are long chain organic molecules. Insect molting and metamorphosis are governed by the ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone (JH) with ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) orchestrating the molting process and JH determining the nature of the molt [Riddiford: 2003]. JH regulates metamorphosis, or the radical transition from the worm-like larval stage to the pupa, by preventing Manduca sexta from developing into a pupa (to transition to adult). It is important to note that JH only regulates the type of molt during metamorphosis. Based on our previous knowledge and other studies [Riddiford: 2003] we hypothesize that juvenile hormones does affect the growth rate of Manduca sexta, so their weight will increase over a seven day period when fed this hormone. We hypothesize this due to our previous knowledge from other studies on Manduca sexta, such as the one previously cited. The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in average weight size of the Manduca sexta in the control and experimental group. The dependent variable is average weight size of the Manduca Sexta, while the independent variables include the type of hormone and the amount of hormone in the food. 


Materials and Methods:
	To conduct our experiment, we first selected 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars from the Bio 114 lab per instruction that weighed between 0.75 and 1.75 grams [Johnson AD]. We then divided the caterpillars in two groups: a treatment (experimental) and a control group. From there, we placed one from each group into each container, which was separated by an index card. For each group of caterpillars we gave one of two diets: the control group had 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet—recommended by the manufacturer, with 4 drops of DI water; and the experimental group had 10g of GLM diet, supplemented with 4 drops of the reagent 1:1250 Precor. After the initial preparation, we kept all of our caterpillars in the same incubator, after properly labeling their containers with the group name and ID number. Over the next seven days, we recorded the weight of all of the caterpillars on a scale in the lab. We then compared their weights over the span of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, we performed a two-tailed t test with an alpha level of 0.05.


Results:
	After running a student t test between group means, it is evident that the control and experimental groups are statistically significant (0.0049, 6, 4.3347). The groups were experimentally paired. For the control caterpillars, or the caterpillars that had not had any added reagent to their  food, the average weight was 0.9225 grams (figure 1). The weights mentioned increased until day 5 then decreased. For the experimental caterpillars, or the caterpillars that were fed food with the reagent, the average weight was 0.1575 grams (figure 1). These weights increased until day 4, but then started decreasing for the same reason: the caterpillars were not re-fed. Container 4 for both the experimental and control caterpillars were presumed dead. 


Discussion:
Although our original hypothesis can neither be supported nor denied, our collected data was statistically significant. The mean total weight of the hornworms treated with the juvenile hormone was statistically significant as compared to the control. There was a large difference between the container types of average weight relative to the variation of the sample size. Therefore, the result was most likely not attributed to chance and the null hypothesis would thus be rejected. We expected to see an increase in the weights of the Manduca sexta as a result of the juvenile hormone and its biological affects on the body. We did not see this increase in average weight size, but we did see a large difference between the average weights of the control and experimental group. We were able to find similar studies that were related to our hypothesis in order to determine the effects of different levels of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta. A similar study to ours also questioned how the juvenile hormone controls insect metamorphosis and reproduction. The study found that the juvenile hormone does in fact regulate body size [Riddiford: 2003]. Another study focused on the cessation of juvenile hormone secretion as a trigger for pupation and found that during the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm, the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibited the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone and thus regulated its body size (PTTH [Nijhout: 1974]. 
	Our experimental designs had many errors. Our results were rendered inconclusive due to multiple sources of error in the study and our inability to accurately complete the study. We were supposed to feed the hornworms everyday; however, we did not know this and instead only fed them on the first day. This is due experimental error and not re-feeding the caterpillars after day 1. Sources of error in this study include not feeding the Manduca sexta everyday. Other possible sources of error include incorrect meal preparation for the hornworms, incorrect handling of the insects when weighing them, and putting more than four drops of the reagent in the food. The study should be run again with these errors taken into account. This study would beneficial to scientists who want to understand the role of hormones in the development of animals and humans.
