Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on Neuromuscular Contractions

Abstract:
This experiment demonstrated how lidocaine would reduce the amplitude of contraction in frog legs, which would cause the sodium channels to become void, and in turn, the muscle contractions would occur at a higher stimulus. Because sodium receptors are vital in terms to muscle contraction and movement and we knew lidocaine was a muscle relaxer that would slow down muscle contraction, we decided to test this out to see if there was any large difference between frog legs not subjected to lidocaine as opposed to a group which was. Furthermore, our null hypothesis was supported in the sense that lidocaine does play a direct role in how sodium receptors are able to operate because the controll group reached higher levels of voltage as opposed to the group experiencing the stimulus.


Introduction:
The topic of this lab addressed the idea that muscular functions can be subjected to nerve stimulation and various myoneural blocks which would impede muscular reactions and functions. In this lab, neuromuscular controll is directly proportional and in direct relation to neuron firing through the branching axons with synaptic terminals which reach the muscles and cause them to move. Action potentials are fired through the axon terminals that come into contact with the muscles [Simkin: 2011]. Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential in the generation and propagation of action potentials and proper activity of these channels is imperative in order for neural firing to occur and muscles to contract [Kai: 1993]. Na+ channels are a necessity to muscle contraction because voltage-gated sodium channels are large integral membrane proteins at neuromuscular junctions [Simkin: 2011]. At these junctions, they selectively conduct sodium ions into the muscle fibers, resulting in muscle contraction. The biological question we are posing is that if Na+ receptors are blocked, will that have any affect the reaction of muscle contractions when still subjected to a neuron stimulator. We hypothesized that the inclusion of lidocaine chemicals in the Rania pipiens frog's system would block the sodium channels and cause an action potential to never be reached. The frog legs were good to demonstrate this experiment because they were small enough see muscle twitchings and were easy to observe. The lidocaine would reduce the amplitude of contraction, which would cause the sodium channels to become void, and in turn, the muscle contractions would occur at a higher stimulus.



Materials and Method:
This experiment was carried out by taking 3 frog legs, skinning each frog leg, separating and isolating the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from the frog legs, placing pin electrodes around the nerve, and by taking a syringe filled with 25mM of lidocaine and injecting it into the muscle [Johnson: 2016]. One end of the muscle, which was not connected to the knee joint, was tied off at the end by a string that was attached to a higher apparatus above the frog leg. This string was taunt, which allowed us to visually see the muscle of the frog leg contract when we changed the amount of voltage supplied to the muscle. The electrode pins were connected to a BNC conductor [Johnson: 2016]. With this conductor, we were able to manipulate the amount of voltage supplied to the muscle of the frog legs and this, in turn, allowed us to view the threshold amplitude. With nerve stimulation technology, we were able to determine thresholds and overall movement. The variables were the stimulus level, exposure time, and amplitude which allowed us to find the thresholds and maximum amplitudes. The statistical tests which were used was a matched-pair t_test. This matched-pair t_test allowed us to compare the controll group of the frog muscles which were not injected with lidocaine while given a stimulus to the frog leg muscles which were given a stimulus and injected with lidocaine.



Results:
The general trends I saw seemed to prove our hypothesis correct. Our hypothesis that lidocaine would block sodium receptors and cause the muscle to react at a higher voltage each time proved to be true by Figure 1. In Figure 1, it is evident to see that the controll group of frog legs experienced a higher average voltage as opposed to the group of frog legs which were subjected to the addition of lidocaine. We summarized our numbers so they are easier to understand by only making a graph with the averages of the values collected. Also, we conducted a match-pair t_test which gave us a p_value of 0.267 which is not significent on any alpha level. The fact that the p_value was not significent poses a question to how our null hypothesis was accurate and will be discussed further in the discussion section of this lab. The two groups tested (controll frog legs vs. the frog legs subjected to lidocaine) are statistically different from one another. In Figure 1, the statistical difference is demonstrated in their average values. Also, the fact that The fact that the controll group reached a much higher value of voltage as opposed to the other group subjected to lidocaine demonstrates how they’re statistically different from one another.


Discussion:
In conclusion, the experiment did prove results that aligned with our null hypothesis. However, from a statistical standpoint, our hypothesis should not have resulted in results that match it. Because we got a p_value of 0.267 which was not statistically significent at any alpha level, our hypothesis should have not have been proven true. For our hypothesis to have been fully supported in the results that occurred, the p_value should have been much smaller. Nonetheless, our hypothesis that the lidocaine injected legs reached threshold at a higher stimulus than the controll legs was still demonstrated. In other prior studies, they also experienced the same results when the sodium receptors were blocked; however, they always had a p_value which was smaller [Simkin: 2011]. Because we do not have a p_value, there cannot be any overall comments made about the data demonstrated. The next logical step of this study is to conduct more experiments in order to get more accurate results. Also, for further studies, instead of frog muscles, there could be another type of animal muscle used that is larger and would not be as delicate to pull apart. With the frog legs, it was sometimes difficult to pull apart the muscle without damaging the nerves. Furthermore, our null hypothesis was supported that lidocaine does play a direct role in how sodium receptors are able to operate.

Figure 2. The Effect Lidocaine has on Sodium Receptors in Frog Muscles. This figure demonstrates the main findings of the lab and fully depicts that our null hypothesis was supported because the lidocaine levels were much lower than the controll group because their sodium channels were not blocked.

Table 1. Table showing Average Values of Voltages Frog Legs Reached After Experiencing Voltage. This table demonstrates how lidocaine had a direct impact on the voltage reached for the frog muscles which were injected with it because the muscles only reached very low levels of voltage because of the blocked sodium receptors as opposed to the controll groups which reached higher voltages because their sodium channels were not blocked.
