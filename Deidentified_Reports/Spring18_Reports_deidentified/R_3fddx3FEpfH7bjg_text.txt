Title: Effects of Caffeine on Muscle Twitches

Abstract:
Rana pipiens is the species of frog that is used in this study, more specifically their leg. The sciatic nerve runs down the leg and into the gastrocnemius (the calf muscle). The action potential from the nerve triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle to release calcium which binds with troponin to cause muscle contraction. In this study, we analyzed the effects of caffeine on the muscle contractions. Caffeine causes the muscle to be flooded with calcium by opening the calcium ion gates. We injected muscles with caffeine and stimulated the muscle to contract. We compared these contractions to contractions without being treated with caffeine. Through experimentation, we determined that the caffeine keeps the muscle in a constant state of contraction or partial contraction.

Introduction:
A myogram is a visual representation of the different stages within a single muscle twitch. To do this, the nerve is stimulated in order to cause a twitch, then the twitch can be recorded. Typically, they will have three stages: a latent period, the contraction phase, and a the relaxation phase. The latent period is the delay between stimulus and reaction. The muscle contracts during the contraction phase, and relaxes during the relaxation phase.

	Caffeine is a chemical that opens calcium ion channels in muscles. These ion channels are important in regulating muscle contraction. Vertebrate striated muscle contraction is controlled by the action of the proteins troponin and tropomyosin on the actin filaments. Nervous stimulation causes a depolarization of the muscle membrane (sarcolemma) which triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions bind to troponin and thus cause the tropomyosin strands on the actin filament to move so that the part of the actin surface where myosin heads need to bind is uncovered. Contraction (force generation) then occurs and only stops when the sarcoplasmic reticulum pumps calcium out of the muscle interior, troponin loses its bound calcium and tropomyosin shifts back to its off position (Karius 2018).


Materials and Methods:
First, begin by removing the skin from the frog legs using your hands. If you reach any difficulty around the knee joint, tweezers may help. Once the leg is devoid of skin, turn the leg to expose the cleft in the thigh muscles and separate them at the cleft to expose the sciatic nerve. Then gently pull the nerve off to the side. 
	    Using scissors, separate the gastrocnemius (calf muscle) from the tibia by severing the connective tissues. Then cut underneath of the achilles tendon to disconnect it on the distal end. Then with about 30 cm of string, tie a loop around the achilles/gastrocnemius junction and tie the ends together opposite of the muscle. Cut the excess string and trim the achilles tendon. Now hang the opposite side of the loop on a hook located on the force transducer to suspend the muscle. Now place two pins on either side of the tibia and femur to secure the leg. The final leg, muscle, and transducer should be arranged as it is in Figure 1.
	    Now insert the electrodes into either end of the gastrocnemius, ensuring that they do not touch. Once they electrodes are in place, stimulate and record the muscle at 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V 3 times each. After collecting that data, set the volts to 0 and record as you inject 0.3mL of 100mM caffeine equally throughout the muscle. Then again stimulate the muscle at 0.5, 1.0V and 1.5V 3 times each. With all of the data we used a paired-t test to determine if our results were due to our experiment or a product of chance.

Results:
In both of our trials, the amplitudes of the recorded myograms were smaller in the experimented stimulations than in the controlled stimulations. As the voltage was increased, it was observed that the amplitude increased with it regardless of being controlled or experimented. Below in Figure 2 the averages of the three stimulations can be found to represent the difference in experimented and controlled groups.

Discussion:
Our paired-t test revealed that our hypothesis was correct (P value of 0.000144). The experiment concluded that treating the muscle with caffeine did cause the muscles to remain contracted. This is shown by the smaller amplitudes, when stimulated, in the experimental groups. The smaller amplitudes indicate that when stimulated, the muscle was either barely able to contract, or were not able to contract at all because they had already reached maximum contraction. This is a result of the caffeine causing the muscle to be flooded with calcium which causes the muscles to contract. Without the evacuation of calcium from the muscles, they remain contracted (Karius 2018). In future studies, experimenters should experiment with varying amounts of caffeine in order to determine a threshold of how effective caffeine is at causing contraction. Doing this would further the understanding of the effect of caffeine and would also eliminate any other potential factors present in the experimentation.
