Title: Impact of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction in Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab experiment was to determine the impact on muscle contractions when a sodium channel blocker, Lidocaine, is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens. Muscle contractions is dependent on a variety of processes within the neuromuscular system to function properly. This includes the creation of action potentials depolarize the cell membrane, allowing for the cell to send out neurotransmitters for muscle contraction. Action potentials are created in the cell by the opening of sodium channels. Therefore, the hypothesis of this experiment is that if Lidocaine is injected into the muscle, the muscle will have a lower response to a stimulus in comparison to a controll group. To perform this experiment, there is direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve at a stimulus of 0.2 amp, and the muscle’s response of both the experimental and controll group are recorded. The results of this experiment show the two group are not statistically significent. However, I believe that this experiment is not reliable due to the small sample size, and the experiment should be reconducted for further study.

Introduction:
Many movements are dependent on skeletal muscle which is controllled through the neuromuscular system. For our muscles to contract for any movement, this system needs to send commands by releasing neurotransmitters from the presynaptic nerves. The process begins when sodium channels along the neuron cell membranes opens allowing for sodium to rush into the cell. This creates depolarization in the cell to create an action potential which opens calcium gates (Sadava: 2016). The increase of calcium in the cell releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which travels into the T-tubules to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to form a muscle contraction (Sadava: 2016). When a muscle contraction occurs, it goes through three periods: latent, contraction, and relaxation period. The latent period is the start time between the stimulus and contraction. After this brief period, the contraction period is the progress of response until it reaches the maximum. It then decreases in amplitude which signals the relaxation period where the muscle relaxes until it goes back to normal to wait for another contraction. However, what would happen if one of these steps did not occur? Would the system weaken, improve, or completely fall apart?  These biological questions lead to the creation of an experiment where Lidocaine, a chemical that blocks sodium channels, is inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle, and a stimulation is created to observe the response of the muscle over a stimulus. To test this experiment, Rania pipiens, or Northern Leopard Frogs, were used because they have skeletal muscle as humans, and they are easily accessible to obtain with their habitat spanning over 19 states in the United States (Northern Leopard Frog: 2015). The hypothesis for this experiment is that the experimental group injected with the Lidocaine will have a smaller response of muscle contraction with the electric stimulus in comparison to the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
	To test this hypothesis, the experiment uses three Rania pipien legs that keeps in tack the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve. However, before the experiment begin, it is necessary to prepare the frog legs where the sciatic nerve is visible so that the stimulation can directly hit the nerve. First, the skin layer of the leg is removed to reveal the muscle. Open the thigh by using forceps or scissors and pull back from both sides to open the sciatic nerve. In addition, ringer’s solution is added periodically on the leg to replenish the fluids of leg to keep it at optimal functional level. The next step in preparation for the specimen is detaching the gastrocnemus muscle from the Achilles tendon. A string is then tied at the tendon with a loop at the end for it to be hooked on a stand. The stand provides the muscle a point of tension and allow the muscle to be place at a 90-degree angle. Next, the leg is pinned down into the tray to avoid any free movement that could create errors in the data. Finally, the last step in preparing the frog leg for the experiment is to take the probes connected to the stimulator and place them on the tray right next to the sciatic nerve without them overlapping. Then the sciatic nerve is laid on top of the probe for a proper measurement of the response. This procedure is repeated for every new leg that is tested throughout the experiment. Once the specimen’s leg is prepared for testing, the stimulator needs to be set up by connecting it to a computer and downloading iWorx Labscribe program. The purpose of this program is to set conditions of the stimulus, and to record the response of the leg in voltage. The parameters that are changed from the standard form of the program is to change the setting to Frog Muscle, and let the stimulator produce one pulse for a duration of 5ms with an amplitude of 0.2 amps. With all the equipment set up, the experiment begins by first testing the leg with no change to act as the controll group. Once the amplitude of the response is recorded, the leg is injected with around 1.5 Ml of 25mM of Lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle by using a syringe. The stimulation is repeated for the experimental group with the same parameters as tested for the controll group. This full process is repeated for each frog leg, and the responses are recorded in voltages. With the data collected, the statistical test two sample t_test is used as a comparison between the results of the controll group and the experimental group.

Results:
The graph presents that the average response for the controll group is 1.163 V while the experiment group averages around 0.9376 creating an average difference 0.2275 V, which follows the hypothesis. However, the statistical paired t_test is the determinant to see if these results have any statistical significance. The results of the statistical paired t_test suggests that the controll and experimental group are not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis that the experimental group injected with Lidocaine solution will have a smaller response of a muscle contraction in comparison to the controll group cannot be supported. While the general trend from the results seems to favor the hypothesis, the statistical two sample test shows the trend is not statistically significent because the p value was equal to 0.21. However, I believe that a major effect on this high p_value is contributed to the small sample size of frog legs used in this experiment. With only three legs used for the total experiment, this does not seem to be enough data because of the various muscle activity from each muscle. In addition, there have been studies which has connected Lidocaine in slowing down muscle contractions. For example, the uses of Lidocaine in pharmacology region uses Lidocaine as a regional anesthesia because of it inhibitor factor of impulses (Lidocaine: 2017). A similar statement is found in a study from “Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine” which came to the comparison that quaternary lidocaine derivatives can prolong the duration of peripheral nerve blocks p to 10-fold increase (Shankarappa: 2012). Based on these studies, there seems to be a strong connection between Lidocaine and a lower response in muscle contraction, but this connection cannot be made from this experiment. Therefore, this experiment needs to be reconducted by improving the sample size of the experiment. This would give the experiment more data and allow it to be more reliable source.
