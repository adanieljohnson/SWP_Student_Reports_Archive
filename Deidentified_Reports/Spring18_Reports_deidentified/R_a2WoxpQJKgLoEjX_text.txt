Title: Effects of Precor on the Weight and Length of [Manduca Sexta] Caterpillar Larvae

Abstract:
Insects utilize a variety of chemicals to regulate their metamorphic stages, the main one for development and growth are hormones. Manduca sexta caterpillar larvae were examined in this experiment in a controllled lab setting. It was hypothesised that an increase in the insect hormone, the juvenile hormone, would stunt the growth of the caterpillar. In the experiment, a chemical mimicker called Precor was used as a substitute to see if larvae could be stunted and prevented from developing. Several sets of caterpillars were seperated in the same environment with one containing caterpillar food with Precor while the other group had normal caterpillar food. [Manduca sexta] did not show a significent response with the treatment of Precor in their diet. There was noticeable variance in the results. The results for the [Manduca sexta] caterpillar larvae were unexpected but it may be due to the fact that the caterpillars had escaped their tubs at one point as well as not being fed on a daily basis. 


Introduction:
Hormones are chemical signals in an organism, dictating growth as well as development. Hormones bind to a variety of different receptors to stimulate a change in the organism. For insects, their development, including their molting and maturation are a result of the juvenile hormone. In manduca sexta caterpillars, their lifestyle has five instar stages, the pupa stage, and the adult stage.  A drop in the juvenile hormones in the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae signals the organism's body to prepare for the pupa stage. The hormone that regulates the molt time of the larvae is called Ecdysterone. (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) The dependent variable is the caterpillar length and weight. The independent variable would be the amount of Precor in food and days in observation

Null Hypothesis: If the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae consume the food with Precor (a JH mimic), then they will be unaffected by the addition of the mimicker. 
Alternative Hypothesis: If the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae consume the food with Precor (a JH mimic), then they will be unaffected by the addition of the mimicker. 
Null Statistical Hypothesis:  If manduca sexta caterpillar larvae are fed Precor (a JH mimic) drops in the their food, then the length and weight of the larvae will not change between the controll group and the treatment group.
Alternative Statistical Hypothesis: If manduca sexta caterpillar larvae are fed Precor (a JH mimic) drops in the their food, then the length and weight of the larvae will change between the controll group and the treatment group.


Materials and Method:
We divided the groups of [Manduca sexta] larvae into groups of two with the JH mimic (Precor) and controlls. (Regular Food)
In each of their own living spaces, we gave the controll group 10g of regular caterpillar food. The affected group had 10g of food with Precor (JH mimic). Over 7 days, the caterpillar larvaes had their weight and length recorded with a ruler and a scale. For each of the days, the old food should be removed and replaced with new food.The weight and lengths are compared at the end of the 7 days to see if the Precor would affect each of the caterpillars length and weight. Finally, present the data in an organized table as well as on a graph. 


Results:
Our results show that there is an almost equal distribution of heavy and light caterpillars between the controll and treatment groups. Two caterpillars from the controll outweighed and were longer than their counterparts. Two caterpillars from the treatment groups were longer and outweighed their counterparts. According to Fig.3 and 4, overall it shows that the treatment had a higher average in both weight and length. 

Discussion:
Our data states that there is mild effect of Precor on the growing larvae. Due to the variance in length and weight, there is not a clear trend available to interpret. However, both Figures 3 and 4 show that the treatment caterpillars were both larger and longer than our controll. Our caterpillars did not experience significent stunting because there were both large and small caterpillars for both the controll and treatment. Two controll caterpillars were larger than their counterpart treatments and two treatment caterpillars outweighed their counterparts as well. This may be due to the fact that they could have crossed the barrier that separated them, leading to the consumption of the wrong food source. They were also only feed on two of the seven days (Saturday & Monday)  we observed them and the lack of fresh food everyday could have affected their weight and length. Overall, the caterpillars did not show a significent or notable trend that could count as the Precor acting on them.
