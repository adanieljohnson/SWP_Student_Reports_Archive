Title: Changes in resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum in a sand environment

Abstract:
All resources an organism needs to survive are finite. The species that continue to survive are the ones that are the most efficient at allocating these resources. Resource allocation is something often studied in plant species to determine the plasticity of a species to different environments. The purpose of this experiment was to determine if planting Fagopyrum esculentum in sand as opposed to typical vermiculite soil would affect its resource allocation. It was hypothesized that the root:shoot ratio would be higher for plants grown in sand.  Three pots were prepared for each condition, vermiculite soil and sand, and then grown for two weeks. After the growth period the root:shoot ratio was analyzed for each condition for both weight and length. The average root:shoot ratio for weight was only slightly higher for the sand condition, and the ratio for length was much higher for the sand condition. It was concluded that for length, the root:shoot ratio was significantly higher for the sand condition, but it was not for weight.


Introduction:
There are many factors in the environment that influence the growth, adaptation, and survival of an organism. Biotic factors define the relationship between an organism and other organisms, while abiotic factors define the relationship between an organism and non-living sources. These factors may be more clear among animals, but they effect plant species just as much, if not more. Each plant has a given amount of resources at any time and it allocates them to different functions and structures. Different allocation patterns reflect different strategies that are the results of selection pressures and constraints [Weiner: 2004]. Every environment has resource limitation; as all resources an organism needs to survive are finite. The species that continue to live generation after generation do so because they have become efficient at resource allocation and continue to change in this positive direction over time [Huskáková: 2016]. Resource allocation is the distribution and use of limited resources in an effective manner. Effective resource allocation entails responding to adverse conditions by undertaking physiological changes that allow for efficient use of limited resources like low soil moisture, light, or nutrient content. For example, if a plant has low nutrient content in its soil environment, it will allocate more growth to the shoots so it has more surface area for photosynthesis, allowing a more efficient creation of nutrients. The purpose of this experiment was to assess how Fagopyrum esculentum-- a species of wheatgrass that grows in an amount of time effective for research-- alters its resource allocation when placed in a sand environment as opposed to typical vermiculite soil. It was hypothesized that in sand conditions, buckwheat plants will have a high root:shoot ratio, as they will allocate more energy to growing their roots, as they need to be longer to absorb more nutrients.


Materials and Methods:
Six pots were obtained; three were filled with the control vermiculite soil and three, the experimental condition, were filled with sand. The pots were then soaked in a tub of water to preliminarily wet the medium. Twenty seeds of Fagopyrum esculentum were then planted in each pot and then 20mL of Miracle-Gro™ was poured into each of the six pots. The pots were labeled “Soil” 1-3 for the soil condition and “Sand” 1-3 for the sand condition, and placed in a greenhouse. Each day for 2 weeks, all of the plants were watered the same amount. At the end of the 2-week growth period, the plants were harvested, and the three largest plants from each pot were set aside for analysis. For each of the six pots, the three collected plants were weighed together, and their weight was recorded. The roots and shoots were then separated from each other, and the shoots were weighed together and their weight was recorded. The weight of the roots was then calculated based upon the recorded plant and shoot weights. The root and shoot weights were then used to calculate the ratio of the average root weight : average shoot weight for each condition. From each of the six pots, the longest of the three plants was selected to be measured. The root and shoot were measured separately, and then the root : shoot ratio of their average lengths for each condition was calculated. A 2-sample t-test was run to calculate the significance of the difference between the ratios of the conditions, with α=.05. 


Results:
For both weight (Figure 1) and length (Figure 2), the root:shoot ratio was higher for the sand condition than for the soil condition. However, upon using a two-sample t-test for weight, it was found that there was not a significant difference in root:shoot ratio between the soil condition (n=3, x=.42, SD=.04) and the sand condition (n=3, x=.44, SD=.03) (p=.299, df=3.69, t=-.57). There was, however, a significant difference regarding length in root:shoot ratio between the soil condition (n=3, x=.43, SD=.06) and the sand condition (n=3, x=.59, SD=.09) (p=.048, df=3.46, t=-2.25). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that buckwheat plants will have a high root:shoot ratio was supported in terms of length, however, in terms of weight, it was not. This can be explained through the way sand and soil differ in the way they absorb water. Water flows through sand very quickly, and will rest at the bottom of the sand layer, whereas in soil, it is typically of uniform moisture. As Plants require a root system that delivers adequate water and nutrients for shoot growth, and to anchor them in the soil [Bengough: 2005], and knowing that in a pot of sand the water will be at the bottom, it makes sense that the roots grew longer, because they had to be able to reach a sufficient amount of water. In the soil, the roots did not have to expend energy on growing their roots longer, because they got enough water towards the top of the soil. The change in weight was likely insignificant because the increase in root length for the purpose of reaching the water did not require much mass to be added to the plant. If the shoots had grown more, this possibly would have added more weight and caused a significant difference in mass. This experiment had one major limitation. The seeds used to plant the test subjects were old, and this did not allow for as much plant growth as would have been expected. Additionally, the age of the seeds caused mold to grow in some of the pots, which could have also inhibited growth from all of the seeds. However, this limitation had more of an effect on the amount of plants in each pot, rather than how much the plants grew. Although overall plant growth was also less than would have occurred with healthy seeds. This experiment and ones similar to it are important to the discovery of how plants react to changing environments, and their tolerance to change. Plants that show significant resource allocation difference in adverse environments are considered better adapted as they have evolved to be more resistant to environmental change. Plants with alleles for better resource allocation ability will have more evolutionary success, so it is very important to study, as resource allocation is carried out in many plant species. An extension of this study could include creating a new experimental condition, like change in soil nutrients, light exposure, or water salinity, to name a few. There are many different changes that an environment can undergo besides soil differences like the one tested in this experiment, so it is important to explore other variables to determine the overall efficiency of a plant species’ resource allocation.
