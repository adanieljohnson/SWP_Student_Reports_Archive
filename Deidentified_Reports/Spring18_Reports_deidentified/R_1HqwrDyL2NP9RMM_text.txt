Title: Lanthanum Chloride effects on the muscle contraction of frog legs

Abstract:
	In a neuromuscular junction, ACH must be released from a pre-synaptic neuron in order for muscle contraction to occur.  Calcium needs to enter the presynaptic cell to facilitate the movement of vesicles that release neurotransmitters into the synapse. Lanthanum Chloride is a calcium channel blocker that prevents this process from occurring.  In the experiment, the effects of Lanthanum chloride on frog legs were tested. This should cause a decrease in the voltage needed for the experimental frog leg.  During the experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated and stimulated with probes lying under the sciatic nerve.  These probes measured a myogram on a computer and the voltage value was derived from the computer program.  The results did not show a correlation between Lanthanum Chloride and the inhibition of muscle contraction.  


Introduction:
In this experiment, frog legs were used.  The frog legs had a gastrocnemus muscle contraction when the sciatic nerve was pulsed with an electrical shock. This shock is used on a leg before the injection of the Lanthanum Chloride, and 10 minutes after the injection of the Lanthanum chloride.  The gastrocnemus muscle is a skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles have myofibers. Myofibers consist of sarcomeres that have actin and myosin filaments. Muscle movement can be explained by the sliding filament theory.  In this theory, ACH signals an action potential which causes calcium to be released from the endoplasmic reticulum (Johnson 2018).  Calcium then binds to troponin, which changes the shape and shifts the tropomyosin. This reveals the active site on the actin and allows the myosin globular heads to bind.  A power stroke occurs and yanks the actin, causing muscle contraction.  To start this entire process, ACH needs to be released from a pre-synaptic motor neuron. Motor neuron axons stretch to the myofibers of the muscle, forming a neuromuscular junction.  When the pre-synaptic neuron’s action potential reaches the end of the axon, voltage-gated calcium channels are opened (Johnson 2018) Without the calcium, vesicles cannot release neurotransmitters into the synapse, because calcium must bind to vesicles for transport. A calcium channel blocker, such as Lanthanum, would prevent neuromuscular transmission, because it blocks calcium from entering the pre-synaptic neuron when depolarization has occurred (Washio 1983). If the calcium channel blocker was injected into a frog leg, then the voltage would be lower.  This is important research, because neuromuscular blockades can have extremely detrimental effects on all species.  Some neuromuscular blockades have been used for chemical warfare, and legislation is currently being pushed for the end to the use of neuromuscular blockades and other nerve agents in warfare (Tattersall 1993).


Materials and Method:
First, each group was given three frog legs.  The frog legs were unskinned and moistened with Frog Ringer’s solution. Then, a dissecting probe was used to pull the inner thigh muscles away from the Gastrocnemius muscle.  The Achilles tendon was cut and a string was tied around it.  It was then suspended from an apparatus at a 90° angle to the rest of the frog leg.  Electrical probes were inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve was exposed. An electrical shock was sent through the muscle, causing contraction. This contraction was measured on the computer in the form of a myogram (Johnson 2018). The first time, the frog legs had not been tampered with, so they acted as the controll group in the experiment.  The experiment was repeated with the same frog legs, but this time, 0.2 Ml of the calcium channel blocker, Lanthanum chloride, was injected into the muscle.  This second time, was the treatment group in the experiment. Again, an electrical pulse was sent through the muscle and voltages were recorded using computer software.  A two-tailed t_test was used in order to determine if there was a significent difference in voltage between controll and treatment frog legs. The raw data of voltages was recorded, and then the averages were taken for both the controll and treatment groups in order to show a general trend on the graph created.  


Results:
The frog legs all had muscle contractions, and, according to Table 1, the averages were very close. Generally, the experimental groups had lower voltages than the controll groups, which was depicted by both Figure 1 and Table 1 above.  Looking at Figure 1, it can be determined that the mean difference in the voltages of the controll groups was 0.2088 +/- 0.132 volts. It was also determined that the mean difference in voltage of the groups treated with Lanthanum chloride was 0.1913 +/- 0.194 volts, which was not significently different from the controll (p=0.786, t=0.274). The error bars in the graph represent the standard deviation of the data.


Discussion:
Because of the results, the Alternate hypothesis was rejected and the Null hypothesis was accepted. The statistical test indicated that the p_value was over 0.05.  This made our results not statistically significent and indicated that the results were due to random chance rather than the presence of Lanthanum chloride in the frog leg.  These results could have arisen from several experimental errors.  During the experiment, the frog leg’s threshold was determined and then it was injected with lanthanum chloride and had to sit for 10 minutes.  All of the frog legs sat for at least 10 minutes, but some sat for longer.  Another experimental error that could have occurred, was not adding enough Frog Ringer’s Solution. Frog Ringer’s Solution is needed, because it gives the cells electrolytes that it needs for depolarization (Adrian 1956).  If not enough was added, then more voltage would be needed to trigger an action potential. Lanthanum chloride can be used as a paralytic poison that inhibits muscle contraction, so it is important to continue research on it to better understand the implications of lanthanum chloride exposure (Boucek 1976).
