Title: The Mixed Effects of Salinity in Water on the Growth of Vigna Radiata

Abstract:
Environmental factors play a large role in the ability of plants to thrive. This experiment examines, particularly, the effect of salt on plant growth (in this case mung beans) as it has been known to hinder proper processes [Bayer and Njue: 2016]. Plants were grown in two groups (one treated with water and the other salt water) over a two week period in order to conduct a two sample t-test to determine significant difference in root:shoot ratios between the two groups. The statistical test showed a high probability of our results occurring at random as the data were very similar. 

Introduction:
Soil conditions such as salinity, or the levels of salt present in the soil, hold great influence over the growth of plants and their ability to gain nutrients from their environment. Increased salinity in water is known to block the uptake of necessary nutrients like potassium and phosphorus, and can therefore stunt the effective development of affected organisms [Bayer and Njue: 2016]. In the context of areas that face runoff from areas possessing salt, such as roads, this can be vital information for plant health. This issue is particularly pertinent in arid regions, where a lack of rainfall does not allow for accumulated salt to drain from the areas [Bernstein: 1975]. As a result of the higher salinity levels in the soil, the osmotic potentials of compromised plants are reduced due to the interference of salt [Bernstein: 1975]. Applying these concepts specifically to mung bean plants (Vigna radiata), I would hypothesize that watering the plants with salt water would result in a larger root:shoot ratio as compared with the control group watered with regular water. Because salt is known to block the uptake of nutrients, this could manifest in the roots of the mung bean plants having to grow larger to access proper resources. This might also lead to smaller leaves and shoots in affected plants, which could adversely affect their yields and ability to absorb sunlight. 

Materials and Methods:
To test this hypothesis, there were two test groups, one being a treatment group that received salt water and the other being a control group that was watered with untreated water. Both of these groups were kept in a greenhouse to reduce variability in abiotic factors such as temperature, light, and humidity. Both groups were planted in vermiculite and fertilizer, with the different pots all receiving a liberal handful of mung bean seeds. After this, the treatment group was watered with salt water of a concentration around 5% salinity rather than normal water, with both groups receiving liberal amounts of water daily. Following a two week growth period, the weights, lengths, and ratios of the roots and shoots of the plants were measured after being cut into their respective parts and cleaned with water to remove soil. These measurements were compared using a one tail, two sample t test to assess the validity of the hypothesis. 

Results:
Examining the R:S weight ratio, the average ratio amongst the control group was 0.98878 while the standard deviation was 0.05089; the average ratio amongst the experimental group was 0.83532 while the standard deviation was 0.36703. In the R:S length ratio, the average regarding the control group was 1.04744 and the standard deviation was 0.56214; the experimental group possessed an average of 0.89367 and a standard deviation of 0.19651. While both Figure 1 and Figure 2 denote lower ratios in the experimental group, the standard deviations with both length and weight are large enough to reasonably account for this variation. The one tail, two sample t test used 10 degrees of freedom for the analysis. This resulted in t-stats of 0.60237 and 0.63249 for the weight and length measurements, respectively. These test statistics led to p-values of 0.54 and 0.56, again respectively. Furthermore, accounting for the standard deviations, the two are within single standard deviations of each other.

Discussion:
Referring back to the original hypothesis, there is no evidence from the data to support the theory that being watered with salt water would lead to greater root:shoot ratios. There was not enough variation between the control and treatment group to hold up this conclusion. With a greater than 50% probability of getting our test statistics by chance for both groups, the results give no indication that salt water had any real impact on the growth of the mung bean plants. This large p-value would not yield any sort of rejection of an established alpha level, and thus would not allow for the hypothesis to be supported. While this is true, the plants were mostly dead at the end of the growing period, so had they been thriving, there could be some incongruence between the data presented here and the results in another scenario. However, purely going based off of the evidence collected, it does not seem that the presence of salt in water has any great impact on the growth of plants. Perhaps it could also help to explain the resiliency of plants in environments that are not entirely ideal. Some plants are known to possess more salinity resiliency than others, so mung beans could potentially be able to withstand the salt water treatment and thrive in spite of it [Bernstein: 1975]. As the mung bean plants in this experiment seemed indifferent to their source of water, they could be completely fine in adverse conditions.
