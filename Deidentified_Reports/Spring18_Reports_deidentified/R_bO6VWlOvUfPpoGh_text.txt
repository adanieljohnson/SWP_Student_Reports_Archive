Title: The Effects of Precor on the weight of Manduca sexta (Tobacco Hornworms)

Abstract:
Precor is a chemical commonly used to protect animals from fleas. It uses and insect growth regulator (IGR) that acts like the JH hormone which is needed by the Manduca sexta to determine the type of molt it is supposed to go through. By adding 5 drops of Precor to a preweighed amount of food we tested to see if the there was significently more weight gain in those caterpillars than caterpillars that were given food that was treated with 5 drops of water. Results showed that there was not a significent enough difference between the weights of the two types of groups for there to be a correlation between the addition of Precor and weight gained by the Tobacco hornworm. Though the hypothesis was rejected there is a possibility that the concentration of Precor was too low in the diet of the Manduca sexta to show the proper results.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta are more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm are a type of insect that starts life as a caterpillar before pupating into a moth. In order to pupate the caterpillar requires the involvement of two hormones, Ecdysterone (20E) which regulates the timing of the molting for the caterpillar and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which regulates the type of molt the larvae go through. In this experiment we used the chemical Precor a common flea medication which contains the Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) methoprene [1] that is known to mimic the effects of JH. As previously stated the JH is needed for the larvae of the Manduca sexta to determine which type of molt needs to occur, if there is too much JH or too little JH it can prevent pupation and kill the caterpillar. In our experiment we tested how the addition of Precor to the caterpillar's diet effected the overall weight of the caterpillar. We hypothesized that the addition of Precor to the diet of the Manduca sexta would show an increase on the weight of the insect.

Materials and Method:
We gathered 8 caterpillars and separated them into two groups, a controll group which was given no Precor and a treatment group that received five drops of 4.2% Precor. We then weighed each caterpillar before placing it in a labeled container that held two caterpillars separated by a divider. Each caterpillar was then given 10g of food, if the caterpillar was in the controll group it received food that had been treated with 5 drops of water, and if the caterpillar was in the treatment group it received food that had been treated with 5 drops of Precor. We then weighed the caterpillars for everyday for the next week, except for the day after the experiment was set up, we forgot to collect data for that day. 

Results:
There was weight increase within the treatment group it was deemed significently insignificent because our controll group also showed similar weight gain. One trend that was noticed was that our treatment group increased its weight more rapidly than the controll group. We also noticed that one worm in particular remained consistently larger than the other worms. 


Discussion:
 Our results did not support our hypothesis. While there was weight increase within the treatment group it was deemed significently insignificent because our controll group also showed similar weight gain. One trend that was noticed was that our treatment group increased its weight more rapidly than the controll group. We also noticed that one worm in particular remained consistently larger than the other worms. Though the hypothesis was rejected, and the results showed that there was no correlation between the addition of Precor and the weight of Manduca sexta, I believe that if we had used a stronger concentration of Precor our data would have supported the hypothesis.
