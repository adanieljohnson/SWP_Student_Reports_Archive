Title: Muscle Twitch in the leg of Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
Rania Pipens uses its hind legs to escape predators using neuromuscular junction in the legs. In this experiment, we tested the muscle twitch of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania Pipens to see a significent change in amplitude using acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is a chemical used as a neurotransmitter that signals to other cells. In neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine activates skeletal muscles which require voluntary movement in the body by generating an action potential and sends signals to other cells in the body from nerve cells in a synapse called the neuromuscular junction. We wondered how the introduction of 10 mg/Ml acetylcholine onto the exposed muscle tissue of Rania Pipiens would affect the amplitude of the muscle at 1 Hz at .1/1/2/3/4/5 amps when stimulated directly through the nerve using a silver wire. We cut the gastrocnemus muscle and injected it with added acetylcholine.

Introduction:
Rania Pipens is the scientific name for the northern leopard frog. Like most frogs, Rania Pipens relies on its hind legs to escape predators which have strong leg muscles. Rania Pipiens was an ideal model species for this experiment because they have same neuromuscular junctions as most complex animals and is thus relevant for understanding the systems of the human body. Acetylcholine is a natural chemical that works as a neurotransmitter in the human body. It sends signals to other cells in the body from nerve cells in a synapse called the neuromuscular junction which is ideally suited for studies of synaptic plasticity because there is only one neurotransmitter and one neurotransmitter receptor type there [Wang: 2018]. In neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine activates skeletal muscles which require voluntary movement in the body by generating an action potential, which then would cause a muscle twitch. We wondered how the introduction of 10 mg/Ml acetylcholine onto the exposed gastrocnemus muscle tissue of Rania Pipiens would affect the amplitude of the muscle at 1 Hz at .1/1/2/3/4/5 amps when stimulated directly through the nerve using silver wire. If we increased the amount of acetylcholine, there would be a significent difference in amplitude.

Materials and Method:
In this lab, we used two legs of Rania Pipens, a ringer, 10 mg/Ml acetylcholine, a spray bottle, stimulation probes. In a process called degloving, the skin of the frog leg was peeled off. Next, the thigh was opened by pulling it apart to get to the sciatic nerve. Then, the tip of a pair of scissors was used to clear the connective tissue between the gastrocnemus muscle and the tibiofibula bone of the frog. Using those scissors, the gastrocnemus muscle was then cut off at the Achilles tendon along with a large part of the Achilles tendon. A knot was tied between the lower part of the gastrocnemus muscle and the Achilles tendon. At the end of the string was a loop used to hang it on a stand and lift the gastrocnemus muscle. The rest of the excess string and the Achilles tendon were cut off. Pins were placed on the frog leg to keep it in place and the stand was adjusted to suspend the gastrocnemus muscle at 90 degrees on the tray. The black stimulation probe was inserted in the lower part of the gastrocnemus muscle and the red stimulation probe was inserted in the middle part of the muscle. The sciatic nerve was laid down on the sleeve probe which was closed by a rubber sleeve. A spray bottle was used to evenly spread the acetylcholine over the leg. We tested the controll group first without additional acetylcholine and then did the same thing but with added 10 mg/ul acetylcholine. We tested the experiment using a computer to capture the amplitude of muscle contraction at 1 Hz at .1/1/2/3/4/5 amps.

Results:
We can conclude is that there is a loose correlation between increased neuromuscular junction activity with the additional 10 mg/ul acetylcholine treatments. For this experiment, we used a two-sample t_test. As shown in Figure 1, the groups were significently different but did not tell us a clear indication that added acetylcholine affected the muscle. In the controll group, there was an average of 0.200917 amps and a standard deviation of 0.087998 amps. In the test group, there was an average of 0.405667 amps and a standard deviation of 0.344847 amps. The amplitude of the controll group was 0.2 V and the amplitude of the test group was 0.4 V, also shown in figure 1. There is a significent difference of amplitude but since there is a loose correlation, we cannot tell if the experiment was valid.

Discussion:
There was a significent difference of amplitude but nothing from the data shows that it came from the acetylcholine. Therefore, we had to reject the hypothesis. There were several procedural errors that may have influenced the results of this experiment. One reason this may be is because it was injected straight through the gastrocnemus muscle rather than at the ends of the muscle where neuromuscular junction happens. Because it wasn’t properly injected in the right location, it’s possible that the muscular tissue in the leg of Rania Pipiens was sufficiently disrupted to the point where it demonstrated a reduced function. This reduction may be explained in which there is a current flow reduction that is induced by drugs with antagonist activity [Wang: 2018]. It is also possible that the right and left legs of Rania Pipiens were not interchangeable.
