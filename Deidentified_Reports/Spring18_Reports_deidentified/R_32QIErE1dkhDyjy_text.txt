Title: Investigating the Effects of Tubocurarine in the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
In this lab, we investigated the effects of the acetylcholine antagonist, Tubocurarine, on the contraction ability of the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. More specifically, we wanted to see how blocking the nicotinic receptors of the muscle fiber would affect the leopard frog leg’s ability to carry out a contraction. Acetylcholine is a necessary neurotransmitter that is involved with helping an action potential spread through the muscle fiber and trigger the release of calcium to carry out a muscular contraction. For this experiment we test three different leopard frog legs; first, we determined the threshold for each of the three legs and then measured three contractions. After, we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with Tubocurarine and measured three more contractions. We hypothesized that once the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with the Tubocurarine, the overall contraction of the leopard frog leg would decrease tremendously. After collecting data and running three paired T-tests, we were able to determine that the Tubocurarine significently decreased the strength of the contractions in all three frog legs. Therefore, we were able to support the idea that Tubocurarine is an acetylcholine antagonist and it will decrease the body’s ability to generate muscular contraction

Introduction:
Rania pipiens, otherwise known as the Northern leopard frog, are greenish-brown frogs with dark, irregular-shaped spots found all over their body. The gastrocnemus muscle (calf) of the leopard frog plays a large role in the frog’s ability to jump and generate force to propel the body. In addition to the muscular component of the frog leg, the frogs also have a sciatic plexus that runs through the gastrocnemus muscle that generates a neuromuscular contraction. In order for a contraction to occur, action potentials will initiate the release of acetylcholine which diffuse into the muscle fiber; from this, the action potential will spread through the T-tubules of a muscle fiber, which will cause the release of calcium to initiate a muscular contraction. For the purpose of this lab, we examined how Tubocurarine, an acetylcholine antagonist, would affect the contraction strength of the frog leg after direct nerve stimulation to the sciatic nerve. Research has revealed that “Tubocurarine (dTC) inhibits agonist-induced depolarizations of vertebrate skeletal muscle” [Neubig : 1979]. Therefore, for our experiment, we explored how the contraction strength of the frog would be altered by the presence of Tubocurarine within the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. The contraction phase of a muscle twitch is typically characterized as the period where the muscle will shorten in response to changes in the chemical state of the muscle fiber. Since acetylcholine is a necessary neurotransmitter needed to carry out a contraction, and Tubocurarine has been shown to block its ability to enter the muscle fiber, we hypothesized that the R. pipien legs that were injected with Tubocurarine would exhibit weaker contractions than the other frog legs that were not injected with the antagonist. 

Materials and Method:
To carry out this experiment, we obtained 3 R. pipien legs that were severed from their bodies just above the quadriceps muscle. In addition to the frog legs, we also acquired a bottle of Ringer’s solution, a stand to suspend the muscle, scissors for dissection, a syringe, an electrode converter for stimulation, the LabScribe software, and a bundle of string. We started to prep the frog leg by ungloving the leg by peeling the skin from the quadriceps muscle down towards the toes. Once the skin was removed, the gastrocnemus muscle was detached from the Achilles tendon of the leg. Then, the sciatic nerve was revealed by separating the tissue of the quadriceps muscle. Then, the femur and quadriceps muscle was pinned to the dissection mat and the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended at a 90-degree angle from the stand (See Figure 1). Once the leg was assembled, we applied the black and red electrodes to the sciatic nerve, making sure both electrodes were not touching. Once the electrodes were set up, we determined the threshold for the controll leg. Once we determined this, we stimulated the leg two more times at threshold (which we found to be about 0.2 V) and recorded the amplitude. After this, we then injected the gastrocnemus muscle two times (once at the top and once at the bottom) with Tubocurarine and waited ten minutes. After the chemical was given time to start working, we then completed the same method, regarding the electrodes, for the experimental leg. This procedure was then replicated on the second and third frog leg. Then, three paired T-tests were run in order to test whether or not each frog leg experienced a significent change in the strength of the contractions.  

Results:
Our data revealed that the average strength of contraction of the first frog leg (0.0596¬¬0.00153) decreased significently after the leg was injected with Tubocurarine (0.01630.00057) (t-value: 49.14, P-value: 0.000414, d.f.=2)(See Figure 2.). The average strength of the second frog leg (0.2780.022) also experienced a significent decrease in amplitude of strength once it was injected with Tubocurarine (0.1260.00458) (t-value: 14.91, P-value= 0.00446, d.f.=2)(See Figure 3.). The average strength of the third frog leg (0.08030.0035) also decreased significently after the leg was injected with Tubocurarine (0.01160.00115)(t-value: 47.26, P-value: 0.000447, d.f.=2)(See Figure 4.). The statistical test for each individual frog leg revealed that Tubocurarine does decrease the contraction strength of a frog leg significently. 

Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment, we found that the Tubocurarine chemical does inhibit the R. pipiens’ ability to contract their muscles. Therefore, our hypothesis was supported by our results, because all three of the leopard frog legs exhibited significently weaker contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle once the leg was injected with Tubocurarine. This result was expected because Tuborcurarine is defined as an acetylcholine antagonist; therefore, the Tubocurarine that was injected into the leopard frog legs ultimately blocked acetylcholine’s ability to bind to the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscle. A similar study explored the effects of a muscarinic and nicotinic antagonist in rat brains by injecting a muscarinic antagonist and nicotinic antagonist into the medial prefrontal cortex, then they sent the rats through a series of training sessions that worked their short-term and long-term memory. The researchers found that muscarinic receptor antagonist did not affect the initial learning of the task, but it did affect the long-term memory of the rat. On the other hand, for the nicotinic receptor antagonist, the researchers found that the rats were unable to carry out the desired task in either session [Maruki : 2003]. This ultimately revealed that an acetylcholine antagonist can impede an organism’s ability to carry out simple neurological functions as well as neuromuscular movement. Overall, our experiment revealed that Tubocurarine does have a significent effect on the neuromuscular system of a leopard frog leg. This experiment ultimately explained how a simple twitch response in the neuromuscular system requires the presence of acetylcholine at the nicotinic receptors to carry out a muscular contraction.
