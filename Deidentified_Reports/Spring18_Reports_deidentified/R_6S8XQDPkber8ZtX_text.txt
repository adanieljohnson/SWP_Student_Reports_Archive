Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Development of the Manduca sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, also called the tobacco hornworm, is characterized by distinct stages of life. Juvenile hormone (JH) is essential to proper development of the organism. It was hypothesized that increased amounts of JH applied at the onset of the 5th larval instar, in the form of a mimic - Martin's IGR - would cause maturation into a 6th larval instar. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the weight and length changes in a control group versus a treatment group which received Martin's IGR integrated with its diet. Both groups of caterpillars showed an overall increase in both weight and length over the course of eight days. The results of the experiment indicated no statistically significant difference between the groups, indicating that an increase of JH before the 5th larval instar does not result in maturation to a supernumerary nymph. However, previously performed studies have produced evidence to the contrary. If the experiment were carried out for several more days, or if the dosage of Martin's IGR was increased, there may have been a stronger effect shown on the caterpillars.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is in the order Lepidoptera. As an adult, it is considered a pest, and can cause damage to crops, though they do not carry any known human pathogens. Manduca sexta follow the Holometabolous life cycle, meaning they undergo four stages of life - egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The organism is good to use in an experiment because it is relatively easy to distinguish between instars and the caterpillars could not seriously hurt the experimenter. 
Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids (20E) are important in the development of the caterpillars and are necessary for the survival of the organism. JH is composed of a long chain of organic molecules produced by a gland located on either side of the foregut of the caterpillar called the corpus allata. JH regulates the type of molt that occurs during development. In adult caterpillars, it controls multiple functions. 20E regulates the timing of molting, and similar to JH, controls additional functions in adult caterpillars. The two work together to control the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the organism [Johnson: 2018]. A decreased level of JH is needed and involved in the metamorphosis from the caterpillar to the pupa stage [Nijhout: 1974]. Near the end of the 4th larval instar, there is a large increase in 20E and the levels of JH begin to drop off slightly. During the 5th larval instar, JH levels drop very low, and a commitment pulse occurs, indicating to the caterpillar it is ready to pupate [Johnson:2018]. 
In this experiment, we looked at how JH levels affect the Manduca sexta's development. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) act on systems of insects in unique ways. One such way is by mimicking the function of JH. Abnormally high levels of JH have been shown to impact the molt between developmental stages [Krysan: 1993]. In order to test how JH affects the Manduca sexta caterpillar and its development, Martin's IGR was used, a chemical which mimics JH, integrated into the caterpillar's diets [Johnson: 2018]. The effect of JH at the onset of the 5th larval instar before pupation and eventual transition into adulthood was specifically observed. It was hypothesized that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the 5th larval instar would prohibit proper development of the Manduca sexta and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph (6th instar). 


Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the experiment, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, which were all around the end of the 4th instar, were used. Four round, plastic containers were each divided into two habitats using an index card. Two caterpillars were placed in each container. Two of the four containers were used for the control group (four control caterpillars total), and the other two containers were used for the treatment group (four treatment caterpillars total). Each control-group caterpillar received ten grams of food initially, with three drops of water and no Martin's IGR, for seven days. The treatment group of caterpillars each received ten grams of food initially, with three drops of Martin's IGR, for seven days. Both the control group and the treatment group received ten grams of more food with three drops of water or Martin's IGR, respectively, when the food supply was low enough that the organisms would run out by the next day. The groups were both kept in the same incubator conditions at 23Â°C in a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle for seven days. Each day for eight days, the caterpillars' weights and lengths were recorded. A statistical two-sample T-test was used to analyze the collected date to compare the control and treatment groups.

Results:
There was a general increase in both weight and length for the Manduca sexta caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups over eight days (Figures 1 and 2). The average weight on Day 7 was higher for the control group, while the average length on Day 7 was higher for the treatment group. The control group experienced the highest individual values overall for both control and weight over the course of eight days. The caterpillars treated with Martin's IGR did not grow significantly longer (p= 0.45, t= 0.12) or heavier (p= 0.47 , t= 0.07) than the control group. 

Discussion:
The results of our experiment indicated that our hypothesis should be rejected. There was not a significant statistical difference between the control group and treatment group of Manduca sexta caterpillars with regard to weight/length growth. A significant increase in weight/length would have indicated the caterpillars were not beginning to pupate during the 5th larval instar, but rather were carrying into a 6th instar as supernumerary nymphs. The data we gathered did not support this conclusion. 
Although the data collected did not support our hypothesis, previous studies observed that the application of a JH mimic before pupation prevented the Manduca sexta from adult differentiation, with a 50% effective rate when 3.3 ng of JH was directly injected into each animal [Kiguchi: 1978]. A potential reason our results did not show the same effect could be that the time over which the experiment was done was not long enough to start pupation. If the experiment had run a few days longer, perhaps the data we would have collected would have supported our hypothesis and shown evidence of a 6th instar in the treatment group and pupation in the control group. Another reason could be the low dosage of Martin's IGR applied to the treatment group. At only 0.3%, the effects could have been minimized. Perhaps if the Martin's IGR had been at an increased dosage or directly injected into the animal, as in the previously mentioned study, the Martin's IGR would have had a stronger effect on the caterpillars' growth. Martin's IGR has uses as a pesticide, and so the results of such a study could have real-world applications of further examining the effects of pesticides on crop development in agriculture, as well as the actual effects as an insecticide.
