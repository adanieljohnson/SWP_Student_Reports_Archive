Title: The Effects of Various Temperatures and Lanthanum(III) Chloride on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effects of different temperatures and Lanthanum (III) Chloride on the rate of photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea. Using solutions with and without chloroplasts from the tes t species and a spectrometer to record absorbances, we had the ability to calculate the rate of photosynthesis and compare the different experimental groups to each other and to our control group. We hypothesized that Lanthanum (III) Chloride would decrease photosynthetic rate and that the rate of photosynthesis would be highest at room temperature. Our results showed that Lanthanum (III) Chloride decreased absorption rate and that the optimum temperature for absorption of light was at 4 degrees Celsius. Thus, our hypothesis was not fully supported by our experiment since our experiment only supported one of our hypotheses. 


Introduction:
In this experiment we tested the effects of various temperatures and Lanthanum (III) Chloride on the rate of photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea over time.  By keeping the light intensity constant, we will have the ability to determine the individual effects of Lanthanum(III) Chloride and temperature on the rate of photosynthesis. Lanthanum(III) Chloride is an inorganic compound  found in the form of a salt, that is commonly used to block the activity of cation channels, specifically calcium channels.  Calcium plays a large role in the regulation of photosynthetic electron flow and light-dependent metabolism [Hochmal: 2015].  Calcium appears to modulate activity of the phosphatase enzymes in the carbon reduction cycle and to regulate chloroplast NAD+ kinase activity through a calmodulin-like protein [Becker 2018].  Some evidence supports a calcium function in the water-splitting complex, and other evidence indicates a reaction center function in photosystem II [Becker: 1984].  As a result, we hypothesize that Lanthanum (III) Chloride will decrease the photosynthetic rate since it blocks the calcium channels.  Organisms use enzymes to carry out biochemical reactions and these enzymes are specifically folded to bind to a molecule in a specific way.  At low temperatures around 0℃, enzymes cannot work efficiently and photosynthetic rates decrease, at medium temperatures around 20℃, enzymes work at their optimum levels and photosynthetic rates are high, and at high temperatures around 40℃, photosynthetic rates decreases because enzymes do not work as efficiently [Markings 2018].  For this reason, we hypothesize that the greatest photosynthetic rates will be at room temperature since this temperature is optimal.


Materials and Methods:
First, we started our experiment by making a pellet solution. Second, we allowed the mortar & pestle, medium-sized beaker, and 3 centrifuge tubes to chill in crushed ice, we removed the veins from 4 kale leaves and rinsed them in water. Third, using the mortar and pestle and 10 mL of grinding buffer, we grinded the spinach to a paste and mixed 10 more mL of grinding buffer into the mixture and strained it using a cheesecloth. Fourth, we transferred 200 micrometers of the liquid into a and labeled it “Sample of A” and put it on ice, then transferred the rest of the liquid to a centrifuge tube marked “A”. Fifth, we spun the tube at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. After spinning and pouring the supernatant out of tube A into another centrifuge tube labeled “B” (leaving the debris in tube A). We removed 200 μl of liquid from tube B and put it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B”. Fifth, we centrifuged this tube at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. After pouring the supernatant into a clean tube (leaving the pellet in tube B), we place tube B on ice. Sixth, we labeled 20 large test tubes and placed them on a rack. We used the reagent tables below to fill the test tubes. We also conducted treatments as shown in the second table. Seventh, we began our assay by adding 100 μL of chloroplast from the prepared B pellet solution to tubes 4-18 and mixed the solutions. We transferred all the mixtures to spectrometer cuvettes and measured the absorbances of all of the samples at 600 nm. Eighth, we placed the samples in their respective locations ( either in the incubator, room temperature, or  at 4 degrees celcius), and measured their absorbances 3 times at 10 minute intervals. Ninth, we recorded these absorbance’s over the 30 minute period. Tenth, we calculated the percent changes of the absorbances for each tube using the following formula. (absorbance at time0/absorbance at time t)x100.We compared the results of our experiment using a two sample T-test to see if our results were significant and whether or not our null hypothesis would be accepted to rejected.


Results:
Our results show that the Lanthanum(III) Chloride caused the average absorbances over the 30-minute period to decrease at the fastest rate and the temperature with the optimal photosynthetic rate was at 4℃. Figure 3 shows that the chloroplast in light at 4℃ had an overall percent change of 54.7% which is greater than the percent change of the chloroplast in light at 40℃ which had an overall percent change of 11.9%. Our results for  Lanthanum(III) Chloride show that it  caused the average absorbances over the 30-minute period to decrease at the fastest rate. Figure 1 shows that over the 30-minute period, the average greater than the chloroplast in light at 20℃ which had an overall percent change of 33%, and the that absorbance decreased from 0.255 to 0.040 and there was a percent change of 84%. Per our t-test results, our t- value is 5.7013 and our p-value is 0.0046 when comparing our percent change of our sample for lanthanum (III) chloride with the average absorbance of our sample with not chloroplast. Our t-results when comparing our no chloroplast sample to the chloroplast sample at 4℃ shows our t-value is 2.038 and our p-value is 0.1112. 


Discussion:
Our results do match our hypotheses for the 1mM lanthanum (III) chloride decreasing the rate of photosynthes but do not match our hypothesis for photosynthetic rates increasing more at room temperature than at 4˚C and 40˚C. The reason why the lanthanum (III) chloride treatment did affect the photosynthetic rate of B. oleracea the way we had anticipated is because calcium appears to modulate activity of the phosphatase enzymes in the carbon reduction cycle and regulate chloroplast NAD+ kinase activity through a calmodulin-like protein [Becker 2018].  Thus, adding the lanthanum (III) chloride will inhibit or block the calcium channels and decrease the rate of photosynthesis since phosphatase ions will not have the ability to work properly.  As for temperature, our hypothesis was most likely not supported by the data because of a procedural error. Our chloroplasts could not have been properly isolated since we did not calculate chloroplast density. Moreover, we could have had in inconsistency in temperature since we did have technical difficulties when dealing with the incubator and with the light source. This could have resulted in an incorrect photosynthetic rate. However, we can do further testing to see if time exposed to varying temperatures influences photosynthetic rates in B. oleracea. Per the results of our 2-sample t-test, our hypothesis for the lanthanum (III) chloride was supported since our p-value was less than 0.05. Our hypothesis was rejected when comparing our sample with no chloroplast to our sample which had the greatest percent change because the p-value was greater than 0.05. This is what we expected since our results were not consistent with what we had hypothesized. This Overall, the experiment did show that there was a difference between the treatments’ and controls’ photosynthetic rates.  Although our hypothesis was not supported, we could recreate this experiment with more trials and additional samples to produce more accurate results.
