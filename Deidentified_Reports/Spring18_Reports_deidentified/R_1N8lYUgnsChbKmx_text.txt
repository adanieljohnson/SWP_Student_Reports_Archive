Title: Azaguard: it’s Effects on Developing Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
In this procedure, the effects of the commonly used pesticide Azaguard are observed against Manduca Sexta, a common pest plighting crop fields. Azaguard effects the Ecdysone production in Manduca Sexta, which is a crucial hormone for growth and development. In the procedure, 8 Manduca Sexta in the early larval stages are separated into a control and treatment group. The control receives 10 grams of a standard diet, while the treatment receives Azaguard alongside the 10-gram diet. The weights and lengths are then recorded each day for 8 days. After the data was averaged, the control group gained weight and length at a faster rate than the treatment group. In fact, the treatment group lost weight towards the end of 8-day period, while the control group ran out of food by the fifth day. The control group lost a small amount of weight towards the end of the procedure, but this implies the food was the primary reason for the rapid growth in the control group. Finally, by observing the health decline of the treatment group and the good health of the control group, it can be confidentially concluded that Azaguard does in fact cause a decline in health and weight in Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
In the larvae stage, Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is considered a pest by farmers because they feed on tobacco plants during the larvae stage. Manduca Sexta are holometabolist insects with a 48-day life cycle starting off as an egg, a larva with 5 instar stages, and finally the larva. Controlling the growth and development of Manduca Sexta are three hormones, Brain Hormone (BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile hormone (JH). 20E, the hormone of interest in this procedure, is secreted by the prothoracic glands which are cells located behind the head and thorax. (DeVries: 2015) 20E controls the timing of molting. On the other hand, JH is produced by the corpus allata. Similar to 20E, JH controls the type of molt the insect undergoes. (Candice: 2013) BH (also known as PTTH) will not be discussed, since it was not of interest in the procedure. JH and 20E work together to control growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta molts into the next stage of development when the levels of 20E is above the level of JH. If molting occurs while JH is higher than 20E, then the Manduca Sexta will molt into whatever it is before molting. (Johnson: 2016) Since Manduca Sexta is considered a pest, Azaguard is a widely used pesticide to eradicate populations of Manduca Sexta. After consuming food treated with Azaguard, the Manduca Sexta’s Ecdysone production will be inhibited, resulting in overall loss of growth and eventual death of the treated individuals. (Sylva: 2015). 

Materials and Methods:
In this procedure, 8 Manduca Sexta of similar sizes and weights were selected and divided into two groups of four individuals each. The Manduca Sexta selected were young, in hopes of the Ecdysterone having a larger visible effect on growth and development. Two Manduca Sexta each were placed in a total of four tubs which were divided in half, one side for each individual. One group of 4 Manduca Sexta served as the control group. They were assigned numbers 1 thru 4, and fed a diet consisting of 10 grams Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) with 10 drops of water. On the other hand, the 4 other Manduca Sexta—each assigned numbers 5 thru 8—served as the test group. Each Manduca Sexta in the test group was given 10 grams of GLM with no water. Instead, their food was dosed with 7 drops of Azaguard. The food was then mixed to ensure and even distribution of the treatment. Both groups were stored in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius, and they were only given the initial 10 grams of GLM food for the duration of the procedure. Every 24 hours for 8 days, the weight in grams and length in cm was recorded for each Manduca Sexta. In addition, each caterpillar was examined for overall color, health, and activity level daily and any notable observations were recorded. In order to compare the two groups for statistical significance, a two-sample t-test was conducted. The mean weights and lengths were recorded for each group by day. In other words, the control group had a mean weight for each day and the treatment group also had a mean weight for each day. This allows for two two-sample t-tests to be completed (one for the length sand another for the weight) in a fashion that exhibits clear trends for both groups.

Results:
Above, the daily average weights of the control and treatment groups are shown. Also included is a graph of average lengths (in centimeters) for both treatment and control groups of Manduca Sexta. On the initial day, both the control and test groups were of similar weight and length. Both groups appeared green, active, and healthy. On the second day, no visible changes were evident among the control and treatment populations. On the third day, both populations still appeared green and healthy. The control group responded to touch in a more sporadic manner than the treatment group. By day 4, the control population appeared bloated and they were active in their containers. Also, the control group had eaten much more food than the treatment group, which appeared lethargic, discolored to a brown tint, and insensitive to touch. On the fifth day, the control group appeared bloated, and they have run out of food. Also, the control group appeared very green and active. On the other hand, the treatment group appeared frail and inactive. A large amount of food remained in their bowls. By day 6, the health of the treatment group continued to decline as the discolorations deepened to a grey. Meanwhile, the control group remained large and bloated. On day 7, the treatment group appeared unresponsive to touch, the control group remained stable. Finally, by the eight day, the treatment group appeared to be barely conscious to external stimuli, and they appeared to be shriveled. The control group was healthy. After running a two-sample t-test between the weights, a P-value of 0.012 was calculated.  

Discussion:
With a p-value of 0.012 for the weight, the null hypothesis—which states Azaguard would have no effect on the weight of Manduca Sexta—is rejected. By doing so, the Alternative hypothesis is supported in this procedure. Also, the null hypothesis is rejected when looking at the lengths of the Manduca Sexta, as a p-value of 0.035 was calculated for the length. In other words, it can be concluded with confidence that Azaguard has a negative impact on the growth and development of Manduca Sexta. Evidence for this can also be noted in observing the weight and length differences over time between the treatment on control groups. For example, the weight of the control group drastically increased until day 5. Meanwhile, the treatment group began to lose weight over the 8-day period while they ate little food. Furthermore, after day 5, the control group ran out of food and began to lose weight after that point. Looking at the lengths, a similar trend unfolds. Although the slope is less profound, the control group gained length while the treatment group showed marginal positive growth. These results suggest the control group ate more than the treatment group, and as a result began to increase in size and mass. The reason for this being that the Ecdysterone in the treatment food deterred the Manduca Sexta from feeding, while the control group ate at a ravenous pace. Although there were no fatalities in the group treated with Azaguard, it can be inferred there would be fatalities in the treatment population if the experiment was continued.
