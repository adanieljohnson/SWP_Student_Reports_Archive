Title: Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitor’s Effects on Frog Leg Muscle Contraction in Rana pipiens.

Abstract:
In this lab, the effects of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor on muscle contraction were investigated. It was hypothesized based on the previous findings that when treated with AChE inhibitors, the muscle contraction period would be prolonged and the twitch amplitude would be increased. The experiment was carried out by in three frog legsgastrocnemius muscles of Rana pipiens treated with 0.1mL Sevin, which contained AChE inhibitors Carbaryl. The result showed that, for the twitch durations, different frog legs showed different results after treating the sevin—some of them decreased and some increased. For the twitch amplitudes, they were significantly decreased after the injection of sevin. 


Introduction:
In this lab, the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor’ effect on muscle contraction is of particular interest. In the experiment, Rana pipiens’ leg will be used as the experimental subjects. It is known that the acetylcholine, as a common neurotransmitter, stimulates an endplate potential on the postsynaptic cell by binding to the receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane. And to stop the transmission, the ACh esterase will need to hydrolyze the ACh that bind to the receptors. AChE inhibitors inhibit the activities of AChE, thus not terminating the transmission process, resulting in the accumulation of Ach[Fatt: 1951]. As previous studies showed, with the presence of AChE inhibitors, the ACh will bind to the receptors repeatedly on their routes to leave the synaptic cleft, thus causing the prolongation of end-plate currents[Magleby: 1975]. So, it is hypothesized that the muscle contraction period will be prolonged and twitch amplitude will increase with the presence of AChE inhibitors.


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used as the experimental subjects. Theiry skins were torn off firstly. Then the gastrocnemius muscles were separated from skeletons with a pair of scissor. After that, the sciatic nerve was exposed and connected to the two stimulation electrodes, which are connected to an iWorx TA apparatus.  that can produce myograms on the computer. The separated gastrocnemius muscle was then hanged and given the tensionattached to a muscle transducer and the induced contractions in response to electric stimulation were recorded as a myogram. The muscle was stimulated by the electrodes at a voltage of 0.5mV, and the amplitude and duration of the twitch generated by the stimuli wereas recorded from reading the myograms provided on the computer. Each frog legmuscle was then injected with 0.1mL of sevin, which was the Ach esterase blocker, on the muscle and stimulated again to obtain the same variables. A paired T-Test was used for each set of data, a critical value of 0.05 was used.


Results:
As shown from the figure 1,  for each of the 3 frogsgastrocnemius muscles, the twitch duration for the first frog leg muscle was 747±57ms before treated with sevin, 776±66ms for the second frog leg and 749±67 for the third one. After sevin is injected into the muscle, the twitch durations for the frog leg muscles were not significantly reduced (866±179ms, 752±35ms, 773±121ms ; p=0.113, p=0.247, p=0.783 respectively)
As for figure 2, the twitch amplitude for each of the frog leg was 0.750±0.006mV, 0.788±.007mV, 0.999±0.004mV before injected with sevin, and the twitch amplitudes were significantly reduced after the treatment( 0.595±0.025, 0.703±0.012, 0.879±0.017; p=0.00, p=0.00, p=0.00 respectively).


Discussion:
The result indicates that the hypothesis cannot be supported because one of the variable(twitch duration) did not vary consistently after the treatment in the three tested muscles. The twitch amplitudes were reduced in the experiment after the gastrocnemius muscles were treated with sevin, which contained carbaryl. This result was against our prediction that the amplitude would go up when the AChE was inhibited. It was known that the carbaryl (1-napthyl-N-methylcarbamate) prevented the hydrolysis of the ACh by inhibiting the esterase enzyme that broke down the neurotransmitter. Thus carbaryl indirectly prevented the reuptake of ACh[Schock: 2012]. The carbaryl disrupted the function of AChE by adding a carbamyl moiety to the active site of the esterase enzyme, preventing it from interacting with the AChE.  When there were no AChE functioning, the end-plate potential generated by the neurotransmitter can not be terminated, causing an accumulation of ACh on the post-synaptic neuron, which led to overstimulation of the muscle[Klaassen and Amdur: 1996]. So the muscle would be fatigue due to the surplus of the AChs, causing a decrease in the amplitude of the contraction. The inconsistencies of the twitch duration might be explained by the fact that the frog legs we used came from different frogs that might have different physiological states. And the inhibition of acetylcholine might have different effects on the neuromuscular junction that we didn’t take into considerations. These factors would all contribute to the inconsistent results we got in the experiment.
