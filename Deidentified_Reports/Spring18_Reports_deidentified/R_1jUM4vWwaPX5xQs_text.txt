Title: Betta splendens Introduced to Fake Fish of Varying Authenticity Display No Significant Change in Aggressive Response

Abstract:
Animals respond to stimuli in their environment in a variety of ways, including through aggressive behavior. We decided to investigate how the level of authenticity of a fake fish would affect the aggressiveness of the response of live Betta splendens males and hypothesized that the live fish would respond more aggressively to a more authentic fake fish. During the control trial, we separately presented other live beta males to the three beta males we were observing. During the first experimental trial, we separately presented an unauthentic fake fish to the same three beta males. Last, during the second experimental trial, we separately presented an authentic fake fish to the same three beta males. All other variables were kept constant. We used a point system to quantify aggressiveness. We then analyzed our data using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer tests. There was no statistically significant difference between groups, nor was there a difference within groups. The reason for this is probably because the fake fish were floating in the tank in a state of motionlessness, so the live males did not respond aggressively in defense. Scientists can use data from experiments like these to study the evolution of behavior, and this information can benefit pet breeders.

Introduction:
Animals react in a variety of ways to different conditions and stimuli. We observed and described the behavior of Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish. Intraspecific agonistic behaviors are those displayed between two fish of the same species and include broadside movements (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) and facing movements (erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers/opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane”) [Johnson: 2018]. According to a study using robotic fake fish and live Siamese fighting fish, an important factor in deciding whether or not a live male would respond aggressively was how realistic the shape of the fake fish appeared to be [D. Romano: 2017]. By this logic, the more similar the shape of the fake fish to the shape of the real fish, the more likely the live fish is to respond with aggressive behavior. This may be because the real fish are more likely to perceive the fake fish as a threat to their potential mates and other resources if they are of the same species and occupy the same niche. We tested to see how males respond to fake fish of varying levels of authenticity and predicted that the fish would show more signs of aggression when presented to a more realistic fake fish. This is important, because ethologists use data like this to learn why certain behaviors evolved and how they contribute to an organism’s fitness, providing insights into ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology [Johnson: 2018]. Consequently, this exercise helped us better comprehend why animals act the way they do, leading to a greater understanding of the complexity of the world around us.

Materials and Methods:
There were two treatment groups and one control group. For the control group, we removed the sight barrier between the live beta males and observed the aggressive behavior of three of them in response to the presence of other lives males. For the first experimental group, we put an unauthentic fake fish in the tank with the same three fish we were observing before. The unauthentic fake fish was similar in shape to a real beta but lacked visual detail and its body was only one color (red). It did not move at all in the tank and was attached to a rock on a string that held it down, making it seem even more foreign and different. For the second experimental group, we put an authentic fake fish in the tank with the same three fish from before. The authentic fake fish was identical in shape to a real beta in every aspect and its body was multiple colors, like a real beta. It was also around the same size as the other live fish we were observing. The only difference between this fake fish and a real beta male was that it did not move around the tank. All other variables were kept constant. We observed each pairing for five minutes followed by five minutes of rest to prevent habituation. We observed the same three male betas in each trial. To evaluate and compare their aggressive behavior, we used the following point system:

1 point – pelvic fin flickering
2 points – erect pectoral fins
3 points – tail beating
4 points – spreading gill covers/opercula
5 points – tail flashing
6 points – red “mane”

We used a one-way ANOVA to test for differences in aggression between the three groups. The mean aggression scores, represented by points, were then compared among pairs of groups with Tukey-Kramer tests, as well.

Results:
We used a one-way ANOVA to test for variation between and within groups. There was not a significant difference between groups (p = 0.051). The Tukey-Kramer tests did not show that any of the groups were significantly more aggressive than all other groups, either. The mean point score for the control trial was 58.7 ± 44.46. The mean point score when presented to the unauthentic fake fish was 1.3 ± 2.31. The mean point score when presented to the authentic fake fish was 0. As shown in Figure 1, there was neither a statistically significant difference between nor within groups. Therefore, aggressive behavior was not influenced by the authenticity of the fake fish presented to the live male fish in this case. 

Discussion:
We hypothesized that the male betas would exhibit more aggressive behavior when presented to a more authentic fake fish. However, our hypothesis was not supported by the data. We believe that the relevant biological mechanism in this case is lack of visual aggressive cues. It is also possible that the betas rely more on scent than vision when assessing their environment, and our fake fish did not possess the smell of a live fish, because they are non-living and thus lack hormones. In the study involving robotic fake fish, the aggressiveness of the live fish increased as the number of aggressive cues displayed by the robotic fish increased. [D. Romano: 2017]. In our case, we simply placed the fake fish into the tank with the beta males. Since the fake fish did not exhibit any aggressive behavior at all, let alone multiple signals, the real fish did not respond. Biologically, it makes more sense for an organism to conserve energy for times of danger than to waste it on aggressive behavior in low-risk situations. This explains why they exhibited little to no aggressive behavior when presented with the fake fish. On the other hand, the beta males did respond aggressively when presented with other live fish, because the live fish were exhibiting aggressive behavior, as well. In the future, we could repeat this procedure to verify our results. In addition, if we decided to complete a new version of this experiment, it would be intriguing to see if the males act differently when they are together in the presence of a female, because if they are trying to win over a mate, the type and frequency of aggressive behavior they exhibit may be different. If possible, we could also make the fake fish even more realistic by having them display aggressive cues and by somehow making them smell like live fish. Overall, experiments like these are important for studying how aggressive behavior evolved, both in regard to defense and reproduction. Fish that can better identify at what times it is favorable to attack versus when to retreat are more fit, because they will only expend energy when it is necessary. Therefore, they will be more successful and have the most offspring because this conserved energy can be spent on growth, maintenance, and reproduction instead. Pet store owners can also use this information in artificial selection if they wanted to breed more aggressive or less aggressive beta fish, depending on which type the consumer prefers. The trait that is selected for will become more and more prevalent in the population over time as allele frequencies increase.

Figure 1. Effect of presentation of unauthentic versus authentic fake fish on the aggressive behavior of beta males. During the control trial, three beta males were separately introduced to live beta males. During the treatment trials, the same three beta males were separately introduced to an unauthentic and an authentic fake fish. We used a point system to quantify their aggressive behavior. Each bar represents the mean point value of three replicates; error bars represent two standard deviations of the mean.
