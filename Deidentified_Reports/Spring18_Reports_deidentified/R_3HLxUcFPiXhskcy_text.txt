Title: Neuromuscular Junction: Effect of Lidocaine on Muscle Stimulation and Contraction of Frog Leg

Abstract:
In order for a muscle to contract, an action potential needs to occur, causing sodium channels to open and sodium to rush in and depolarize the muscle, creating a contraction. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker, and was used to test the effect of lidocaine on threshold amplitude in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog, predicting that if lidocaine were added, then the threshold amplitude would increase. We tested this by stimulating the sciatic nerve and measuring the threshold amplitude three times, adding lidocaine, then measuring the threshold amplitude three times again. We did this on two different frog legs, finding that without lidocaine, the threshold amplitude was averaged at .185 V. With lidocaine, the average threshold amplitude was averaged at .9135 V. Using a two sample t-test, we found that our results were not significant and our null hypothesis was supported.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system uses the nervous system and muscular system to respond to changes in internal and external environments within milliseconds. Skeletal muscle consists of thousands of myofibers that are connected to motor axons extending from the cell body in the spinal cord. Each axon and the myofibers it affects make up a motor unit. The points where the axon reaches a myofiber are called neuromuscular junctions. 
Muscle contraction is stimulated through a process known as excitation-contraction coupling (Calderón, 2014). In this process, axons transmit messages to the neuromuscular junction, causing the presynaptic neuron to release acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to receptors on the myofiber to open sodium ion channels. The action potential it creates spreads throughout the fiber and stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium stimulates the contractile unit of the muscle, in which myosin thick filaments travel down actin thin filaments (using ATP), causing the myofiber to shorten. The muscle then relaxes once calcium goes back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
We can study what happens in an entire muscle or nerve using a myogram. A myogram records the force of a muscle movement and translates it into an electrical signal, creating a visual representation of the different stages of a muscle stimulation. There are three phases of a myogram. The latent period is the time between stimulation and the start of contraction, and is usually less than 10 milliseconds. The contraction period occurs when chemical changes within the myofibers cause the muscle to shorten. The relaxation phase occurs when the muscle returns to its relaxed state.
Lidocaine is a drug that blocks sodium channels in muscles, thus making the threshold needed for an action potential to happen much more difficult to reach (Cummins, 2007). When seeing this on a myogram, it would look as if the threshold amplitude needed to get a response from the muscle is much higher than without lidocaine. If lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, is added to the muscle, then the threshold amplitude needed to cause a response will be much higher than without lidocaine. 


Materials and Methods:
After obtained two frog legs, prepare each by peeling off the skin, then separating anterior and posterior femoral muscles to isolate the sciatic nerve (which looks like a thin white string). Then, detach the gastrocnemius muscle from the achilles tendon and suspend it using a string so that the muscle is held at a 90 degree angle. Keep both the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve moist by adding frog ringer’s solution every few minutes. Once the muscle is prepared, place silver thread electrodes connected to a transducer on the sciatic nerve. Starting from 0.0mV, slowly increase the stimulation and determine the threshold amplitude of the muscle. Do this three times before adding lidocaine. When adding lidocaine, use .1 mL of 25 millimolar lidocaine and inject it at different places in the gastrocnemius muscle. Once the lidocaine is added, determine the threshold amplitude of the muscle as done before adding the lidocaine. Do this three times. After, do the same thing with the other frog leg, recording all results. Once data is collected, use a paired t-test to determine if the results are significant. A paired t-test is used because the same subject is being used as the control and experimental groups.


Results:
In both categories, the threshold amplitude increased with each trial, with the first trial having the lowest threshold amplitude of the three and the third trial having the highest. In addition, the muscle without any lidocaine consistently had the lowest threshold amplitude. When lidocaine was added, the threshold amplitude increased in both frogs. Lastly, our results of the two sample t-test was t=.2.

Discussion:
The paired t-test revealed that our results were not significant, indicating our null hypothesis was supported. Although statistically our results were not significant, we noted that in both subjects, the presence of lidocaine created the need for a higher threshold, indicating that it did have some effect on threshold amplitude.
In each trial, the threshold amplitude increased in both categories of the experiment, reflecting some fatigue. Fatigue refers to the decline in muscular force generated over time due to a lack of ATP needed in assisting in muscle contracting (Allen, 2001). Fatigue thus causes the muscle to need more stimulation, thus a higher threshold amplitude, in order to contract. Since fatigue naturally happens in muscle, this was expected, despite whether lidocaine was present or not. 
Additionally, the presence of lidocaine caused the threshold amplitude to be higher, reflecting what we had predicted. This occurs because the lidocaine blocks sodium channels, thus preventing sodium from going into the muscle to depolarize it, preventing calcium from being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, preventing it from attaching to thin filaments, and finally preventing the muscle from contracting (Johnson, 2016). All in all, lidocaine makes it difficult for the muscle to reach threshold, thus increasing the threshold amplitude. 
In this experiment, two frog legs were used, with one having a much higher threshold amplitude than the other after both were treated with lidocaine. While lidocaine caused for there to be a higher threshold amplitude, the threshold amplitude of Frog 2 was dramatically higher (nearly 3x more) than that of Frog 1. This result, while supporting our hypothesis, suggests that something in the experiment interfered with our results that caused the threshold of Frog 2 to be much higher than that of Frog 1. In addition, the placement of the lidocaine may have caused Frog 2’s threshold to be much higher than Frog 1’s threshold. Although both frogs received the same amount lidocaine, we could have unknowingly placed it in different parts of the gastrocnemius muscle. Lastly, the duration between lidocaine injection and stimulation may have influenced this result since Frog 1 had more time between injection and stimulation. 
If we were to repeat this experiment, we would record the threshold amplitudes of both frog legs without without lidocaine, then record the threshold amplitude of both frog legs after injected with lidocaine, waiting the same amount of time between injection and stimulation.
