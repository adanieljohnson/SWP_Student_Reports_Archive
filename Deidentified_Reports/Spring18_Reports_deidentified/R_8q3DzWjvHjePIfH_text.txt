Title: The Effect of Martin's IGR on the Manduca Seta

Abstract:

Juvenile hormone determines what an insect will become in terms of metamorphosis. Synthetic JH, such as Martin’s IGR, has been made to mimic the youthenizing effects of this hormone. High levels of JH cause the insect to become another of what it already was. For this experiment, 8 Manduca Sexta larva were selected in the 5th instar and fed either food infused with water or food infused with the synthetic JH Martin’s IGR. Although the treatment group was hypothesized to morph into 6th instar supernumerary nymphs due to their exposure to Martin’s IGR, the results were deemed statistically insignificent. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a type of moth native to North America. As a larva, it is very pesty and feeds mainly off of tobacco plants. It only spends about a third of its entire lifetime in this larva stage. However, as a moth, its main desire is reproducing. Most of the Manduca Sexta’s life is spent in the transition phase between the adult and larva called the pupa. Pupating involves molting, or when an insect’s epidermal cells secrete a new, thicker layer of skin in order to prepare for adulthood [Johnson: 2018]. The hormone that controlls this process is called ecdysone. Most importantly, the hormone that controlls what the Manduca Sexta will become is called Juvenile hormone.  Levels of this hormone, which is secreted by the corpus allatum in the prothoracic glands, effect insects because it delays the development, increasing the time until the commitment pulse [Wastson RD: 1988]. Once the larva reaches the commitment pulse, at the beginning of the 5th instar, it will molt indefinitely [Johnson:2018]. According to the critical switch hypothesis, high juvenile hormone levels will cause the Manduca Sexta to become another of what it already is instead of molting into an adult. There are synthetic forms of juvenile hormone, for example Martin’s IGR, that have this same effect on insects. The hypothesis of this experiment was that synthetic juvenile hormone, Martin’s IGR, would cause the 5th instar Manduca Sexta to transform into a 6th instar supernumerary nymph instead of molting into an adult. 


Materials and Method:

For this experiment, 8 Manduca Sexta larva in the beginning fo the 5th instar were selected and randoMly placed into either a controll or a treatment group, each containing 4 caterpillars. After recording their mass and length, they were put into homes, which were prepared by placing an index card in between a plastic container. 4 of these containers were used to house the 8 caterpillars. Next, caterpillar food was prepared by first weighing out 80 grams and then splitting this 80 grams into groups of two, each containing 40 grams. 10 drops of water was added to the controll group’s 40 grams of food. Similarly, 10 drops of Martin’s IGR was added to the experimental group’s food. After grinding each of the separate groups’ food into a large smooth lump, 10 grams of the controll food was placed into their respective homes based off of controll or experimental. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator receiving 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness at 25 degrees Celsius. They received new food every other day and measurements of weight and length were taken daily. To test the results, two singular variable T-tests were conducted. 


Results:


Control T-test results:  t_stat= 1.82, d.f.= 14, P= .089

In general, both the weight and the length increase over the span of the week. The fluctuations in length are most likely explained by human measuring error and difference in experimenter. 



Treatment T-test results: t_stat=2.61, d.f.= 14, P= .02

Again, both the weight and length increase at the same time, and there are limited fluctuations between the days.

Discussion:
It was predicted that the controll group would molt because those larvae were not exposed to extra juvenile hormone. This controll group would then pupate on time. Since the experimental group was exposed to the synthetic juvenile hormone, it was hypothesized that this group would grow larger in mass and length than the controll group because they would have morphed into a 6th instar nymph. Not only did a caterpillar in both the controll and the experimental group molt, but also the controll group was actually larger than the experimental group as seen through figure 3. Additionally, in reference to the T-test for the controll group, the p value was .089 meaning these results are not statically significent. A p value over .05 signifies that the differences in between length and weight were most likely a coincidence and therefore deemed statistically insignificent. However, the p value for the treatment group was .02 which is considerably lower than .05 meaning that the differences between the variables was valid. Although we can deem the results for the treatment group statically significent, one must still reject the hypothesis due to the results shown in figure 3. The values between the controll and the treatment group for both weight and length are simply too similar to suggest that Martin’s IGR caused the larvae to morph into supernumerary nymph. Also, there was an issue with the experiment that could have altered the results. For example, it was not a sure fact that the caterpillars were selected in the 5th instar. There was no definite way to distinguish between instars. Therefore, a caterpillar could have been selected that was already past the commitment pulse, which would explain why a treatment larva molted.
