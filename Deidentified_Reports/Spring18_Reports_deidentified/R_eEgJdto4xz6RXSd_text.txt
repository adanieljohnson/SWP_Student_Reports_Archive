Title: The Effect of Azaguard on Growth Hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab was to observe the effects of Azaguard, an insecticide, on the growth and molt of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Azaguard interferes with an insect’s ability to molt. It was hypothesized that if Azaguard is fed to the caterpillars, they will weigh less. Four caterpillars were fed a regular wheat-germ-based diet while four other caterpillars were fed the same food mixed with Azaguard. The caterpillars were monitored daily. Each day the untreated caterpillars weighed more than the treated caterpillars. The results were found to be statistically significant with the p value being 0.009148. The Azaguard inhibits the molt of the caterpillar so that it can not reproduce nor continue to be a pest. 


Introduction:
Insect growth regulators (IGR) affect certain psychological processes involved in the development of insects. IGRs are not toxic, meaning they do not kill the insect. Instead, they inhibit the insect from molting and, therefore, inhibit its ability to reproduce (AD Johnson). They can potentially either interfere with or over-activate certain regulatory processes involving hormones. This lab studied a Manduca sexta caterpillar. These organisms are often studied in the lab because of their short life cycle, large size, and ease of rearing (Villanueva, 1998).  The purpose of this lab was to observe the effects of Azaguard, an insecticide, on the growth and molt of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Azaguard is an insect growth regulator that prevents molting between larval, pupal and, nymphal stages by increasing the amount of juvenile hormone (BioSafe, 2016).  Juvenile hormone, made in the corpus allatum of the brain is secreted to control an insect’s type of molt, or shedding of their skin to allow for growth (The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica, 2014). The purpose of this experiment was to see the effect of Azaguard on the weight of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. A t-test was used to indicate whether these results were statistically significant, or whether or not Azaguard’s effect occurred by chance or not. It was hypothesized that if Azaguard is fed to the caterpillars, they will weigh  less. The dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillars and the independent variable was the amount of Azaguard added. If the test is statistically significant this could aid gardeners. It would prove that Azaguard could be used as an effective insecticide to remove caterpillar pests.

Materials and Methods:
Obtained four plastic containers with a lid. Taped an index card across the center to act as a barrier between the two sides of the container. Labeled the containers groups 1-4. Labeled one side control and the other treatment. Fed control group a normal 10g diet of wheat-germ-based food. Placed 10g of food in each container on the control side. Added 10 drops of 1:1250 concentrated Azaguard to 10g of food. Placed 10g of this treatment diet in each of the four containers on the treatment side. Obtained 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and placed one in each side of the containers. Placed lids on containers and put in a temperature controlling unit. Monitored caterpillars daily for 7 days. Weighed them each day to monitor growth. Used a two sample t-test to analyze the results of the weight of the caterpillars. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows the average change in weight from day 1 to day 7 for both the control and treatment groups.  The average change in weight of the control was found to be 3.09g and the average change in weight of the treatment group was found to be 0.6625g. There was also no overlap of standard error. A t-test was performed using the average change in weights of both the control and treatment groups. The mean of the change in weight of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 3.78, df = 6, P = 0.009148).  


Discussion:
The results supported the hypothesis that if Azaguard is fed to caterpillars they will weigh less.  Figure one shows that the change in weight from day 1 to day 7 of the control group was 2.43g greater than the change in weight of the treatment group. The standard error has no overlap, validating the significance of the effect of Azaguard. Because the results are statistically significant, this means that the Azaguard did have an effect on the caterpillar’s growth that was not just due to randomness. Azaguard works by interfering with an insects ability to molt. It controls insects in the larval, pupal, and nymphal stages by interfering with the metabolism of ecdysone (Keystone Pest solutions, 2004). Ecdysone concentration induces the expression of gene coding for proteins that the larva requires to molt. (Norris, 1998).  In this study, the caterpillars that ingested the Azaguard could not make the proteins necessary to grow and molt. The results gathered indicate that the consumption of Azaguard inhibits growth of the insect by increasing the amount of juvenile hormone. This would inhibit their ability to reproduce which would alleviate the spread of these pests in a garden. If the experiment was to be reproduced, researchers should obtain similar results. In a study conducted by Lynn M. Riddiford in 2003, juvenile hormone and its role in molting was studied. The researchers explain that JH is normally present during larval life to allow growth of the larva and the progression from one larval stage to the next until the larva attains a proper size for metamorphosis.  He proves that juvenile hormone appears in the epidermis in the final larval instar and specifies pupal cuticle formation during the molt by interfering with the corpus allata, where JH is released from.  (Riddiford et al, 2003). This supports the data collected that alteration of JH will result in defects in molting which is exactly what Azaguard does.
