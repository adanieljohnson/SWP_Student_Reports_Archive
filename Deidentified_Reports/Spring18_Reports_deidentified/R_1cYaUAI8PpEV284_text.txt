Title: The Determination of the Optimal Wavelength of Red and Blue Light Compared to the Suboptimal Green Light 

Abstract:
There are many factors that affect the photosynthetic rate of plants. Photosynthesis is an process that produces the energy needed for a plant to grow through redox reactions in the thylakoid membrane. In this experiment, in particular, we are studying the effect of different types of light on the photosynthetic rate of spinach. The three types of light that are being analyzed look at blue, red and green lights. All the types of light had varied wavelengths, so we hypothesized that the red and blue lights would be an the optimal wavelength for photosynthetic rate compared to green light. Based on our results and our one-tailed t test, we were able to conclude that there was a significant difference in the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts of red and blue light versus the green light. Thus, making it clear that the wavelength of red and blue light is optimal for the process of photosynthesis compared to the green light, which is considered suboptimal. Additionally, the the absorbances is seen in the 30 minute time period. The absorbances ecreased compared to the initial absorbance calculated. This shows that there is an increase in activity of DCPIP and thus and increase the photosynthetic rate. This study shows the need for additional research on lights sources. 

Introduction:
In this lab, the photosynthetic rate of spinach plants or chlorophyll was tested in various different lighting environments. Firstly, photosynthesis is the energy generating process that occurs in the chloroplasts of a plant cell. Photosynthetic rate or more generally plant growth is greatly affected by a variety of factors. One of the many factors that has an effect on the photosynthetic rate of a plant are herbicides, which are known as “chemicals designed to inhibit and destroy plant life” (Gaspar, 479). In addition to herbicides, a particular factor that we are aiming to investigate is the type of light source that the spinach plant is exposed to and the effect that it has on photosynthetic rate. Overall, we are analyzing the effect of the variation of wavelengths on the photosynthetic rate of the chlorophyll present in spinach. Spinach is utilized as the model system in this particular experiment due to the fact that it is cheap, easy to access and possesses a significant amount of chloroplasts. 
 Light, overall, plays an instrumental role in the functionality of the photosystems in the thylakoid membrane due to the fact that it excites the electrons in photosystem 2, which propels the rate of photosynthesis in the plant. The types of light that are observed were green, blue and red. The reason that these specific light sources were chosen was to display the absorbances of the chlorophyll at varying wavelengths. The red light possesses the approximate wavelength of about 630 nm, the blue light has the wavelength range of roughly 470 nm (Sahin, 1). Finally green light has the wavelength of about 510 nm (Johkan, 128).Using all of the wavelengths, the absorbance of the DCPIP reduced in the enriched chloroplasts is measured and analyzed. The presence  DCPIP allows for the effects of various herbicides and other photosynthetic rate altering factors to be interpreted. DCPIP is also known as the electron acceptor of the process of photosynthesis and therefore plays a key role in photoinhibition, which occurs within photosystem II and thus allows for explicit observation of the Hill Reaction (Ramalho, 320). 
	Based on all of the information above, we were able to form a well-informed conclusion or hypothesis that allowed us to investigate the following questions about our topic: what is the optimal wavelength of light for the photosynthetic rate of spinach (chlorophyll) and which of these three types of light has the largest effect on the photosynthetic rate of spinach. Our hypothesis was that the photosynthetic rate of spinach varied for red and blue light compared to green light. Additionally, we hypothesized that the red and blue lights would be the optimal wavelengths for the photosynthetic rate of the the spinach and the green wavelength will be the suboptimal wavelength.  Overall, we predicted that the effect or the percent change of the absorbances of the test tubes would decrease at a relatively steady rate as time continues.

Materials and Methods:
This lab used the model of spinach leaves to test the varied effects of light on the photosynthetic rate. This spinach was obtained, washed carefully and removed from their central veins. Then, all of the necessary tools, such as the mortar and pestle, the grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine pH=8.0) and the 3 tubes were placed over ice for cooling. Once all of materials are cooled properly, the spinach was put into the mortar and pestle then 10 mL of the grinding buffer was added. The spinach was then grinded with the grinding buffer into a “slurry”. Then, add another 10 mL grinding buffer. Following the addition of the second 10 mL of grinding buffer, the liquid was placed into a tube labeled “Sample A” then centrifuged for the first time at 200 x G or 200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes 4oC. After the initial centrifuge, pour out the supernatant out into another Tube labelled “Sample B. Then, “Sample B” tube is centrifuged a second time at 1,000 x G or 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4oC. That supernatant produced from the second centrifuge was poured into another tube labelled “Sample C” and then was placed on ice to cool. While “Sample C” cools, 10 test tubes were labelled and 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts were put in in order to perform the Hill Assay. Then, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP (130 mM) and 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH = 6.5). The 1st of the tubes that was made was a blank, which possessed everything above but the active ingredient (DCPIP). Once all of the components above were added, the test tubes were put into spectrophotometer cuvettes and placed in their respective light environments. Test tubes 1-3 were placed in green light, test tubes 4-6 were placed in blue light and test tubes 7-9 were put into red light. Each cuvette was left in their environment for 10 minutes then the absorbance was measured at 600 nm, making sure to blank the spectrophotometer between light groups. This process of measurement was repeats 3 times in total until the absorbance over a 30 minute time period could be analyzed. Finally, after all of the trials were performed a one-tailed t test was performed, where a critical value of .05 was used to compare to the calculated value. 


Results:
The overall trend of each of the enriched chloroplast samples was that the absorbances of the DCPIP decreased after each period of time. Even though the percent changes fluctuated a significant amount, overall the change seen amongst all of the samples was that the absorbance decreased. Each of the enriched chloroplasts samples had varied absorbances after the 30 minute period. The mean of the data for the red light after 30 minutes was 25.83 and the variance for the same data was 33.94. Additionally, for the green data the mean was 9.60 and the standard deviation was 25.27. The statistical test used to compare the red light to the green light was a one-tailed t test, which yielded the results t(4)= 3.63, p = .011. For the comparison of red light to blue light after the 30 minute time period, the results yielded t(4)= 3.94, p =.0085 after a one tailed t test was interpreted. For the blue data after 30 minutes, the mean was 7.25 and the standard deviation (variance) was 32.11. 


Discussion:
Based on the data from the one-tailed t test seen above, it is reasonable to conclude that our hypothesis was supported. Our hypothesis stated that there the photosynthetic rate of spinach in the blue and red light was optimal compared to the suboptimal green light. This can be seen due to the fact that the p-value of the comparison of both red versus blue and red versus green is less than .05, which means that the statistical null hypothesis can be rejected and the hypothesis that there is a significant difference between the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts at green wavelength versus the absorbance at red and blue wavelengths. Overall, as time continued on the absorbances of the enriched chloroplasts decreased, thus leading to the conclusion of that as that the DCPIP absorbance is inversely proportional trendwise to the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts. In other words, as absorbance goes down, the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts increases.  A particular study that emphasizes our findings, which studied the effects of varied wavelengths of green light specifically in lettuce. This study stated that “green light is absorbed only weakly by chlorophylls and pigments extracted from green leaves” (Johkan, 128). This summarizes the idea that as a result of the green light being reflected by the plant, it likely will not be absorbed an extensive amount compared to red, white and blue light either combined or individually, which absorbs more light (Johkan, 128). Although this study did not use different types of light, it still helps to emphasize our overall hypothesis, that there is a significant difference in the photosynthetic rate of plants that are exposed to light at different wavelengths. Next, another study that could also strengthen our point looked directly at the combination of red and blue light and determined that they have the highest impact on plant growth due to that fact that they are resources for photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation (Lin, 87).  The possible errors that could be found throughout this experiment could be seen through the health and age of the spinach plant. If they were older or unhealthy plants, it would have a negative effect on the results of the experiment overall. Additionally, it is possible a minor procedural error through the pipetting or the transferring of the cuvettes could have an effect on the data. There are a variety of different studies that could expand this topic of study. One possible future study could be using a different plant as opposed to spinach or continuing using different types of light at various wavelengths. Additionally, it is possible to collect absorbances for longer than 30 minutes, which could give us a broader time period to analyze and interpret the effects of altered wavelengths of light. Overall, these findings show that wavelength and type of light plays a key role in the photosynthetic rate of plants due to the fact that the light reaction portion of the process photosynthesis is dependent on light.
