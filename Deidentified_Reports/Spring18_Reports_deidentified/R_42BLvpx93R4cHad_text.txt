Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of this study will be to determine if increases in Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta will result in larger larva instead of full adulthood. JH Hormone is the hormone responsible for determining which molt a Manduca sexta molts into, and therefore, if manipulated it could trigger yet another molt stage of a larger larva. Before pupation Juvenile Hormone level in Manduca sexta heavily decrease, so could an excess amount of Juvenile Hormone keep Manduca sexta in a continual larval stage? By feeding Manduca sexta food with an increased level of Juvenile Hormone, and by tracking their growth, we determined that, in comparison to the Control Group, the Manduca sexta did not pupate or grow faster than that of their Control counterparts. 


Introduction:
In this study, we will be examining the insect, the Manduca sexta. It is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera; the same order that most moths, butterflies, and skippers belong too (Johnson, 2016) The Manduca sexta spends most of its life as a caterpillar in a larva like stage. After its fifth instar stage, the Manduca sexta enters what is known as the pupal stage, to which in matures into an adult. The life cycle of a Manduca sexta is regulated by hormones: specifically, Ecdysterone and Juvenile hormone. Ecdysterone is responsible got regulating the timing of when the Manduca sexta molts, while Juvenile Hormone (JH) is responsible for regulating which specific molt the Manduca sexta molts (Johnson, 2016). Right before pupation, JH level decrease heavily while Ecdysterone increase. In this experiment, we will be examining two different groups of Manduca sexta larva and the effects an increase in Juvenile Hormone has on overall growth. Our dependent variable will be how much growth, in the measureable units of weight, is apparent, while our independent variable will be the methoprene and Juvenile hormone found in Precore solution.  If Manduca sexta are continually exposed to high levels of Juvenille Hormones, which can be traced through the Juvenile hormone analogue methorprene which will be infused with regular Manduca sexta  diet, they will continue to molt into different instar stages of Manduca sexta: meaning they will increase in weight and size, and never fully reach adulthood as moths, but instead larger larva. 


Materials and Methods:
1.	Select 4, 11-12 day-old Manduca sexta caterpillars of all the same relative size. It is better if they are small to begin with since they are going to grow.
2.	Create 4 rearing containers with one divider down the middle. This should leave you with 8 separate halves in which your Manduca sexta will live. 
3.	Mix and create 10 grams of food for each of the 8 Manduca sexta
•	Control: 10 grams of regular Floss Manduca sexta diet food mixed with 12 drops of water.
•	JH Treatment: 10 grams of Manduca sexta diet food mixed with 12 drops of Precore methoprene and JH based solution.  
4.	Place all of the Manduca sexta caterpillars into their designated incubating containers and label each container either Control or Precore. 
5.	Incubate all Manduca sexta at a consistent temperature of 25 Celsius, in a 12 hour dark:12 hour light cycle. 
6.	Replace food once it begins to dry and as necessary. 
7.	Weigh and record each caterpillar every day for 7 days.


Results:
The Control group grew on average and as a group grew more than that of the Precor JH treatment group: the control group growing an average of 9.28 grams and the Precore JH treatment group growing an average of 5.6 grams. The Control group was much more active towards the beginning of the week. They ate the most food and were extremely large by the last day. However, on day 6, the Control Group severely stopped moving and functioning. Although they were not dead, they barely moved to just eat. However, on the other hand, the Precore treatment group was characterized by decreased movement in the beginning of the week, with more movement that the Control group on day 7. Similarly, the food for both group was changed about twice a day after weighing either because there was not enough food, or it was dry. The mean weight of the group after examining both the control and Precor JH treatment group was not significantly greater than its mean before consuming the Precore methoprene JH analogue food (t-stat = 2.23172, df = 6, P = 0.067107).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our experiment because, as outlined in the data, the control group grew more than the Precore JH hormone group like we initially hypothesized. The experiment was not successful because none of the Manduca sexta reached pupation. If they had reached pupation then, as a group, we could have determined if they would reach yet another instar group. However, we can detail that the control group did grow faster and therefore would have reached pupation before that of the Precore JH treatment group. According to other studies, an influx of JH should be responsible for excess growth, yet that was not the case within our experiment (M.H. Browder, 2001). The next logical step in this experiment would be to redo it, but for a longer period of days. A week was simply not enough to know if the Manduca Sexta would pupate and create larger instar larva.
