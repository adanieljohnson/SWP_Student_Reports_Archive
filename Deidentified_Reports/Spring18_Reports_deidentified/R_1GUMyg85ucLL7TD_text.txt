Title: The Effect of a Calcium Channel Blocker on Muscle Contraction in a Frog Leg

Abstract:
Muscle 	contraction is an intricate process that is dependent upon many different ions to spark action potentials. Manipulating different ion concentrations allows us to better understand the process. In this experiment, we are inserting lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg to see its effect on threshold amplitude. Because lanthanum chloride is a calcium channel blocker, calcium will have a difficult time being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and action potentials will be scarce. We hypothesized that the lanthanum chloride would produce a higher threshold amplitude. In order to determine the threshold amplitude, we used a computer software program. We calculated the threshold value three separate times for both control and both treatment groups. After gathering all the data from the class, we completed a two sample t-test. It produced a P-value of 0.96. This P-value indicated that the groups are not significantly different. 

Introduction:
The muscular system of a species’ body is largely dependent upon the neuromuscular system. The contraction, or movement, of the muscles require action potentials. For an action potential to occur, acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter released due to nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction, must be released from the presynaptic terminal. The binding of acetylcholine to its receptor site on the muscle fiber then causes sodium channels to open and a resulting action potential to occur [Queensland Brain Institute: 2017]. The action potential then travels throughout the muscle, where it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a calcium storage unit within the muscle, and calcium is released, and the muscle fiber is able to shorten, or contract [Rüegg: 1992]. 

The ions such as sodium and calcium are extremely important in the function of the neuromuscular system. Calcium ion concentration, in particular, is very important in the contraction of muscles [Excitation Contraction Coupling, http://muscle.ucsd.edu/musintro/ecc.shtml]. In order to understand the effects of their absence in this system, in this experiment we will add lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg. How will the muscle respond to the addition of this calcium channel blocker? Will the threshold be increased or decreased? We hypothesize that, as the lanthanum chloride is added, the threshold value will be increased. We hypothesize that, because some of the calcium channels will be blocked, calcium will not be able to be released and cause an action potential as quickly as if the calcium channels were open, yielding a higher threshold value in the treatment leg. 


Materials and Methods:
To test the effect of a calcium channel blocker on the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog, we used syringes to administer the lanthanum chloride. We used a control group to compare the myograms of the treatment groups. Upon collecting the data, a statistical t-test was used to compare the average threshold values between the two groups. 
We first obtained two frog legs. The dissection procedure was the same for both the control and treatment leg. We labeled one leg as the control and the other as the treatment. 
We dissected the frog leg, separating the top portion of the gastrocnemius muscle from the bone. We then attached a piece of thread around the top portion of the muscle and looped it around the hook hanging down from the FT-302 transducer. We made sure there was enough tension in the thread so that the muscle was standing straight up. We cut two small pieces of the silver thread and tied each around the muscle in two different locations, one towards the top and one towards the bottom of the muscle. We then attached the probes to the thread in the two different locations. Using the computer software program, we determined the threshold value by starting at an amplitude value of 0 and increased in small increments. The smallest value at which the muscle contracts was the threshold value. We recorded the threshold three separate times, each time starting at a threshold of 0. Since we only had two frog legs, we performed the control and treatment procedure on both legs. After determining the threshold values with no blocker administered, we added 0.1ml of lanthanum chloride to the gastrocnemius muscle, inserting the syringe at an angle into two different locations on the muscle, one towards the top and one towards the bottom. We then waited ten minutes before repeating the process of determining the threshold value three times using the computer software system. 


Results:

The bar graph shows that the control group had a higher threshold amplitude than did the treatment group. These values were determined by averaging the data collected from the two sections combined. To interpret this data, we performed a two sample, one tailed t-test. This gave us a P-value of 0.96.


Discussion:
A P-value of 0.96 is much larger than the ideal P-value of 0.05. This large P-value indicates that the groups are not statistically significantly different. This shows that there may have been other factors affecting the threshold amplitude, rather than the presence of a calcium channel blocker. The treatment group has a lower average value of threshold amplitude than the control group, showing the opposite of what we predicted. This causes us to have to reject our alternate hypothesis and accept our null hypothesis, stating that lanthanum chloride did not have a significant effect on threshold.
