Title: The Impact of Lidocaine (Sodium Channel Blocker) on the Muscle Contraction of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
	Ion channels are essential in controlling muscle contraction. In this experiment, we specifically focused on sodium ion channel. We wanted to know what would happen to muscle contraction if sodium ion channels were blocked. We measured the muscle contraction level of frog leg before and after lidocaine (a kind of sodium channel blocker) treatment. We hypothesized when applied with same stimulus, the muscle contraction would decrease if sodium channels were blocked. Our result failed to support our hypothesis. The further experiment could be done to find the relationship between the amount of lidocaine used and the muscle contraction level.

Introduction:
	Nervous system controls skeletal muscle system by regulating the ions flow into and out of the cells. Sodium channels are one of the ion channels that are essential in nerves signaling muscle contraction. In nervous system, they open to allow large amount of sodium ions flush in during depolarization (Hodgkin, 1952). In muscular system, after acetylcholine (Ach) being released by the axon ends and binding with postsynaptic receptors on muscle cells, sodium channels open, allowing the action potential to spread down T tubules to activate further steps which finally results in muscle contraction (Johnson, 2018). We wanted to know what would happen to muscle contraction response if sodium channels were blocked and sodium ions could not flush in to the cells. We chose Rana pipien’s leg as our study subject, because Rana pipien’s leg could be easily dissected for experiments. We planned to activate the sciatic nerve with electrical probes and to measure the response of gastrocnemius muscle, which contraction is controlled by sciatic nerve. We would use a computer program named LabScribe toolbar to measure the gastrocnemius muscle contraction response. We used lidocaine as the sodium channel blocker. We hypothesized when applied with same amount of stimulus, the muscle without sodium channel blocker would contract more than the muscle with sodium channel blocker.

Materials and Methods:
    Our study subjects were 3 Rana pipien’s legs. For each leg, we carefully skinned it, and we separated the inner thigh muscle to expose the sciatic nerve. Then, we separated gastrocnemius muscle and peroneus muscle by cutting open the Achilles tendon. We tied the lower end of gastrocnemius muscle with a string and hanged it up so it appeared at 90 degrees in perspective to the peroneus muscle. We attached the electrical probes with the sciatic nerve and applied the electrical stimulus of 0.2V, the number of pulses of 0, and the stimulus duration of 5ms. The response of muscle contraction was measured by the computer and was recorded. After that, we injected 0.1mL of 25mM lidocaine directly to the gastrocnemius muscle, and applied 0.2V electrical stimulus again to the sciatic nerve. The response of muscle contraction was measured and recorded. We ran a paired t-test on our data.

Results:
    The average muscle contraction response of 3 study subjects with and without lidocaine is shown on figure 1. The average muscle response without lidocaine (1.163V) is higher than the average muscle response with lidocaine (0.921V). However, the difference between before and after lidocaine treatment is not statistically significant (t=2.4, p=0.138).

Discussion:
    Our results indicated that on average, the gastrocnemius muscle contracted more when it was without lidocaine than with lidocaine. However, the statistical test failed to support a significant difference between 2 average contractions. Thus, we failed to support our hypothesis that the muscle treated with sodium channel blocker (lidocaine) would show less contraction compared to the muscle without sodium channel blocker treatment when the same stimulus was applied. However, studies have shown that inactivation of sodium channels caused gene mutation could cause varies muscle disorders like muscle stiffness and paralysis (Simkin, 2011), which indicates the possible influence of sodium channel block having on muscle contraction.
    There may be some errors in our experiment that leaded to our finding. Firstly, we may not evenly inject the lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle, so some parts of sodium channels were not blocked. Also, the amount of lidocaine we injected into the muscle may be too small to block all sodium channels. Moreover, our sample size was small, and the graph showed large variation in the response to the same level of stimulus, so there was a chance that our subjects were skewed.
	Understanding how lidocaine function in blocking sodium channels and affecting muscle function can help us better understand the lidocaine’s application in medical practices. Lidocaine is used as an anesthesia in medicine (Lidocaine, 2018). Further study can be done to find the relationship between the amount of lidocaine (sodium channel blocker) used and the level of muscle contraction.
