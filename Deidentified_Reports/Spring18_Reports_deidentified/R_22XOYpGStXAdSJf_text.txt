Title: The Effect of Potassium Channel Blocker on Muscle Relaxation 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the relaxation time on a frog leg before and after it was injected with a the potassium blocker, 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl (TEA Cl). We hypothesize that injecting the frog leg with the potassium blocker will cause the leg to stay contracted for longer and thus have a longer relaxation time than the control frog that was the same leg but had no injection of potassium blocker. The injection of the potassium blocker was done to determine how manipulation of ions in a frog leg had on the nerve and muscle contractions. In the experiment three frog legs were dissected, during which we exposed the sciatic nerve in order to connect it to a computer and sleeve electrodes, so that we could stimulate impulses which allowed us to get a myogram for the muscle contraction. This process was done on three frog legs before and after they were injected. The results collected showed a general trend of noticeable increase in relaxation time in the frog after injected. However, the p-value from our data was 0.1359 which indicates weak statistical evidence that our results supported our hypothesis. We determined that this could be due to the tiring of the leg muscle before we could test it with the injection, contamination of the frog legs with the blocker before it was 

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles in the body work together to allow organisms to respond to stimuli. They are similar to hormones in this way, however they can respond within milliseconds rather than seconds to days like hormones. The process starts with the neuron in the muscle. Axons of the motor neurons extend into the muscle and they branch out in the body. These neurons have a meeting point called neuromuscular junction, and this is where acetylcholine is released when nerve impulses arrive [Johnson: 2018].  The ACh binds with a receptor, which opens Na+ channels allowing an action potential to be generated in the muscle fiber. The action potential causes a release of Ca+ which activates the contractile mechanism in the muscle. In this lab, we want to test the effects of introducing a potassium blocker, 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl (TEA Cl). In comparison to this, another study was done proving the viability of the effects the introduction of a chemical to the nerve and muscle can have on neuron firing and muscle contraction [Hille: 1968]. In this experiment, we will be using Rana pipiens a species of frog. This frog is used because we can easily dissect away the skin to expose the nerve and we are also able to expose the tissues for us to put in probes and measure the responses. It is also shown in other studies that the tissues in frog legs are not depressed or depolarization is not blocked by the introduction of certain chemicals which is important because we need to know the results are due to the injectin of the potassium blocker not another chemical exposed by what we cleaned the materials we used in lab were [Inoue and Frank: 1967]. Our hypothesis is based on how potassium ions in a channel allow the muscle to repolarize the neuron when the action potential has been fired, thus if there was potassium blocker introduced they would not be able to repolarize the neuron allowing the muscle to relax [Johnson: 2018]. We hypothesize that injecting the frog leg with the potassium blocker will cause the leg to stay contracted for longer and thus have a longer relaxation time than the control frog that was the same leg but had no injection of potassium blocker.


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we were given three frog legs. We began by removing the skin, then we exposed the end of the white sciatic nerve through dissecting into the inner thigh muscle at the top of the leg. While doing this we made sure the nerve was handled carefully and that the leg was kept moist with the Ringer’s solution. We then unattached the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg so that we could attach a string and hold up the muscle with tension. Then my group used sleeve electrodes, to stimulate the nerve directly, along with the computer program in order to take a myogram of each muscle contraction. We then determined the threshold for the leg, then took the relaxation time at an amplitude above the threshold under normal conditions on the frog leg. Once this was found we injected the same frog leg with 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl (TEA Cl, a potassium channel blocker), and waited a few minutes for it to take effect on the frog leg. Once it had we repeated the process of find the threshold and taking a relaxation time at the same amplitude applied to the frog leg before the injection. This process was repeated on all three frog legs. Then we compared the length of relaxation times before and after the injection using a paired t-test.


Results:
The general trends you notice from the data collected on the control frogs versus the same frog leg injected with potassium blocker is that the injected frog leg had a longer relation time in milliseconds, this is illustrated in Figure 1. In table 1, we are given the p-value of 0.1359, is insignificant.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that injecting the frog leg with the potassium blocker will cause the leg to stay contracted for longer and thus have a longer relaxation time than the control frog had weak statistical evidence that it was supported because our calculated p-value was 0.1359. However, the general trend of relaxation times was longer for the grog leg after it was injected with the potassium blocker. This makes sense based on the idea of repolarization in a neuron because potassium ions in a channel allow the muscle to repolarize the neuron when the action potential has been fired, thus if there was potassium blocker introduced they would not be able to repolarize the neuron which allows the muscle to relax [Johnson: 2018]. Thus, interfering with the potassium introduces problems in the functioning of the neuron and causes a delay in the process. Our experiment could have been statistically weak for a number of reasons. It was either contamination on the dissection board, because we did each frog leg one by one so the board was introduced to blocker and then we would try and clean the materials and start over on the next but it could have still been exposed. In another experiment, they were analyzing the interactions among the neuron and nerve impulse to determine if there is a difference in animal’s nerve conduction velocity because of their structure [Ahmed, Malik, Azeem, & Noushad: 2012]. This brought to light yet another explanation can be found in other research on the idea that the right and left leg in a frog could have different contraction abilities and from frog to frog it also varies widely, therefore causing drastic number differences between the three frogs [Ahmed, Malik, Azeem, & Noushad: 2012]. It could also be due to the idea that the control frog was exposed to the impulses and it tired the muscle out before we could get completely accurate number. Finally, the last contribution of error was due to the fact that after we injected the frog leg it continued to have small contraction on its own, so we had to collect data with the impulse, for time purposes, while the frog leg was still reacting to the injection. The next step in this experiment would be to retest frog legs not treated and treated with potassium blocker, however this time try and eliminate some of the variables that could have introduced error and caused weak statistical evidence. Once this is done, other steps could include looking at more values that just relaxation time to see if it affects any other aspects of the muscle contraction. We care about other data points because we have not found statistical evidence for what is affected by injecting the potassium channel blocker so collecting other data could show what is affected.
