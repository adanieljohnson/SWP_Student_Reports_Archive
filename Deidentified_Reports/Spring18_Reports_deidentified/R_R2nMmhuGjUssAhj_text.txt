Title: Effects of Neomycin, as an IP3 Pathway Inhibitor, on Physarum polycephalum plasmodium’s Cytoplasmic Streaming

Abstract:
Signal transduction pathways are a way for cells to receive signals, interpret them accurately, and respond accordingly. Within the inositol triphosphate signal transduction pathway, phospholipase C acts as the second messenger and produces the rest of the cellular response to the signal received. In this experiment, the effects of neomycin, a phospholipase C inhibitor, on cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium are tested. The results proved that in the presence of neomycin, the oscillations in cytoplasmic streaming decreased in distance and time, and the longer the neomycin was there, the smaller the oscillations got. This was a result of neomycin inhibiting the IP3 signaling pathway, which is linked to dynamics of the membrane-cytoskeleton movement in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium slime mold.

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways are responsible for facilitating the recognition and effects of stimuli by identifying and using various outside signals to create responses (Berg et al. 2002). IP3, Inositol Triphosphate, is a small molecule that is formed when an extracellular regulatory molecule binds to a membrane receptor and activates a G protein. The alpha subunit of the G protein activates phospholipase C, which acts on a membrane phospholipid and cleaves off IP3 (Firtel et al. 1989). It then gets released into the cytosol where it acts to signal the release of calcium ions. The cytosol normally has a low calcium concentration due to calcium pumps exporting ions across the plasma membrane and into the endoplasmic reticulum, and as a result the endoplasmic reticulum is a storage location for calcium ions in the cell. IP3 is responsible for releasing these calcium ions by binding to ligand-gated calcium channels, which causes calcium levels to increase in the cytosol and the result is various cellular responses. If neomycin, an antibiotic, is present it will inhibit the IP3-mediated calcium ion release from the endoplasmic reticulum, as this antibiotic inhibits PLC, or Phospholipase C, which in turn doesn’t allow for IP2 to transition to IP3 and for the rest of the pathway to occur normally (Prentki et al. 1986).
A model by which you could go about whether or not PLC plays a role in oscillatory behavior, and what the inhibitory effects of neomycin on this behavior are, is Physarum polycephalum plasmodium. Cytoplasmic streaming, the specific oscillatory behavior in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, is the movement of the cytoplasm within a cell in the forward and reverse direction, and it is responsible for the transport of proteins, nutrients, and other necessary things throughout the cell. Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is a good model organism to observe signal transduction pathways that allow cells to respond to stimuli because it is single-celled organism similar to amoebas in that it has everything within one plasma membrane (Grigoriev et al. 2016). Each Physarum polycephalum plasmodium essentially acts as one big cell, so cell processes are easily observable. The cytoplasmic streaming changes direction frequently and in response to various factors, which means that the changes in flow and direction must be by a signaling mechanism. Observing the flow in strands of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium makes it possible to see changes in rate, length, and direction of oscillations, all of which are a result of signaling within the plasma membrane. Therefore, observing the changes in rate, length, and direction of oscillations in the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium containing neomycin should reveal the effects of the neomycin on the signaling pathways within the model organism.
In previous experiments, when neomycin has been added to slime mold, there were bulges of the membrane, which is a typical effect of PIP2 blockers. The filling of the bulges with protoplasm caused “bead” formation which decreased the oscillation period and amplitude, as well as intracellular pressure (Matveeva et al. 2014). The effect of neomycin as an inhibitor of phospholipase C, which binds with PIP2 in the membrane, on the slime mold strands is a shorter oscillation period while under the effects of neomycin than before the neomycin was added (Matveeva et al. 2014). Based on previous knowledge and exploration of this mechanism, it is hypothesized that neomycin causes the length of the oscillation periods of Physarum polycephalum plasmodium to be shorter.


Materials and Methods:
To see the effects of neomycin on the slime mold, cytoplasmic streaming was observed in a set of plates and times were recorded regarding the direction of oscillation. Stock plates were cultured for 5 days on water agar plates, and each had two-1 cm2 of Physarum polycephalum plasmodium. They were kept at 37 degrees Celsius in darkness before being used in the lab. When conducting this experiment, three plates were used, and each was placed under a phase microscope for a clear view of the movement within the strands of the mold. To make results consistent, one strand was selected on each plate to be observed for all readings. To provide a frame of reference for the experimental results, 3 baseline readings per plate were taken of the slime mold by timing from the beginning of movement in one direction to when the streaming reversed direction. Because it was unclear how pipetting the neomycin directly onto the strands of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium would affect the mold, water was pipetted onto the plates first. 100 microliters of water was added to the strand on each plate, and movement was still observable and as a result it was confirmed that pipetting neomycin directly onto the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium strands would be an acceptable procedural step. 3 times were recorded for each plate after the water was added, following the same guidelines as before. Before adding anything else to the plate, the water was removed with the pipette. A neomycin solution was then created by taking a 1 mg/mL solution and performing a 1:6 dilution to create a 142 ug/mL neomycin solution to use on the plates. This dilution was performed to help inflate the effect of neomycin by creating a solution of reasonable concentration. 100 uL of this neomycin solution was pipetted onto the selected strand in each agar plate to form a bubble completely covering the strand, and 1 minute was waited before observing and taking time readings. This 1 minute was waited to ensure that the neomycin was given time to set in and begin affecting the signaling and therefore cytoplasmic streaming of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium samples. Times were observed and recorded at 1 minute, 11 minutes, and 21 minutes after the introduction of the neomycin. After all data was recorded, a two tailed t-test was used to analyze the results with a critical value of 0.05 to determine statistical significance.

Results:
Overall the observed oscillation times for cytoplasmic streaming in the slime mold strands decreased across the timed trials. When water was added, the average time of flow in a certain direction was 61.7  7.9 s. 1 minute after neomycin was added, the average time was 63.6  18.0 s. 11 minutes after neomycin was added, the average time was 50.3  18.6 s. 21 minutes after neomycin was added, the average time was 44.4  12.4 s. When comparing the results after 1 minute to water and 11 minutes to water were not significant. The results after 21 minutes when compared to water were significant (t(2)=6.12, p=0.026). 


Discussion:
There is a significant difference between the oscillations of cytoplasmic streaming in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium in the presence of water and neomycin-inhibited Physarum polycephalum plasmodium. It was hypothesized that the length of oscillations in the slime mold would decrease with the addition of neomycin, and the results from timing after 21 minutes proved this to be correct. As a result of oscillation periods of smaller distances, the length of time over which the oscillations occurred also decreased. A common effect of PIP2 inhibitors is the creation of bulges in the strands that fill with protoplasm and therefore reduce the intracellular pressure, oscillations, and amplitudes. Additionally, as found by Matveeva et al., the oscillation period was shorter after the time with the neomycin than before it was added (Matveeva et al. 2014). This means that the oscillation periods after 1 minute and 11 minutes were longer than they were after 21 minutes, which is correlated with the longer observed times for unidirectional movement after less time. Furthermore, the oscillation period will eventually start to increase due to the elongation of the contraction phase, which occurs after the shortening of the oscillation period. As more and more time passed with the neomycin on the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium, it gradually started to bind PIP2 that was free as a result of oscillations. This binding created competition with the phospholipase C for the PIP2, which could be affected by the presence of PIP2-binding proteins that move as a result of oscillations and contractions in the slime mold (Matveeva et al. 2014). In another study it was found that inhibitors similar to neomycin can even prevent oscillation of mechanical and electrical activity of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium plasmodium, which makes sense as it can also prevent normal functioning of mechanosensitive calcium ion channels in the plasmodial membrane (Grigoriev et al. 2016). All of these findings point to the presence of some type of signaling system that is somehow related to the movement of the membrane and cytoskeleton (Grigoriev et al. 2016). The results from this experiment with Physarum polycephalum plasmodium and neomycin are consistent with these findings, which speak to how observing slime mold and its oscillations relate to signaling transduction pathways and possible inhibitors. The effect of neomycin inhibiting PLC and not allowing for IP2 to go to IP3 in the signaling system in turn affects the dynamics of the membrane-cytoskeleton association, which is why the oscillations and contraction phases varied with the addition of neomycin after different intervals of time.
	The possible errors in the experiment performed could be found in the introduction of water and neomycin into the plates. When pipetting the water and neomycin onto a strand, it was very easy to accidentally touch the strand directly. It was also difficult to keep track of one strand to observe for all readings, and as a result oscillation rates could have been affected by observing different strands with different baseline times. After performing this experiment and analyzing the results, it was seen that there is potential for future studies to further investigate the inhibitory effects on Physarum polycephalum plasmodium. The effects of the neomycin on the IP3 pathway and therefore on the oscillation period is a logical explanation for the decrease in recorded times over time, but there are other explanations that could play a role. It is possible that with the addition of neomycin, it takes longer to build up pressure, which would have a large effect on when the strand would stop or switch direction of streaming. So, it is possible that neomycin is affecting the strand’s ability to build up pressure to change direction. It is also possible that the decrease in time is a result of simply a faster rate of movement within the strands. Because of the other explanations, it would be interesting to conduct an experiment with the same procedure but recording rates of movement within a strand rather than times for movement in a one direction.
	Overall, this lab supported the hypothesis that the oscillation period, in distance and time, decreased with the addition of neomycin. This was a result of neomycin inhibiting the IP3 pathway and therefore affecting the entire signaling pathway, which is linked to dynamics of the membrane-cytoskeleton movement in Physarum polycephalum plasmodium slime mold.
