Title: The Effect of Precor Hormone on Manduca Sexta Weight

Abstract:
The experiment conducted below was created to test the effects of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the development of Manduca Sexta organism. The concentration of Precor hormone (JH) was determined from previous studies and we hypothesized that a significent amount of Precor would decrease the Manduca Sexta’s weight. Four caterpillars were set up as a controll group and four caterpillars were set up as an experimental group. The controll group used distilled water in their food diet while the experimental group had the concentration of Precor in the food. The weight of the caterpillars was recorded after eight days and with statistical test, it was concluded that the hypothesis was not supported in this experiment and the concentration of Precor did not decrease each Manduca Sexta’s weight. 


Introduction:
Hormones controll growth, development and behavior in living organisms. In insects specifically, hormones such as the juvenile hormone are necessary for the insect to move through all life stages (Johnson). The Manduca Sexta (Order Lepidoptera) is an example of holometabolous life cycle – their cycle contains four stages before peeking into adulthood. Two hormones that can be used on the Manduca Sexta organism are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). The ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting while the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt. The juvenile hormone ensures growth in the larva but it decreases level during the pupation stage. It is vital for insects to fulfil their complete development into adulthood. One of the stages in which the Manduca Sexta goes through – pupal – corresponds to the testing of JH effects. According to previous research, increasing the juvenile hormone will decrease the weight of the insect (Fain, Riddiford). They state that the accurate level of JH should be about 2e10-5 μg. If we treat the Manduca Sexta with the approximately JH level of 2e10-5 μg, then their weight will decrease. 


Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, we divided our eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups and place them into plastic containers. The containers had a taped down index card to create two sections in each container. Holes on the top of the container lid were left uncovered. The controll group was fed 10mg of food with 0.15Ml of distilled water. The experimental group was fed 10 mg of food with 0.15Ml of 4% concentration of Precor (JH) hormone. Each of the four containers were kept under the same conditions of 25 ° C with 12 hours of dark/12 hours of light. For 8 days, we recorded the weight of each caterpillar every day. On the last day, a 2 sample one-tail T- test was completed. 


Results:
Our hypothesis was not supported in this experiment. We stated that the 0.15Ml of precor on the Manduc Sexta would decrease their weight. Our data shows that the Manduca Sexta organisms increased in weight from the 0.15Ml 4% concentration of Precor. The average weight for the controll group was 1.30g and the average weight for the experimental group was 1.42g. After conducting the T-test, the P value found was 0.857, which supports that our data was not statically significent. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis of adding 0.15Ml of 4% concentration of Precor to Manduca Sexta’s food was not supported because the organisms gained weight throughout the experiment. There was no weight decrease as stated in our hypothesis because the JH hormone regulates the growth in the caterpillar’s larva stage. Our caterpillars gained weight but only in their larva stage – they did not reach adulthood so therefore there was no (William.). Our P value was 0.857 shows that the two set of data are not statistically significent. This supports the indication that Precor of 0.15Ml 4% concentration had specific influence on the weight of the caterpillars. 
	For future investigations, the experiment should be repeated with varying amounts of hormone concentration to find the point at which the caterpillars decrease in weight and increase in weight. More caterpillars should be added in to account for the random error of weight fluctuation that affected the trend of the experiment. Improving the experiment with these suggestions could potentially result in more accurate results of the effect of Precor on the Manduca Sexta

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The figure above shows the average weights of both the controll group and the experimental group on day 1 of the experiment and of day 8. Both groups increased in average weight over the course of this experiment. There was no significent difference in ending weight between both groups. One of the controllled larva decreased in weight, which accounts for the large margin of error on the controll group day 8 set of data.
