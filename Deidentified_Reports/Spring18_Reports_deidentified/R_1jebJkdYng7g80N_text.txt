Title: EDTA/SrCl Inhibition of Physarum polycephalum Chemotaxis and Plasmodium Growth

Abstract:
Signaling is important for communication and execution of functions in organisms. Chemotaxis - movement/growth towards a chemical stimulus is an advanced behavior exhibited by Physarum polycephalum. The secondary messenger of IP3 GPCR and calcium channel pathways, Ca2+, activates actin microfilament assembly. Strontium Chloride and EDTA solutions block and inhibit surface channels, so we hypothesized that SrCl and EDTA would disrupt normal chemotaxis behavior of P. polycephalum. The experiment tested 3 groups, a control, Ca2+, and EDTA/SrCl enriched agar. Growth was measured after a 15 and 24 hour incubation intervals. An excel t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variance (cv=0.05) was used to determine significance from the control group.  After 24 hours, we saw consistent growth in the control group, averaging 38 mm. The EDTA/SrCl group was completely inhibited, having 0 mm of growth. A p-value of 0.00764 confirmed its statistical significance. From our data, we could conclude that a solution of EDTA/SrCl effectively inhibits the chemotaxis growth of P. polycephalum.

Introduction:
Signaling plays an important role in the communication and execution of functions in organisms. Signals propagate intracellular responses directly leading to changes in gene expression, movement, division, and many others. While signaling tends to be more simplistic in unicellular organisms, the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum is used as a model organism. P. polycephalum organizes its signaling pathways into rules-based logic gates. This organism likely developed this level of complexity as a direct result of its identity as a multinucleate synctium (containing multiple nuclei within a single plasma membrane) [Johnson: 2016]. Chemotaxis - movement/growth towards a chemical stimulus - is one of several advanced behaviors exhibited by P. polycephalum, and is the area of focus in this experiment. Upon detection of a desirable chemical in the surrounding environment, P. polycephalum’s leading edge, plasmodium, will actively move towards the stimulus using actin microfilament assembly. The signaling pathway to activate this process can begin in one of two ways: with surface calcium channels or G-Protein Coupled Receptor embedded in the plasma membrane. After a ligand binds the GPCR, the alpha region of the heterotrimeric G-protein is activated and moves along the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane until it effects phospholipase C. PL-C cleaves a membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol into two secondary messenger molecules: diacylglycerol, and IP3, which stimulates Ca2+ release from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium activates the actin microfilament assembly leading to growth towards the stimulus. [Ridgeway: 1976] A key fact is that the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ is kept very low, so any sudden change in concentration has significant intracellular effects. Calcium surface channels are also a factor of maintaining this homeostasis, and controlling its intracellular concentration. Calcium can be secreted by the P. polycephalum or absorbed, causing similar effects to the calcium of the IP3 pathway. Strontium Chloride and EDTA solutions have been known to block and inhibit surface channels of this pathway [Olenhusen: 1979], so we hypothesized that the presence of SrCl and EDTA in the extracellular environment would inhibit the normal chemotaxis of P. polycephalum.

Materials and Methods:
We began with a culture of P. polycephalum grown in at 37*C in a water agar petri dish. The culture was cut into 1 cm cubes for later transfer. We set up three experimental groups with three replicates each. Each petri dish was wrapped in tin foil, incubated, and measured for growth at a 15 and 24 hour interval. Additionally, each dish had three central 1 cm cubes spaced 1 cm apart. The middle cube contained the block of P. polycephalum, the right hand block was glucose agar (25mM) (positive control) with an oat on top, and the left hand block was a blank control. The control group had normal agar and no additional solution added. This was considered the standard growing condition. The calcium group featured the same setup, but the independent variable (agar solution) was a Ca2+ ion solution (20mM) diluted 1 ml in 19 ml of deionized water. This dilution was evenly spread over the surface of each replicate and allowed to absorb into the agar. The EDTA/Strontium Chloride group was diluted and distributed in a similar fashion (1 ml (20mM) of each, and 18 ml of deionized water). After a 15 and 24 hours we measured the longest growth from the central P. polycephalum cube and its directionality. On excel we performed a t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variance with a critical value of 0.05 to test for statistical significance in growth relative to the control group. Outliers were removed from the data as per the Grubb’s statistical outlier test.

Results:
After the 15 hour incubation period, we saw very little growth among each of the groups with the exception of one replicate in the calcium group. After 24 hours, we saw consistent growth in the control group, averaging 38 mm. The calcium group finished with inconsistent growth - one replicate growing 32 mm and the other two growing only 1 or 3 mm. The EDTA/SrCl group was completely inhibited (following the removal of an obvious outlier), with the two relevant groups having 0 mm of growth. The directionality of the growth was very inconsistent, appearing to be random between each group. The excel t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variance (critical value 0.05)  yielded no statistical significance after 15 hours, but after 24 hours the EDTA/SrCl group had significantly less growth than the control group. EDTA/SrCl: T(3)=(t Stat=6.423,p=0.00764) p&lt;0.05.          

Discussion:
From our data, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that a solution of EDTA/SrCl effectively inhibits the chemotaxis growth of P. polycephalum. The control group consistently grew in the normal agar, but the EDTA/SrCl enriched agar effectively halted this growth. We can attribute this to the inhibitory function of EDTA and Strontium, blocking the signal transduction pathways that generate plasmodium growth. If the surface calcium channels are blocked, P. polycephalum will be unable to change its intracellular calcium concentration - leading to a disruption of pathways that rely on Ca2+ ions. Furthermore, EDTA is known to be a chelating agent, in other words, it binds metal ions such as Ca2+ [Dominguez: 2009]. This leads us to believe that EDTA/SrCl might do more than block surface channels; it may also effectively isolate and remove calcium ions from their functional role in the cell. Since calcium ions are required for the activation of actin microfilaments and leading edge growth [Hasegawa: 1980], an EDTA/SrCl solution would severely impair these mechanisms from both angles (i.e. Ca2+ sequestering and GPCR IP3 pathway). 
Although the experiment was successful, there were several sources of error that lead to data inconsistencies and an outlier. The depth of the agar varied by a few mm in each petri dish: this can cause problems with the agar’s ability to absorb the applied solution, in addition to creating uneven block heights upon transfer, which makes it difficult for the physarum to grow off of the block. Another source of error was the P. polycephalum culture itself: it is near impossible to generate identical 1cm cubes of P. polycephalum, which can lead to growing variance. Gaps between the blocks can also be an impediment to P. polycephalum growth. The only significant outlier came in the EDTA/SrCl group, in which one replicate grew more than any other in the entire experiment. This can be attributed to many things, but our best assumption is that the agar did not effectively absorb the applied solution. 
In future experiments, it is recommended that other factors surrounding leading edge growth are studied, such as inhibitory or amplifying agents. In this experiment we also included a calcium enriched agar group, assuming that it would be a positive control. The results were not what we expected - the calcium replicates averaged 14.33 mm of growth - much less than the 38 mm average of the control group. Consequently, we think it would be worthwhile to investigate why this result occurred, perhaps by setting up an experiment with different methods of calcium ion application (intra vs intercellular presence). This fits into the big picture of biochemical research because P. polycephalum is an ideal model organism for studying signaling. From research of P. polycephalum actin microfilaments, it is likely that we can apply any findings to actin microfilaments of Eukaryotes like Humans.
