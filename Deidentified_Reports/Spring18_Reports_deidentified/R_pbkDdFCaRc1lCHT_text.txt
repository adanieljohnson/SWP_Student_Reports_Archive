Title: Physarum Polyscephelum’s Chemotaxis when Subjected to Dibutrylyl-cAMP and Curcumin

Abstract:
	This experiment aimed to analyze the effects of Dibutrylyl cAMP, a Protein Kinase A activator, and Curcumin, a Protein Kinase A inhibitor, on the distance migrated during chemotaxis in Physarum Polyscephelum. It was hypothesized that when we exposed Physarum to Dibutrylyl cAMP, then there will be a significent increase in the distance migrated during chemotaxis. We tested this by recording the distance traveled when exposing Physarum to an agar plat which was soaked in an Dibutrylyl cAMP solution. Our results support this hypothesis because there was a significent increase in the distance migrated when compared to the controll. For the Curcumin portion of the experiment, we hypothesized that when physarum is exposed to curcumin, then the distance migrated during chemotaxis will be significently less than the controll. After subjecting physarum to an agar plate soaked with a curcumin solution, we concluded that there was no significent decrease in the distance migrated between the controll and the test plates. These results did not support our hypothesis which theorized a reduced distance migrated during chemotaxis. 


Introduction:
	In order for organisms to survive in continuously changing environment, organisms have to consistently respond to stimuli in their environment and change their behavior in response to these stimuli. An example of this is when Physarum polyscephelum, Physarum, detects chemicals that are found in their food, they respond by performing chemotaxis and migrate towards the food. In our experiment, we are determining if Physarum would increase or decrease its rate of chemotaxis and migrate more or less when exposed to a Protein Kinase A (PKA) activator and inhibitor. In a separate experiment, a study was conducted using Dibutrylyl-cAMP, and they determined that it acted as an activator for PKA, increasing its rate of gene regulation and changes in gene expressions [Derlacz, 1998]. We then hypothesized that if Physarum polyscephelum was subjected to Dibutrylyl-cAMP, then the physarum will travel a greater distance towards the food when compared to the controll. However in a separate lab, they studied the effects of Curcumin on PKA and they determined that it activated as a non-competitive inhibitor for cAMP, which inhibited the gene regulation and expression [Reddy, 1994]. Knowing this, we hypothesized that when Physarum polyscephelum was subjected to Curcumin, then the physarum would travel less towards the food when compared to the controll. We use physarum for this experiment because their cells are very similar to human cells. Furthermore, physarum response very evidently when exposed to different stimuli. This allows us to clearly observe the effects of the Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor, and record its response. 


Materials and Method:
In order to get the activators and Inhibitors infused with the agar plate, we created a solution that was 19 Ml of water, and 1 Ml of either curcumin or Dibutrylyl-cAMP which we soaked each agar plate with for 10 minutes. We then had to cut out locations for the Physarum and oat flakes for 3 agar plates for Dibutrylyl-cAMP infused, curcumin infused, and controlls. To get the physarum into the agar plate, we cut out 1cm by 1 cm pieces from a physarum stock plate and placed them in the holes cut previously. We wrapped all 9 agar plates with tin foil to inhibit phototaxis and placed in the incubator for 24 hours. After this amount of time, we recorded the distance traveled and the direction of the movement, and conducted two sample t_test to test significance.


Results:
	In this experiment, we observed an increase in the average distance migrated for both the Dibutrylyl cAMP and the Curcumin conditions when compared to the controll. Our data resulted with Dibutrylyl cAMP having the greatest distance migrated, with an average distance of 36.33 mm. This is seen in Figure 1. After conducting a two sample t_test, we determined that the data from the Dibutrylyl cAMP was significently different than the controll, with a P-value of 0.046 (t_stat= 2.86, d.f.=4). Curcumin also had a large increase in the distance of migration compared to the controll. It migrated 30.67 mm which is seen in Figure 1. However, after conduction a two sample t_test, we can determine that the data from the curcumin condition was not significently different than the controll, resulting in a P-value of 0.129 (t_stat=1.91 d.f.=4).


Discussion:
	In this experiment, we were trying to determine if physarum’s chemotaxis would be effected when it was subjected to a Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor.  It was hypothesized that when the Physarum was subjected to an environment with Dibutrylyl cAMP, an activator, then the distance of chemotaxis would increase. Our results supported our hypothesis because the average distance migrated was 36.33 mm compared to 9.33 in the controll. These results are seen in Figure 1. Then after conducting a two sample t_test, we conclude that there was a significent different between the Dibutrylyl cAMP condition and the controll (t_stat=2.86, d.f.=4, P-Value=0.046). There are other experiments that explain the increased distance migrated when physarum is exposed to Dibutrylyl cAMP. In another experiment, they determined that Protein Kinase A is crucial for the signaling for gene regulation, which leads to alteration of the actin cytoskeleton, creating movement [O’Connor 2001]. This explains our data, because dibutrylyl cAMP acts as an activator for PKA and a continuously activated PKA leads to continual alteration of the actin filaments that drive cellular movement. This increased movement of the actin filaments allow the physarum cells to push farther and farther towards the food, which would increase the distance migrated. Our data also discovered a large increase in the distance migrated for the Curcumin condition. The average distance migrated by the physarum in the curcumin condition, traveled 30.67 mm, which is seen in Figure 1. After conduction a two sampled t_test, we concluded that there was no significent difference between the distance migrated for the Curcumin condition compared to the controll (t_stat=1.91, d.f.=4, P-Value=0.129). Despite the insignificent data, we hypothesized that the distance of chemotaxis would have decreased when the physarum was exposed to the curcumin when compared to the controll. This data then did not support our hypothesis. However, there is a separate study suggest that Protein Kinase A controlls chemoattractant signal transduction [Scavello, 2017]. So with an inhibited PKA, then the physarum will not response normally to the chemicals released by the food, and will grow in any direction, not just toward the food. We experienced flaws throughout the experiment which impacted our results. We did not know the specific concentrations of the Dibutrylyl cAMP and the Curcumin solutions which we subjected our agar plate to, so we don’t know if it was a high enough concentration to affect the physarum. If it was not high enough, then the curcumin could have inhibited the physarum more, and reduced the distance migrated significently. For future experiments, we would like to know the specific concentrations, so we can have an accurate idea on the amount of activator and inhibitor molecules are in the plate. Another flaw we experienced was transferring equal concentrations of the solutions. We used a glass pipette and mixed thoroughly, but there could have been an agar plate that was soaked with a higher concentration of the inhibitor or activator solution. This would have created an unprecise set of data.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 depicts the average distance the Physarum migrated in millimeters when exposed to the three different plate conditions. After conducting a two sample t_test for Dibutrylyl cAMP, we can conclude that it did significently increased the distance of migration (t_stat=2.86, d.f.=4, P-Value=0.046). After conducting two sample t_test for Curcumin, we can conclude that it did not significently decrease the distance of migration (t_stat=1.91, d.f.=4, P-Value=0.129). The error bars are determined by the standard deviation for each sample, for the Control it was 16.17 mm, Dibutrylyl cAMP was 2.52 mm, and the Curcumin was 10.67 mm.
