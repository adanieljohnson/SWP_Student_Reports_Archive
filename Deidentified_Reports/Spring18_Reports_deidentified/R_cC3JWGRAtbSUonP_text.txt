Title: The Effect of Methoprene on the Molting Patterns of Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta)

Abstract:
This study tests the effects of methoprene, an insect growth regulator, on the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta), and its ability to pupate from a 4th instar larvae. A control group and treatment group were created, the treatment group receiving Precor, a chemical containing methoprene, in their food. Length and weight of the larvae were recorded. Two of the control group caterpillars began pupation, meanwhile none of the treatment group caterpillars began pupation. The hypothesis, which was that the consumption of Precor would result in the inability to molt into a pupae was proven correctly, however was not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta), a kind of holometabolous insect, develop and grow through a life cycle in which starts with an egg and ends with an adult phase[Johnson-2018]. This cycle, which consists of an egg stage, 5 instar larva stages, a pupa stage, and an adult stage, is controlled by hormones[Johnson-2018]. Two hormones, Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone, determine when and what phase a Manduca sexta molts into, which occurs between every phase[Johnson-2018]. Insect growth regulators(IGR) can interfere with or over-activate processes regulated by the insect hormones, such as juvenile hormones[Johnson-2018]. One of these IGRs, precor, contains methoprene, which mimics Juvenile hormone[Johnson-2018]. Consumption of methoprene by the Manduca sexta creates an increase in the JH function[Beckage-1982]. Manduca sexta in the larvae stage “can cause significant damage to tobacco crops”[Byron-2017], and are considered pests at this stage. Using IGRs may have the potential to decrease the population of Manduca sexta, and brings to question the potential effectiveness of using methoprene to inhibit the larvae from entering the pupae stage. The hypothesis is that increasing the levels of Juvenile Hormone through addition of Precor to food consumed by the caterpillars will cause the larvae in the 4th instar stage to be unable to molt into the 5th instar stage, and will not become an adult. Instead, the caterpillars will stay in the 4th instar stage until they die. 

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of tobacco hornworm caterpillars, all in their 4th instar larvae stages, were used. One group of four caterpillars was the control group, while the treatment group consisted of four caterpillars. Each caterpillar was placed in individual segments of 4 containers divided evenly by a sheet of paper. The control group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of standard food with 10 drops of distilled water per 10 grams of food. The treatment group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of standard food with 10 drops of Precor per 10 grams of food. The independent variable was treatment of Precor given to the treatment group instead of water. The caterpillars were stored in a refrigerator and taken out daily to be supplied with 10 grams of food, to be weighed, and to be measured for length. The statistical test used was using a two-sample T-Test, and the change in weight and lengths of the control and treatment groups were compared. 

Results:
The control group (average; 3.93±0.56) and treatment group (average; 4.1±0.35) had different average changes in length, with overlapping standard of deviation lines, as depicted in Figure 1. The results for the P-value, T-value, and degrees of Freedom are shown in Table #1 for the average weight difference of the groups, showing statistical insignificance (t-stat = 0.52, df = 6, P = 0.61958). The control group (average; 10.37±2.8) and treatment group (average; 11.13±0.69) had different average changes in weight, with overlapping standard of deviation lines, as depicted in Figure 2. The results for the P-value, T-value, and degrees of Freedom are shown in Table #2 for the average weight difference of the groups, showing statistical insignificance (t-stat = 0.53, df = 6, P = 0.62). Overall, the treatment group had higher averages.

Discussion:
The P-values of the weight and the length were both greater than 0.05. This means that there was a failure to reject the null hypothesis, as that the data was not statistically significant. Therefore, the data does not effectively support the hypothesis, in which claimed the caterpillars will be unable to grow into adults due to an increase in methoprene consumption. However, it may be taken into consideration that two of the four control group caterpillars showed signs of pupating at the end of the experiment through change in color and wetness[Reineke-1980], as depicted in Image 1. Meanwhile, none of the treatment group caterpillars began signs of pupating, despite their larger sizes and weight. This may be because as the caterpillar begin to prepare for pupation, its increase in size slows[Bollenbacher-1981], and the treatment group did not show this quality. It may be further tested through observing the caterpillars for an extended period to determine if the treatment group ever reaches pupation[Wolfgang-1986]. Additionally, the amount of methoprene injected into the food may be increased in future experiments to determine if a greater dosage may lead to a more drastic change[Wolfgang-1986].
