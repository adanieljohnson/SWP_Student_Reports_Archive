Title: Chemical signaling of synthetic juvenile hormone in the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Abstract: In our experiment, our group observed the effect of a synthetic juvenile hormone called precor on the maturation of the manduca sexta. We predicted that if we administer the manduca sexta 1: 1250 precor each day in its food for an eight-day period, it will mature more slowly than the manduca not given any precor. The larva was fed each day and weighed once a day. Overall, our results of the P-value which was 0.0025 was significent to show that the precor did not have a dramatic enough effect on the larva to conclude that it made any difference in the maturation process at all. 

Introduction:
Introduction: The manduca sexta is affected by two main hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) which regulated the type of molt. And Endysterone which regulates the timing of the molt. When one of these hormones is altered in turn it alters the molting of the larva. Usually molting occurs in the larva once there’s a small spike in the internal levels of Endysterone which is known as the commitment pulse, letting the larva’s body know it’s time for bodily reorganization In the case study that was written for the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, it was found that due to Juvabione and IGR’s it caused the linden bug to have “low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults.” [Tunaz, Hasan & Uygun, N.:2004] This was caused because the Juvabione acted as a synthetic Juvenile hormone for the Linden bug. We now want to carry out a similar experiment, in terms of looking at the effects of juvenile hormones on insects. We want to see the effects of a Juvenile hormone mimic, precor, on the manduca sexta larva. If we administer the manduca sexta larva 1: 1250 precor to deionized water each day for eight days in its food, it will mature more slowly than the average manduca because the precor will cause it to develop more slowly. 

Materials and Method:
Materials and Method: We will have eight manduca sexta larva and split them into two groups of four. The experimental group will each be given 10 grams of food each day taken from 40 grams of food which will be mixed with 4 drops of 1: 1250 precor to deionized water solution each day for an eight-day period. They will be weighed once a day in grams. The controll group will each be fed with 10 grams of food each day from 40 grams of food which will be mixed with four drops of water instead of the precor solution each day for an eight-day period. They will also be weighed once a day and weight will be recorded in grams. We will analyze the results using a two tailed T-test.

Results:
The P-value found using the two tail T-test was 0.0025. As seen in figure one, in the beginning of the 8-day period the controll group caterpillars on average weighed 9.4225g on day one. The experimental group caterpillars on average weighed 8.1725. By day eight the controll group caterpillars on average weighed 8.78. The experimental group on average weighed 9.195g. The standard deviation for the weight of the experimental group was 9.16±1.27. The standard deviation for the weight of the controll group was 6.41±0.74. On day one all of the caterpillars were greenish/blueish in color. By day eight the controll group was mostly yellowish/brownish in color. The experimental group remained mostly blueish/greenish in color by day eight. 

Discussion:
Discussion: Though the Turkish journal found that, “IGR leads to various abnormalities that impair insect survival.” (Tunaz:2004) In our experiment there was not enough evidence to conclude hat precor caused slowed maturation of the manduca sexta. We found a 0.0025 P-value which is significent in rejecting our null hypothesis. It was found in figure one that the weights of the controll group dramatically dropped enough to assume that the precor hormone is able to make the manduca eat more because the experimental group on average had a higher weight and maintained a higher weight thorough the eight-day period as opposed to the controll group whose average weight dropped from 9.4225g to 8.78g, which is a drop of 0.6425g. Whereas, the experimental group went from 8.1725g to 9.195g, which is an increase of 1.0225g. It can also be concluded that the precor hormone causes the manduca to remain the same blueish/greenish color as opposed to the controll group who started the week at the same blueish/greenish and on the eighth day became a more yellowish/brownish color. Overall, our hypothesis that, if we administer the manduca sexta larva 1: 1250 precor to deionized water each day for eight days in its food, it will mature more slowly than the average manduca because the precor will cause it to develop more slowly was in fact incorrect. There was not enough data to conclude that the precor had any effect on the maturation rate of the manduca sexta.
