Title: How twitch thresholds of the gastrocnemus muscle are affected by tubocurarine

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on studying the twitch threshold of gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens or the Northern Leopard frog before and after it is injected with tubocurarine, a muscle relaxant. The goal of the experiment was to determine if the inclusion of the muscle relaxant (1 Ml of tubocurarine) would cause a noticeable difference in the voltage amplitude necessary to create a contraction in the muscle. The null hypothesis was that there would be no significent evidence to support a noticeable difference and the alternative hypothesis was that there would be enough evidence to support a substantial difference. To test this a force transducer, specific instruments and software, and four frog legs were used to measure the twitch thresholds of each leg before and after the injection of tubocurarine.  After statistical analysis of the data we found that there was not enough evidence to support a significent difference and any differences found happened by chance, thus the null hypothesis was supported. 

Introduction:
This experiment was designed to test the post-mortem stimulus response of a Northern Leopard Frog (Rania Pipiens). Specifically, the experiment targeted the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg through stimulus to the sciatic nerve. We tested the twitch threshold of the muscle using an artificial electrical stimulus before and after injecting the leg with tubocurarine, which is a muscle relaxant. Tubocurarine acts as a receptor antagonist by blocking ACh (Acetylcholine), a neurotransmitter, from being received by the receptors in the muscle cells. We hypothesized that after injecting the leg with tubocurarine that it would take a stimulus of greater magnitude than before the injection to cause a muscle contraction. To test this hypothesis, we used 2 frog legs and measured their twitch thresholds before injecting them with tubocurarine. After the injection, we followed the same procedure and measured the stimulus magnitude to create a twitch. To prove our hypothesis correct we would need to see a substantial difference between the magnitude of the stimulus before and after the injection.  


Materials and Method:
Frog legs were provided to us by the lab instructor. Once placed on the dissection tray the skin of the frog leg was removed by peeling it off from the thigh down to the feet. Using Ringer’s solution to keep the frog legs moist the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from the bone by cutting the connective tissue and then cut away from the knee joint allowing a large portion of the tendon to remain connected to the muscle. Next the thigh muscle was gently pulled apart to expose the sciatic nerve. Once the nerve was exposed, the free end of the gastrocnemus muscle connected to a force transducer by string and held perpendicular to the dissection tray. After suspending the gastrocnemus muscle, the BNC was connected to the sciatic nerve and the LabScribe software was used to send electronic stimulus to the nerve, staring at 0.0 amps and increasing by .1 increments until a strong contraction occurred.  After a stimulus occurred the leg was then injected with 1 Ml of tubocurarine and allowed to sit for 5 minutes before the procedure was carried out again. We completed this entire procedure for each of the four frog legs. We made sure to record the voltage amplitude necessary to create a muscle contraction before and after the injection of tubocurarine in all four legs. 

Results:
After preforming the experimental test on all four frog legs we noticed a difference in the average voltage amplitude necessary to create a muscle stimulus (Figure 2). However, after statistical tests we found that the P-value (.1288, Figure 1) of the experiment was too great to prove the results significent enough to validate our hypothesis. 

Discussion:
The data collected throughout the experimented supported the possibility that tubocurarine affected the voltage amplitude necessary to create a muscle stimulus, yet after statistical review there is not enough evidence to support these claims. Thus, our hypothesis that injecting the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle with tubocurarine would create a higher twitch threshold was not supported and in turn rejected. This could be due to the fact that not enough tubocurarine was used in the experiment. Multiple factors could have led to this conclusion, such as the amount of tubocurarine used, human error, and inconsistencies in the muscle contractions due to the muscle no longer being connected to a living animal. Perhaps using 2 Ml of tubocurarine over the 1 Ml used in this experiment or more clinical dissection could have led to a more noticeable difference in voltage amplitude.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This table of values shows the results of the statistical testing of the data collected in the experiment. Over all it proves that the data collected was not enough to prove the hypothesis correct because the P-Value (.1288) is greater than .05. 

Figure 2: This graph shows the average voltage amplitude necessary to create a muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens as well as one standard deviation from the average (the error bars). Clearly there is a higher amplitude necessary to cause a muscle contraction after the injection of tubocurarine, yet that was proved insignificent by the statistical testing.
