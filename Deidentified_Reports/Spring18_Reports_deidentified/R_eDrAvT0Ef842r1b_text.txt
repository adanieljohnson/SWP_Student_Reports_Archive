Title: The Effects of Precor on the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test and analyze the effects of juvenile hormone in Precor solution when it was added to the food of a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar. Precor has a similar effect on insects as the juvenile hormone. Precor is a JH analog, a hormone that allows for growth during the larval instars, and inhibits pupation. Previous studies have shown the role of Precor as an insecticide led us to hypothesize that feeding the Manducas food that contains JH will cause them to be overall smaller than our controll group. We performed this experiment by splitting 8 caterpillars into two groups: the controll or the experimental. The controll group was fed food with distilled water mixed in, while the experimental group was fed food with drops of precor treatment mixed in everyday for a week. The average difference in both length and weight of the caterpillars was greater in the experimental group than the controll. There was an increase in mass in the controll and experimental groups. This led us to conclude that our hypothesis, that feeding Manduca Sexta Caterpillars food that contains JH will cause them to have a small


Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworms, are pests during their larval stages (Byron and Gillet-Kaufman 2018). As holometabolous creatures, they appear wholly different as larvae, than adults. The Manduca Sexta appears as a caterpillar in its larval stages, then as a moth as an adult. As the Manduca Sexta plays a role as a pest during its larval stage, we will test the effects of Precor, an insecticide that mimics JH, on the caterpillar. In today’s lab, we will determine the effect of food soaked precor solution when fed to a Manduca Sexta caterpillar. Precor solution contains a juvenile hormone. JH is commonly put into insecticides to stunt an insect’s growth synthetic analogues of the juvenile hormone are used as an insecticide preventing the larvae from developing into adult insects. Given high levels of JH, larvae can still molt, but the result will only be a bigger larva, not an adult. Thus, the insect’s reproductive cycle ceases to work. When entering the system of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, JH usually causes the growth to be stunted, and causes molting to occur later than usual (Nijhout 2018). Juvenile hormone is one of the three main hormones that controll insect development. It is produced in the corpus allata, an endocrine gland present in insects. It also prevents pupation and and directs growth in Manducan Sexta’s larval instars.We hypothesize that feeding Manduca Sexta Caterpillars food that contains JH will cause them to have a smaller average increase in mass and length than the controll, which receives the standard diet. We hypothesize this because of the role of JH in insecticides.


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we will need 30-100uL of precor solution per day, 3-10 droplets of water, 10g of food for each caterpillar per day, and 8 caterpillars. The caterpillars were housed in an incubator set to 37 degrees Celsius.  First, we began by separating the eight caterpillars into two groups: a controll group and an experimental group. We then prepared four plastic containers with perforated lids by inserting index cards to split them into two halves, giving one container the ability to house two caterpillars on each side of the half. We labeled each container with our group’s names, lab section, and whether the caterpillars contained were controll or experimental. The controll group was fed 10g of food with 3-10 drops of distilled water mixed in, while the experimental group was fed 10g of GLM food with 5 drops of precor treatment mixed in. Each day at 7pm, we emptied the caterpillar’s living areas. We then proceeded to record the length (cm) and weight (g) of each caterpillar daily. We used the two-sample t_test to compare the data between the controll and experimental group.


Results:
The average weight of the experimental group was higher than the controll, but the length was a little lower in the experimental than the controll as well. This may have been because the beginning average length and weight of the controll Manducas was a little larger than the experimental. The average difference in both length and weight of the caterpillars was greater in the experimental group than the controll. There was an increase in mass of 4.72 g and 4.83 g respectively in the controll and experimental groups; there was an increase of length of 2.95 cm and 3.0 cm respectively in the controll and experimental groups.


Discussion:
The Manduca Sexta species has been used extensively as a model organism in experiments related to insect development, genetics, and behavior (Byron, Kaufman 2017). In the lab, they can be successfully reared on artificial diet. Body size is controllled by mechanisms that terminate growth when the individual reaches a species-specific size. In insects, it is a pulse of ecdysone at the end of larval life that causes the larva to stop feeding and growing and initiate metamorphosis (Nijhout 2018). The processes that controll the timing of ecdysone secretion in larvae of the moth Manduca sexta are affected by JH. After measuring our controll and experimental groups, we saw an increase in mass of 4.72 g and 4.83 g respectively in the controll and experimental groups; there was an increase of length of 2.95 cm and 3.0 cm respectively in the controll and experimental groups. These findings led us to believe that the experimental group became only slightly larger than the controll groups. Our hypothesis, that feeding Manduca Caterpillars food that contains JH will cause them to have a smaller average increase in mass and length than the controll, was not supported. Because although it seems as if there is a greater change in the experimental and controll our P-value was .32 for length and .52 for mass, thus our findings were not significent. During development, JH regulates the type of molt (Johnson). Our finding may not have been significent due to a low of an amount of precor being added or the type of JH was perhaps ineffective in the Manduca.
