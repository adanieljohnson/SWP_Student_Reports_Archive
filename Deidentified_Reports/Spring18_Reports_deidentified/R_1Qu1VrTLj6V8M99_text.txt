Title: The Ability of Betta splendins to Properly Respond to Perceived Threats

Abstract:
Bettas show a wide variety of aggressions spanning both broadside and facing movements, with the most recognizable being a protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes underneath the opercula which creates a sort of red colored mane. With the larger amounts of energy that is used during confrontation, it would be an evolutionary advantage as a betta fish to be able to easily distinguish between legitimate threats and those that are not. To test the ability of betta fish to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate threats, we exposed three male betta fish to very fake appearing artificial fish, realistic artificial fish, and real fish to examine their behavior in the presence of these threats.A one way ANOVA test was calculated on the response times of the betta fish to the stimuli. The analysis F (2,1) was significent with the p_value equaling 0.000123.With the negligible response to stimuli that were not other fish, the bettas demonstrated an impressive ability to discern the legitimacy of intruders and thus conserve their energy reserves for more important tasks. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, utilizes various observational skills to discover insight into how evolution and selection have shaped these behaviors over time [Johnson: 2016]. These behaviors are not thought of in isolation, but rather are given shape through a holistic examination of the examined organism’s mechanisms and mannerisms. Some of this discipline involves the role of agnostic behaviors (or threat behaviors) in the interactions between animals. These interactions can either be intraspecific (between the same species) or interspecific (between different species) [Johnson: 2016]. These behaviors can easily be identified in Betta splendins (betta fish) due to the bright colors that have been bred for aquarium use. Bettas show a wide variety of aggressions spanning both broadside and facing movements, with the most recognizable being a protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes underneath the opercula which creates a sort of red colored mane [Johnson: 2016]. This display is an evident display of aggression in the fish. Thus, fish using this red mane serves as a quantifiable behavior when observing bettas. With the larger amounts of energy that is used during confrontation, it would be an evolutionary advantage as a betta fish to be able to easily distinguish between legitimate threats and those that are not. Bettas that emerge victorious from confrontation are known to consume large amounts of oxygen following the fight and thus consume a lot of energy during the confrontation itself [Castro: 2006].  In the wild, this would allow animals to better conserve their energy to find food and reproduce. 

Materials and Method:
To test the ability of betta fish to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate threats, we exposed three male betta fish to a couple of different stimuli to examine their behavior in the presence of these threats. The fish were kept in a tank with three sections that were divided with white plastic to keep them from habituating to the presence of the stimuli that were presented to them. To quantify aggression, we timed the duration of time that the fish displayed their red mane over a four minute period. The first stimulus given to the fish was a very artificial betta, made with red styrofoam and marker. Next, the fish were exposed to a lifelike fake betta made with rubber and realistic coloring. Lastly, the fish were exposed to each other to find their reaction to a real threat (though they were separated physically by a clear shield to allow the full four minutes to elapse). With there being three treatment groups, we used an ANOVA test to see if there was a significent statistical difference between the response time of the fish to the various stimuli.

Results:
Among the response to the unrealistic artificial fish, the three fish had a mean of 0 ± 0. There was no aggressive response in any of the subjects. Similarly, with the rubber and realistic betta, the real fish showed no response with the time of red mane protrusion having a mean of 0 ± 0. When exposed to each other, the bettas had a mean response time of 113 ± 25.87. Figure 1 denotes the vast discrepancies between the various treatments with its plot of the time in seconds spent responding to the treatments. A one way ANOVA test was calculated on the response times of the betta fish to the stimuli. The analysis F (2,1) was significent with the p_value equaling 0.000123. 


Discussion:
Based off of the ANOVA test, there is ample evidence to suggest that betta fish can readily distinguish between real and false threats. Bettas are highly specialized in their ability to gauge the displays of potential opponents based off of cues that they are giving off which is consistent with the results of the test [Castro: 2006]. With no quantifiable response to the artificial stimuli, the fish demonstrated a remarkable ability to conserve their agnostic behaviors and thus energy for legitimate threats. Theoretically, the inability of the fish to respond could have come from rapid habituation to intrusions in the tank. However, with how resounding the results of this experiment were, it is highly unlikely that the data came from error alone or happened by chance. This follows as conserving energy in a natural habitat would greatly benefit the success of the organism. With the negligible response to stimuli that were not other fish, the bettas demonstrated an impressive ability to discern the legitimacy of intruders and thus conserve their energy reserves for more important tasks.
