Title: How Exposure of Precor Through Food Affects the Developmental Stages of Manduca sexta Caterpillars Interpreted by Change in Weight

Abstract:
This experiment attempted to analyze the effectiveness of precor as an IGR, insect growth regulator. IGRs effect the development of insects by targeting hormones. Precor specifically targets JH, juvenile hormone, which works as a pest control because it hinders the growth of an insect by making it not develop to adult stages. In this experiment, Manduca sexta caterpillars are being used to test the effectiveness of precor if mixed in with their food. It is hypothesized that the caterpillars that are exposed to precor in their food will weigh less than the caterpillars not exposed to the precor in their food. The food of the treatment caterpillars will be mixed with precor, while the control caterpillars will be mixed with water. After the experiment was completed the data provided that there was no statistical significance between the treatment and control groups, but it was concluded that due to experimental error the data obtained from the experiment cannot be used to interpret the effectiveness of precor as an IGR. 

Introduction:
Insect growth Regulation (IGR) affect the development of insects by targeting hormones specifically JH, juvenile hormone, a hormone used for development. When JH is a hormone that promotes the growth of insects past the larva stage then decreases in the insect once it gets to the adult stages. IGRs are commonly used as a method of pest control by hindering growth instead of using toxicity to control the insects. One of these pest controls is called Precor. Precor is best used when sprayed on plants outside before an infestation of insects. Precor targets the larva stage of insects and prevents them from reaching adult stages of growth (Pener: 2012). Methoprine, the main ingredient in precor, inhibits the ability of the insects to reach maturity. Precor is sprayed on furniture or plants to target the insects during feeding (DoMyOwn:2018). Precor is mainly used to prevent flea infestations inside, but in this lab, it will be testing its preventative measures on caterpillar infestations with food. The Manduca sexta caterpillar works well as a model organism because just like fleas, caterpillar's developmental stages are regulated by JH hormone. However, because precor is mainly used indoors on furniture it poses the question of will it work if mixed with caterpillar's food. The developmental stages can be measured by the weight of the insect; therefore, this experiment will be analyzing weights of caterpillars exposed to precor in their food verses the weights of caterpillars not exposed to precor in their food. The Biological Null Hypothesis is if caterpillars are exposed to precor, then their weight will not differ from the weight of those not exposed. The biological alternative hypothesis if caterpillars are exposed to precor, then their weight will differ from the weight of those not exposed to precor. The statistical null hypothesis is there is no statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to precor will differ from the weight of those not exposed to precor. The statistical alternative hypothesis is there is statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to precor will differ from the weight of those not exposed to precor. The independent variable of this experiment is the precor mixed with the food, which is also a measurable continuous variable. The dependent variable of this experiment is the weight of the caterpillars, which is also a continuous measurable variable. 

Materials and Methods:
There will be two groups of caterpillars that will be placed in four separate containers with a divider separating each caterpillar along with 10g of food. Each caterpillar in the control group will have a divider between each caterpillar. Each caterpillar will receive 10g of food with 5 drops of distilled water mixed in and no precor. The treatment group will also be separated by a divider and receive 10g of food; however, the treatment group's food will be mixed with 5 drops of precor. Every day around 1:00pm for 7 the weight of the caterpillars will be taken using a scale and recorded into a table. At the end of the experiment the data will be analyzed using a statistical two sample t-test of the averaged treatment group weight and the averaged control group weight for each day. The results of the two-sample t-test will determined the effectiveness of precor as an IGR for caterpillars. The containers with the caterpillars are kept on the upper shelf of the incubator. At the end of the experiment the change in weights were averaged and the data was analyzed using a bar graph and a two-sample t-test.

Results:
The general trends in figure 1 are that the change in weight of the control group caterpillars was slightly more than the change in weight of the treatment group caterpillars. The change in weights however, we're not significantly different from one another, all within a few decimal places apart from one another. The mean of both the control and treatment groups change in weights were very similar at 2.73g and 2.64g. A two sample T-test was taken and proved that there was no statistical difference between our control group and our treatment group (DF: 6, t-value: 0.407, p-value: 0.698). Because the p-value is greater than 0.05 we reject the alternate hypothesis and accept the null hypothesis. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment have shown that there was no statistical difference between the control group, without precor, and the treatment group, with precor. The p-value of 0.698 told us to reject the alternate and to accept the null. This provided the data that precor did not have a statistical significance on the development of the caterpillars. This was shown in figure 1 because the change in weights for each caterpillar over the seven-day period were very close in range with one another. Based on the results that showed that there was no significant difference between the development of the caterpillars treated with precor and not treated with precor, it was interpreted that precor did not have a significant impact on caterpillars. Because precor showed to not have a significant impact on the development of the caterpillars it was inferred that precor does not work well as an IGR. In order for precor to be a sufficient IGR it had to affect the development of the caterpillars, which it did not. Since the data has been interpreted as precor not being a sufficient IGR, it was also inferred that precor would not work as a method of pest control for caterpillars. 
However, there was human error in the experiment. The caterpillars were weighed every day, but they were not provided with new food every day. By the end of the 5th day the food was scarce and then nonexistent on the 6th and 7th day. The goal of the experiment was to test if the change in weight of caterpillars exposed to precor in their food would be less than the change in weight of those caterpillars in the control. However, looking at a similar study done by the University of California on the developmental stages of Cat flea larva where they exposed adolescent larva to precor and looked at their emergence to the adult stages of development it can be inferred that precor is effective as an IGR. The cat flea larva that were exposed to precor either did not make it the adult stages of development or were dead by the end of the experiment (Rust: 1982). This outside data provides that precor works as an IGR by inhibiting the developmental stages of larva by using JH, not letting them reach adulthood. In a perfect scenario, the experimenters would be able to re-do the experiment the correct way, but because of the lab set up there was no time for this. In conclusion, the data showed that precor is not a sufficient IGR on Manduca sexta caterpillars because the change in weight of the treatment group and control group did not vary substantially.
