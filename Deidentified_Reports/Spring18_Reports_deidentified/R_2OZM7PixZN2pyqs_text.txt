Title: Behavioral Analysis of betta splendins in Room Temperature Water versus Refrigerated Water

Abstract:
In this lab setting the group decided to test the effects of a colder temperature of the species betta splendins. The result of the experiment was a faster response in the colder water, however, in the warmer water the fish displayed more agnostic behaviors overall. These fish are native to Southest Asia and are not accustomed to cool temperatures, thus why there was a lack of activity in our experiment that tested with cold water. We determined that colder water results in a more lethargic betta splenden. The experiment does not answer why or how these agnostic traits evolve but it gives us a better understanding of their behavior in different extremes which will potentially lead to the answer. 

Introduction:
In this lab, the class engaged in analyzing the behavior of the species betta splendins under varying environmental stressors. My group decided to analyze the behavior of the fish species when introduced to different water temperatures. The species betta splendins is native to southwest Asia, particularly the nations of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. [Sturgeon:2018] The regions native to the Betta fish are considered tropical wet climates, which have an average temperature of 75° degrees fahrenheit throughout the year. [Natural Geographic:2012] Therefore, Betta fish are accustomed to temperatures above the average room temperature of 70° fahrenheit. It is rare for these Asian nations to experience extreme lows in temperatures, for example in Vietnam the average low year round is 63° degrees fahrenheit. [Manton:2001] The species betta splendins are an infraspecific aggressive territorial species, especially the male sex.  The infraspecific agnostic behaviors Betta’s display often leads to the death of one of the two fish that come into contact with one another (if males). This behavior has baffled scientists for decades as this behavior reduces the overall fitness of the species. The group decided to analyze the behavior of the Betta fish in varying temperatures to observe how they react to the change in their environment. It is also true that colder water results in lower amounts of oxygen, thus I predict that the Betta fish will display more agnostic behaviors in colder temperatures, due to the lack of available oxygen and the energy they must use to maintain homeostasis; making for a more competitive environment. [United States Environmental Protection Agency:2015]

Materials and Method:
The first step of the experiment was to acquire all the necessary materials. The group collected a tank that could be divided into sections, a mirror, two male Betta fish of different colors, room temperature water (74° fahrenheit), and refrigerated water (40° fahrenheit). We decided the experiment would work best if we did two sets of testing one test for the room temperature water and one test for the refrigerated water. The tests that we would run include the behavior of the two male Betta fish when isolated, when looking at itself through a mirror, and lastly, when introduced to another male. In order to obtain the best data we decided to test each twice; two tests for isolated males, mirrored males, and males together. We all observed the fish and counted the amount of times the betta fish performed a type of behavior. We ranked the actions in order of increasing agnostic behavior to measure the fish’s behavior. (figure. 1.)  For each observed behavior we wrote down the number of the corresponding rank, for example if the male fish performed a tail beat and it’s pectoral fin was erect we would have wrote down a 3 and a 2. If behaviors occur then the rank number is recorded again. After observing and recording the behavior the group discussed and made sure their results were the same. We performed a two tailed paired T-test to better analyze the data. 

Results:
The results of the experiment shows that the change in temperature did not affect the Betta’s behavior holistically, however, the data does support that the when the Betta fish when placed in a cooler environment were more readily aggressive. The second experiment or the refrigerated water experiment resulted in a faster response from both fish. The first experiment with the room temperature water resulted in increasing constant agnostic behaviors; looking at the average number. The data shows that there is a significent difference in the two experiments, which constitutes that temperature does have an effect on the behavior of the Betta fish.  

Discussion:
The results of the two parallel experiments did not support my hypothesis that the species betta splendins would display more agnostic behavior in colder temperatures. The first experiment with the room temperature water resulted in high rates of agnostic behaviors between both fish, mostly the red. The second experiment with the refrigerated water resulted in a faster response, but overall a less agnostic response from both fish. Betta fish’s ideal temperature is between 76°-80℉. Betta fish that are exposed to colder temperatures, for example 40℉, they become lethargic, won't eat, their immune system is more at risk, and will often sink to the bottom of the tank to get warmer. [Davis:2018] It is not included in the data but it was a common for the Betta fish to sink to the bottom when they were put in cold water. This behavior can be attributed to it saving energy in order to maintain homeostasis. Betta fish are not accustomed to cold temperatures, so when we place the fish in a cold environment it reacted violently and thus why the fish were so quick to show agnostic behaviors. It also makes a sense that the Bettas did not present a lot of agnostic behavior when in the cold water in order to allocate energy towards homeostasis. The results of our experiment are like that of other experiments. The Betta fish that were introduced to a cold environment often sank to the bottom of the tank and became lethargic. [Woodhead: 2003] There was room for error in our experiment because we were counting the amount of behaviors that the fish displayed and it would be easy to miss count and/or count a behavior as something it is not, for example some of my lab partners thought that the pectoral fin was actually the dorsal. If I were to modify the experiment I would count the number of time the fish came into contact with the other or the mirror instead of ranking behavior. It would be easier to count the amount of times it makes contact with the other or the glass (in the case of the mirror). It is important to understand the behaviors of species so we can better understand the world around us,animal behavior, why and how particular traits such as, intraspecific agnostic behavior evolves in some species.
