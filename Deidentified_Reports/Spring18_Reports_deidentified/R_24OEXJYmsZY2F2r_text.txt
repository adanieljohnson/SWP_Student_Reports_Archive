Title: Effect of Added Acetylcholine on the Amplitude of a Contraction from a Frog’s Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
This experiment examined the effect of additional acetylcholine on the amplitude of a frog gastrocnemus muscle. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons whose axons activate myofibers at neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arriving at these junctions cause the release of a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which then goes on to signal an action potential to occur. We hypothesize that the addition of acetylcholine to the gastrocnemus muscle of our frog leg will cause the muscle to contract with a smaller amplitude compared to without it. Two frog legs were prepared and hooked up to the software program iWorx. After finding the threshold, three pulses were sent to find the amplitude of each contraction. Acetylcholine was then injected into the muscle and three more pulses were run to find the new amplitude. A 2-sample T-test and multiple comparisons of the contractions were performed. The hypothesis was supported by this experiment; the amplitude of the muscle contraction with the added neurotransmitter was significently smaller than the muscle contraction without it because the excess neurotransmitter competed to bind to the limited number of acetylcholine receptors which were unable to account for the massive number, ultimately fatiguing them faster than anticipated.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to sense and respond to internal and external environments within milliseconds of stimulation. The neuromuscular system consists of thousands of myofibers which are bound together by connective tissue to form skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons whose axons extend into a muscle and activate individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arriving at these neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal which then binds to its membrane receptor on the receiving muscle fiber. This binding signals sodium ion channels to open and generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential then signals calcium to release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and activates the muscle fiber to shorten. In a case study performed by J. Diamond on the effects of added acetylcholine in rabbit leg muscle contractions, muscular amplitude was significently decreased with the addition of acetylcholine compared to without it, (Diamond, 1958). In another case study performed by E. Davis on the effect of added Acetylcholine on different frog characteristics, added Acetylcholine was found to strikingly reduce a frog’s muscular amplitude and rate, compared to the amplitude and rate in a normal frog’s muscle, (Davis, 1931). We as a group wanted to test our own neuromuscular alteration on our own frog to see how the addition of acetylcholine to the gastrocnemus muscle would affect the amplitude of the contraction. I hypothesize that the addition of acetylcholine to the gastrocnemus muscle of our frog leg will have a similar effect to that of Davis’ - the muscle will contract with a smaller amplitude with the addition of acetylcholine compared to without.

Materials and Method:
Begin the experiment by installing the computer software “iWorx” and programming the setting to “Animal Muscle.” In the toolbar controllling the setting of the experiment, set the pulse amplitude (amp) to 0.000V, the number of pulses to three, and both the frequency (FHz) and the pulse width (W) to five milliseconds to start. Select two frog legs and, one at a time, take forceps and grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull downward towards the foot. Find the ventral side of the leg by locating the cleft in the thigh muscle, as opposed to the smooth thigh muscle on the dorsal side. Separate the inner thigh muscle beginning at the upper end of the leg (near the cleft) and extending toward the frog’s “knee.” This will reveal blood vessels and the white sciatic nerve; free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue with your fingers. With scissors, detach the gastrocnemus muscle from the tibialis anterior muscle by slicing the thin membranous connective tissue seal holding the two muscles together. To detach the gastrocnemus muscle from the lower portion of the leg, cut at the point where the Achilles Tendon meets the Tibia Bone, being sure to leave some of the Achilles attached to the gastrocnemus muscle. With string, tie a knot at the junction between the remaining Achilles Tendon and the gastrocnemus muscle; leave enough slack on the string to make a loop (about one inch long) from the double knot. Place the tied loop on the front hook of an adjustable mechanical arm above the dissecting pan. Allow the frog leg to lay on the dissecting pan while ensuring the muscle is at a ninety-degree angle. Secure the frog leg with pins around the quadricep muscle and just below where the gastrocnemus muscle is hanging. Place two probes with silver conductive wire next to the cleft and lay the sciatic nerve overtop both of the probe wires, allowing for direct stimulation of the nerve itself. After preparing the frog leg, find the threshold value of voltage that allows for contraction of the frog muscle by setting the amplitude to 0.1V and increasing by increments of 0.1. Find the maximum V2-V1 value of each myogram. This represents the amplitude of the muscle contraction on the myogram as measured in volts. Once the threshold value is found, add the (threshold value) with the (threshold value x 25%), and run three more myograms at this new level, being sure to calculate the V2-V1 value of each myogram. Once this first test is complete, start the experimental section by using a syringe to draw 0.1Ml of acetylcholine from a container and injecting about 0.05Ml in the top half of the gastrocnemus muscle, and the other 0.05Ml in the bottom half of the gastrocnemus muscle. After sixty seconds, run three myograms at the calculated threshold value from the first test and record the V2-V1 values for each myogram. Repeat this same process for the second leg. Dispose of the biological waste in a separate container from the non-biological waste. Disassemble and disinfect the set up using ethanol spray. Run a two-sample t_test using the values derived from the experiment in order to determine the chance that the results of the experiment occurred coincidentally. 

Results:
The amplitude of the frog legs without the added acetylcholine was significently higher than the amplitude of the frog legs with the added acetylcholine. For the first frog, the threshold was found to be 0.5V. The calculated threshold (threshold + (0.25 x threshold)) was found to be 0.9. For the second frog, the threshold was found to be 1.2V. The calculated threshold (threshold + (0.25 x threshold)) was found to be 1.5V. The mean value of the amplitude for the frog legs without added acetylcholine was calculated to be 0.95V with a standard deviation of 0.013. The mean value of the amplitude for the frog legs with the added acetylcholine was calculated to be 0.20V with a standard deviation of 0.0012. The P value for the two-tail t_test (P(T&lt;=t) two-tail) was found to be 4.27x10-6.

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported by this experiment; I stated that the addition of acetylcholine to the gastrocnemus muscle of our frog legs will cause the muscle to contract with a smaller amplitude compared to a contraction without the addition of acetylcholine, and that is exactly what happened. When a stimulus in the internal or external environment triggers a nerve impulse, the impulse travels down and arrives at a neuromuscular junction. Once at the neuromuscular junction, the impulse signals the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which then binds to its membrane receptors on the muscle fiber  this binding then goes on to signal depolarization and repolarization. According to the experiment performed by Diamond, there is only a certain number of acetylcholine specific receptors available on the postsynaptic muscle fibers; because of this, no matter how much acetylcholine there is available, only the limited number of acetylcholine receptors will be able to respond to these signals. The excess and unaccounted for acetylcholine fatigues the receptors faster because they are unable to account for the large number of neurotransmitter present, (Diamond, 1958). This can be shown in Figure 1. above. The amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle without the added acetylcholine was significently higher with a mean of 0.95V and a standard deviation of 0.013, compared to the mean of the amplitude for the frog legs with added acetylcholine which was calculated to be 0.20V with a standard deviation of 0.0012. The muscle was not able to contract as strongly as it was before because of all the excess acetylcholine competing to bind to the receptor. The P value for the two-tail t_test (P(T&lt;=t) two-tail) was found to be 4.27x10-6. This is a great statistical value because this indicates the chance that our data occurred from pure coincidence and validates our results. For the first frog, the threshold was found to be 0.5V. The threshold is the point when the myogram amplitude values stopped increasing; this is where the threshold was found to be. The calculated threshold (threshold + (0.25 x threshold)) was found to be 0.9. We used this equation to ensure we were safely within the threshold area; this limited the chance for unnecessary mistakes to be made. For the second frog, the threshold was found to be 1.2V. The calculated threshold (threshold + (0.25 x threshold)) was found to be 1.5V. E. Davis had similar results to our own, as he found that the effect of added Acetylcholine was found to strikingly reduce a frog’s muscular amplitude and rate, compared to the amplitude and rate in a normal frog’s muscle, (Davis, 1931). The process of signaling through the neuromuscular system is such a precise process that the slightest alternation can have significent effects on the outcome of the response or the proceeding signal.
