Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Frog Sciatic Nerve Threshold

Abstract:
Frogs are one of the most common experimented organism regarding isometric skeletal muscle contract. The effects of lidocaine, which have been previously experimented and tested for dozens of years, is akin to a muscle anesthetic and will serve as a sodium channel blocker to the frog’s sciatic nerve. It was hypothesized that the application of lidocaine will affect the contraction threshold. After thorough experimental procedures, which included, but is not limited to, the utilization of the iWorx software, it was calculated that lidocaine exhibited a significent effect on threshold through a two-sample T-test (P = 0.0137, T = -2.818). These results were in accordance to previous studies and the predicted effects of lidocaine were accepted.

Introduction:
Isometric muscle contraction, in specific, occurs in three significent periods: the latent period, the contraction period, and the relaxation period (Fulton, 1925). Skeletal muscles themselves consist of myofibrils, which are long bundles of protein, that consist of thick myofilaments and thin myofilaments. The thick myofilaments are composed of myosin, a fibrous protein that, together with actin on the thin myofilament, is involved in the contraction of skeletal muscles (Johnson, 2018). The thin myofilaments are composed of actin, troponin, and tropomyosin. The physiological process that results in the contraction of the muscle, whether it is in frog or any other species, is triggered by an action potential occurring in the sarcolemma of the muscle fiber. The action potential will propagate through the t-tubules and trigger the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium will then bind to the troponin on the thin myofilament, causing it to shift the tropomyosin, exposing the binding site for the cross-bridge between actin and myosin (Johnson, 2018). A singular contraction, or a “twitch,” is what will be measured in terms of threshold, or the minimum stimulus required for a twitch. Frogs are easy to work with as their “twitch” is easily recognizable and their muscles (gastrocnemus) as well as nerves (sciatic nerve) are easy to isolate and use for experimentation. When the muscle is contracted repeatedly, there is a point where each “twitch” is progressively reduced called tetany.  	
    Frogs readily use their leg muscles to jump across obstacles and this contraction is what will be measured (by the gastrocnemus). Previous studies have confirmed that lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker and muscle anesthetic, causes a nonreversible block or loss of “impulse activity” in the muscle, which results in lower threshold limits (Bainton, 1994). To test these findings, using lidocaine as the independent variable and threshold value as the dependent variable, it was hypothesized that lidocaine will trigger either an increase or a decrease in the minimum threshold. 

Materials and Method:
Three different frog legs were organized and prepared on a dissecting plate. The skin of the frog legs was peeled off to reveal the muscles and the sciatic nerve. To find the sciatic nerve, the upper par of the frog leg, like a Ziploc bag, was separated until a small cream-colored line was revealed. Following this, the gastrocnemus muscle was separated and cut at the frog’s Achilles tendon to allow proper muscle contraction. Four different pins were used to isolate major muscle groups and to keep them from uncontrolllably contracting. Following this, a yarn loop was tied at the end of the gastrocnemus muscle and hanged 90 degrees from the dissecting plate to ensure proper muscle contraction. A ringer solution was kept readily to moisten the muscle. Before the application of Lidocaine, the controll portion of the experiment was conducted by applying small, continuous bouts of voltages and finding what the minimum threshold for contraction is. This process was repeated three times for each frog leg. Then, .2Ml of lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle via a syringe for each frog leg. The same procedure of finding the minimum threshold was carried out three times for each frog leg. A two-sample T-test was conducted with the averaged results to determine if the alternate hypothesis is significent (confidence interval of 95%). 

Results:
According to the data recovered from the experiment, the trend that was most notable is that the lidocaine application substantially increased the minimum threshold, which turned out higher than the controll (refer to Table 1). From these trends alone, the action of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine seems to be working as a higher voltage Is needed to initiate a response from the frog leg. According to the conducted two-sample T-test, the results were significent, and the experimental hypothesis was accepted (P = 0.0137, T = -2.818) with a confidence interval of 95%.    The dissection and preparation of the frog was met with many difficulties throughout the procedures. Some of this difficulty, but not all, included damage to the sciatic nerve due to repeated excitation or through the dissecting procedure itself, as well as incorrect practices for the dissection because of inexperience. Some confounding or systematic errors may have been introduced due to the iWorx software as it is not a perfect tool for measuring threshold. These systematic errors may have been prevalent in some confounding data (refer to the error bars of Figure 1) or data that was recorded incorrectly.

Discussion:
According to the results of the two-sample t_test and the relevant trends found in the data (Figure 1), lidocaine application to the gastrocnemus muscle severely increased the threshold limit of the frog leg. These results conform to the proposed hypothesis that lidocaine will affect the threshold limit and conform to previously accepted results from similar studies (Chen, 2012). With a confidence interval of over 95%, the null hypothesis is denied, and the alternate hypothesis is accepted, although further experimentation would increase the acceptance. Although the data conformed with what was to be expected, there were a plethora of errors, in the form of systematic and human errors, that may have adversely affected the results. During the preparation of the frog legs for analysis, the sciatic nerve was handled roughly, and this could have, by itself, increased the threshold limit. Furthermore, the iWorx software, although accurate, is not perfect and multiple errors came up along the way which could have affected the results. A previous study has linked sodium inactivation, via lidocaine, to be enhanced by lowering the external calcium concentration (External solution like the Ringer Solution) which is a favorable direction to take the results as it could further increase the threshold limit and make it more evident that sodium channel blockers, like lidocaine, do act as a muscle relaxant(Saito, 1984).
