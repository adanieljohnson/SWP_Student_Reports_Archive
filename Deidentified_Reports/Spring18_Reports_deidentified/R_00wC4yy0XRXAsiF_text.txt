Title: Different Types of Soil has No Effect on the Root to Shoot Ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum  in the First Two Weeks

Abstract:
This experiment was used to determine if the difference in where the Raphanus raphanistrum was planted would have an effect on the length root to shoot ratio. Plants and are animals are able to allocate their resources in different situations. When plants allocate their resources, it is due to either a biotic or abiotic factors. Some plants are able to adapt to their changed environments better than others and it may not have the plants allocate their resources. There were two sets of plants planted, with one set planted in dirt soil and the other planted in sand. Sand does not hold water as well as dirt soil, so the plants should have allocated its resources to the roots so the plant could get more water. This was disproven by the mean for the root to shoot ratio for the sand plants being 1.140.504 and for the plants ion the dirt soil being 1.130.110. The root to shoot ratio was higher in the radish plants that were planted in the soil. This could have been because root plants grow well in sand as well as dirt soil, or because the sand and dirt soil were watered every day which is not very typical in the real environment. The experiment showed inconclusive results and the different in the ratio was not enough to make a definite conclusion.

Introduction:
This experiment was performed based on the knowledge of resource allocation. According to Oxford Bibliographies, resource allocation in biology refers to the “proportion of an organism’s energy budget allocated to reproduction at any given time. Reproduction must be balanced (or traded off) against opposing expenditures such as growth, survival, maintenance, and future reproduction” [Gilbert:2016]. Plants adapt to their environment based on different biotic and abiotic factors. Some plants have very little adaptations and do not tolerate changes from different conditions, but some plants can adapt to many different conditions. In this experiment, different soils were used to see if Raphanus raphanistrum would allocate their resources differently in the different soils. If Raphanus raphanistrum can adapt to many different types of conditions, they can easily be grown in many different environments. In this experiment, it was expected the Raphanus raphanistrum in the sand would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the Raphanus raphanistrum in the soil. Sand does not hold water as well as soil does, so it was expected that the Raphanus raphanistrum in the sand would allocate their resources more to the roots than the shoots in order to get enough water to grow. 

Materials and Method:
There were two groups that were assessed in this experiment. There were three plants that were planted in sand and three that were planted in soil. Each plant received miracle grow and then 10-15 seeds of Raphanus raphanistrum was placed in the sand and soil. The plants were placed in a green room in a place that had similar amounts of sunlight. Each day all of the plants were watered and this continued for two weeks until it was time to look at the root and shoots of each plant. After the plants were harvested there were 10 plants that were harvested from each plant. The plants were weighed together, and then cut at the junction between the roots and shoots. The shoots were weighed and from this the root weight could be determined. The root to shoot ratio was determined and recorded. The longest root and shoot was picked from each plant and the length was recorded. The root to shoot length ratio was determined and recorded. The root to shoot ratio for both the weight and length for the plants in the soil and the sand was determined by taking the mean of the three of each plant. 

Results:
	It was determined from the experiment the weight root to shoot ratio mean for the plants in the sand was 0.3310.0679 (Figure 1) and for the length it was 1.140.504 (Figure 1). The weight root to shoot ratio for the plants in the soil was 0.3730.0340 (Figure 1) and for the length it was 1.130.110 (Figure 1). [The weight was measured in grams and the length was measured in centimeters].

Discussion:
The results of this experiment go against the hypothesis stated at the beginning of the experiment. The results show the mean for the root to shoot ratio for the length was higher in the plants in the soil than in the sand. It was believed the sand would have a larger root to shoot ratio because of the allocation of the plants. There are many reasons why this hypothesis was not supported. When planting radishes, it is important to make sure the “moisture and soil depth” is just right and “planting radishes from seed works best if the soil is moist but does not have standing water” [Chase]. This is a potential reason for the hypothesis not being supported by the experiment. The plants were watered each day and this allowed the sand to continue to be moist as well as the soil. In the real environment, it does not rain every day, so allowing the plants to be watered everyday may have affected the way radishes grow in the real environment. If the plants were not watered every day the sand would have not remained moist and it could have caused the plant to allocate its resources to its roots. Another reason the hypothesis may not be supported is because “root vegetables in particular will grow well in sand even when started from seed. This group includes radishes, carrots, potatoes, turnips and alliums like garlic and onion” [SFGate]. This experiment only lasted for two weeks so the plants were not fully ready to be picked. Radishes must be able to adapt to new environments which allows them grow efficiently in different soils. This experiment could have been continued to see how as the plant continued to grow how the sand would affect the roots. If the plants got bigger, they many need more water, and the dirt soil holds it better. Also, if the plants were not watered every day, but instead every three days, it may show a difference in the root to shoot length ratio.
