Title: ACH ESTERASE INHIBITION LOWERS CONTRACTION VOLTAGE OF RANA PIPIENS GASTROCNEMIUS MUSCLE

Abstract:
Carbaryl, the active ingredient in SEVIN, functions as an ACh inhibitor, such that it prevents reuptake of ACh and, thus, leads to an overabundance of ACh in the neuromuscular junction and an overstimulation of the postsynaptic site. Our experiment was designed to test the effectiveness of SEVIN as an inhibitor of acetylcholine (ACh), one of the necessary chemicals in producing the action potential that leads to the contraction mechanism of muscle fibers, utilizing the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle to observe the minimum threshold and contraction voltage before and after injection of SEVIN into the frog leg muscle. While our expectations for the decrease of contraction voltage were apparent from the data collected and the results of the paired t-test, we came to the additional conclusion that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean minimum threshold of the frog legs before and after treatment, based on the fact that our paired t-test derived p-value for the minimum threshold value exceeded our confidence interval of 95%.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is a collection of nerves and muscles that allows both vertebrates and invertebrates that allows to sense and respond to external and internal stimuli. As a system unique to animals, the neuromuscular system is based on electrical signaling via nerves, which resulting in a response from the organism within milliseconds. The skeletal muscles that grant animals voluntary movement are innervated by motor neurons at points referred to as neuromuscular junctions. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic nerve terminal into the neuromuscular junction as a result of nerve impulses that depolarize the neuron. ACh binding to its designated receptor on the muscle fiber membrane induces the opening of sodium channels, by which an action potential is generated from the sudden influx of sodium in the muscle fiber. This action potential then proceeds to spread across the fiber and stimulate the release of Ca+2, resulting in the mechanism known as muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. In a 1987 case study performed by KI Enomoto, researchers examined how the Rana brevipoda porosa neuromuscular junction was affected by the treatment of vesamicol, a drug that inhibits ACh uptake in the synaptic vesicles. In monitoring the response of sciatic nerve-sartorius muscle voltage stimulation, they found that vesamicol essentially blocked ACh transport, decreasing the postsynaptic ACh response, peak height, and decay time, concluding that inhibition involved the blocking of open channels [Enomoto: 1987]. The Rana pipiens is a species of leopard frog in which the contraction of a muscle through nerve stimulation would be easily and ideally observable by utilizing the sciatic nerve and its connected gastrocnemius muscle to analyze muscle contraction and minimum threshold stimulus. Based on the results of the Enomoto case study, in which ACh inhibition was found to have significant postsynaptic effects in the frog leg neuromuscular junction, we plan on similarly testing the effects of ACh inhibition on frog neuromuscular junctions by also stimulating the sciatic nerve to induce contractions, however, we intend to test the gastrocnemius nerve when treated with 2% solution SEVIN, an insecticide. To measure the effects, we plan on observing the minimum threshold and contraction voltage of the frog gastrocnemius muscle before and after treatment with SEVIN. Following the injection of the insecticide into the gastrocnemius muscle, we expect SEVIN to act as an ACh blocker and effectively raise the minimum threshold while lowering the contraction voltage due to the predicted inability of ACh to produce a postsynaptic response after treatment with SEVIN.

Materials and Methods:
Our group first selected 3 frog legs, first skinning each of the legs and moistening with frog Ringer’s solution. Following this, we gently separated the inner thigh muscles, revealing the white sciatic nerve which we then freed from its surrounding connective tissue. To finish preparations of the first frog leg, we cut the tendon connecting the gastrocnemius muscle close to the tendon, tying the severed tendon to a string which we then looped onto a device that elevated the muscle perpendicular to the dissecting plate. Placing the pin electrodes under the nerves, making sure they didn’t cross, we utilized iWorx as our program to record the stimulation and contraction of the muscle. We then set the initial pulse amplitude to 0.000V and stimulated the muscle by generating an action potential in the sciatic nerve. Continuing to stimulate the nerve, we increased the amplitude by 0.01V with each stimulation until we determined the threshold stimulus, i.e. the minimum voltage needed to generate a conducting pathway. Once we determined the minimum threshold, we then used the iWorx software to find and record the contraction voltage of the muscle. Then, with a syringe, we treated the gastrocnemius muscle with 2% SEVIN solution, an ACh esterase inhibitor. We then repeated the process to find the minimum threshold and contraction voltage for Leg #1 after treatment with the chemical. Following this, we repeated the entire process of determining minimum threshold and contraction voltage for Leg #2, followed by treatment and reassessment of minimum threshold and contraction voltage. This process was subsequently repeated for the Leg #3. Since we measured the same variables in the same group, the only difference being the time we measured the variables (i.e. before versus after treatment with SEVIN), we utilized a paired t-test to analyze the minimum threshold and contraction voltage of the legs before treatment with SEVIN in comparison to the minimum threshold and contraction voltage of the legs after treatment with SEVIN.

Results:
Figure 1. Average minimum threshold of the frog legs, in which the control group refers to the minimum threshold values of the legs gathered before treatment with SEVIN while the treatment group refers to the minimum threshold values of the same legs gathered after treatment. Each bar is the average minimum threshold of the gastrocnemius muscles of 3 frog legs stimulated through the sciatic nerve; error bars are ± s.d. Standard deviation for the control group was ±0.033. Standard deviation for the treatment group was ±0.031. With a p-value of 0.423, there was no statistically significant difference between the mean minimum threshold of the control group and the mean minimum threshold of the treatment group (statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05).

Regarding the minimum threshold of the frog legs before treatment in comparison to the minimum threshold of the legs after treatment, we found that on average there was little to no change between the mean minimum thresholds before treatment and the ones after, as seen in Figure 1. Legs #1 and #3 exhibited no change in minimum threshold with the treatment of SEVIN, whereas Leg #2 experienced only a slight increase in minimum threshold, requiring 0.0045V more to stimulate the leg after treatment. In terms of general observations, Leg #3 required double the amount of stimulation than did Legs #1 and #2 in order to achieve the minimum threshold, needing 0.1V as opposed to the 0.05V for Leg #1 or 0.0375V for Leg #2. Using a paired t-test to compare the mean minimum threshold of the 3 legs before treatment to the mean minimum threshold of the legs after treatment, we found that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean minimum threshold of the group before the treatment to its mean minimum threshold after (t-stat = 1.00, df = 2, P = 0.423). We know that the groups were not statistically different in minimum threshold because our t-test resulted in a p-value greater than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05).


Figure 2. Average contraction voltage of the frog legs, in which the control group refers to the contraction voltage values of the legs gathered before treatment with SEVIN while the treatment group refers to the contraction voltage values of the same legs gathered after treatment. Each bar is the average contraction voltage of the gastrocnemius muscles of 3 frog legs stimulated through the sciatic nerve; error bars are ± s.d. Standard deviation for the control group was ±0.016. Standard deviation for the treatment group was ±0.005. With a p-value of 0.02, there was a statistically significant difference between the mean contraction voltage of the control group and the mean contraction voltage of the treatment group (statistically significant at P &lt; 0.05).

Concerning the contraction voltages of the control and treatment groups, the difference between the mean contraction voltage of the 3 legs before treatment with SEVIN and the mean contraction voltage of the legs after treatment can be viewed in Figure 2, which confers an averaged decrease of 0.0221 ± 0.019 V from the control group to the treatment group. Legs #1, #2, and #3 all exhibited decreases in contraction voltage from before treatment to after treatment, thus resulting in an overall trend of decrease of contraction voltage from the control group to the treatment group. Using a paired t-test to compare the mean contraction voltage of the 3 legs before treatment to the mean contraction voltage of the legs after treatment, we found that the mean contraction voltage of the group after treatment was significantly lesser than its mean before treatment (t-stat = 3.02, df = 6, P = 0.023). We know that the groups were statistically different in contraction voltage because our t-test resulted in a p-value lesser than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05).

Discussion:
The results of our experiment indicate that while ACh inhibition through injection of the insecticide SEVIN seems to produce no immediate effects on the minimum threshold of the frog gastrocnemius muscle when stimulated through the sciatic nerve, the SEVIN-induced ACh inhibition does appear to cause a decrease in the contraction voltage of the gastrocnemius muscle, based on the trends found in the data conveyed in Figures 1 and 2. This corresponds with the results of our paired t-test, performed for both minimum threshold and voltage contractions, in which there was no statistically significant difference between the mean minimum threshold of the 3 frog legs before treatment and the mean minimum threshold of the legs after treatment, as p = 0.423, which is greater than the accepted p-value of &lt; 0.05. There was, however, a statistically significant difference between the mean contraction voltage of the group before treatment and its mean contraction voltage after, apparent in the p-value of 0.02. The p-value of the mean minimum threshold leads us to be unable to reject our null hypothesis pertaining to minimum threshold, however, our paired t-test results for the mean contraction voltage allows us to reject the null hypothesis pertaining to contraction voltage. In this sense, we can reject half of our original hypothesis while accepting the other half, in that as we predicted there was a decrease in mean contraction voltage between the control and treatment group, and yet contrary to what we expected, there was no difference in minimum threshold between before and after treatment. Our data can likely be explained by the results of the 2004 case study performed under CJ Smulder, in which it was found that ACh-invoked responses within the neuromuscular system of a rat were inhibited in response to carbaryl, the active ingredient in SEVIN. This was consistent across both high and low concentrations of ACh, such that ACh-induced ion currents were blocked in both high and low concentrations of ACh. They concluded that carbaryl directly inhibits neuronal ACh reuptake, meaning that the postsynaptic sites would be overstimulated as a result of ACh remaining within the postsynaptic gap. Without a relaxation period when ACh is reuptaken, this would lead to muscle fatigue which would appear as a decreased contraction voltage [Smulder: 2004]. While the model organism in the Smulder study was a rat as opposed to a frog, the results of the case may still offer an explanation as to why SEVIN affected only the contraction voltage and not the the minimum threshold, since it inhibits ACh reuptake rather than ACh reception. Another reason that there was no statistically significant difference between the mean minimum threshold before and after SEVIN treatment could be that not enough time had passed between when we injected the pesticide and when we tested for minimum threshold amplitude. In the Enomoto case study, the amplitude of the frog leg EPC after treatment with vesamicol remained unchanged for approximately 30 minutes before showing change [Enamoto: 1987]. While we may not have needed to wait that long before testing for the minimum threshold, a repeat of this experiment could possibly include a delay of 5-10 minutes between when the frog leg is injected and when it is tested in order to allow the carbaryl to act throughout the muscle fiber; this could also lead to a greater statistically significant difference in the contraction voltage. Another aspect of the experiment that could be adjusted for another trial would be the percent SEVIN in the solution we used, as our solution was only 2% SEVIN. A solution with a higher concentration of SEVIN, for example 5% or 7%, may exhibit stronger and/or more immediate effects regarding ACh inhibition within the frog leg.
