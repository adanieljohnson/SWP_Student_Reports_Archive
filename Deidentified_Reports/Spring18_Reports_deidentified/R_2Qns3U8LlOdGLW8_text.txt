Title: Change in clarity of water showed no significent difference in the agnostic behavior amongst Betta splendins. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to see how reduced water clarity affects the expression of aggressive behavior in Betta splendins. We did this experiment by quantifying the number of times the betta splendins observed  I hypothesize that there will be a difference in the agnostic behavior that is observed when we change the betta splendins environment from clear water to murky water. There was no significent difference between the total behaviors before and after the treatment (t_stat= 2.32, d.f.= 2, p= 0.07). Therefore, my hypothesis was not supported. This experiment is important for understanding how artificial selection and domestication has on the adaptability of fish. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we wanted to see how reduced water clarity affects the expression of aggressive behavior in Betta splendins. Betta splendins, typically called betta fish elicit aggressive behavior and are bred for fighting and being beautifully colored fish. This also means that they are domesticated fish. Because Betta splendins are domesticated fish they are typically in clear water fish tanks. Within our experiment, we want to see how Betta splendins react in their wild-life habitat of murky water. Betta splendins originate in Thailand where they are typically in many varieties of environments such as rice paddies, ditches and other muddy and sluggish water [Johnson: 2017]. Because of this, we thought it would be interesting to view how domesticated Betta splendins would act in their original habitats. In an experiment published in 2011 titled Communication in troubled water: responses of fish communication systems to changing environments, concluded that by altering the environment of fish, with more suspended particles that scatter light within their environment, will affect visual communication. Another main point that they highlighted within their article was the fact that the reception of visual signals can be altered if they are not in the same environment that they regularly inhabit because fish visual systems tend to be adapted to their normal habitats [Vander der Sluijs et al. : 2011]. Therefore, it is right to infer that if we alter a fish's environment they will elicit different behaviors because it is not their typical habitat that they have adapted to. With this in mind, I hypothesize that there will be a difference in the agnostic behavior that is observed when we change the Betta splendins environment from clear water to murky water because the murky water will have affected the vision of fishes and will result from them in changing their behaviors. 

Materials and Method:
We obtained three Betta splendins and paired them up with each other to make three replicates for our data. We labeled the fishes 1, 2, and 3. The first pair was fish 1 and 3. The second pair was 1 and 2. And the last pair, 3, was 1 and 3. Then we observed each pair for five minutes with only the clear divider up among the pairs. We observed the pairs by quantifying their agnostic behaviors. We viewed each fish separately counting how many times each of them elicited tail flashing and red mane behaviors and then added those numbers together to get the total of those agnostic behaviors from one of the pairs. After we observed the first pair we let the fishes rest for five minutes. For the next two pairs, we observed for five minutes and then let them rest for five minutes. Then we took all the fish out from the tank and added soil to the tank, enough to give the water a murky look and repeated the past procedures with all the pairs of fish in the murky water. Lastly, we recorded this information in a table and calculated the significent values of the difference between the number of agnostic behaviors in clear water than those behaviors in murky water through a two-tailed t_test.

Results:
The average for the before condition was 18.67+/- 2.08 and the average for the after the condition was 12.33+/- 4.16. There was no significent difference between the total behaviors before and after the treatment (t_stat= 2.32, d.f.= 2, p= 0.07). In figure 1 the average behaviors in the clear water environment were larger than that of aggressive behavior in the murky water environment. There was more variability in the after treatment data. 



Discussion:
In conclusion there was no significent difference from the aggressive behaviors displayed in clear water than in the murky water. There was a difference in the averages of quantitative results as you can see in figure 1, but that cannot conclude our overall results with the two tailed t_test. This could have been an error on the experimental design side whereas if we had let the Betta splendins in the murky water for more than 5 minutes we could have viewed a difference in the behaviors displayed. What these results can tell us is that the Betta splendins are not able to adapt to different environments as the non-domesticated Betta splendins are. I initially had thought that maybe the water clarity could affect the vision of the fish, but if they had adapted to their new environment they could have elicited a response because of that. Therefore they just weren't able to adapt to their environment leaving them motionless and similar to their prior environment. Also, this can tell us that the domesticated Betta splendins have only evolved to their own adapted environment and lack adaptation to new environments because within their artificial environments there is no variability. This can also be viewed as a lack of phenotypic plasticity, which is seen in organisms that experience environmental change. Within a study on the effects of genetic and light environment on color expression in sticklebacks concluded that the fish responded differently within different environmental colors because of their phenotypic plasticity and this was due to the fact that the sticklebacks are adjusted to changing environments[Lewandowski & Baughman:2008]. Unlike the Betta splendins who are not exposed to changing environments, they are not able to fully adapt to their environments and this could be a reason for no response to the new environment of murky water. These results are relevant to fully understanding what domestication and artificial selection can have on the organism as a whole. Animals who have been isolated for protection can act differently within their captive state and differently once they are released. Animals that have been bred for certain reasons such as chickens have been studied to have different behaviors under controllled domestication. In a 2006 study, they were found to show less intense social behavior and lower frequency of social interactions as well as being less inclined to explore unknown food sources [Jensen: 2006]. The junglefowl chickens and laying hens behaved differently and found that the wild chickens were able to adapt better to a sudden change in environmental conditions. The genes that were under selection for any domesticated breed can also affect behavior and the capacity to adapt. Artificial selection and domestication has more of an effect than just tailoring to a certain need but can actually affect the animals abilities to properly survive out in a wild habitat which is necessary to know when being selective for a trait.
