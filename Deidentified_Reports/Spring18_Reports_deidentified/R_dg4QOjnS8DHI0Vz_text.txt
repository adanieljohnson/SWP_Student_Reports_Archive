Title: The Impact of Blocking Acetylcholine on Muscle Contraction in Rana pipiens Legs

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of blocking acetylcholine in a Rana pipiens frog leg.  This experiment tested whether Sevin, an acetylcholine blocker, caused a difference in contractions at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus in Rana pipiens frog legs.  This was done by testing the minimum point of contraction in a frog leg without Sevin and then injected with Sevin.  This was repeated with three more frog legs.  I hypothesized that that blocking acetylcholine in Rana pipiens frog legs will prohibit an action potential from reaching a muscle and thus causing a contraction at a higher minimal threshold of voltage stimulus.  The results concluded that there is a statistical difference, a p-value of 0.038, in contractions at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus between Rana pipiens frog legs injected by Sevin vs those not injected by Sevin.

Introduction:
In vertebrates and invertebrates hundreds to thousands of myofibers compose skeletal muscle [Johnson:2018]. Skeletal muscles are supplied by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are in gray matter of the spinal cord [Johnson:2018].  Axons of these motor neurons go into muscles and branch to individual myofibers at places called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2018].  Nerve impulses at these neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine, an organic chemical, which binds with a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber which opens sodium channels to create an action potential [Johnson:2018].  The action potential then spreads and causes the release of Ca2+ which activates the contraction of the muscle fiber making it shorten [Johnson:2018], [Hamlin:2000].  Acetylcholine being inhibited in the muscle has been known to increase the latency period and increase the time and voltage needed in order for acetylcholine to bind to receptors and allow for contraction [Hamlin:2000].  The amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is also decreased [Hamlin:2000].  Hamlin performed a similar study looking at the effect of acetylcholine receptor inhibitors and its impact on the latency period of the contraction of the gastrocnemius of the tested frog [Hamlin:2000].

Our experiment will be focused on blocking acetylcholine in a Rana pipiens frog leg.  The Rana pipiens frog is known also as the northern leopard frog and is a type of leopard frog from the true frog family [O’Donnell:2012].  The Rana pipiens frog is an ideal organism for the experiment because of its easy accessibility in the United States and good endurance for its muscles for muscle physiology, and it also it has been used for a long time with many studies to examine the nervous system [O’Donnell:2012].

The experiment will be done so by stimulating a Rana pipiens frog leg to record the magnitude of its contraction, and then repeating the process by injecting the chemical Sevin, an acetylcholine blocker, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine.  I hypothesize that blocking acetylcholine in Rana pipiens frog legs will prohibit an action potential from reaching a muscle and thus causing a contraction at a higher minimum threshold of voltage stimulus.


Materials and Methods:
4 Rana pipiens frog legs were to be used in the experiment.  Each frog leg had the gastrocnemius muscle separated by cutting the Achilles tendon, and then the muscle was tied to a force transducer at a ninety-degree angle with the rest of the leg pinned down.  The sciatic nerve was then isolated and stimulated to record the magnitude of the minimum point of contraction.  Then after recording the minimum point of contraction and three myograms, the average of the three trials was taken.  Then, with the same leg, 0.1mL of a 2% solution of Sevin (the acetylcholine blocker) was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle and after 5 minutes of allowing the treatment to be absorbed, the minimum point of contraction is recorded again with the same process of averaging the three trials (myograms).  This procedure is done in this experiment with 4 frog legs.  After repeating this whole process 4 times, a paired t-test is calculated.

Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the contraction at the average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the Sevin chemical treatment groups is higher than of the control groups.  The average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the control group is 0.0825+/-0.034V compared to the higher average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the treatment group at 0.1375+/-0.025V.  This difference was proven to be statistically significant as the two groups were statistically different from one another after conducting a paired t-test which had a p-value of 0.038, t-stat of -2.68, and df of 3.

Discussion:
My hypothesis seemed to be supported by my results at first glance with the contraction at the average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the control group is 0.0825V compared to the much higher average of the treatment group at 0.1375V, and my hypothesis was statistically supported by the paired t-test which came out with a p-value of 0.038 which is below the significant level of 0.05.  Therefore a statistical difference between Rana pipiens frog legs injected by Sevin vs those not injected by Sevin can be proven in this study.  The statistically supported difference between the contractions shows that Sevin successfully inhibits the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and thus prohibiting an action potential from reaching a muscle and causing a contraction.

The goal of Hamlin’s study, looking at the effect of acetylcholine receptor inhibitors and its impact on the latency period of the contraction of the gastrocnemius of the tested frog, was to look at how the chemicals effect the rate by which acetylcholine molecules are able to reach receptors, open sodium channels, and simulate contraction [Hamlin:2000].  The study was not statistically proven in that if an inhibitor is added to the gastrocnemius of the frog then the latency period will increase, but the results did show a slight difference and allows for further studies to test the effects of acetylcholine on other aspects of muscle contraction [Hamlin:2000].

The next logical step for this study would be to run another experiment again diving deeper into Sevin’s blocking of acetylcholine.  Now because we know that Sevin has a significant effect on the contraction of minimum thresholds of voltage stimulus, we can run a second experiment testing the differences in the minimum thresholds of contraction with different amounts of Sevin injected in order to further understand Sevin’s blocking of acetylcholine and its impact on muscle contraction.

Overall, the experiment provides an excellent way into examining the role acetylcholine plays in muscle contraction [Johnson:2018].  This experiment is particularly important because the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens is very similar to the gastrocnemius muscle in humans.  This allows experimenters to generalize findings to humans and get an idea of how the gastrocnemius muscle works with acetylcholine as well as all other muscles in the human body.  Understanding what weakens the force of muscle contraction can be applied to find out what increases the force of muscle contraction.  Understanding this concept can be important for finding treatment for individuals with neuromuscular diseases.

The treatment group (blue bar) is the frogs legs when they are injected with the Sevin chemical, and the control group (orange bar) is the frog legs when they are not injected with anything.  Each bar is the mean of the minimum average voltages from the control group (0.0825V) and Sevin chemical groups (0.1375); error bars are +/-0.034V for the control bar and +/-0.025V for the Sevin chemical bar.
