Title: High and low temperatures slow the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
The light dependent reactions refer to the first portion of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light into energy [Johnson: 2016]. In this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts obtained from Spinacia oleracea was determined in a low temperature environment, a high temperature environment, and a room temperature environment using DCPIP and a mass spectrophotometer. I hypothesized that chloroplasts kept in a high temperature environment would have the slowest rate of photosynthesis in comparison to chloroplasts kept in a low temperature environment and chloroplasts kept at room temperature. Additionally, I predicted that the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts kept in the low temperature environment would be slow in comparison to the control group, however not as slow as the high temperature group. A two-sample t-test indicated that the rate of photosynthesis in the high temperature group was significantly lower than that of the control group. A second two-sample t-test between the control group and the low temperature group indicated a smaller yet significant difference between the rate of photosynthesis of the two groups. All aspects of the hypothesis was supported. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants make energy [Johnson: 2016]. Stage 1 of photosynthesis is referred to as the light-independent reactions because UV light has to excite electrons in the chlorophyll to initiate process [Johnson: 2016]. Excited electrons are first absorbed by photosystem II where they enter an electron-transport chain; the electron carrier plastoquinone picks them and carries them to an enzyme called the cytochrome b6-f complex [Alberts: 2014]. This movement of electrons is energetically favorable, and so this process is coupled with the energetically favorable process of pumping protons from the region of the chloroplast called the stroma across the thylakoid membrane to another region referred to as the thylakoid space in order to create a proton gradient [Alberts: 2014]. As protons flow down their gradient back into the stroma, an enzyme called ATP synthase initiates the production of energy in the form of ATP [Alberts: 2014]. When photosystem II needs more electrons, water is broken down and oxygen is released as a byproduct [Johnson: 2016]. 
	In the second portion of the light dependent reactions electrons enter photosystem I [Johnson: 2016]. Catalyzed by the cytochrome b6-f complex, electrons are passed from the electron carrier plastoquinone to the electron carrier plastocyanin [Alberts: 2014]. They are then carried to another electron carrier known as ferredoxin; ferredoxin carries its electrons to ferredoxin NADP reductase, an enzyme that initiates the production of energy in the form of NADPH and marks the end of the light independent reactions [Alberts: 2014]. In this experiment, we studied how temperature affects these reactions. Temperature and time were our independent variables, and the rate of photosynthesis-determined by the percent change in absorbance-was our dependent variable. Spinacia oleracea were used in this experiment because spinach is accessible, inexpensive, and relatively easy to obtain chloroplasts from. 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) was added to our chloroplasts because it clearly indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis through an observable change in color and, thus, allows us to measure the rate of photosynthesis. The Hill reaction refers to the electron transfer that occurs during the light reactions; when DCPIP is oxidized, or when it loses electrons, it changes from a dark blue liquid to a clear liquid [Johnson: 2016]. 
I hypothesized that spinach chloroplasts kept in high temperatures would show a decreased rate of photosynthesis. Enzymes, proteins that catalyze reactions, are necessary throughout the light independent reactions, as demonstrated by the role the cytochrome b6-f complex, ATP synthase, and NADP reductase [Alberts: 2014].  Literature suggests that high temperatures can lead to the degradation of proteins, and, thus, inhibit them from functioning properly. In a previous study, an enzyme assay on rice that had been grown in high temperatures indicated a decrease in sink carbohydrate metabolism enzymes [Chaturvedi: 2017]. In another study, mesophilic photosynthetic bacteria were put in environments 80  C and photosynthesis ceased because pigment-proteins lost their normal structure [Ratsep: 2018]. I predicted that the enzymes involved in the light reactions of spinach leaves would begin to degrade at high temperatures, and, thus, slow down the rate of photosynthesis.
Additionally, I hypothesized that spinach chloroplasts kept in cold temperatures would have a slightly lower rate of synthesis than spinach chloroplasts kept at room temperature, however not as slow of a rate as the chloroplasts kept at high temperatures. Cold temperatures do not appear to have the same deteriorating effects on proteins that high temperatures do; however, they may slow the overall process. A previous study found that cold temperatures reduced the efficiency of photosystem II in Opuntia streptacantha plantlets [Ojeda-Pérez, 2017]. I predicted that chloroplasts in 0  C would have a slower rate of photosynthesis than chloroplasts in 21  C but not as slow as the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts in 80  C.


Materials and Methods:
Veins were removed from four large spinach leaves using scissors and the remains were ground into a thick paste using a mortar and pestle and 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8).  After the spinach leaves were ground, 10 more mL of grinding buffer was added, and the mixture was strained using a cheesecloth. The filtered liquid was transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and spun in a centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm at 4 C. The supernatant was poured into a second 50 mL centrifuge tube, and the debris was discarded. The mixture was placed back in the centrifuge for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm at 4 C. The supernatant was poured out and discarded, and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. 
To prepare a blank for the spectrophotometer, 8mL of water was added to a test tube in addition to 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Ten more test tubes were obtained, and 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer was added to each. Three test tubes were randomly assigned to the control group, three were assigned to treatment group 1, three were assigned to treatment group 2, and two were assigned to the negative control group. 100  l of the pellet and grinding buffer mixture was added to all test tubes including the blank and excluding the negative control group.  All of the mixtures were mixed and transferred to cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was immediately blanked using the mixture from the blank test tube. Immediately after that each of the samples was placed into the spectrophotometer and the absorbance at 600 nm for each was obtained. 
The three control group test tubes and the two negative control test tubes were placed under a grow light in 21 C. Simultaneously, the three test tubes in experimental group 1 were placed in an ice bath (0 C), and the three test tubes in experimental group 2 were placed in a hot bath (~80 C). The test tubes stayed in their respective places for 10 minutes. The spectrophotometer was then re-blanked and the absorbance of each at 600 nm was recorded again. After another 10 minutes in their respective locations, the spectrophotometer was again blanked and the absorbance of each at 600 nm was recorded for a third time. After 10 more minutes in their places the absorbance of each was taken again. Percent change between the absorbance at time zero and the absorbance after 10 minutes was calculated for each test tube. Percent change was then calculated for 20 minutes and 30 minutes. A two- sample t-test was used to compare the percent change in absorbance after 30 minutes between experimental group 1 and the control as well as experimental group 2 and the control group.



Results:
As demonstrated by Figure 1, the percent change in absorbance in the high temperature group was the lowest of the three, indicating that the high temperature group had the lowest rate of photosynthesis. The low temperature group appeared to have a slightly greater percent change, but the room temperature group had the largest percent change, indicating that the rate of photosynthesis in the control group was the highest. A two-sample t-test indicated that the percent change in absorbance for the high temperature group was significantly different from the control group (p= 0.000465, t-stat= -8.10, df= 5). Another two-sample t-test between indicated that the percent change in absorbance for the low temperature group was significantly different from the control group as well (p=0.0184, t-stat= -3.5, df= 5). 

Discussion:
The rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts kept in a high temperature environment was significantly lower than the rate of photosynthesis of spinach chloroplasts at room temperature; the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts kept in a low temperature environment was also significantly lower than the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts at room temperature, however the difference was not as significant as it was for the high temperature group. All aspects of the hypothesis were supported. The large difference between the rate of photosynthesis in the high temperature group and the rate of photosynthesis in the control group may be attributed to heat's influence on proteins; it has been observed that high temperatures can make plant enzymes start to unfold or degrade [Chaturvedi: 2017]. The significant yet slightly smaller difference in the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts in low temperatures may be attributed to the fact that cold temperatures appear to slow processes down, specifically in Photosystem II according to previous research [Ojeda-Pérez, 2017].  Cold temperatures do appear to have an impact; however, they do not appear to have the detrimental effect that the extremely warm temperatures do.
	Although the hypothesis was supported, the study could be improved by increasing the sample size of each of the groups. Additionally, it would be beneficial to put the chloroplasts in an alternate high temperature environment; the hot bath had a lid on it, and so the chloroplasts in the high temperature environment were not as close to the grow light as the control groups and the cold temperature group. This could have contributed to the low rate of photosynthesis. Future experiments should investigate if chloroplasts put in a high temperature environment or in a low temperature environment for an extended amount of time eventually adapt to their environment and photosynthesize at a typical rate. Our experiment only allowed the chloroplasts to stay in their respective environments for 30 minutes total. 
	The results we found are significant because they can be tied to climate change. Over the past 50 years, climate change has affected temperature patterns [Ojeda-Pérez, 2017]. Results from our experiment indicate that drastic changes in temperature, whether that be cold temperatures or hot temperatures, can significantly reduce the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts. This is extremely significant seeing as though it is the light independent reactions of photosynthesis that produce and release oxygen [Alberts: 2014]. Although our conclusions cannot be generalized to all plants, it is important to note that extreme temperature changes, as initiated by climate change, can decrease the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts obtained from spinach.
