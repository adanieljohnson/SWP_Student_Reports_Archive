Title: Neutral effects of IBMX and caffeine on Physarum polycephalum aggregation

Abstract:
Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes utilize signal transduction pathways, systems of interconnected biochemical processes, to trigger important reactions that help them adapt to the surrounding environment. Signal transduction pathways utilize secondary messengers, such as the adenosine triphosphate derivative Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, to elicit desired reactions. This experiment studies the effect phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and caffeine have on the aggragation of P. polycephalum.  By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, P. polycephalum should not be able to degrade its cAMP secondary messenger pool, causing aggregation to increase around the site of a chemoattractant. It was found that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and caffeine had no significent effect on the rate of aggregation. These results contradict with previous studies which have found that increasing the concentration of cAMP increases aggregation of P. polycephalum.


Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways are systems of interconnected biochemical processes, used in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, that transform a stimulus into a biochemical signal to trigger important reactions and processes. In bacteria specially, signal transduction method are important in allowing adaptation in response to environmental change through processes such as phototaxis and chemotaxis [1].  A signal transduction pathway is activated when a ligand binds to a receptor. Dependent upon the type of receptor, its activation triggers the creation of various secondary messengers, such as nucleotide derivatives and membrane lipid derivatives, utilized to elicit desired reactions [2]. Once the desired reaction has occurred, the signal transduction pathway needs to be turned back off. This is often achieved by either degrading the secondary messenger pool, or by desensitizing the receptor [2]. Physarum polycephalum utilizes many different secondary messengers in its signal intracellular transduction pathways, one of the most important being Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)—a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [3]. 

In P. polycephalum, the secondary messenger cAMP is involved in the controll of movement. The signal transduction pathway that utilizes cAMP is activated by a G-stimulatory protein, which then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, causing it to convert ATP to cAMP [2].  cAMP then goes on to bind regulatory subunits on inactive protein kinase A (PKA), inducing a conformation change which frees the two catalytic subunits in their active form [2]. These active subunits go on to phosphorylates various targets involved in motile functions of P. polycephalum, causing the slime mold to grow—typically towards a chemoattractant. In order to stop growth, this signal transduction pathway must be turned off. This is done by using phosphodiesterase to degrade cAMP [2].

This experiment aims to determine what would happen if cAMP was never degraded, by utilizing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to prevent degradation of the secondary messenger pool.  Based on previous knowledge of this signal transduction pathway, it is hypothesized that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX will cause a significent increase in the aggregation of P. polycephalum around the site of a chemoattractant.	


Materials and Method:
P. polycephalum was chosen as the model organism for this experiment due to its rapid growth rate and thick strands which allows for easy measurement. The P. polycephalum utilized in this experiment had been cultured in lab 5 days before the experiment and kept in an incubator at 37C. The P. polycephalum culture was prepared using a 100mm water-agar plate with two 1mm P polycephalum blocks, and oatmeal as food. It is important to note that water agar platers were used instead of another agar variant because water agar adds no nutrients, therefore providing no additional incentive for the P. polycephalum to aggregate.  To begin the experiment, six 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar medium were obtained. Using Sharpie, two one centimeter blocks were drawn on the back of each plate. Three controll plates were then coated with water, and three experimental plates were coated with a mixture of 1mM IBMX and 20nM caffeine. The plates were left to sit with the coat for 10 minutes to ensure proper absorption into the gel.  After 10 minutes, the coat was poured carefully into the sink and the plates were dried using Kimwipes. Flat-tipped forceps and a flat metal spatula were then sterilized using ethanol and an alcohol lamp containing 95% ethanol. It is important to note that instruments were sterilized between each step of the experiment.  Two 1 cm squares were then cut in each plate, corresponding with the 1cm squares drawn, using the sterilized flat-tipped forceps and flat metal spatula, and replaced with 1 cm squares of P. polycephalum from the stock plate. One flake of oatmeal was then placed on top of each 1 cm block of P. polycephalum to provide a chemoattractant. The initial area of each P. polycephalum was taken. Afterwards, all six plates were wrapped in tinfoil, to prevent phototaxis, and placed in an incubator set at 37C to insure temperature stability. The mold was then measured at 12 hour intervals, to assess the area of aggregation, for a total period of 36 hours. After all data had been collected, an area calculating software was used to determine the growth of each sample. The percent change was then calculated using the formula shown in Figure 1. Two tailed t_tests (assuming equal variances) were then run to determine whether or not the results from the experiment were significent.  The critical value by which statistical significance was determined was 0.05. 


Results:
Overall, the experimental plates aggregated more than the controll plates. Experimental 2 and Experimental 3 both aggregated noticeably, while Experimental 1 did not aggregate at all. However, there was no significent difference between the controll P. polycephalum plates coated with water and the experimental P. polycephalum plates coated with caffeine and IBMX (t (4) =-1.47, p = 0.22). 


Discussion:
Overall, there was no statistically significent evidence supporting the hypothesis that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX will cause an increase in the aggregation of P. polycephalum. The results of the experiment were inconclusive and produced no observable general trends. While both Experimental 1 and Experimental 3 both aggregated over the 36-hour time frame, they grew away from the chemoattractant, the oatmeal flake, rather than aggregating around it. Their percent change also differed tremendously, making it difficult to compare the two. The results from this experiment differ from those in past literature. A similar experiment conducted using P. polycephalum found that the autocrine production cAMP leads to aggregation and autocrine production of extra-cellular cAMP phosphodiesterase plays an important role in controllling the rate of said aggregation [2]. Based on the results of this experiment, our P. polycephalum should have shown increased aggregation around the site of the chemoattractant, as cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase was inhibited.  Previous studies also may explain why the P. polycephalum aggregated away from the chemoattractant rather than around it. A previous experiment studying how different chemoattractants affected the rate chemotaxis in P. polycephalum found IBMX to be a moderate chemoattractant [5].  If the IBMX did act as a chemoattractant in this experiment, it would explain why the P. polycephalum grew outwards instead of aggregating around the oatmeal flake. 
 
Both the experimental group and the controll group contained outliers. Control 3 grew between hours 24 and 36. This signifies that it was likely contaminated by either the unsterilized flat-tipped forceps or flat metal spatula, or that the plate was exposed to light between hours 24 and 36 and underwent phototaxis.  Experimental 1 experienced no growth over the 36-hour period. This could indicate that the plate was not completely dried after coating with IBMX and caffeine, causing the P. polycephalum to die. If the experiment were to be performed again in the future, it would be beneficial to choose a different phosphodiesterase inhibitor to ensure that the oatmeal was the only chemoattractant located in the plates. It could also be beneficial to wrap the plates in two layers of tinfoil, rather than just one, to ensure that the P. polycephalum is not exposed to light. Future experimentation could be beneficial because cAMP is a common secondary messenger used by humans as well. Knowledge of how cAMP and cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase effect said signal transduction pathway could be utilized in the medical industry to help create new pharmaceutical drugs. Overall, the experiment displayed that inhibiting phosphodiesterase, causing an increase in cAMP, most likely had some effect on the aggregation of P. polycephalum.
