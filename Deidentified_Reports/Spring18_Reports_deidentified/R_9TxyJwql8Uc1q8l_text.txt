Title: E20 Inhibition and the Developmental Cycle of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Growth and development of manduca sexta is primarily governed by two hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Through a mechanism based on concentration ratios, the two hormones alternate in spikes at key stages of development. We hypothesized that blocking ecdysone would distort the ratios and inhibit the growth of the larvae. Using azamax, the study inhibits ecdysone via azamax ingested by the larvae to measure the effects of the absence of ecdysone and larval development. The experimental group was found to be significently smaller as an overall population; therefore, we can concluded that, at least in early stages, ecdysone is necessary to initiate and promote growth (i.e. molting) from one larval stage to the next.


Introduction:
The hormonal pathways that regulate the development of the tobacco hornworm are well documented and understood. Two hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and and ecdysone (E20), govern life cycle development which is dependent upon relative concentration ratios [Johnson 2016]. Given our understanding of the nature of hormones and their functions, this study attempts to understand the specific function of the hormone E20 in governing the manduca sexta life cycle. Manteca seat is being used as the experimental organism because of it’s relatively short (approximately 40 day) life cycle and the relatively easy nature of accessing and manipulating hormone circulation. Schwartz and Truman (1983) found that in the first three stages of larval development of manduca sexta, E20 promotes growth and development; however, after the third stage, E20 becomes inhibitory in nature (Schwartz and Truman). Therefore, we hypothesize that the inhibition of E20 during the first three larval stages should inhibit development and prevent the larvae from developing normally (retarded growth).


Materials and Method:
First, eight larvae were selected and divided into two groups, experimental and controll. The two groups were separated into separate rearing containers and kept in the same incubator. Each day, both groups were fed. The controll diet consisted of ten grams of food per larva with seven drops of water per ten grams of food. The experimental diet is the same with seven drops of aza max substituted for the seven drops of water. At each feeding, the larvae were weighed. At the end, a mean was calculated for the controll and experimental groups and a two sample t- test was used to evaluate the significance of the E20 inhibitor.



Results:
As demonstrated by figures 1, 2, and 3, on average, the controll group grew bigger and faster than the experimental group with the notable exceptions of controll 2 and experimental 4. The mean weight table (figure 1) was used for a two sample t test. The t test returned a t value of 2.48884 and a p value of .013001; thus, these results are significent. 


Discussion:
Given the significance of the findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the delayed growth of the experiment group was due to the E20 inhibition and the hypothesis is supported by the data. Given the finding of Schwartz and Truman (1983), this would indicate that E20 is necessary for early larval development. In the data, it is necessary to note that the mean weight table (figure 3) is calculated without the data from controll two and experiment four because there is incomplete data for experiment four as the larva escaped from the container and was disposed of in the middle of the study and controll two is such an outlier that it would impact the results. Ultimately, this suggests further study of the mechanisms of E20 that initiate cellular growth responses which may allow us to better understand human growth mechanisms and inter hormonal relationships that affect human development. It may slo allow us to develop new more effective (and less harmful) pesticides
