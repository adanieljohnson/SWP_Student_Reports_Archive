Title: Injecting Caffeine in the gastrocnemius muscle of frog contracting the muscle and raising the resting baseline

Abstract:
Skeletal muscles are controlled by the motor neuron innervating it. The release of calcium leads to the contraction of muscle. Caffeine, as a chemical used in daily basis, induces the release of calcium. The objective of this study is to discover the effect of caffeine on muscle. Rena pipien’s gastrocnemius muscle is used as the model organism. The hypothesis was that caffeine would cause the muscle to contract in larger amplitude under the same stimulation. Caffeine was directly injected to the muscle in the study to reach the goal. The result showed that the muscle treated with caffeine contracted less under the same stimulation but performed a higher total amount of contraction due to the rise in baseline during the injection process. The result didn’t support the hypothesis but provided a future study direction. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. The point at which the axon of neuron innervates the myofiber that consists skeletal muscles is called neuromuscular junction. The impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of neuro transmitter acetylcholine (ACh). Next, ACh binds to its receptor on the muscle fiber and opens sodium channels that create action potential in the muscle fiber. The voltage-sensitive calcium channel is then opened to release the stored calcium into the muscle fiber. The contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber is finally activated by the releasing of calcium and causes the muscle to shorten [1]. Three distinct phases are included in the process: latent period, contraction phase and relaxation phase. Latent period is the time period between the stimulation and the beginning of the contraction. Contraction phase is the time that the muscle spends to contract. Relaxation phase refers to the relax time of the muscle. In the study, we are using gastrocnemius muscle from Rena pipien’s leg, which is controlled by sciatic nerve. The subject frog is chosen because it’s easy to obtain and observe. We are investigating the effect of caffeine when injected to the gastrocnemius muscle in the study. Since caffeine induces the release of calcium in the muscle, our alternative hypothesis is that caffeine would cause the muscle to contract harder under the same stimulation. In other words, the amplitude of the contraction would be larger. The amount of caffeine injected would be independent variable while the amplitude of the contraction would be dependent variable. 

Materials and Methods:
For the setup of our study, we picked two legs from individual frogs. The treatment we applied on the legs included degloving the legs by pulling the skin down towards the foot, separating the inner thigh muscles and exposing the sciatic nerve, separating the gastrocnemius from the tibia and disconnecting it by cutting underneath the achilles tendon. Next, we tied a loop around the gastrocnemius junction and cut the excess string and achilles tendon and hang the loop on the force transducer by 90°. The leg was pinned on the tray to be immobilized. The leg should be kept moist with frog ringer for the whole time. To record the force, we poked the two electrodes into the gastrocnemius muscle on the two ends. 

We set the number of pulses as three to get an average number of amplitude generated. The pulse width was set at 5ms with 1Hz frequency and 0 holding potential. Then we stimulated the muscle at 0.5V, 1.0V and 1.5V. After recording the amplitude of the contraction, we injected 0.1ml of caffeine with concentration 100mM/L to three different locations on the muscle, 0.3ml in total. Then we recorded the contraction amplitude at 0.5V, 1.0V and 1.5V again. The muscle was referred as control when it hasn’t accepted caffeine and referred as experimental after caffeine was injected. Both two legs went through the same process.

We used paired t-test as statistical test to see if our results were significant different from each other. The reason was that we had multiple pairs of observations on the same muscle before and after the caffeine treatment.

Results:
The result of paired t-test was that t-stat=10.36, df=5, P=0.000144.

According to the myogram generated from the software, we observed a gradually rising in the baseline during the injection of caffeine. The mean value of this baseline shifting is 1.718V. The muscles also appeared to become stiff and reached tetanus during the injection of caffeine. The muscle with caffeine was significantly shorter than the one without caffeine although they were at almost the same length before treated with caffeine. 

Figure 1 shows that the experiment group expressed less amount of contraction caused by stimulation. Figure 2 shows that the experiment group experienced larger amount of total contraction. The difference of the total amount of contraction between control group and experiment group became smaller as the stimulation increased. 

Discussion:
The mean of control and experiment group without the shifting of baseline was significantly different from each other because P is much smaller than 0.05. Our results didn’t support our hypothesis that the caffeine would increase the amplitude of contraction caused by stimulation. We were not aware of the baseline shifting before the study. Therefore, we didn’t consider the total amount of contraction. The explanation could be that the amplitude of baseline after injection caffeine was already higher than or similar to the amplitude of contraction the stimulation could provide. Thus, the muscle didn’t contract as much as before. The phenomenon could be rationalized by the function of caffeine. Since caffeine induces calcium, it would immediately cause the contraction of the muscle that wouldn’t relax as it normally should. The article published by J.M. Lopes et al. also suggests the same outcome by stating caffeine had a direct effect on skeletal muscle contractile [2]. 

Mistake might generate because of the large amount of caffeine we added to the muscle. Because the muscle reached tetanus status after we injected caffeine, the amount of caffeine was more than it could take. Thus, if we reduce the amount of caffeine and observe visible contraction after injection, the result would be more accurate. 

Next, we would change our hypothesis and design a new study based on the new hypothesis. The new hypothesis would focus on the total amount of contraction and discuss the relationship between the caffeine injected and the amplitude of contraction resulted.
