Title: How Precor Effects the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as the tobacco horn worm, is an insect that many would consider as a pest. The Manduca sexta starts as larvae and develops into a moth. In order to achieve this metamorphosis into a moth, Manduca sexta must undergo molting, which is induced by the hormones Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone, which controll the type and timing of molting. This experiment aims to solve the hypothesis of whether adding Precor, an Insect Growth regulator used to stop fleas, would prevent the growth of the Manduca sexta. The experiment resulted in the Manduca sexta treated with Precor, which was mixed in their food, growing much larger than the Manduca sexta not given Precor in their food. On average, the Manduca sexta treated with Precor, the treatment group, weighed 4.13 grams. This is 0.48975 grams more than the average controll group weight, which was 3.64025. Since the treatment group grew much larger than the controll group, the hypothesis that Precor would limit the growth of Manduca sexta is rejected.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or otherwise known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that pertains to the Order Lepidoptera. The Order Lepidoptera houses all butterflies, moths, and skippers. The Manduca sexta, aside from pertaining to the Order Lepidoptera, Manduca sexta also pertains to the general classification of the broad term “pest”. This is because the Manduca sexta is detrimental to crops. The Manduca sexta has a relatively short lifespan in the eyes of humans, as it’s life only spans on an average of from 39 to 48 days. The life cycle of the Manduca sexta can be classified as a holometabolous life cycle, as the Manduca sexta begins as an egg and develops into an adult. This developmental process is pushed by hormones.  The main hormones in Manduca sexta that help propel it towards the next steps in its life are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. The main purpose of Juvenile Hormone is to regulate the type of molt that the Manduca sexta will undergo (Johnson AD, 2016). Manduca Sexta can undergo two types of molting: larval or metamorphic (Kingsolver, 2007). Ecdysterone is responsible for the timing of this molting. These two hormones work together in the development of the Manduca sexta, tampering with one could yield many different results such as the halting of growth. There are many chemicals that can cause a fluctuation in the balance of Juvenile Hormone and and Ecdysterone, one main one being Precor.  The main use of Precor is for pest controll. It is a commodity on the market that can be ordered online or bought in convenience stores. Precor is an example of an Insect Growth Regulator. The purpose of Insect Growth Regulators is to offer a substitution to harmful pesticides. Pesticides can harm the crops they are aiming to protect from pests whereas Insect Growth Regulators are less harmful and aim to prevent the insect from surviving.  The effects of Precor on Manduca sexta are hypothesized that as an Insect Growth Regulator, it may limit Juvenile Hormone which in turn will stop the Manduca sexta from growing. This can be measured by weighing the Manduca sexta, the larger one being the heavier one obviously.

Materials and Method:
At the beginning of the experiment, the group gathered eight caterpillars. After that, each caterpillar was weighed in grams and had their weights recorded. The caterpillars were then split into two groups of four, one to be controll and one to be treatment. After this, 80 grams of caterpillar food were retrieved to be distributed in equal portions of 10 grams to each caterpillar. The 80 grams were then split into 40 grams. The first batch was mixed with 20 drops of distilled water (60 Ml) and the second batch with 20 drops of Precor (60 Ml). Finally, each caterpillar was weighed every day for seven consecutive days and had their weight recorded each day.

Results:
A statistical T Test was ran on the experiment. The T value in the Two Sample T Test performed is 1.135685. The standard deviation in the controll group is 0.737609822 with an average of 3.64025 and the standard deviation in the treatment group is 0.558159774 with an average of 4.13. The P value is .299408 and the degrees of freedom is 6.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment do not support the hypothesis that Precor would limit the growth of Manduca sexta. It does prevent the Manduca sexta from molting, but the Manduca sexta still grew with Precor being used. In fact, the Manduca sexta grew more than the controll group. This is significent because this experiment shows that Precor may not be an efficient Insect Growth Regulator to use on Manduca sexta. If the goal is to prevent molting, then from the results Precor would be helpful. If not though, Precor led to larger Manduca sexta. This may be because Precor may limit Juvenile Hormone, which controlls the type of molt, but still accelerate the growth of the Manduca sexta. The only errors made during the experiment were that day two and day five were missed. Even though we missed these days we were still able to maintain a consistent amount of data because we still recorded the other days and did not leave a large enough gap to skewer results. In Kingsolver’s experiment, his Manducta sexta was given an artificial diet as well, this is significent because it shows that Manducta sexta are versatile in being experimented on to show rates of growth. Logically, the next step would be to try a different chemical as the goal is to stint the survival of the tobacco hornworm, not allow it to grow even more. Using a different chemical will allow for the same hypothesis to be applied. The Manducta sexta, like most members of its genus, are a pest in general terms since they are detrimental to crops. Because of this they need to be dealt with efficiently. With the use of a functioning Insect Growth Regulator, the Manduca sexta themselves can be stopped while retaining minimal damage on the crops.

Figure 1: The average weight of the controll and treatment group are compared. The controll group is smaller on average than the treatment group which is receiving quantities of Precor. The treatment group has been exposed to a total of 60 Ml of Precor. Each caterpillar was measured in weight, specifically in grams.
