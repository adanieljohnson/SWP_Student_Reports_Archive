Title: The Effects of A23187 Activator on the Intracellular Calcium Channels of Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effects of A23187 on intracellular calcium channels in Physarum polycephalum. Using three plates containing water agar as our control group, and three petri plates with 5mL of a 20mL diluted solution containing A23187 as our test group, we had the ability to calculate the time of cytoplasmic streaming and the distance and direction that the P. polycephalum traveled from the Physarum stock. We hypothesized that the A23187 activator would cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and cause the P. polycephalum to move towards the food. Our results showed that A23187 did cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease when compared to our control group, and the P. polycephalum did move towards the food. The A23187 caused the amount of calcium in the P. polycephalum to increase which resulted in increased contraction and movement. Our control plates showed no growth because they had no outside stimulus to trigger the calcium channels which perpetuate growth. Thus, our results were statistically significant.


Introduction:
Physarum are multicellular organisms that do not use hormones or have a nervous system to sense and respond to its environment. Every response must be controlled and coordinated by one or more of their intracellular signal transduction pathways. Physarum use G-protein coupled receptors, the cAMP mediated path, the IP3 mediated path, and calcium activated signaling pathways to transduce signals[Johnson:2018]. In this experiment, we tested the effects of A23187 on intracellular calcium channels in Physarum polycephalum, commonly referred to as Physarum. By measuring the cytoplasmic streaming and distance travelled by the P. polychephalum, we can determine the effects of A23187 on calcium channels. Since P. polycephalum have transduction pathways like humans, they are exceptional organisms to study. The movement of P. polycephalum is due to cytoplasmic streaming. During this process, the interaction between the actin and myosin located within the walls of the plasmodial tubes causes the rear edge of the cell to release from its surface [Terry:2009]. Thus, the organism continues its movement forward. Calcium plays a huge role in the motility of P. polychephalum. When removing calcium from P. polychephalum, the organism ceased to show contractile movements [Terry: 2009]. When A23187 was used in a past experiment, it caused an increase in contractile movement. Since contractile movement is due to cytoplasmic streaming, the A23187 does increase cytoplasmic streaming [Kawamichi and Nakamura:2000]. This indicated that calcium has an enhancing effect on the movement and growth of an organism [Terry: 2009]. Thus, we hypothesize that the A23187 will cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and cause the P. polycephlaum to move towards the food. Since A23187 is an activator, it will speed up the time it takes a P. polycephalum to complete a full cycle of streaming.


Materials and Methods:
Prior to this experiment the Physarum stock was prepared. We collected 6 petri dishes (3 plates for control and 3 plates for treatment) containing 2% water-agar and prepared our plates per the guidelines in figure 5 and 6. Once the control and treatment groups were prepared 5mL of diluted test solution was added to each petri dishes for test group. The diluted test solution was soaked for 10 minutes and drained. Once the blocks were added in the petri dishes they were wrapped in aluminum foil, and placed it in the incubator for 28 hours. After incubation when we scored our plates, we picked three streams from each of the 3 test plates and the 3 control plates, took three readings from each and took the average value of each reading. Next, we recorded the distance, direction the physarum traveled in each plate, and conducted a two-sample t-test  using p=0.05 to determine significance.


Results:
Our results show that A23187 activator caused the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and caused the P. polycephalum to move towards the food source. When comparing the cytoplasmic streaming of both groups as seen in figure 3, test group 1 had an average of 32.67seconds, test group 2 had an average of 33.67 seconds, test group 3 had an average of 29.00 seconds, and the control group had an average of 41.8 seconds. When looking at figure 4, one can see that the average distance traveled by the control group was greater than the average distance traveled by the test group. After analyzing the direction that the physarum traveled one can see that the control group had no growth and the test group tended to move towards the source of food. After completing a two-sample t-test comparing the cytoplasmic streaming of the control group and the test group, our results were statistically significant. (t-stat = 4.1724, df=9, p=0.0008).


Discussion:
After completing our experiment, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported. The A23187 activator did cause the cytoplasmic streaming time of the P. polycephalum to decrease. The A23187 activator caused the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease because it has a direct effect on the calcium channels of the organism. Organisms need calcium to contract their muscles and move forward. The increase in calcium causes the actin-myosin interaction so that the muscle contracts when calcium returns to submicromolar levels, the interaction is abolished and the muscle relaxes [Kawamichi and Nakamura:2000]. For this reason, our control group had no growth since the calcium channels were not activated. This could be because the 2% water agar plate is not conducive to growth unless it is stimulated by an outside source. Thus, the activator caused the amount of calcium in the P. polycephalum to increase which caused the P. polycephalum to contract its muscles and move at a faster pace[Terry:2009]. When analyzing the results of our two-sample t-test, our results were statistically significant (t-stat = 4.1724, df=9, p=0.0008). Since our p value is less than 5%, there is a significant difference between the results of the control group and the results of our test group. When analyzing our control groups, we saw that control group 1 showed growth. This could be a result of human error, specifically the movement of the placement of the food. If I were to repeat this experiment I would alter the concentration of A23187 and complete more trials to see how this change would alter cytoplasmic streaming. In addition, I could improve this experiment by using additional outside sources such as an inhibitor to determine its effect on physarum growth. This experiment is extremely relevant to our world today because one can use the results from this experiment and apply them to other organisms and potentially humans.
