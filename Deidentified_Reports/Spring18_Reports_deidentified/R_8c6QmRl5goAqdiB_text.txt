Title: Testing the Role of Ecdysterone on the Weight of Manduca sexta: Applying azadirachtin, an ecdysterone blocker, to M. sexta food proves that it while it does not completely prevent weight gain, it significently slows it.

Abstract:
Ecdysterone is one of the three main hormones involved in insect development. The purpose of this study is to examine the role of ecdysterone on M. sexta, specifically whether the hormone prevents weight gain in the insect. Through administering azadirachtin into M. sexta’s food and measuring the weight of them every day for a span of eight days, we found that blocking ecdysterone is indeed linked to slowing weight gain. The line graph we generated illustrates that while the weight of M. sexta in the controll group significently increases over the eight days, the weight of M. sextain the experimental group increases slightly at first yet then levels off and eventually, for two out of the four animals, declines. All in all, we conclude that while blocking ecdysterone does not completely prevent weight gain, it significently slows weight gain over time. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera that has a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that M. sexta undergo four primary major life stages – egg or embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult – in which the larvae and adult are dissimilar in appearance [Johnson: 2018]. Prothoracicotrophic or brain hormone (PTTH or BH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) are the main hormones that controll the insect development of M. sexta, including molting and the formation of the pupa [Johnson: 2018]. Molting occurs when insects form a new outer layer (cuticle) and shed their old one, marking the transition of an insect from a caterpillar to the pupa stage [Johnson: 2018]. This transition occurs when ecdysterone rises and juvenile hormone falls, a point in the process called the commitment pulse, which signifies that the caterpillar is ready to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. In taking this information into account, our experimental question is does blocking ecdysterone cause a change in weight for M. sexta? In this experiment, we will use azadirachtin to test the effect of ecdysterone on M. sexta weight. Azadirachtin is a natural, strong insect growth regulator that has also been shown to interfere with reproduction, specifically inhibiting vitellogenesis and egg production in some studies; therefore, the substance has been shown to have a profound effect on organisms [Idaomar et al.: 1998]. The goal of this experiment is to measure and analyze the effects of ecdysterone on M. sexta, specifically through monitoring and observing the insect’s weight. We will use a controll group that does not receive any drops of azadirachtin in its food and a treatment group that does receive an administration of the hormone. Weight will serve as the dependent variable and ecdysterone will serve as the independent variable. We predict that blocking ecdysterone will prevent weight gain in M. sexta.  

Materials and Method:
We selected eight M. sexta and divided them into two groups, placing four in the controll group and four in the treatment group. The organisms were collected and kept in individual sides of containers with holes punched in the top. There were two organisms per plastic container, divided by an index card in the middle. Each M. sexta was maintained in an incubator and fed a diet. Specifically, the controll group was fed 10 grams of food, and the treatment group was fed 10 grams of food plus 10 drops of 0.001 M azagard (azadirachtin). For statistical analysis, a two-sample t_test was used to compare the controll group to the treatment group, essentially analyzing whether azadirachtin or the blocking of ecdysterone had an effect on M. sexta.

Results:
Some recorded observations are that there were less pieces of feces in the treatment group containers in comparison to the controll group containers. Also, at the end of day eight, there was a black stripe on the back of animal four, signifying that the caterpillar was ready to pupate and that there was a rise in ecdysterone. 
Based on direct examination of the raw data, it can be seen that while the treatment group did gain weight, it did not gain weight as fast as the controll group over the span of eight days. For example, animal 1 gained 10.61 grams versus animal 8 only gaining 3.21 grams. It can also be observed that the final weight of the caterpillars on the eighth day for the controll group is almost double the number of grams of the treatment group. 
The graph shows that while initially all the animals experienced weight gain, over time, the controll group versus the treatment group varied in weight. The weight of animals 1-4 in the controll group significently increased, whereas the weight of animals 5-8 in the treatment group leveled off. In fact, the graph illustrates that after leveling off, between days 7 and 8 the weight of animal 6 decreased and between days 5 and 8 the weight of animal 7 decreased. 
The t-value is 10.805, the degrees of freedom is 6, and the p_value is 3.72E-5 (0.025). The results are significent since the p_value is less than 0.05 and therefore the null statistical hypothesis (H0 = there is no statistical difference between the weight of M. sexta without the administration of Azadirachtin and the weight of M. sexta with blocked ecdysterone) can be rejected. 

Discussion:
Prior to this experiment, we learned that insects need both ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, or otherwise they will die, because these two hormones work in conjunction to controll growth, molting, and metaphorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, we predicted that the administration of azadirachtin, an ecdysterone blocker, would have a significent impact on insects. Our results show that over time, the administration of an ecdysterone blocker slows weight gain, eventually causing the weight of M. sexta to level off and in some instances begin to decrease. Thus, the graph trends and p_value for the two-sample t_test support our initial prediction that azadirachtin would have an impact on insects and more specifically our hypothesis that blocking ecdysterone will prevent weight gain in M. sexta; thus, our hypothesis was accurate. 
Not only did our experiment show that blocking ecdysterone, specifically through the use of azadirachtin, has an effect on organisms, but other published studies have as well. Some studies examined the effects of azadirachtin on endocrine and neuroendocrine functions in adult females of the earwig Labidura riparia [Idaomar et al.: 1998]. The results of these studies on Lab. riparia reveals that azadirachtin causes physiological abnormalities and disruption of several physiological processes, including the hindrance of egg production, inhibition of vitellogenesis, and disturbance of material resembling neuropeptide hormones in some neuro-secreting cells of the brain [Idaomar et al.: 1998].
Another study further examined the effect of azadirachtin in last-instar larvae of M. sexta [Schlüter et al.: 1985]. This study found that even though M. sexta transitioned from a caterpillar to the pupa stage with the administration of low doses of azadirachtin, the insects provded to be defective as a result of the low dose injection of the ecdysterone blocker [Schlüter et al.: 1985]. Even more, the larvae that endured a higher administration of azadirachtin typically did not finish development, dying in some cases [Schlüter et al.: 1985]. As a result, due to the ability of azadirachtin to prevent M. sexta from fully developing, some countries use the substance, one that comes from the tree Azadirachta indica, as a ward against plant pests [Schlüter et al.: 1985]. Thus, the blocking of ecdysterone could have a practical implication in our world. 
In reflecting on our experiment, there is room for improvement. Some possible sources of error include an imprecise amount of food for each caterpillar (in other words, the grams of food varied slightly from one compartment to another) and a movement of caterpillars – two or three times, caterpillars traveled over a notecard into a different compartment of the container, causing us to have to predict which one came from which side (we usually figured the one on the notecard was the one that had traveled over to the other side). In addition, in reflecting on our hypothesis and the results of this experiment, we believe a stronger one would have been that blocking ecdysterone slows weight gain, rather than prevents it, since prevent is a much stronger, more absolute term. Looking towards the future, the next logical steps for this study would be to modify the procedure and repeat this experiment. A different procedure step we would change if we repeated the study again would be to use a separate container for each insect to ensure one does not crawl into the compartment of another one. We would also mix the hormone into the food, rather than just dropping 10 drops on the surface of the food, to better ensure each insect ingests the same amount of the hormone, since we cannot controll which part of the food placed in the container the insect will choose to touch. In addition, we would increase the duration of the experiment to longer than eight days to see what happens to the weight of the caterpillars after the leveling off section of the line graph. All in all, our study revealed that blocking one of the main hormones has a great impact on insects, causing us to question whether the blocking of other hormones, such as juvenile hormone and Prothoracicotrophic, would have a significent effect on insects as well.
