Title: The Effect of Restricted Visible Light Spectrum on Root-to-Shoot Ratios of Mung Beans

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the affect of limited resources on a plant's resource allocation abilities. We specifically examined Vigna radiata, commonly called mung beans, and the effect of limiting wavelengths of visible light available would have on their growth. It is already known that plants can exhibit phenotypic plasticity when faced with insufficient resources. Our experiment allowed mung beans to grow in either full spectrum or partial spectrum visible light, which excluded wavelengths at about 650 nm. We hypothesized that beans grown under partial spectrum light would have longer shoots, and thus a lower root-to-shoot length ratio, and a higher root-to-shoot mass ratio than beans grown under full spectrum light. Our results showed no significant statistical difference between either treatment group, either in length or mass of the plant roots and shoots, and our hypothesis, therefore, was not supported.

Introduction:
Plants need certain resources to survive, grow, and reproduce-including light, carbon dioxide, water, and soil nutrients-yet, these resources are always limited.  Thus, to cope with limited resource availability, plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity, the ability to alter how they distribute their resources for use in the functions that benefit the organism most.  This ability to allocate resources was demonstrated in a study of perennial grasses of the Great Plains, USA which showed that various species of grasses responded to years of low precipitation with more root growth than shoot growth, whereas in years of sufficient precipitation they produced similar growth of both roots and shoots [Sainju: 2017].  The grasses in this study responded to environmental conditions by allocating resources to increasing their root system's capability of accessing the limited water supply.  Our experiment aimed to examine how plant resource allocation changes as alterations in the environment limit resources. In looking at light as a limited resource, we reasoned that restricting a plant's access to certain wavelengths on the visible light spectrum could reduce its ability to photosynthesize, and thus affect its method of allocation.  A 2015 study on the impact of light quality and quantity on aspen seedlings supports our reasoning. In the study, trembling aspen seedlings subjected to various wavelengths on the visible light spectrum showed a significant difference in their growth of shoots (P = 0.003), where those grown under low red/far red light or blue light, grew the most [Kelly: 2015]. No significant difference, however, was shown for root growth [Kelly: 2015].  As seen here, altering the spectrum of light a plant receives can impact how it manages its resources for growth and survival. Still, various species of plants may have differing responses to parts of the visible light spectrum. Knowledge of how specific species of plants respond to light conditions can provide important insight into the effects of agricultural practices. Farming practices that grow crops under certain ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, for example, can be implemented to improve productivity. The plant our experiment specifically examined was the mung bean (Vigna radiata). We reasoned that limiting the visible light spectrum available to the bean plant would cause it to expend more energy to acquire the limited light resource, thus increasing the growth of its shoot. We hypothesized that, grown under partial spectrum light, the beans would have longer shoots and a lower root-to-shoot length ratio as well as a higher root-to-shoot mass ratio than beans grown under full spectrum light.

Materials and Methods:
To begin, six identical pots were filled with vermiculite and soaked with water until thoroughly moist.  About 20 mung beans were planted in every pot, each of which then also received 50 mL of Miracle Grow plant food.  The pots were separated into two groups, three in each, and placed under different tipis of translucent plastic film.  The first group was covered by clear film in such a way that all light had to pass through the film to reach the mung beans beneath.  With clear film, this group theoretically received the full spectrum of visible light wavelengths from about 400 to 700 nm. The same was done with the other group of pots, this time with red film. This second group theoretically received a partial spectrum which included all wavelengths of visible light except at about 650 nm. Both groups were placed in a greenhouse where they grew at the same temperature and under equal amounts of sunlight.  The mung beans were watered every day for two weeks.  After the two week period, the lengths and masses of the beans were measured and the root-to-shoot ratios were calculated.  More specifically, three random bean plants were selected from each pot under the full spectrum tipi and the length (in millimeters) and mass (in grams) of each plant's shoot and roots were measured. The plant lengths and masses from each pot were averaged, and a root:shoot ratio for both length and mass was calculated from the averages of the three pots. The same was repeated for the mung beans under the partial spectrum tipi.  Finally, a one-tailed t-test was performed with the root-to-shoot ratio averages of each pot.

Results:
Examination from this experiment's data shows that the ratio of mung bean root and shoot length was noticeably lower in the group receiving partial spectrum visible light. Mung beans under the partial spectrum tipi had a mean root-to-shoot ratio of 0.93 ± 0.16 while those under the full spectrum tipi had a mean ratio of 1.12 ± 0.14 (Figure 1).  A one tailed t-test revealed, however, that these means are not statistically significant (t-stat = 1.60, df = 4, P = 0.185). On the other hand, the mass root-to-shoot ratios appear to have very similar values: the partial spectrum beans had a mean mass ratio of 0.98 ± 0.34 whereas the full spectrum beans had a mean ratio of 0.96 ± 0.08. A one tailed t-test confirmed that there was no significant difference between the two groups (t-stat = 0.092 df = 4, P = 0.931). 

Discussion:
The lower mean root-to-shoot ratio of bean shoot length in the partial spectrum group compared to the full spectrum group indicates that the shoots of the beans grew longer on average under conditions of limited light resource. Longer shoots suggests that resources were allocated to functions that increase its ability to obtain the wavelengths of light of which it was deprived. This would support our hypothesis, yet, a t-test revealed that the discrepancy between the two treatment groups was not large enough to be statistically significant. Furthermore, the root-to-shoot ratio of mass for both treatment groups had very similar averages and no significant difference, indicating that the mung beans neither supplemented nor restricted the resources going to the roots. We can conclude that our hypothesis was not supported and mung bean plants do not exhibit a resource allocation response to growth under a visible light spectrum which excludes wavelengths around 650nm.

Figure 1.  Root:shoot ratios of mass and length for mung beans.  This figure shows treatment groups growing in different wavelengths of visible light, full spectrum and partial spectrum (excludes wavelengths at about 650nm), and their respective average root:shoot ratios. The mean root:shoot ratio of length was not significantly different between the full spectrum and partial spectrum groups (t-stat = 1.60, df = 4, P = 0.185). The mean root:shoot ratio of mass was not significantly different between the full and partial spectrum groups either (t-stat = 0.092 df = 4, P = 0.931).  Error bars show ±1 s.d.
