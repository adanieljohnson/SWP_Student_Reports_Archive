Title: Effect of Increased Phosphorous on the Root and Shoot Growth of Field Peas

Abstract:
This experiment examined the effect of exposure to increased amounts of phosphorous in the soil on P. sativun subsp. arvense (field peas) by comparing root to shoot ratios of a controllled and experimental variable and observing resource allocation. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of the experimental variables would be a smaller value than that of the controllled variables due to the increased availability of the essential growth nutrient. The experimental variable was the subjects to which the phosphorous was added and the controll being the same subject without the added phosphorous. Six field pea subjects evenly distributed to three per variable, were studied by using using basic measures of central tendency and dispersion and analyzing that data using a two-sample t_test. The hypothesis was supported by the results that showed that the availability of phosphorous in the soil is inversely related to a plant’s root to shoot ratio. The t_test used to analyze the data, provided values of low statistical significance and is possibly a result of external factors not taken into consideration by the time frame of this experiment. Despite the low statistical values, it is concluded by the observations that increased amounts of phosphorous in soil have a beneficial effect

Introduction:
The point of this experiment was to gain a better understanding of resource allocation and how it is displayed in plants and how it can be statistically analyzed and inferred. We used field peas as our means to accomplish this learning goal. Field peas are classified as a type of legume and are a species that grows best in cold weather with an abundance of moisture and the growth is most benefitted by being planted in the early spring [Koonce: 1935]. When it comes to necessary elements for plant growth, phosphorous is classified as one of the major essential macronutrients for biological growth and development. However, the typical concentration of phosphorous in soil is very low at levels of 1 ppm or less [Rodríguez: 1999]. When plants experience a phosphorous deficiency, it has been observed that this increases the root to shoot ratio. When we measure root to shoot ratios we are essentially measuring the health and resource allocation in plants. Roots and shoots adjust in length and weight in accordance with resource availability and this availability effects the overall health of the plant. In addition, it was also observed that plants with small seeds showed very little growth after two weeks [Atkinson, 1973]. With this information, this question is posed: If the field peas were exposed to increased amounts of phosphorous in the soil, would this significently increase root and/or shoot growth? With the knowledge that field peas have small seeds, and that a phosphorous deficiency has a negative effect on growth, I predict that the plants exposed to the additional phosphorous will have the smallest root to shoot length ratio because the nutrient added is essential to growth.

Materials and Method:
Before planting the seeds, we prepared six small nursery containers filled with vermiculite and added approximately two tablespoons of phosphorous in the form of bone meal to three of the nursery containers to serve as the experimental variable, leaving the other three as they were as a controllled variable. We soaked the containers with vermiculite thoroughly then  distributed and planted seeds and added 10 Ml of Miracle-Gro solution to each container. After all the nursery containers had been prepared, we placed them in a greenhouse so they were all exposed to the same environmental conditions. In the two weeks leading up to the day of data collection, we made sure the plants were watered every day. 
We took five field pea plants from each group and thoroughly cleaned off the roots with a wash bottle. For each set of five plants we took the total weight (in grams), then divided the found weight by five to find the approximate individual weight of each plant. After taking the whole weights, we separated the roots from the shoots of the plants by cutting where the color changed on the plant making sure to keep each root with its corresponding shoot. We repeated the same weighing process for the total and individual weights of the roots and shoots. Then, we found the maximum root and shoot length (in millimeters) of the plants from each set of five. Then with this data recorded, we found the root to shoot length and weight ratios for each set by using the individual weights and dividing the mass/length of the root by the mass/length of the shoot. After finding the data for each set we found the mean and standard deviation for each measurement to use as the general data for the phosphorous plants. We then repeated the same process to collect the data of the controllled variable plants. Using all the data found, we used a two-sample t_test to analyze the data.


Results:
The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the plants exposed to additional phosphorous is 0.892 with a standard deviation of 0.21 and the length ratio is 1.01 with a standard deviation of 0.17 (Table 1). The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the controll plants is 0.805 with a standard deviation of 0.133 and the length ratio is 1.03 with a standard deviation of 0.27 (Table 2). The weights recorded for the controll plants were generally greater than those of the experimental plants but the average maximum lengths of the roots and shoots were very similar. A two-sample t_test was used to analyze the root to shoot length ratios in which it was found that the mean of the controll group is not significently different than the experimental group with a t-value of 0.10, the degrees of freedom being 4, and a P-value of 0.92.

Discussion:
My hypothesis predicted that the root to shoot length ratio of the plants with the additional phosphorous would be smaller than that of the controll plants and was supported by the data found. The roots of the plants with added phosphorous were on average 129 mm with a root to shoot length ratio of 1.01 (Table 1). The roots of the controll plants were on average 130 mm with a root to shoot length ratio of 1.03 (Table 2).  In comparison to the study done on the general effects of phosphorous deficiency [Atkinson: 1973] where it was observed that a deficiency in phosphorous results in a greater root to shoot ratio, in the results from this experiment the plants with an increased availability of phosphorous had a smaller root to shoot ratio. Therefore, it can be inferred that availability of phosphorous and the root to shoot ratio value are inversely related. It can also be interpreted that the most likely reason the roots of the controll plants were longer is because they had to grow their roots longer to be able to absorb the same amount of nutrients as the experimental plants which did not have to work as hard. In addition to this, when looking at the average length of the shoots the controll plants was 126.33 mm and the average length of the shoots of the experimental plants was 127.33 mm. Since the shoots of the experimental plants were longer this is supportive of the interpretation of results that the controll plants allocate more of their resources in their roots while the experimental plants allocate more of their resources in their shoots. When analyzing the data, we chose to use the root to shoot length ratios as the values to input in the two-sample t_test since the purpose of the experiment was to observe the effect of additional phosphorous on growth and the plant growth is best represented by the length ratios. The length ratios demonstrate growth better than weight ratios because you could have a very short but thick plant but you could also have a very long and thin plant and the shorter plant would weigh more meaning that weight does not represent growth the most effectively. The t_test showed little to no difference between the two variables. Concluding that even though my hypothesis was supported it is questionable if the added phosphorous had a large enough impact on the growth of these plants to justify the addition. It is possible that there are a few factors that influence the growth of field peas that we did not take into consideration. If we wanted to repeat the experiment and get results possibly with more of a significent statistical difference the way we could try planting the seeds in the early spring so the temperatures are cooler and increase the amount of time between planting to the seeds to data collection from two to six weeks. Higher temperatures can drain moisture and disturb the photosynthesis process, so cooler temperatures for field peas that are accustomed to colder mountain temperatures may increase growth.
