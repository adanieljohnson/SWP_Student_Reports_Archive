Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Antagonist on Muscle Contraction Threshold

Abstract:
I.	Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine the impact of the acetylcholine antagonist tubocurarine on the threshold of muscular response to electrical stimulation of the legs of Rana pipiens frogs. Our hypothesis was that the antagonist would increase the threshold of response due to the fact that it would inhibit the effects of the Acetylcholine on the muscle. According to our results, the threshold of the treated legs was higher than that of the untreated legs, meaning that the antagonist does have an effect on the threshold of response. 


Introduction:
II.	Introduction:
In this lab, we used the Rana pipiens, also known as the northern leopard frog, to examine the impact of the Acetylcholine blocker tubocurarine on muscular response to electrical stimulation. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that is released at the neuromuscular junction in response to an action potential. When acetylcholine binds to its receptors, muscle contraction is induced. Acetylcholine receptor antagonists inhibit the effects of acetylcholine at the receptors [Teixeira-Neto, 1]. In this experiment, the variable that we tested was the effect of the acetylcholine receptor blocker tubocurarine on the threshold of electrical current required to provoke muscle contraction. Our goal in this experiment is to provoke a jump-like twitch from the frog legs. We hypothesize that the antagonist, which we will inject into the thigh muscle of each leg, will inhibit this twitch or increase the threshold at which the twitch occurs. 


Materials and Methods:
III.	Methods:
We were given four frog legs to test in this experiment. We conducted a dissection on each leg, in which we removed the skin and cut through the thigh muscles to expose the sciatic nerve. We stimulated each leg in an untreated state to establish the untreated threshold, which would act as our control group, then injected each leg with 1 mM of the acetylcholine antagonist tubocurarine. The thresholds of all four legs were taken after being injected, and were compared to the thresholds of the untreated legs. 


Results:
IV.	Results:
Figure 1 shows comparisons of all four legs before and after treatment. Figure 2 shows the averages of both thresholds. As shown by this data, there was an overall increase in the thresholds after treatment. Our paired two-sample t-test showed that, although there was an increase in threshold, it was not statistically significant (df=3, t-stat=-2.081613, p-value=0.1288039). 

Discussion:
V.	Discussion:
As discussed, the release of Acetylcholine produces a contractile response in muscles [Trujillo, 1-2]. Our paired two-sample t-test produced a p-value of 0.1288039, indicating that the difference in the thresholds before and after treatment was not statistically significant. The thresholds did increase on average, however, we must not reject our null hypothesis that the antagonist will not produce a statistically significant increase in the threshold of contraction.
There are several potential sources of error for this experiment. The most glaring of these is that the frogs were ill, which impacted the size of the legs and even their response to stimulation. For this reason, the data could have been skewed or not aligned with that of healthy frogs. There is also the possibility of human error. Cutting too close to the nerve, or even partially severing the nerve would have impacted the amount of response that we saw. Touching the nerve with metal tools or allowing the muscles and nerve to dry out may have also had an effect. 
Future improvements to this experiment may include ensuring that the frogs are healthy prior to selecting the legs. The dissection should also be very controlled and it should be ensured that no damage comes to the sciatic nerve. The field must stay moistened in order to allow for optimal conduction of the electrical current. Using a larger sample group would produce a larger data set, which could potentially improve the accuracy of the statistical analysis.
