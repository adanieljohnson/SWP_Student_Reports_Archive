Title: Manduca Sexta and Oral Administration of Juvenile Hormone Analogs

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, has evolved a method for regulating development using Juvenile Hormone (JH). As the caterpillar develops, the amount of JH is reduced allowing these organisms to mature. JH analogs (JHAs), such as Precor, active ingredient methoprene, imitates high levels of JH in insects and stunts development. This study addressed whether oral administration of Precor in Manduca Sexta caterpillars would hinder the growth of the organisms. Our results suggest that Precor probably does not hinder the growth and development in Manduca Sexta through oral administration-possibly suggesting a mechanism to stave-off the effects of methoprene has evolved. Our hypothesis is that high levels of JH hinders the growth and development of Manduca Sexta, as measured by individual organism's weight.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, has a lifespan between 30-50 days. During development, Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating the physiology of these insects. For instance, JH regulates metamorphosis by preventing Manduca Sexta from continuing maturation and forming a pupa to transition from a larval stage to an adult. As the insect develops through each stage, growing and maturing into an adult, the amount of JH is reduced [Ni単o et al: 2009] The present study aims to address ways to modulate insect growth by studying the effects of different JH analogs (JHAs).  A lot of research has been conducted on JHAs in pesticides [for example, see Ginjupalli and Baldwin: 2013]. Precor, active ingredient methoprene, is a JHA that has long been used in pesticides because they are not of concern to human health [Kavlock and Ankley: 1996], JHAs are an attractive management options for farmers because they have low toxicity to mammals and an extensive history of controlling a variety of pests, such as cockroaches, mosquitoes, and fleas [Goodman, Potter, and Haynes: 2013]. Specifically, by imitating high levels of JH, these analogs interfere with the development of normal reproductive adults by preventing the targeted insect from ever maturing [Goodman, Potter, and Haynes: 2013; Ni単o et al: 2009], which can protect crops from current and subsequent pest populations. Thus, our hypothesis is that high levels of JH hinders the growth and development of Manduca Sexta, as measured by individual organism's weight. More so, our null hypothesis is: Precor (methoprene), does not affect the growth of Manduca Sexta, so weight does not change when exposed to Precor.

Materials and Methods:
To conduct our experiment, we first selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars from the Bio 114 lab that weigh between 0.75 and 1.75 g. From there we divided the caterpillars in two groups (an experimental and a control), placing one from each group into each container, which was separated by an index card. For each group of caterpillars we gave one of two diets: the control group had 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet-recommended by the manufacturer, with 4 drops of DI water; and the experimental group had 10g of GLM diet, supplemented with 4 drops of Precor (active ingredient methoprene). After the initial preparation, we kept all of our caterpillars in the same incubator, after properly labeling their containers with the group name and ID number. We then ran a 2-tailed paired t with an alpha level of 0.05 to determine the significance of the difference between the weights in the control group and the weights of the experimental group.

Results:
After collecting our data, we saw that the mean weights in the experimental group were smaller than mean weights for the experimental group. The mean weight for the experimental group was 0.1575 +/- 0.320g (figure 1). The mean weight for the control group was 0.9225 +/- 0.144g (figure 1), which was significantly different from the control (p=0.005, t=4.335). 

Discussion:
The p-value of 0.005 is an order of magnitude below the significance level of 0.05, which indicates that we must reject the null hypothesis. This means that the JHA methoprene may hinder growth in Manduca sexta, as we proposed in our initial hypothesis. Under this assumption, our findings that JHAs interfere with the development of normal reproductive adults corroborate the work of Ni単o et al.: 2009 and Goodman, Potter, and Haynes: 2013. 
After completing this experiment, however, we discovered that our protocol called for fresh food to be given each day. Miscommunication among the lab group resulted in failure to abide by this protocol. As a result, the subjects were fed once at the beginning of the week on day one, which may have contributed to the observation that the subjects lost weight starting on the 6th day and continuing to the 7th. Accordingly, the low p-value could just be a statistical anomaly. There are many confounding variables that may contribute to this anomaly, such as the fact that certain subjects may have had an insufficient food supply (due to variations in individual eating patterns); variations in duration spent in the containers with food due to different prep times; and different team members efficiency at weighing the caterpillars.

Figure 1: Mean weights of Manduca sexta caterpillars that received methoprene added to their food (experimental group, n=4) vs. DI water added to their food (control group, n=4) Error bars represent +/- one standard deviation. T-test results showed weights to be much lower when methoprene was added to the subjects' food (p<0.005).
