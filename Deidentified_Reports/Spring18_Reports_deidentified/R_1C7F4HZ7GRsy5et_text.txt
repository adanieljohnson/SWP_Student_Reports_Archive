Title: Methoprene as an Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment analyzed the success of Methoprene as an insect growth regulator on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Insect growth regulators are substances that adversely affect growth and development in insects. Precor is a common brand that contains the active ingredient of Methoprene, which is a juvenile hormone analog that inhibits the ability of insects to reach maturity. Based on proven success for infestations of fleas, this experiment tested the hypothesis that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to Precor and therefore Methoprene, then their weight will decrease. This experiment consisted of a controll and treatment group with four caterpillars each, and the weights of these caterpillars were measured over a seven week period. The results showed that there was no statistical significent difference between the average weights of these groups, and therefore this alternative hypothesis was rejected. This finding has implications for not only the scientific community, but the general population who struggles with Manduca sexta infestations. Comparison to previous studies and observation points to potential error, therefore this experiment will likely be repeated with adjustments. 

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators (or IGRs) are substances that adversely affect growth and development in insects. They are often used as an alternative approach to pest controll that work by hindering growth as opposed to directly killing the insects such as with insecticides. These IGRs target specific insect hormones that play a role in development [Glare: 1999]. Precor is a common brand of IGR that contains the active ingredient Methoprene [Merchant: 2006]. Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analog that inhibits the ability of insects to reach maturity. It is generally nontoxic, so it does not kill the insects but simply prevents them from reaching later larvae and adult stages and therefore reproducing. Juvenile hormone concentration increases in insects prior to the final larval instar stage, influencing development. Therefore excess juvenile hormone interferes with this process, and restricts the ability for insects to move through the stages of their life cycle [Glare: 1999].
Precor is proven to be most successful when sprayed before an infestation as a preventative measure. It is most often sprayed on furniture or plants to target the insects during feeding [Merchant: 2006]. Precor is predominately used to prevent flea infestations indoors, so this experiment will test its ability to inhibit growth in already inhabited caterpillar environments. 
In this experiment, the species Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, was specifically selected due to its relatively short holometabolous life cycle of 39-48 days and the fact that relies on similar JH hormones to regulate development. Manduca sexta is a moth in its adult stage, but this species is a common pest in its larval stage, destroying important crops [Judy: 1973]. Therefore determining if Precor is a successful IGR for this species can be helpful to many farmers who struggle with Manduca sexta infestation.
Because Precor is predominately used prior to flea infestations indoors, this poses the question if it will prove successful when mixed with food that Manduca sexta ingests- the question that will be examined in this lab. Developmental stages can be measured through growth in terms of weight of the insect. Therefore, this experiment will analyze the weights of caterpillars after exposure to Precor compared to controll environments. The exposure to Precor will be the independent variable, and the resulting weight of the caterpillars will be the dependent variable. It is hypothesized that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to Precor and therefore Methoprene, then their weight will decrease. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, eight caterpillars were studied and split into one treatment and one controll group with four each. Each caterpillar’s initial weight was measured on a scale and recorded. These caterpillars were placed in four perforated plastic containers with a divider in each to create eight separate environments for all eight caterpillars. In each environment, ten grams of caterpillar food were placed along with one caterpillar. For each of the four controll environments, five drops of water were added using a pipette. For each of the four treatment environments, five drops of Precor were added using a seperate pipette. The containers were placed in an incubator and stored there throughout the seven day duration of the experiment. The containers were removed every day at 1 pm for seven days, and the weight of each caterpillar was measured on the scale and recorded. At the end of the experiment (after seven days), the weights of the caterpillars for each day were averaged within the controll and treatment groups. The averaged data was then analyzed using a statistical two-sample t_test to compare the means from these two groups of data. The results of this two-sample t_test were used to determine if the if the null hypothesis was rejected or accepted, and therefore to determine the effectiveness of Precor as an insect growth regulator. 

Results:
Observation
Throughout the seven day period of this experiment, the Manduca sexta caterpillars maintained a vibrant green color. They appeared to stay relatively the same length throughout the duration of the experiment, and only became slightly thicker. There was still food present in each of the containers up until the final day; however, it appeared to be lighter and more dried out as the days went by. The caterpillars appeared to have less movement on the final days as compared to the first few days.
Data Collection
This table shows the average weights of the Manduca sexta caterpillars in both the controll and treatment groups as measured in grams over a seven day period. In both the controll and treatment groups, the weights are shown to slightly decrease from day 1 to day 2, then rise from day 2 to day 6, and finally slightly fall again from day 6 to day 7. 
This bar graph displays the average weights of the Manduca sexta caterpillars as measured in grams over the seven day period. It directly compares the average weights of both the controll and treatment group, which appear to be fairly similar across all seven days. 
Statistical Analysis - Two-Sample T-Test:
As displayed above in the summary data for the two-sample t_test, the t-value = 0.40, degrees of freedom =12, and P-value = 0.574, based on the similar averages for the controll and treatment group Because the P-value is greater than 0.05, this data shows that the the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group.


Discussion:
As the above two-sample two test for statistical analysis exhibits, the P-value is much greater than 0.05, which means that the mean of the controll group is not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. Therefore, the null hypothesis is accepted and the alternative hypothesis is rejected, which leads to the conclusion that exposure to Precor does not affect the weights of Manduca sexta caterpillars. This implies that the active ingredient of Methoprene does not function as a successful insect growth regulator in this species, as it fails to inhibit growth and development.
	Previous published studies conveying the success of Methoprene in inhibiting growth in Manduca sexta caterpillars, and therefore Precor as a insect growth regulator [Judy: 1973] point to potential sources of error in this experiment. As stated in the observations, the food appeared to be dried out over the course of the experiment, and the caterpillars appeared more lethargic. This suggests that the caterpillars were not having proper nutrition, and if they were not eating their food, they would not have had exposure to Precor. Therefore these caterpillars not successfully eating every day could have skewed this data. Based on this potential source of error, the next logical step would be to repeat this experiment, replacing the food for the caterpillars each day. 
This study has important implications for not only the scientific community but the general population. These results put into question the success of Precor as an insect growth regulator for Manduca sexta caterpillars, which is an important consideration for farmers and gardeners who struggle with infestations of these species.
