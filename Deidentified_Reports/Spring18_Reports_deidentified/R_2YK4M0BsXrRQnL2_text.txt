Title: Betta splendins fish exhibit gill cover spreading and protrusion of branchiostegal membranes more often in presence of similarly-colored fish

Abstract:
	This experiment was created to examine intraspecific agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins fish in response to fish of the same color versus to those of different colors. Two facing movements, gill spreading and mane protrusion, were examined during five minute intervals. We examined the behavior of a red fish in response to a blue one, a blue fish in response to a blue opponent, and a red fish in response to a red opponent. The data for fish of the same color was combined. It was predicted that the fish would respond more aggressively in response to a fish of the same color because they are more likely to recognize their opponent as the same species and classify it as a competitor. Our hypothesis was supported by this data; a two-tailed t_test showed a significent difference in the behavior of fish, which were more aggressive toward a similarly colored opponent than toward a different colored opponent. 

Introduction:
	In this lab we will observe Betta splendins fish and their intraspecific agnostic behaviors in response to fish of the same color as compared to fish of different colors. Male Betta fish exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to the presence of male fish of the same species. These include broadside movements, which occur when a fish’s side is turned toward its opponent, and facing movements, which happen when the fish directly faces its opponent (Johnson: 2018). Our group chose to examine two facing movements: spreading of gill covers and protrusion of branchiostegal membranes (“manes”). These behaviors will be examined during five minute intervals and the number of occurrences of each will be tallied. A similar study performed to examine the lateral bias of betta fish showed that they tend to exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to mirror images. This included agnostic displays, most notably, attempts of biting (Takeuchi et al.: 2010). Another experiment performed on Notemigonus crysoleucas fish, which are golden, in response to bioinspired robot fish showed that these fish are more attracted to a gray robot than they are to a red one; red phenotypes are not present in nature (Polverino et al.: 2013). Although this study did not examine aggressive behavior, this suggests that fish do not have as strong of a response to organisms that are differently colored. This leads us to hypothesize that fish will be more aggressive toward fish of the same color because they are more likely to recognize it as the same species. 

Materials and Method:
Our group examined two fish at a time in a small tank which separated the fish with a Plexiglas barrier. First, a blue betta fish was examined in response to a red fish. For an increment of 5 minutes, gill cover spreading and protrusion of branchiostegal membranes (manes) were observed. The fish were allowed to rest for 5 minutes and we then observed them for another increment of 5 minutes. The data from both of the trials was combined. This was repeated twice more: a red fish was observed in response to another red fish and a blue fish was observed in response to another blue fish. The data acquired during the four trials for fish of the same colors was combined. Our group tallied the number of instances of gill spreading and occurrences of a mane. Two two-tailed t tests were run which compared behaviors for fish in the presence of a fish of the same color compared to fish in the presence of a fish of a different color. Each t test analyzed one of the two behaviors (gill cover spreading and mane presence). 

Results:
The average number of occurrences of gill spreading for fish next to an organism of the same color was 8 ± 1.414 while for fish of different colors the mean was 20.5 ± 1.915. For mane protrusion, the mean number of occurrences was 4.5 ± 2.121 for fish in response to those of the same color while it was 16.5 ± 2.380 for fish of different colors (Figure 1). Two separate t_tests were run for each behavior in order to compare fish in response to those of the same color with fish in response to those of different colors. For gill spreading, there was found to be a significent difference in changing the color of the fish (t stat = 8.006, d.f. = 4, p = 0.0006). Similar results were found for mane protrusion (t stat = -5.977, d.f. = 4, p = 0.002). 

Discussion:
Our data was supported by our hypothesis as our t_test showed that there was a significent difference in the behaviors for agnostic responses to fish of the same color versus fish of different colors. The p values for both behaviors were found to be less than 0.05, meaning that the mean number of occurrences of gill spreading and mane protrusion were significently higher for Bettas in response to similarly colored fish than different colored fish (Figure 1). 

Responsive behaviors involve multiple neural processes like visual scanning and assessment, fin movements, and dashing (Takeuchi et al.: 2010). An experiment performed on female Betta fish showed that these individuals seem to associate more with phenotypically similar fish (Blakeslee et al., 2009). There is strong evidence that fish are able to assess and react to color difference in their companions. A future experiment could assess mating preference of a female fish towards a male of a similarly colored or differently colored fish. This experiment and similar ones could assist biologists in examining the causes of aggressive behavior in ecosystems. It is important to analyze sources of competition for animals, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
