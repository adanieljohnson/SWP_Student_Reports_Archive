Title: Color of light affects Vigna radiata resource allocation

Abstract:
This experiment was performed to find the differences in resource allocation in mung beans (Vigna radiata) grown in different environments. Specifically, whether plants grown under green light would grow larger shoots than plants grown under white light. The results showed that plants grown under white light have a higher root:shoot (R:S) ratio, which is a measure of how large the shoots are compared to the roots. This follows the hypothesis, because plants cannot absorb green light as readily as they can white light. Therefore, plants living under green light would have to produce larger leaves to capitalize on the little light that remains. 

Introduction:
The purpose of the experiment was to see the difference in growth between plants growing under white light and those under green light. These variables were chosen to partially simulate the difference in habitat between plants living on the forest floor and plants living in a sunny area. Plants growing under the canopy of a forest, for example, will have mostly green light to utilize. Knowing how light color affects growth and resource allocation in plants could have many applications in research, agriculture, and conservation. The hypothesis is that the plants growing under white light will have a higher root:shoot ratio than those growing under green light. The reason for this is that the plants grown under white light will devote fewer resources to leaves, because the light that they can use is more abundant [Wang: 2013]. They will also likely have fewer restrictions on their growth, so they will probably be larger. This is because plants use red and blue light in the process of photosynthesis, but green light is mostly reflected, so it is not used by the plant. If a plant has access only to green light, it follows that it would reflect most of it and absorb a very limited amount of light. This would mean a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis, which would in turn give the plant less energy to work with, reducing its size [Conn: 2017]. 

Materials and Method:
In the experiment, Mung Beans (Vigna radiata) were used. The species was chosen for its resilience and speed of growth. Two planting trays were prepared, each with three pots full of seeds. The two trays were covered in a plastic film, the films being identical except for the color: one was green tinted, the other clear. The plants were placed in a greenhouse,  watered daily, and left to grow for two weeks. Note that both groups were given the same amounts of water, soil, fertilizer, and they both were kept at the same temperature. After two weeks of growth, random plants were selected, five from each pot, giving each tray a sample of 15 plants. The plants were cleaned, weighed, and their lengths were measured. The roots were also cut off, weighed, and measured. These data were used to find the overall measurements of the plants, but also to find the root:shoot ratio. Then a two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data. 


Results:
The experiment found that plants grown under green light were of comparable total mass and length (table 1), but had differences when it came to root:shoot ratios (figures 1 and 2).  The R:S ratio by length for the two samples had a P-value of 0.6275, which exceeds the standard 0.05. This means that the two samples are statistically different, with the mean for white light exceeding that of green light by an average of 0.0736 centimeters. For R:S ratio by mass, the P-value was 0.1835, again showing statistical difference, with the mean for white light exceeding that of green, this time by an average of 0.699 grams. 

Discussion:
The results show that the plants growing in green light focus more of their resources on shoot growth than on root growth. Shoots, which comprise a stem and a cotyledon, or “seed leaf”, are the part of the young plant that captures light [Conn: 2017]. If a plant living under green light isn’t producing enough energy through photosynthesis, it must produce larger leaves, or in this case shoots, to compensate. This leads the the effect seen in the experiment: the plants growing under white light have normal R:S ratios because they have plenty of light, but those growing under green light must produce more shoots. This supports the hypothesis, that the plants growing under white light would have a higher R:S ratio than those grown under green light. This fact suggests that white light provides more energy for the plant to use, and therefore plants grown under white light might grow faster or larger. Knowing that light color affects plant growth could be potentially useful in many fields of research and business. Essentially every field that involves plants could benefit from this knowledge. For example, any indoor agriculture that requires the use of artificial lighting would be able to adjust the color of light to suit the plant that is being grown. In addition, the color of light is a factor of plant habitat that could be useful to conservation efforts in rainforests. This experiment has demonstrated a pattern that has already been well-documented [Wang: 2013], but the results are nonetheless useful. The experiment wasn’t perfect, and the data were not as tightly grouped as would be ideal. A more rigorous study, for example, would precisely measure water, soil, and other variables. Although this experiment has a very limited amount of real variables, they could always be more precisely controllled. A more serious possible point of error was that two people were simultaneously measuring the plants from the green light sample and the white light sample, potentially introducing some inconsistency. The solution would be to assign one person to each type of measurement rather than each sample. This is more a failure of the design of the experiment rather than simply human error. Also, note the vast standard deviation for the white light sample measured by mass. This was probably a result of the above mentioned distribution of labor, or possibly because of contamination from soil or excess water. The fact that the R:S ratio was measured in two separate ways –length and mass–  still gives the experiment legitimacy, even though it was somewhat flawed. Other than that, the experiment was satisfactory, and the results aligned with both the hypothesis and previously done studies.
