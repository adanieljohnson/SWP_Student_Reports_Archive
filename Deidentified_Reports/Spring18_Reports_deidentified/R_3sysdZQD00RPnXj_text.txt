Title: The Effect of Different Colors of Light on Photosynthesis in [Spinacia oleracea]

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of different colors of light on the rate of photosynthesis in [Spinacia oleracea] chloroplasts. We did so by measuring the rate of photosynthesis of each chloroplast solution exposed to the different colors of light. We hypothesize that our results will show higher photosynthesis rates in red and white light and lower rates in blue and green light. In order to conduct the experiment, we first enriched the chloroplasts and then tested 3 mixtures each (12 total) under blue, red, white, or green light and recorded the absorbance of each mixture every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Our ANOVA showed a p_value of 0.03 and the Tukey- Kramer post- hoc test showed a significent difference between the average % change absorbance of white and green light. While our p_value was less than 0.05, our results did not completely support our hypothesis because there wasn’t a significent difference between the % change in absorbance of both red and white light compared to blue and green light. However, they did support our belief that white light should show a higher rate of photosynthesis than green light.  Our data showed that white light had the highest rate of photosynthesis, followed by red, blue, and finally green light.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis in plants takes place in chloroplasts. More specifically, chloroplasts contain pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids which are responsible for absorbing the light necessary to initiate photosynthesis [Lodish: 2000]. While, both pigments aid in the initial photosynthetic process, chlorophyll pigments (A and B) are mainly responsible for the absorption of light [Lodish:2000]. This is because the carotenoids cannot transfer light energy directly to photosynthetic pathways, instead they must transfer the energy they absorb to chlorophyll [Zigmantas:2002]. Furthermore, chlorophyll A is more involved in the photosynthetic process than chlorophyll B because it is in both the antenna and reaction center in a photosystem [Lodish:2000]. Both chlorophyll pigments and carotenoids effectively absorb light at wavelengths between 400 and 500nm and both chlorophyll pigments also show increased light absorption at wavelengths between 630-680nm [Yang:2017]. However, between 530 and 610nm both chlorophyll and the carotenoids have a low absorption of light [Yang:2017]. Photosynthesis consists of two parts: light independent reactions and light dependent reactions. The light dependent reactions contain the protein complexes photosystems I and II, both of which aid the transport of electrons and help generate a proton gradient. Generally, after the electron in photosystem I becomes excited, it is eventually handed off to the electron acceptor NADP+. The typical process involving the transport of electrons to electron acceptors is called the Hill reaction [Johnson AD: 2018]. In order to measure the electron transport process, NADP+ can be switched with the electron acceptor DCPIP [Johnson: 2018]. By itself, DCPIP is oxidized and has a blue color, however, when it’s reduced, it turns clear. This change in color allows use to measure the reduction of DCPIP as a change in absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson AD: 2017]. By measuring the change in absorbance of each mixture, we can draw conclusions about the rate of photosynthesis of the chloroplasts; the lower the absorbance, the greater the rate of photosynthesis. When exposed to varying colors of light, plant leaves exhibit different photosynthetic rates. Green light tends to be reflected by plants and small amounts of green light are absorbed by chlorophyll pigments [Johkan: 2012]. In contrast, red light has demonstrated an ability to increase photosynthesis because its wavelength of light matches the absorbance peaks of chlorophyll pigments [Darko: 2012]. Additionally, the wavelength of blue light does not correspond to the peak wavelength of absorbance for chlorophyll pigments [Lodish:2000]. We want to determine how varying colors of light (blue, green, red, and white) affect photosynthesis in [Spinacia oleracea]. We chose [Spinacia oleracea] because it’s easy to obtain and contains the light absorbing pigments chlorophyll and carotenoids. We hypothesize that exposure to red and white light in comparison to exposure to blue and green light should result in higher rates of photosynthesis in [Spinacia oleracea] chloroplasts. 

Materials and Method:
We chose 4 large [Spinacia oleracea] and then deveined them. We then added the 4 deveined leaves and 10Ml of 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 (grinding buffer) into a mortar and ground it into a thick paste. We then added 10 more Ml of grinding buffer and strained the [Spinacia oleracea] slurry through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a beaker.  We spun the slurry in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm and 4°C and poured the supernatant into another tube to be put it in the centrifuge for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm and 4°C. After that we added 20Ml of grinding buffer to the chloroplast pellet and mixed it together. Next, we created 1 blank and 12 test tubes containing 100 µL of chloroplasts, 6 Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP, and 2Ml of 100mM phosphate at pH 6.5 (reaction buffer). We added the chloroplasts to the test tube last and mixed each tube immediately after adding them. We transferred each of the mixtures into the spectrophotometer cuvettes and divided them into 4 groups of 3, based on which color of light (red, blue, green, or white) they would sit under. After doing so, we blanked the spectrophotometer and recorded the initial absorbance at 600nm for each sample 3 times, every 10 minutes. After collecting all the data, we performed an ANOVA to compare the percent change of initial absorbance to final absorbance after 30 minutes. After doing so, we followed up our results with a Tukey-Kramer test, to further analyze the relationship between the colors of light. Finally, we performed a Q-test to see if there was an outlier in the recorded % change absorbances of solution under green light. 

Results:
The solution treated with white light resulted in an average % change absorbance of 97.37±1.96, for red light it was 96.37±1.77, blue light was 88.13±1.16, and green light was 82.87±10.27 (Figure 1). The degrees of freedom among groups was 3 and the degrees of freedom within groups was 8, the F-value was 5.05, and p- value was 0.03.  Additionally, the Tukey-Kramer test showed that there was a significent difference between the average absorbance % change of white and green light (p=0.042). Lastly, the Q-test for solutions exposed to green light showed that Qexp ≤ Qcrit (0.770 ≤ 0.970) at a 95% confidence level. 

Discussion:
Although our results showed that our p_value was 0.03, they did not completely support our hypothesis because our data did not show a significent difference between both the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts exposed to red or white light and those exposed to blue or green light. However, our results do support our claim that there should be significent increase in the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts exposed to white light in comparison with green light (p=0.042). At first, we suspected that the perceived significance was due to an outlier in trial 2 of the green light, due to its low % change of absorbance in comparison to the other 2 trials of green light. However, after performing a Q-test for outliers, we discovered that trial 2 was not an outlier and the % change of absorbance should be included in our final results. As expected, the results did show a slight increase in the photosynthetic rates of mixtures treated with white and red light. More specifically, our data showed that white light resulted in the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by red light, blue light, and finally green light. Red and white light should show a higher absorbance than blue and green light because chlorophyll A readily absorbs their wavelengths of light (Red= 600-600nm, White=380-760nm) [Yang:2017]. White light in particular should show the highest rate of photosynthesis because it is a mixture of all colors of light and is absorbed by the chlorophyll pigments at low and high wavelengths [Lodish:2000]. In contrast, blue light tends to be absorbed mainly by the carotenoids and chlorophyll B rather than chlorophyll A, lowering its effect on the rate of photosynthesis [Lodish:2000]. Lastly, the wavelength of green light is 500-560nm and corresponds with the low absorption of light by chlorophyll between 530-610 nm [Yang:2017]. A study on the photosynthetic rates of tobacco leaves showed that in comparison with white light, tobacco plants treated with other monochromatic light (red, blue, green, yellow) resulted in lower photosynthetic rates, likely due to stomatal limitations [Yang:2017]. Meanwhile, green light is shown to have lower photosynthetic rates and limit plant growth [Yang:2017]. If we were to repeat this experiment again, we could increase the number of replicates exposed to each color of light and increase the amount of time the mixtures are exposed to the light. The more replicates tested and the longer the mixtures are exposed to the light, the greater the chance we could find a significent difference between the photosynthesis rates of white and red light and the photosynthesis rates of green and blue light. Furthermore, we could double or triple the number of chloroplasts we add to the mixture to see if that creates a larger % change between absorbance rates. Lastly, the results of this experiment can be applied to future growth and development of plants grown for food. For example, red light has been shown to help stimulate the production of antioxidants and stimulate general growth of plants [Olle: 2013]. In contrast, blue light has the ability to help increase biomass [Olle:2013]. Knowing which color of light contributes to which portion of plant growth can help us alter growth rate.
