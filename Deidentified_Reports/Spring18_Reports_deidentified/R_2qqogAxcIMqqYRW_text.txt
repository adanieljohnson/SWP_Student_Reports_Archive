Title: Blue Water Color Decreases Aggressive Behaviors in Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Animal behaviors vary in different environmental conditions. Previous research has concluded that abiotic factors affect the expression of specific behaviors in certain organisms. In this experiment, we observed the effect of water color on agnostic behaviors in male Betta splendins in order to determine the effect of this abiotic factor on aggression levels. We hypothesized that two male Betta splendins placed in close proximity would yield higher aggression levels in clear water than blue water due to the decrease transparency of blue water and the fish’s ability to blend into its surroundings. To test our hypothesis, we observed interactions of three pairs of male Betta splendins in clear and blue water. Aggressive behaviors were quantified using an aggressive behaviors score system devised specifically for this experiment. The aggressive behavior score for each fish in blue and clear water was compared using a paired t_test. While our statistical test did not confirm a significent difference between the groups, our data clearly showed a higher average aggressive behavior score for clear water than blue water. Therefore, we still believe our hypothesis is correct and conclude that abiotic factors do alter an organism's exhibition of behaviors which require abundant energy.

Introduction:
Aggressive behaviors in animals are induced by certain conditions or stimuli. In many cases, these aggressive behaviors, also termed agnostic behaviors, are prompted during interactions between two males of the same species. However, the level of aggressiveness of the actions each organism displays can vary in different environments. Previous research has concluded that abiotic factors, such as level of oxygen dissolved in water and water transparency, affect the personality traits of Poecilia Vivipara, a neotropical fish [Sommer-Trembo: 2017]. In environments which lack necessary resources, such as oxygen, it is likely better for the organism to remain tranquil rather than expend energy exhibiting aggressive behaviors.
    In this experiment, we observed the effect of water color on agnostic behaviors in male Betta splendins in an attempt to determine the effect of this abiotic factor on aggression levels. Also referred to as “Siamese fighting fish,” Betta splendins was chosen as our study species due to its high level of aggression during interactions and because of its well-developed color vision, which allows the fish to see red, yellow, and blue. While the claim that the color of a fellow male  affects level of aggressiveness has not been supported by research, Betta splendins’ color vision allows the organism to better detect potential rival males, thereby increasing stimulation for aggression [Irawan: 2006]. We hypothesized that two male Betta splendins placed in close proximity would yield higher aggression levels in clear water than blue water due to the decrease transparency of blue water and the fish’s ability to blend into its surroundings.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we examined the effect of water color on aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendins by calculating an aggressive behavior score by observing male-male interactions for a specified length of time.
    First, we obtained six male Betta splendins from the Wake Forest biology department. Color and size were not taken into account, only the sex of the fish. Matched into three pairs, (which remained unchanged throughout all trials in an effort to eliminate confounding variables), the fish were placed into a tank with blue water. Each tank possessed opaque dividers in order to separate the fish, preventing interactions prior to the trials.
    The first trials were performed in blue water. After being allowed time to become accustomed to their new, blue water environment, the divider between the first pair of fish was lifted. We observed the interactions between the fish for 5 minutes, specifically looking for four aggressive behaviors: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, and red mane. Each time one of the two fish performed one of these specific behaviors, we recorded its occurence. During the trials, if a fish acted too aggressively toward its sparring partner (marked by physical contact), we separated the fish and ended the trial. After 5 minutes, the fish were placed in their respective sides of the tank and the divider was inserted. This process was repeated for a total of six times, with each pair participating in one trial in blue water and one trial in clear water.
    After conclusion of the trials, aggressive behavior score was determined. The aggressive behavior score system we devised involved assigning numerical values from 1 to 3 for each behavior, with a higher number denoting a high level of aggressiveness in the behavior. Pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, and red mane were given values of 1, 2, 3, and 3, respectively. Using the recorded number of occurrences for each specified behavior, we determined the total aggressive behavior score for each fish in each trial. The average and standard deviation of the aggressive behavior score were calculated for both the blue and clear water trials. The difference between the aggressive behavior score of the two groups was compared using an paired t_test (alpha value = 0.5).

Results:
As seen in Figure 1, the male Betta splendins produced a higher aggressive behavior score in clear water  (12.9±10.1) than in blue water (8.0±6.9). The difference between the two groups was not found to be significent (t(3)=1.85, p=0.16).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our data, as the difference between aggressive behavior score of the blue water and clear water was not found to be significent. Since the standard deviation of both groups in our experiment is remarkably high (due to some fish consistently being more aggressive and others being more passive), a similar experiment with more trials would likely be needed to conclude that the two groups are significently different. Also given that our index for quantifying the level of aggressiveness of each fish, the aggressive behavior score, is not scientifically tested or proven, this could also be a source of error. However, given the trends in the data, which clearly show a higher average aggressive behavior score for clear water, we believe that our hypothesis is correct, although the reasoning behind it may be incorrect.
It is quite possible that the blue color of the water was not responsible for the decrease in aggressive behaviors, but rather another variable, such as light intensity or water transparency, influenced the results. When compared to Betta splendins in clear water, Betta splendins in blue water would be subjected to both lower light intensity and lower water transparency due to the coloring of the water, likely decreasing visibility. Previous research regarding the effect of light intensity on aggressive behaviors clearly states that increased light intensity correlates with increased aggressive behaviors in many species of fish. When studying Oreochromis niloticus, the Nile tilapia, researchers observed a positive relationship between light intensity and frequency of aggressive interactions [Carvalho: 2013]. Similarly, researchers testing the effects of water transparency on agnostic behaviors concluded that lower water transparency caused fish to be shyer and less active [Sommer-Trembo: 2017]. While it is possible that the blue color of the water impacted the aggressiveness of our Betta splendins, it is more likely a combination of these other factors.
As our results suggest, animal behaviors vary in different environmental conditions. In environments which hinder visibility, such as blue water for the Betta splendins, it is likely beneficial for the fish to prevent the exhibition of aggressive behaviors in order to avoid expending energy until absolutely necessary. Our study shows that abiotic factors, such as water color, do affect an organism’s level of aggressiveness, altering the exhibition of behaviors that require copious supplies of energy.
