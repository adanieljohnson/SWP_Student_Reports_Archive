Title: Effect of Increased Juvenile Hormone on Weight of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is the organism being studied.  Throughout its lifecycle it goes through 4 distinct stages embryo, larva, pupa, adult.  The type and time of molting is determined by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone.  The main objective of this lab is to determine whether or not an increased level of juvenile hormone affects the weight of the caterpillar as it reaches adulthood.  We believe the caterpillars with increased Juvenile Hormone will have lower weights than the controll group.  For the treatment group we mixed 10 drops of Precor to each of their food and recorded the changing weights of all caterpillars every day for a week.  After day 3 there were noticeable disparities in the weights of the controll group versus the treatment caterpillars.  Treatments 1,2 and 4 had lower weights than the controll but treatment 3 had approximately the same growth rate as the controll caterpillars. Our hypothesis was proven wrong in the end.  Even though we did observe an overall lower weight in the treatment group versus the controll group the difference was not significent.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is a caterpillar with an average holometabolous life cycle of 39-48 days.  It begins as an egg and after the 1st instar it becomes a larva.  It remains as a larva until the 5th instar where it metamorphosizes into a pupa and finally into an adult moth.  Their development are controllled mainly by 3 hormones: prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone.  For this lab we are focusing on how increased levels of Juvenile Hormone (giving caterpillars Precor) compared to the normal levels of JH, would affect the weight of the Manduca sexta.  Juvenile hormone, which is secreted by the corpus allata, controlls the type of molting of the Manduca sexta during its life cycle.  Molting separates each of the instars and the pupal and adult stages [Johnson: 2018].  Juvenile hormone also plays a vital role during the adult stage of insects: it modulates ovarian maturation, learning, migration, diapause, innate immunity, and is also a pro-aging hormone [Yamamoto: 2013].  Studying the Manduca sexta will provide further information regarding the potential success of pesticides, when treating for Tobacco Hornworm.  We believe that increased levels of juvenile hormone in the Manduca sexta’s diet will cause them to weigh less than the untreated caterpillars as they develop into adults.


Materials and Method:
Gather 8 caterpillars in the larva stage (4 for the controll group and 4 for the treatment group).  Make sure none of them have past the commitment pulse (do not have black stripes along their sides).  Then grab 4 containers and divide each container in half with a notecard (2 containers for the 4 controll caterpillars and 2 containers for the 4 treatment caterpillars).  Mark which caterpillars are which on the side of the notecard.  Weigh all the caterpillars for their initial weights.  Next, weigh 10g of food for each caterpillar.  For the controll caterpillars, add 10 drops of distilled water to their food, and for the treatment add 10 drops of precor (juvenile hormone).  Place all containers in the incubator.  Each day at the same time, change and treat the food, in order to prevent it from drying out, clean out the containers, and record the weight of each caterpillar.  Once all weight data has been collected, use a two sample t_test in order to determine whether or not the averages in weight between the two groups was significent or due to chance.


Results:
Treatment 3 was continuously in the same weight range as the controll group.  After day 3, the weights between the controll and treatment groups started to have noticeable disparities.  Control 2 had a slightly lower end weight than the other controlls.  Lastly, treatment 2 overall decreased in weight, unlike all other caterpillars.  Our T-Test results were, T-statistic: 2.113482, Degrees of Freedom: 6, P-Value: 0.078463 (above 0.05 therefore our results are not significent)


Discussion:
After calculating our p_value, it is evident that our hypothesis was rejected.  In our results we did see a lower change in weight in the caterpillars that were treated with Precor, which indicates less growth.  However, the decreased weight was not actually significent.  Treatment 3 also followed the weight trend of the controll group which demonstrates that increased juvenile hormone does not decrease the weight of the caterpillar.  This deviation could have resulted from the Precor not having an effect on this caterpillar.  We also observed an overall loss in weight for treatment 2.  This could have been due to the caterpillar being sick or lacking either allatotropin or allatostatin neurohormones.  Allatotropin stimulates the secretion of JH and allatostatin inhibits the synthesis of JH [Subramanian: 2016].  If they lacked allatotropin then they would not have any JH present in their body and therefore would not be able to molt.  If they lacked allatostatin then the caterpillar would not be able to lower the level of JH, which is crucial during the 5th instar and to advance past the commitment pulse [Riddiford: 2012].  Possible sources of error could have been not distributing the drops evenly throughout the food, not having exactly 10 drops on each food group, weighing caterpillars with secretions connected to them, or not tarring the scale.
