Title:  Rate of Aggressiveness in Male Betta Splendens in the presence of shelter vs. no shelter.

Abstract:
Every animal has a different way of protecting and defending themselves, male Betta Splendens are no different. They don't ensue fights right away, instead they perform a ritualized set of agonistic behaviors and therefore also known as Siamese fighting fish.  According to previous research betta fish expend a lot of energy displaying aggressive behaviors. In hindsight, it would make sense if they could, avoid having to expend energy they would. Therefore, we hypothesize that two betta fish will show a decrease in aggressiveness when they are exposed to each other with shelter vs. no shelter. We assume this because if given the chance to not have to confront another male and expend energy the betta fish would choose to hide instead and conserve energy. We used 6 male betta fish and performed 3 replicates testing the time the fish were being aggressive in no shelter vs. shelter for 5 min each followed by a 5 min rest. We then quantified this into an average from the 6 fish into a rate of agonistic behavior. Our results did not support our hypothesis because they showed an average increase in aggressive behavior in the presence of a shelter. According to statistical testing, our results were not statistically significant. This conclusion came f

Introduction:
Male Betta Splendens, are typically found in Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. They are part of the Gourami family. In nature, male Betta Splendens establish their own territory but when confined to significantly small areas and faced with another betta male aggressive behaviors will become apparent, if neither backs down a death match can ensue. [Bronstein: 1981]. Because of this, they are also known as Siamese fighting fish. Male Betta Splendens are known to be very aggressive towards each other by performing a series of ritualized displays of agonistic behavior. The displaying of aggressive behaviors actually benefits both of the fish because they have the opportunity to resolve the conflict without actually having to fight. Engaging in a physical fight is very dangerous for both of the fish because they have the same skill set, making the fight very evenly matched. On the other hand, always showing signs of aggression towards other Betta Splendens has an increase in metabolic rate meaning, the fish expend a lot of energy by displaying these behaviors [Castro: 2006]. There have been studies done testing the difference in aggressive when two male Betta Splendens are exposed to an audience: another female, different species etc... It seems to be that betta fish agonistic behavior change in intensity and frequency when exposed to different audiences. [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. All the research done have had audiences have been living, biotic audiences. there could be a correlation with abiotic factors on the aggressive behaviors in betta fish such as shelter. Due to the fact that energy is expended by displaying aggressive behaviors it would make sense that if the fish could avoid the other male than they would take that opportunity because it will allow them to conserve energy. Therefore, we hypothesized that two betta fish will hide in shelter when they are exposed to each other to conserve energy, decreasing their aggressiveness vs. when there is no shelter present and they will show and increase in aggressive behaviors.

Materials and Methods:
We placed two betta fish in a tank that was separated by a glass and plastic divider. After taking out the plastic divider, leaving only the glass divider, we then performed 5-minute aggression trials and timed specific aggressive behaviors for each fish. After 5 minutes we placed the plastic divider between them again and had a 5 min rest time. This allowed the fish to return back to a state of habitualness. During that time, we placed two shelters in each side of the tank. The shelters were quite large and occupied a lot of the space, changing the environment the fish previously had. We then removed the plastic divider once again and performed the 5-minute aggression trials. We repeated this two more time to have a total of 3 reps making sure the fish had 5 min rest between each test. With the data collected from the trials, we converted the time to decimals and then calculated the average time of aggressiveness in the fish with shelter and without shelter. To test if our results were significant or not we used a paired t-tests comparing shelter and no shelter aggressiveness as our statistical analysis. The alpha value we compared our results was .05, meaning any p-value of under .05 meant that the results were significant.

Results:
Individually 4 out of the 6 fish showed a decrease in aggressiveness when a shelter was present. However, our experiment was based on the average of all the fish. Therefore, our results showed a mean ratio of .445 (±0.35) agonistic behavior when there was a shelter present. When there was no shelter present the ratio was .418 (±0.4) of agonistic behavior. There was a .027 higher ratio of average aggressive behavior when a shelter was present. After a paired t-test was done we determined that our results were not significant (t-stat = 0.421, df = 5, P = 0.691). Our dependent variable resulted in a P-value greater the alpha value of .05 (P = 0.05 or less), which means that there was no statistical significant difference between aggressiveness levels based on a shelter being present of not.

Discussion:
Our results indicated that our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Our results after statistical testing using a paired t-test with the basis that of a p value lower than .05 is significant, our results were not significant. The presence of a shelter actually increased the average aggressiveness of the 6 fish, however four of the fish showed a decreased in aggressiveness but it was proven insignificant because of their paired t-tests. While the presence of a living audience had an effect on betta fish in previous research our results seemed to conclude that external factor of shelter had no impact on the aggressiveness of Betta Splendens [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. However, even though our results were insignificant there was an increase ratio of agonistic behavior when a shelter was present. This could be due to the fact that betta males compete for space and protect their "nests" through aggressive behavior. Since the shelter were quite large their space became limited and this could have caused the increase in agonistic behavior [Bronstein: 1981]. In terms of future experiments, we noticed that in the first replicate we performed, the fishes were the same size, this is the rep where the fish increased aggressiveness with the shelter. The next two reps we did, there was one fish that was larger and one that was smaller and they both showed a decrease in aggressiveness. The reason for this is because the fish display agonistic behavior in an effort to make the other back down and submit. When one fish was larger than the other the smaller fish backed down because it was evident that they were outmatched therefore no further intimidation was needed. On the other hand, when the fish were of the same size neither one backed down and so they continued being aggressive. Therefore, if done again we would make two experiments, one that has the fishes the same size and the other with one fish that is larger and the other smaller. Also noting that a bigger tank could help as well because the shelters were far too large for the tank and there could be an anomaly with that as well because the fish could have felt the need for more space and that is why they were more aggressive not because of the shelter itself but the space the shelter occupied. This would allow us to get accurate results in testing for the shelter present instead of the amount of space the fish have.
