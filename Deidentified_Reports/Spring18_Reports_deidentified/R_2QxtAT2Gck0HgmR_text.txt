Title: Effects of Tide-Free and Gentle Detergent on Spinacia Oleraceam (Spinach) and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris (Chard) Do Not Lead to Reduction of Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is significant in the sense that it produces a by-product (oxygen) that is fundamental for much of the life on Earth. In this study, photosynthetic reduction through household pollutants (specifically Tide-Free and Gentle) was the focus of study through Spinacia Oleraceam (Spinach) and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris (Chard). This experiment strove to determine whether or not Tide detergent would significantly reduce photosynthetic activity in spinach and chard considering the detergent is consistently polluting the environment. After exposing chloroplasts from each plant to both 10% and 20% diluted detergent, the evidence did not support the idea that the detergent lead to a reduction in photosynthetic activity. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. This process involves the green pigment chlorophyll which helps generate oxygen as a byproduct. Oxygen is essential for many organisms living on Earth; including the human race. However, advancements in technology have led to the production of various pollutants, which harm the environment in many ways, including the disruption of plant life, processes, and therefore photosynthesis. In a 2010 report, Branislav R. Jovanic carried out an experiment where he investigated the effects of laundry detergent (a common household washing product) on bean leaves. What the researcher found was that after twenty-one days of treating (watering) bean leaves with a solution, which had been combined with laundry detergent, was that the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus in the dosed leaf plant was less than 45% when compared to the control (leaves that were not treated with the water/detergent solution [Jovanic, 2010]. We wish to carry-out a similar experiment where we will measure the effects that laundry detergent has on photosynthesis. In order to conduct the experiment, we will obtain two types of plant leaves (spinach and chard), which we will use to obtain enriched chloroplasts. The chloroplasts will be treated with“Tide-Free and Gentle” laundry detergent at a diluted 10% and 20% and then compared to a control group (no detergent added). We will then use the Hill Reaction in order to determine the rate of photosynthesis carried out by the chloroplasts (we will be measuring absorbance change).  We will conduct the experiment with the following hypothesis in mind, if the plants are treated with the Tide laundry detergent, then they will experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out this experiment, the following procedure should be carried out for the spinach and chard leaves. Pack a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, remove the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. Throw away the veins, and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Make sure to blot off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, wipe them dry, then add the spinach leaves. Next, add ten milliliters of cold grinding buffer (four hundred mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Grind the spinach until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. Then, add an additional 10 milliliters of grinding buffer, mix with the spinach slurry, and strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer two-hundred micro-liters of the filtered liquid from the beaker into a micro-tube labeled “Sample of A”, and store it on ice. Next, transfer the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC. Be sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Do not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Next, remove 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 ml tube marked “B”, place it in a micro-tube labeled “Sample of B”, & store it on ice. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Pour the supernatant, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet. Place tube “B” on ice. Add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gentle with a transfer pipet. Transfer 200 μl of this suspended pellet into a micro-tube labeled “Sample of B Pellet”, & store it on ice. Remove 200 μl from tube “C,” and place it into a micro-tube labeled “Sample of C”, & store it on ice the on ice. In order to check the samples for chloroplast density, load 10 μl aliquots of Sample A, Sample B, Sample B-pellet, and Sample C onto a hemocytometer and examine each of them under phase optics. Look for chloroplasts in each of the 3 samples; they will be small, oval to egg-shaped, and shine brightly under phase optics. They are bright yellow to green, but so thin and small that it may be difficult to see their color. Estimate the relative density of chloroplasts in the 3 samples. It is not necessary to count them; just rank the 3 samples from most to fewest chloroplasts. Next, prepare 22 test tubes and place them in a tube rack. Prepare them in the following manner— prepare one blank with 8 mm of water and 2 mm of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Prepare three test tubes with no chloroplasts, 6 mm of water, 2 mm of 130 mM of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Prepare three test tubes with chloroplasts from spinach, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Prepare three test tubes in the same manner as the three previous test tubes, however add 5 mL of 10% deluded laundry detergent. Prepare three test tubes in the same manner as the three previous test tubes, however add 5% of 20% (instead of 10% diluted laundry detergent. Prepare three test tubes with chloroplasts from the chard leaves, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Prepare three test tubes in the same manner as the three previous test tubes, however add 5 mL of 10% deluded laundry detergent. Prepare three test tubes in the same manner as the three previous test tubes, however add 5% of 20% (instead of 10% diluted laundry detergent. Now that the assay has been prepared, add 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts you prepared in earlier into the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-22 (all but the blank, and the 3 tubes with no chloroplasts). Mix each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. Transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Immediately blank the spectrophotometer using Tube 0. Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples (these are the Time Zero data points). After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with Sample 0. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. Record data. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbance a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbance one more time for all 22 samples. Finally, record results and use a paired t-test to analyze data. 


Results:
After running the assay, there was a decrease in photosynthetic activity from a few of the samples across spinach and chard. During the 30 minutes that the assay was conducted (10 minute intervals) there was a slight increase in absorbance (and therefore a reduction of photosynthetic activity) throughout the spinach chloroplasts that were mixed with 10% and 20% detergent. For example, the spinach chloroplasts mixed with 10% detergent saw an increase in absorbance by 6.5% from 10 to 20 minutes within its third test tube. Regarding the spinach chloroplast with 10% detergent versus no detergent, the following t-values were produced— 0.18 (10mins), 0.42 (20mins), 0.57 (30 mins). The following p-values were produced, 0.87 (10 mins), 0.70 (20mins) 0.60 (30mins). Regarding the spinach chloroplasts with 20% detergent versus no detergent, the following t-values were produced— 0.92 (10mins), 0.04 (20mins), and 0.25 (30mins). The following p-values were produced— 0.41 (10mins), 0.97 (20mins), 0.82 (30mins). Regarding the chard chloroplasts with 10% detergent versus no detergent, the following t-values were produced— 1.43 (10mins), 1.38 (20mins), and 1.44 (30 mins). The following p-values were produced— 0.23 (10 mins), 0.24 (20mins), 0.22 (30 mins). Regarding the chard chloroplasts with 20% detergent versus no detergent, the following t-values were produced, 0.96 (10 mins), 1.02 (20mins), 1.44 (30mins). The following p-values were produced— 0.4 (10mins), 0.36 (20mins), 0.28 (30 mins).  


Discussion:

The collected data in this experiment does not support our original hypothesis, which states that polluting the spinach and chard with Tide would decrease photosynthetic activity.  Because of this, we cannot reject our null hypothesis. Although there was little evidence that points to detergent reducing photosynthetic activity in these leaves, there is not enough significant data that aligns with that of Branislav R. Jovanic‘s work, which demonstrates that bean plants were significantly impacted by a decrease in photosynthetic activity after being treated with detergent polluted water [Jovanic, 2010]. Although our data produced multiple p-values, none of them were below 0.05, and so they cannot be considered to be significant. This may have come about for a number of reasons. For example, when preparing the test tube solutions and assay, it was clear that the apparatus used to measure the liquids were defective on account of air bubbles and could have therefore, lead to inaccurate measurements. This leads us to the limitations of the experiment as well. For example, the experiment only tested one type of detergent at 10% and 20%. Increasing the concentration of the detergent could have produced conditions more similar to those of the environment. Also, testing a single type (brand) of detergent is a great limitation to our experiment as there are thousands of detergent types that pollute the environment, which may affect photosynthetic processes differently considering they contain different components. Testing a greater variety of plants would also aid in expanding this experiment as different plants could be affected very differently by such a pollutant, which may not be reflected by the effects on spinach and chard. In proposing ideas for future studies, it might be beneficial to test the effects of other pollutants on photosynthetic activity. This could include testing for photosynthetic reduction in various plant species as a result of chloroform (a by-product produced by disinfectant chemicals). Such experiments could aid in determining how advancements in technology affect our environment.
