Title: Comparing the Photosynthetic Activities of a Sun Plant and a Shade Plant 

Abstract:
Plants capture and store energy from the sun through photosynthesis.In the light dependent reactions, photons absorb light from the sun and generate NADPH and ATP, which are necessary products to create glucose.We wanted to know if plants that grow in the shade have lower photosynthetic activity and hypothesized that the spinach would have a higher photosynthetic activity than the fern.We believed this because spinach plants grow in sun, while fern plants grow in shade.To test our hypothesis, we ground spinach and fern leaves into a paste and centrifuged them until we obtained a pellet that consisted of the max number of chloroplasts in each sample.We ran a Hill assay to determine the photosynthetic activity of the fern and spinach.We found our photosynthetic activity for the spinach to be significantly higher than the fern, supporting our hypothesis that the sun plant will have a higher photosynthetic activity than the shade plant.It is possible that photosynthetic activity is higher in sun plants because they have evolved to have a higher photosynthetic captivity due to their time mainly being spent in the sun,whereas shade plants have a lower photosynthetic captivity.Overall, it’s important to understand that sun plants have a higher photosynthetic activity than shade plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to synthesize energy in the form of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis consists of the light dependent reactions and the light independent reactions. We wanted to know if photosynthetic activity was decreased in plants that do not grow in the sun, so we focused on the light dependent reactions. In the first stage of the light dependent reactions, photons absorb light from the sun. These excited photons then generate reducing power in the form of NADPH, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. To measure photosynthetic activity, the reducing agent NADPH is measured because it is a product of the light dependent reactions. In the second stage of the light dependent reactions, a proton gradient is generated to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2016]. The light dependent reactions function by generating NADPH and ATP, which are necessary products to generate glucose for the light independent reactions of photosynthesis. 

Photosynthesis involves redox reactions in the electron transport chain, proton pumps that create a proton gradient to synthesize ATP, and carrier molecules, NADP+ and NADPH, to transfer high energy electrons used in the light independent reactions. The light dependent reactions consist of two systems, Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), which both are found in the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplast. In PSII, energy is absorbed from a photon of light. The energy is transferred to P680, a pair of chlorophyll molecules called the “special pair”, which enters an excited, high energy state. This high energy electron is then passed to an acceptor molecule, plastiquinone [Alberts: 2013]. The excited electrons are restored by the oxidation of water to produce O2 and H+ ions. The protons produced from oxidation of water are then pumped across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient. Then, reduced plastiquinone transfers its electrons to cytochrome b6f and then to plastocyanin. As the electron moves along the electron transport chain, energy is released to pump more protons across the thylakoid membrane. The protons generated from water splitting and the transfer across the electron transport chain forms the proton gradient necessary to generate ATP. At this time, plastosyanin carries the electrons to PSI, which are excited by incoming photons of light. The excited electrons travel through PSI to NADP+ to produce NADPH, which will travel to the light independent reaction pathway to create glucose. The proton gradient generated creates an electrochemical gradient that runs through an ATP synthase complex. After the electrons move down their electrical and diffusion gradient, ATP is synthesized [Johnson: 2016].  

In our experiment, we wanted to know if photosynthetic activity was decreased in plants that do not grow in the sun. Energy from light excites electrons in PSII and PSI so they can travel through the electron transport chain. We decided to compare the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea), a plant grown in the sun, and fern leaves, a plant grown in the shade. Spinach has a high yield of chloroplasts and its photosynthetic activity thrives in sunlight. However, fern leaves have less chloroplasts and a photosynthetic activity that thrives in the shade. Thus, because the spinach plant has a higher amount of chloroplasts, we expected the photosynthetic activity to be higher. Further research has shown that shade leaves maximize their light capture while reducing the costs of maintaining excess photosynthetic activity. They also have higher chlorophyll concentrations	and lower ATPase activity compared to sun leaves, while sun leaves have a higher PSII activity and captivity because they are always getting energy from sunlight  [Mathur: 2018]. To measure photosynthetic activity, we needed to measure the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts. We did this by using a Hill reaction with an alternate electron acceptor, DCPIP, that chloroplasts pass electrons to. When oxidized, DCPIP is dark blue and absorbs light, but when reduced, DCPIP is colorless [Johnson: 2016]. Thus, the reducing agent NADPH produced by the chloroplasts can be detected. Our previous research and other studies guided us to hypothesize that the spinach leaf would have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern leaf.


Materials and Methods:
The two organisms used were fern leaves and spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). The fern leaves grew with other plants in a shady area inside the biology building, so the exact name is not known. The spinach plants were provided by the biology department. The fern plants grew inside at room temperature, while the spinach was kept in a fridge at 0-8 degrees celsius. 

 Part one:  We placed two mortar and pestles, 2x150 mL beaker, and 6x50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. Three centrifuge tubes were used for the fern leaves and three tubes were used for the spinach leaves. We cut four fern leaves from a shady area and gathered four spinach leaves. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, we removed the large central veins from the fern and spinach leaves, threw the veins away, and tore up the fern and spinach leaves. We added the torn fern leaves to one cold, dry mortar and pestle, and the torn spinach leaves to the other. We then added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), and grinded the fern and spinach leaves until they were a thick paste. The fern leaves were not initially cut as much as the spinach leaves, so between grinding, we had to use scissors to cut the leafy-paste into pieces. The ideal ending point should contain no leaves. However, due to the dryness of the fern leaves and initially not cutting them very much, the ending slurry contained a few leaves in it. We then added an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer to the fern and spinach slurry and mixed it. Using three layers of cheesecloth, we strained the fern and spinach slurries into two separate chilled beakers. 200 ul of the filtered liquid slurries were then transferred into labeled microtubes and stored on ice. The remaining slurries in the beakers were then transferred into separate chilled 50 mL centrifuge tubes and were spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4oC. After centrifuging for 3 minutes, the supernatant was poured into 2 separate chilled 50 mL centrifuge tubes. It was important for us to pour the supernatant out quickly to ensure that no debris was accidentally transferred into the tubes. The tubes were then centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was then removed by each Sample B, and a sample of the fern pellet B and the spinach pellet B were placed in microtubes and were stored on ice. They were gathered by adding 20 mL of grinding buffer to them, stirring with the transfer pipet, and pipetting them in the microtubes. We then took sample B pellet for the fern and chloroplast and compared the chloroplast density on hemocytometer under phase optics in a microscope to qualitatively determine the fraction. 

Part two:   When looking under the microscope, it was estimated that there were about 8 times as many chloroplasts in the spinach solution than the fern solution (Figure 2&3). Therefore, we placed 100 μl of the spinach chloroplasts and 700 μl of water in 3 test tubes to make the concentration more dilute to qualitatively equal the fern chloroplasts. We added 800 μl of the fern chloroplasts in 3 test tubes. Next, we prepared 13 large test tubes with reaction mixes. One blank tube was made with 8mL water and 2mL reaction buffer. Three tubes without chloroplasts with 6mL water, 2mL 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), three tubes with spinach chloroplasts (diluted) and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer, and three tubes with fern chloroplasts and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer were made. We then stirred the tubes and transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Using tube 0, we blanked the spectrophotometer and measured the absorbance of the samples for time zero at 600nm. The tubes were placed under a white grow light that resembled sunlight for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the blanked the spectrophotometer, then read the absorbance of each sample again. We then placed the samples under the white grow light for 10 more minutes, or 20 minutes total. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer and measured the absorbance of each sample. The samples were then placed under the grow light again for 10 minutes, or 30 minutes total. After 10 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked, and the absorbance of each sample was read.

Statistical Tests: For each absorbance read, we recorded it in excel against time. We calculated the “% Change” in absorbance at 10, 20, and 30 minutes using the following formula:  % change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%  A statistical t-test was then used in order to determine the significance of our results.


Results:
The percent change at 30 minutes was highest for the spinach leaves at an average of 57.1%. This was followed by the fern leaves at an average of 11.6% and the control sample with no chloroplasts at an average of 0.3%. The mean of the spinach group and the fern group were statistically different (t-stat= 6.23, df= 4, P= 0.0034). 


Discussion:
We found our results to support our hypothesis that photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves will be higher than in fern leaves. The bigger percent change shown in Figure 1 for the spinach leave shows that more photosynthetic activity took place in the plant grown in the sun. The fern leaves had less photosynthetic activity, which was shown throughout the DCPIP Hill reaction because the color remained blue, while the spinach leaves changed to colorless. Photosynthesis produced the reducing agent NADPH, which cause the blue color to leave.   
 
It is possible that photosynthetic activity is higher in sun plants because they have a higher photosynthetic captivity, whereas shade plants have a lower photosynthetic captivity. Sun plants have a higher photosynthetic captivity because they grow in the sun and are constantly receiving energy. In order to store this energy, they have to have a higher capacity for photosynthesis. Plants have evolved in order to absorb the maximum amount of light in order to survive. Thus, shade plants have evolved a lower photosynthetic captivity because they are faced with less light. At a cellular level, when light hits the shade plant, the excited photon can only reach is maximum photosynthetic captivity, which is lower than the sun plant. Shade plants also have a higher leaf area ratio than sun plants. This can be explained by there being a less amount of sunlight available, so the leaves need to be bigger in order to take in as much sunlight as possible [Atwell: 1999]. In a previous study, it is shown that the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport is higher in sun plant than in shade plant chloroplasts. They found that for the shade species, the light saturated methylamine uncoupled rate of reduction of DCIP in the Hill reaction was less than for the sun species [Boardman: 2018]. This study supports our results with the Hill reaction that the sun plant has a higher photosynthetic activity than the shade plant. At a cellular level, this shows that electron transport through the electron transport pathway is lower for shade plants. If less light is available, less photons will excite electrons, causing less electrons to pass through the electron transport chain.  

Though our hypothesis was supported by our experiment and previous studies, various sources of error have to be considered. A source of error taken into account could be the age of the spinach and fern leaves and their chloroplasts. We did not know the exact age of either plant, but because the fern leaves we found growing leisurely inside the biology building, they were more than likely older than the spinach leaves, which are usually grown fresh for consumption. It has been shown that the maximum photosynthetic activity occurs during the first season of grown and decreases slowly with the second year of age [Freeland: 1952]. This, this could account for the fern leaves having less photosynthetic activity. 

In future areas of research, the effect that different types of light have on exciting electrons can be explored. In a previous study, an experiment that tested the photosynthetic response to different light intensities, low light and high light, and water status of two Nothofagus species was conducted. They found that as light intensity decreased, photosynthetic activity of the two species decreased as well [Peri: 2009]. This can be useful for our experiment because for both the fern plant and the spinach plant, we used a bright white light. However, white light may excite spinach, but not fern. Thus, if different types of light were used on the fern plant, it is possible that different photosynthetic activities can be determined. In another study, a fluorescence imaging system that excites red, blue, and green fluorescence was used. The sun leaves showed a higher photosynthetic activity and different pigment ratios that absorbed blue light [Lichtenthaler: 2000]. If a light was used that does not excite sun plants but did excite shade plants, different photosynthetic activity could be determined as well.  Another future area of research can be done on if plants can adapt to low light in a short period of time. This can be useful for the economical use of available light while growing and harvesting important crops that grow in the shade. If certain crops can adapt to less light, less money can be spent on finding sunny areas or purchasing light sources. Overall, it is important to understand the mechanism of photosynthesis and how photosynthetic  activity is different for sun and shade plants.
