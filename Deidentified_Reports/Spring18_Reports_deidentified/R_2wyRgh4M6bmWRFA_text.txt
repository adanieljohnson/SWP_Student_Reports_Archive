Title: How charge affects the movement patterns of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Organisms typically communicate through cell signaling. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold which is a group of nuclei massed within a single plasma membrane. The mass, also known as a plasmodium, behaves as a giant cell. Consequently, due to this nature, it makes Physarum polycephalum a unique and good organism to better understand cell signaling. Our hypothesis is that Physarum polycephalum will be more likely to move towards positively charged regions than negative charged regions. In our experiment, we used Physarum polycephalum as our test organism to test its reactions to negatively or positively charged regions in a gel electrophoresis tank. We analyzed our results with an ANOVA test. Our observed Physarum movement in the Gel Electrophoresis was all in the negatively charged region. One of our replicants would be considered an outlier as it lies outside three standard deviations of the mean. Our results were found to not be significant after performing our experiment. Our p-value was found to be 0.609. The Tukey-Kramer tests showed that groups A and B were significant between each other.



Introduction:
Organisms typically communicate through cell signaling. Organisms have a variety of signals they use to communicate within their body whether it be hormones, a nervous system, or receptors through the cell body. Physarum polycephalum uses an intracellular signal transduction pathway to control and coordinate its responses to the environment [Johnson 2018].
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold which is a group of nuclei massed within a single plasma membrane. The mass, also known as a plasmodium, behaves as a giant cell. Consequently, due to this nature, it makes Physarum polycephalum a unique and good organism to better understand cell signaling.
Physarum polycephalum will often move towards favorable environments in search of food, while avoiding unfavorable environments such as sunlight. In previous experiments, it was observed that Physarum polycephalum had distinct movement patterns in relation to amino acids that had either positive or negative charges [Lepow 1938]. Our experiment plans to look at the effect of positively and negatively charged regions and its effect on the mobility of Physarum polycephalum. Our hypothesis is that Physarum polycephalum will be more likely to move towards positively charged regions than negative charged regions.


Materials and Methods:
In our experiment, we used Physarum polycephalum as our test organism to test its reactions to negatively or positively charged regions in a gel electrophoresis tank. Gel electrophoresis is typically used to measure the lengths of DNA samples by having them travel in the preferred direction by creating a voltage gradient [Smithies 1959]. In the experiment, three 1 x 1 cm cubes of the Physarum culture were placed in the center of the agar within the gel electrophoresis. Three pieces of oatmeal were equally spaced 2-3 cm away going towards the positively charged region and the negatively charged region. The gel electrophoresis was turned on and the voltage was set at 23 volts. After 24 hours, the gel electrophoresis was observed for any movement of the Physarum cultures and was recorded. We analyzed our results with an ANOVA test.

Results:
Our Physarum movement in the Gel Electrophoresis was all in the negatively charged region. One of our replicants would be considered an outlier as it lies outside three standard deviations of the mean.

Discussion:
Our results were found to not be significant after performing our experiment. Our p-value was found to be 0.609. The Tukey-Kramer tests showed that groups A and B were significant between each other. Overall, the insignificance shows that Physarum polycephalum cultures within the gel electrophoresis tank favored movement towards the negatively charged region compared to the positively charged region. However, when comparing the movements between the phototactic control and the experimental charged, there was significance between the two movements which may have been caused by the outlier within the group.
When looking at Physarum polycephalum, the entire mass of cells will be subject to electrical changes regardless of their size. Specifically, any addition of an attractant or repellant, will be found heavily concentrated within the agar of the gel electrophoresis. Additionally, in an experiment by Whiting, Costello, and Adamatzky; they found that positive charge should have a positive effect on oscillations and movement, while negative charg regions should depict a negative affect on oscillations and movement [Whiting 2014]. Speculating from their results, it could show that the positive charge had a positive effect on the movement of Physarum polycephalum causing favorable movement towards the negatively charged region of the agar and away from the positively charged source.
The experiment that was performed could have been improved by having a more measurable control in relation to our experimental, possibly by creating a gel electrophoresis tank that only is positively charged to observe how movement is affected.
