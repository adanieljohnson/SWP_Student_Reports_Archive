Title: Manduca sexta growth in response to Ecdysterone 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a tobacco hornworm that undergoes metamorphosis to go through its four-stage life cycle. The life cycle consists of egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The changes that the Manduca sexta undergo is influenced by hormones, and for growth, specifically Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. If there is an E20 blocker (Aza Guard) present in the diet of the Manduca sexta, then the molting period of the Manduca sexta will be inhibited. To test this, eight caterpillars were divided into a controll and experimental group and were fed different diets. The controll had an untampered diet while the experimental had Aza Guard mixed into it. After seven days, the difference in weights were calculated and then a two-sample t test was used to evaluate whether or not the difference in weight change was significent. The test showed that the difference between the weight changes was significent, which caused us to reject the null hypothesis.

Introduction:
Introduction:	
The Manduca sexta is a tobacco hornworm that has been studied since tobacco began to be produced in bulk (1). The Manduca sexta has four stages in its life cycle, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult. There are many hormones present in the hornworm’s body and influence how they behave, grow, and react to the environment. The hornworm changes stages in its life cycle due to the amount of nutrition that they have access to and the hormones in their body. The main hormones that are initiating these changes of stages are both Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (E20) (2). With both of these hormones, the tobacco hornworm can metamorphize and go through the different life cycles. With Ecdysterone specifically, there is a small influx of the hormone called the commitment pulse which indicates that the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients and that it is time for them to pupate (3). The hormone that will be focused in this experiment will be Ecdysterone and this ecdysteriod is what helps regulate the molting periods that the hornworm undergoes as it grows in size. These hormones affect the not just the molting and the growth of the body, but also other organic aspects of the caterpillar’s life. The commitment points cause behavior, genetic, and physiological differences that are the beginning of the metamorphosis (3). The impact of hormones is vital in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta, which is why E20 will be the hormone that will be manipulated in this experiment.
Hypothesis:
If there is an E20 blocker (Aza Guard) present in the diet of the Manduca sexta, then the molting period of the Manduca sexta will be inhibited.


Materials and Method:
Method:
Required Materials:
•	Manduca sexta (8)
•	Food (3)
•	Incubators
•	Scale
•	Bowls and mixing equipment
•	E20 Blocker Aza Guard
•	Plastic bowls
•	Index cards
Procedure:
1.	Select 8 Manduca sexta and separate them into 2 groups of 4.
2.	Have one group be assigned as the Control Group and the other the Experimental Group.
3.	Create habitable enclosures with index cards and plastic bowls.
4.	Place the Manduca sexta in corresponding groups.
5.	Make 40 grams of each food, the controll and the experimental with the Aza Guard, and place 10 grams in each Manduca sexta compartment.
6.	After 24 hours, clean the compartment, weigh the Manduca sexta, weigh the food, and replace the food for each Manduca sexta.
7.	Repeat step 6 until a week has passed. After the week, take final measurements then dispose of the Manduca sextas.

Observations:
	On the first day, the experimental group was less active than the controll group counterparts. They were similar in sizes and weights, but the activity range and where they were in the compartments were different from the two groups. Then on day 2, the experimental group was moving much more than the controll group counterparts. The Control Group seems to have been eating the newly added food rather than moving around. The experimental group was larger in size and on average weight. Continuing the trend, on day 3, the experimental group continued to move around before and after being weighed while the controll group only show signs of moving after being weighed. The controll group shows signs of brownish underbellies and generally paler. On day 4, all the caterpillars were moving around and eating the food. The experimental group was much smaller than the controll counterparts and were not eating as much food. The discoloration in the controll group was becoming more severe and the experimental group is getting darker. On day 5, the experimental group became very dark on the sides and the undersides. They were also smaller in size and they were becoming less active. The controll group was generally larger, and they were pale rather than a dark color. They looked plump. Then, on day 6, the controll group was heavier and less active while the experimental group was smaller and more active. The color discoloration was more apparent, and parts of the experimental group were also becoming pale around the face. On the final day, the controll group was moving around and the coloration was vibrant. The experimental group was not nearly as active and their colors are dull and dark. The experimental group was extremely small while the controll group contains large and plump caterpillars.
	The results of the experiment showed that the controll group had larger and healthily colored Manduca sexta than the experimental group, with the mean weight change from day 1 to day 7 for experimental and controll are 1.78 and 7.64 grams respectively. When performing the two-sample t test, the p_value that was calculated was 0.000026, which is lower than our target p_value of 0.05.

Discussion:
	From the results of this experiment, the presence of Aza Guard in the Manduca sexta’s diet seemed to affect the growth and molting periods. The normal diet that was given to the controll group was the exact same as the experimental group, but without the addition of Aza Guard. Without the Aza Guard, the worms grew in size and gained weight, some up to 10 grams which is a normal size of a late stage larva. It can be inferred that the Aza Guard inhibited grow of the Manducta sexta by preventing them from molting their skin, which prevented them from allowing them to put on more weight and size. While the experimental group did not grow in size, they continued to eat a large portion of food that was given to them. It is speculated that this is a cause for the activity of the experimental group, because they had to burn off the excess calories due to their inability to use the energy to grow. Inversely, the controll group was less mobile because they were using most of their energy input towards growth. In every experiment, there is the presence of human error, and while there were no apparent mistakes, the different caretakers of the Manduca sexta each day is an inconsistency that could have altered the results. Each person handles the Manduca sexta in a different manner, mixes the food differently, and cleans the compartments differently. But there were also many consistencies that were positives for the experiment. One of these was that the incubators that were used allowed for constant and regulated living conditions for both of the groups, preventing any abnormalities from arising due to changing conditions. From the results of the experiment, we can reject the null hypothesis. This simply means that the presence of the Aza Guard inhibited molting, which caused the Manduca sexta from growing and maturing. To further any research, there are many other opportunities with hormones that can be manipulated to see if there are any apparent changes within the caterpillars. One experiment could be increase the amount of E20 and JH to see if they caterpillars would go into the different larva stages faster than if they weren’t given any extra hormones at all.
