Title: The effect of an ecdysterone inhibitor on the growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
he purpose of this experiment was to see how inhibiting ecdysterone affects the growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars.  I hypothesized that the caterpillars with the inhibitor would grow at a slower rate than the control group because ecdysterone is a key hormone in the molting stages and growth of the caterpillars.  Two groups of caterpillars were made, one with and one without the inhibitor.  The results showed that the average weight of the experimental group was significantly lower than the control group.  I believe that my hypothesis was supported.  


Introduction:
Hormone signaling is an important biological process in all living creatures because it helps regulate physiology, behavior, and many other life processes.  One hormone found in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar is called ecdysterone and it is very important for the growth and life cycle of the caterpillars (Johnson: 2018).  When the insect is in its caterpillar stage it will regularly go through a phase of molting, called instars.  After enough time, the caterpillar will eventually pupate into an adult moth.  Ecdysterone is extremely important for the timings of these instars and determines when a caterpillar is going to molt.  If the amounts of ecdystrone in the Manduca Sexta are irregular, then the development of the caterpillars can be disturbed.  The reason that Manduca Sexta caterpillars are used in this study is because the development and life cycle of the caterpillars is very easy to monitor.  One study by Champlin and Truman shows that increasing the amount ecdysterone in a Manduca Sexta cell has a relatively small effect, but that completely inhibiting the substance has a much more detrimental effect on the cell (Champlin and Truman: 1998).  Another study by Riddiford shows that limiting the ecdysterone in the Manduca Sexta caterpillars changes the colors of the pupa and makes them a little smaller (Riddiford: 2007).  In this study, the caterpillars will be given an ecdysterone inhibitor called Azaguard.  I hypothesize that any caterpillars given the ecdysterone inhibitor will weigh less and possibly pupate later than the control group of caterpillars.  


Materials and Methods:
• Two groups of Manduca Sexta will be set up, a control group with 4 and an experimental group with 4.   
• 2 caterpillars will be placed in a container and separated by an index card.   
• Each day they caterpillars will be weighed and then given 10g of food with either 10 drops of water, or 10 drops of Azaguard 1:1250. 
• While the caterpillars are not being weighed they will be left in an incubator with 12 hour light/day cycles.  
• The study will last for 8 days and the weights of every caterpillar will be taken every day.
A 2-sample T-test will be performed to determine data significance.  



Results:
On average the masses of the experimental groups seemed to be lower than the masses of the control group.  The two sample t-test gave a p value = 0.0402 which means that the data is significant.  Figure 1 is a graph that shows the average weights of the control group over 8 days.  Figure 2 is a graph that shows the average weights of the experimental group over 8 days.  Figure 3 is a table that shows the values and results of the 2-sample t-test.  In general, the average weights of the control group were much larger than than the average weights of the experimental group. 

Discussion:
I believe that my hypothesis was supported.  The results show that the Manduca Sexta treated with the ecdysterone inhibitor had a statistically lower growth rate than the control group.  The average masses of the control group were much higher than the experimental group.  This data is very similar to the data of other similar experiments such as the ones done by Champlin and Truman as well as the one done by Riddiford.  The first experiment showed that eliminating ecdysterone in a caterpillar cell had an extremely detrimental effect on the cell (Champlin and Truman: 1998).  The latter experiment showed that inhibiting ecdysterone in caterpillar pupa changed their color and made them a little smaller (Riddiford: 2007).  The results of these experiments both support the results from our experiment.  The 2-sample T-test all shows that I am 95% confident that the results are not due to chance.  These results help support the hypothesis developed by our lab group and prove that ecdysterone did have an effect on the caterpillar growth.
