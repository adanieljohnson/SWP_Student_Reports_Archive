Title: Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta Development 

Abstract:
Insect Growth Regulators mimic the effect of JH and can inhibit (Manduca Sexta) development. The experimental goal was to test the effect of Precore on the weight of laravel manduca sexta.  To test this, eight larval( Manduca sexta) were monitored over seven days. Half were given food treated with Precor and the other half’s food was not treated.The hypothesis was that the (manduca sexta) receiving the treated food will be larger than the controll group.  Due to flukes in the procedures, there was no general trend in the data collected. A statistical test was conducted and the alternate hypothesis was rejected. Because of this, the lab was inconclusive.


Introduction:
The (Manduca Sexta)  are moths native to North America, and they a life cycle consisting of eight stages including: egg, first-fifth instar, pupa, and adult moth.The hormones that regulate the insect’s development and molting are Juvenile Hormone and ecdysone.The Juvenile hormone controlls the type of molt, while ecdysterone orchestrates the molt [Riddiford: 2003].  During the first through fourth instar stages, of  the concentration of Juvenile hormone is high, so the instar just molts into another instar. However during the fifth instar stage the concentration of JH drops, so the instar can develop into a pupa and adult. If the concentration of JH is disrupted, then the development of the Manduca is  hindered  and metamorphosis does not occur[Silheck 2000]. Because of this, many scientists use IGR’s (which mimic the effect of JH) to test the effect of different JH concentrations.   Hypothesis: Biological- -null If the (Manduca sexta) consumes food containing Precore, then the growth will not be affected. -Alternate If the (Manduca sexta) consumes food containing Precore, then the weight of the (Manduca sexta) will be larger than the controll.  Statistical- -null The weight will not be statistically different between the controll group and the treated group. -Alternate The weight will be statistically different between the controll group and the treated group.


Materials and Method:
Eight laravel (Manduca Sexta) were selected and divided into two group. Four tubs were then collected and each tub was split in half using a notecard. Each side of each tub was labeled controll or treatment, and one (Manduca Sexta) was place in each half in all four tubs. Each caterpillar labeled controll was prepared 10 grams of food mixed with three drops of water. Each caterpillar labeled treatment was prepared 10 grams of food mixed with three drops of Precore. Every day the caterpillars were weighed, and the weight was recorded in the lab notebook. Each side of each tob was cleaned and the food for each caterpillar was replenished every day as described above. To analyze the data recorded, a t_test was performed on the averages recorded for each group of caterpillars. This tested whether the results were statistically different.  
 Materials: -scale -four tubs with lids -(Manduca Sexta) food -(Manduca Sexta) caterpillars -water -Precor -incubator -notebook cards


Results:
The mean difference of weight for the (Manduca Sexta) in the controll group was 2.215 +/- 2.42 g. The mean for the (Manduca Sexta) in the treatment group was 3.2875 +/- 2.962 g, which was not significently different than the controll (p=0.595, t=0.561).The error bars on Figure two also signify that the two (Manduca Sexta) groups were not significently different due to their overlap. Although the mean difference in weight for the (Manduca Sexta) in the treatment group was about one gram higher (see Figure 1), the P-value of 0.595 shows that these results were not significently different. In both the treatment of controll group all but one caterpillar in each group lost weight (Figure 1). The largest differences were recorded in the treatment group with caterpillar 4  and 1 gaining the most weight (Figure 1). 


Discussion:
Based on the statistical analysis of the data collected, the null hypothesis was accepted due to the p_value of 0.595 with six degrees of freedom. Because the p_value is above 0.05, the results can be interpreted as a result of the randomness of nature, not a result of the Precor IGR. These skewed results are an effect of a misinterpretation of the procedures. The Manduca Sexta were not fed everyday, and their tubs were not cleaned out every time they were massed. This explains the main outliers in the data in which controll caterpillar 2 and treatment caterpillar 4 lost weight. These caterpillars’ food source was not replenished, and they most likely lost weight due to starvation. Several of the caterpillars also broke through the notecard divider and remained on the same side of a caterpillars in a different group. Because of this, some caterpillars received a mixture of treated food and controll food which contributed to the randomness of the results. Without these flukes in the execution of the procedures, the results would most likely be consistent with an experiment produced by other scientists in which the methoprene inhibited the emergence of adult Manduca Sexta and resulted in supernumerary instar. [Beckage 1981]. These previously published studies show that IGR’s can be used as a way of inhibiting the emergence of harmful adult pests in agriculture by inhibiting metamorphosis and indirectly harming the caterpillar’s sensory functions [Staal 1975]. Although the recorded data did not support the information mentioned in the introduction, previous studies prove the information aforementioned.In order to perfect this experiment, the flukes that impacted this experiment should have been non-existent. Without the flukes in this experiment, the procedure would have most likely been successful and conclusive.
