Title: The Effect of Light and Dark Environments On the Root: Shoot Ratio of Fagopyrum Esculentum and the Confirmation of the Hypothesis that Light Deprived Plants Have a Lower Ratio

Abstract:
Plants receive the necessary light energy to carry out the biological processes of life through their chloroplasts. The chloroplasts are found in the shoot of the plant, which then transfer that light into energy that is dispersed throughout the plant. Our experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that plants in a light deprived environment will require longer shoots to more effectively absorb any existing light, thereby having a lower root: shoot ratio than a plant in a light rich environment. In order to test this hypothesis, we planted multiple  Fagopyrum Esculentum plants in light-rich and light deprived environments and allowed them to grow for two weeks. At the end of the two week period, we collected all the plants and recorded their growth. Our hypothesis was confirmed, as the plants growing in a dark environment had lower root: shoot ratios.

Introduction:
Plants only have a limited amount of size and energy that they can devote to the completion of necessary biological processes. Plants absorb nutrients necessary to growth through their roots, and harvest light energy through their shoots. ATP is the  plant’s basic unit of energy, and chloroplasts found within the shoot are responsible for converting light to ATP. They achieve this through the Thylakoid Membrane. The Thylakoid Membrane is found in Chloroplasts, and they contain many important proteins responsible for the conversion of light energy to ATP. Chlorophyll is one of the most notable light-capturing and converting proteins found within the Chloroplast.  (Lodish H, 43) These proteins are found in the plant’s shoot, so clearly a longer shoot will contain more proteins. In an environment devoid of light, plants will need to allocate their resources accordingly. In order to harvest what minimal light may exist, they will allocate a majority of their length to the collection of light energy. This detracts from the size of the roots. 

Materials and Method:
The necessary materials for the completion of this lab include at least 20 Fagopyrum Esculentum plants, soil, water, and a light-rich and light deprived environment in which the plants can grow.
1.	Place the plants, divided equally, in light-rich and light deprived environments.
2.	Over the course of two weeks, water the plants daily.
3.	When the two week period is over, harvest the plants.
4.	Separate the shoots from the roots, carefully pat them dry, and measure the length and weight of each group.
5.	Record your data.


Results:
Fagopyrum Esculentum plants growing in a light rich environment had a mean root: shoot length ratio of .733 with a standard deviation of .109. Plants grown in an environment deprived of light had a mean root: shoot length ratio .596 with a standard deviation of .062.

Discussion:
Our results ultimately confirmed the hypothesis that plants growing in a light deprived environment will require longer shoots in order to harvest the necessary light energy for growth. This experiment is very telling about the environmental effect on the biological makeup of plants and the competitive nature of plant growth. Allocation of necessary resources is a biological decision that all organisms face every day. Plants must continually adjust to resource availability and the rate at which their Roots and Shoots grow throughout their lifetime vary greatly. (Price, 155)
