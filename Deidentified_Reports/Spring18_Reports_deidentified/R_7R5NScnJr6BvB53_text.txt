Title: Plant Resource Allocation in Differing Light Conditions

Abstract:
Our initial goal in this experiment was to determine if there was a significant difference in plant growth under two different light conditions. Considering that most plants are grown under traditional clear light, we hypothesized that blue light would have a significant effect on the size of the plant during the growth process. We set up an experiment using the same type of Vigna radiate for each condition. We watered both plants with the same amount of water for a two-week period, with the only difference being the color of the film that was draped over each category for their designated light condition. In the end, we found that our results did not fully support our hypothesis. We seemed to be in the middle of rejecting our null and accepting an alternative hypothesis. The data supported that there was not a significant difference in the overall size of the plants, only that the root: shoot ratio was noticeably higher in the plants that were grown with the normal colorless light. In comparison, the plants under blue light did grow to a slightly larger size than those under clear. 

Introduction:
Plants allocate their resources differently based on a variety of factors, light conditions being a major one. In an article published by American Journal of Botany, it is said that "light level is, however, significantly correlated with patch location, average plant size and average patch SRE" (Pitelka et al. 1980). For this lab we tested¬¬ how plants allocate their resources in different light conditions. We chose this experiment because, a steady energy resource is essential to the growth and survival of a plant. Just like other factors that affect growth, plants are capable of adapting to the availability of resources around them. If there is a low light resource for example, plants are able to make the necessary changes in order to put them in the best position for survival. An article in Ecology noted that "… plants respond to variation in the environment by partitioning biomass among various plant organs to optimize the capture of nutrients, light, water, and carbon dioxide in a manner that maximizes plant growth rate" (McConnaughay and Coleman 1999).
We hypothesize that the plants grown under clear light will have a lower root to shoot ratio than those grown under blue light. I predict that the blue light condition will serve as a more effective energy resource versus the plants grown under clear light. 


Materials and Methods:
This test will be conducted using two categories of Vigna radiate, or mung bean plants. One grown using blue light, and one with traditional clear light. We began by planting seeds for six plants total, three plants for each light condition. After planting our seeds in the soil, and watering them, we then draped blue film over the first set of three, and clear film over the other set. Placing both sets under an unfiltered lamp is more than sufficient, but in our case, we used a greenhouse. We faithfully watered the plants daily for two weeks, with the exception of one day on the weekends. The amount of water for each plant varied depending how dry they appeared, but in general we used the spay nozzle for roughly 10 seconds on each of the 6 plant pots. We also used the "mist" setting on the water nozzle so that the soil was not ejected from the pots while watering. Most importantly, after each time that we watered, we recovered the plants with their appropriate film to ensure they were receiving their appropriate light. 
After the two-week period, we gathered our six plant pots together, and started our measurements. For the plants grown under the blue light condition, we organized 3 groups of 3-6 "individual" plants from each of the 3 pots for a total of 9 groups. We repeated this step for the plants grown under clear light. Next, we measured the mass of each of the groups in grams. We then compiled our data to calculate a mean and standard deviation for all nine groups. Lastly, we used these statistics to test our hypothesis with a two-sample t test along with a bar graph. Our independent variable was the blue and clear light conditions, while the growth of the plants was the dependent variable.  


Results:
According to our results, there was not a significant difference between the mean of plant masses under both light conditions. The difference was only a few hundredths of a gram, the blue being 2.513333333 grams, and the clear light being 2.495555556 grams. Our graph below provides a visual to just how close the means actually were in grams (Figure 1). The two-sample t test we conducted supported this notion with a t-value of 0.07767 grams and a p-value of 0.941821. 

Here we analyzed our data another way by observing the root: shoot ratio (Figure 2). This was done by dividing the means of our root masses by the means of our shoot masses. This ratio supported a different result from the first instance. Here the Vigna radiate seemed to have better growth under clear light. We also found the t-value for this ratio to be 1.160216 and the p-value to be 0.310491. The plants grown in clear light served as our control group in this study, while the plants under blue light were our test group. 

Discussion:
After conducting this study, I would say that our results only partially supported our initial hypothesis of the plants under blue light growing larger than those under clear. Our collection of t-tests supported that there was not a drastic difference between the mass of both plant categories, meaning that the difference in light color did not have a huge significance on the physical size of the two Vigna radiate. The results do however support that the plants grown under clear light had a higher root: shoot ratio over blue plants, inferring that the plants grown under this condition may be more equipped to take in resources for survival. If the plants grown under clear light have more shoots than those under blue, we could predict that the clear will have a better chance of absorbing light through their shoots, where photosynthesis also takes place.
