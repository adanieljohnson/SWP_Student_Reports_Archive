Title: Effects of Green, Red, and Blue light on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia Oleracea

Abstract:
Most plants grow under a white light, a combination of all different visible lights. The question that we try to answer involves how the individual visible lights affect the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia Oleracea. Our claim that green light and blue light will inhibit the rate of photosynthesis the most compared to red light because of the colors of chloroplasts and DCPIP. Since the chloroplasts are green and DCPIP is blue, those respective lights will reflect a lot of the energy. Doing three trials under each light, we were able to get a percent change in the absorbance of the solution that the ANOVA statistical analysis said had overall significent difference. This means that the different colors influence the rate of photosynthesis. The implications of these results mean that plant caretakers have to be weary of the type of light used to grow the plants. 

Introduction:
Light is an important aspect when it comes to the process of photosynthesis. It is the energy that jumpstarts the process and keeps on powering it. Energy from the light, or more specifically the photons, are used to take the electrons from the water molecules and use them within the plant’s photosystems in the thylakoid membrane; this is called an electron transport chain [Goodsell, 2004]. Harvesting the light, plants can create glucose, their food source. Plants usually use white light, whether from the sun or indoor lights. Could the rate of photosynthesis decrease if only one color was used on a plant? Visible light creates color based on a materials ability to absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light. A material can absorb many wavelengths of light except for a specific range, that range determines the color, which is then reflected into the eyes of the observer [NASA, 2010]. When looking at denim jeans, the denim absorbs all wavelengths besides blue which is the color we see because it is the wavelength reflected. The spinach used is green, which means it will reflect green light; which leads me to believe that the green light used will severally inhibit photosynthesis rate. DCPIP also has a blue color and using the same reasoning will also inhibit the rate of photosynthesis. White light and red light will not inhibit the rate because they contain wavelengths that the chloroplasts can absorb. 

Materials and Method:
Cool a mortar and pestle and a beaker in ice. Remove large central veins from 4 medium sized Spinacia Oleracea. Add the leaves to the cool mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer and grind the leaves. Add 10 more Ml of grinding buffer and filter the chunks with cheesecloth. Transfer the liquid to a centrifuge tube and spin for 2 min at 1200 rpm. Place the supernatant into a second centrifuge and spin for 10 min at 2800 rpm. Label 13 test tubes. The 1st test tube will be the blank, so it will only have water. The other 12 test tubes are all identical in content: 6 Ml of water, 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts made, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Blank the spectrophotometer and measure the absorbance of the 12 test tubes. 
Three test tubes will go under each of the white, blue, green, and red lights. Every 10 min (for a total of 30 min) the absorbance will be measured.An ANOVA was used to get the statistic data. The conclusion will be based on the percent change in absorbance. This is due to the DCPIP getting reduced during photosynthesis. The greater the rate of photosynthesis,  the more reduced DCPIP becomes, making the solution clearer. 



Results:
The results from the experiment show that blue and green light have slowed the rate of photosynthesis when compared to rate of photosynthesis under white or red light. The solutions under the white and red light showed a 97.4% and 96.3% change in absorbance. Which means the DCPIP was reduced at a high rate, which indicates a high rate of photosynthesis. The blue and green light had an 88.2% and 82.9% change which indicates a lesser rate of photosynthesis when compared to chloroplasts under the white and red lights. Using the ANOVA statistical test, the data achieved a value of 0.03 which is less than 0.05. This means there is a significent difference and we can reject the null hypothesis. 

Discussion:
Based on the graph, the color of light does influence the rate of photosynthesis. Since DCPIP gets reduced during photosynthesis and thus starts losing its blue color. The opaquer the solution was, the more the rate of photosynthesis was inhibited. Measuring it with the spectrophotometer gives proof. The white light solutions were the controll, which means the 97.4% change is the benchmark used to compare the percent change in the other lights. The red light had no significent difference based on the ANOVA statistical analysis from the white light with a 96.3% change, meaning the red light used was able to excite the electrons out of the water molecules and perform photosynthesis with no inhibition [Goodsell, 2004]. The blue light had the second to lowest percent change with 88.2%. This is due to the fact the DCPIP had a blue color, reflecting some of the blue light back which means there is less energy to excite the electrons. Despite this, there is not a significent difference based on the ANOVA statistical analysis between the blue light solutions and from either the white or red light. Though there is a significent difference between the green light and the white light meaning that the green light’s 82.9% change is clearly different from white light’s 97.4% change. This is because the green chloroplasts reflect a lot of the green light back, which means less energy to conduct photosynthesis [NASA, 2010]. Based on this data we can conclude that green light inhibits the rate of photosynthesis compared to white light. A paper on this subject agrees that green light is not a good light to grow plants because of the green coloring of chloroplasts. The authors state that the green light would be reflected off, thus inhibiting photosynthesis [Terashima, 2009]. Possible errors can come from having the fluorescent lights adding more lights from the room’s ceiling. To make this experiment better it is best to use lights with equal intensities. The different color lights, unfortunately, have different intensities based on the bulb. There should be no overhead light when doing it as well since that introduces different lights to solutions that should only have one. The wider implications of this assay would allow those who take care of plants (farmers, gardeners, greenhouse workers, etc.) to be mind.f.ul of the lights they use for the plants so that they may grow healthier.
