Title: Oat plants demonstrate no significent difference with the effect of salinity

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to see how salinity affects the root to shoot ratio of weight and length measurements of the oat plant. My hypothesis is that there will be a difference in the root to shoot ratios of weight and length because salinity will stunt the growth in the experimental group. Through a two-sample t test it was concluded that there was no significent difference from the data that was collected. Through this experiment it can be demonstrated that salinity doesn't have an affect but in the greater outlook within environment we can potentially demonstrate that certain irrigation systems wouldn't have much of an affect out the outlook of crop production. 

Introduction:
Many plants allocate their biological structures based off of their resources. We will be experimentally determining how salinity affects the root to shoot ratios of weight and length measurements of the oat plant, Avena sativa. The root to shoot ratio is the ratio of the weight or length of the shoot or root. The root is defined as the structure that is below the grown that is responsible for anchoring the plant, absorbs water and minerals, and stores food. The shoot is defined as what is above the ground which produces sugars by photosynthesis.  By using the root to shoot ratio we are able to see how the plants allocate their resources based off of the resources that are available to them. 

Salinity hinders the ability of plants to take up water which causes reductions in the  growth rate of both the shoot and root of a plant [Munns: 2002].  In a study published by B.L. Haines and E.L Dunn in 1976 concluded that growth and resource allocation response in the Spartina alterniflora to three levels of NH4-N, Fe, and NaCl in solution resulted in a decrease in shoot to root ratio and a decrease in resource allocation to the root production with an increase in the independent variables (NaCl) [Naines & Dunn: 1976]. Incorporating this information with the lab that we are conducting it could indicates that there will be a difference in the ratio of root to shoot because of an allocation to the root or shoot to compensate for the salinity stress within the plants biological system. My hypothesis is that there will be a difference in the ratios of the controll and experiment's weight and height because the plants will allocate their resources because of the salinity within their water. 


Materials and Method:
We obtained four squared pots and filled them with soil up to the rim and then planted oat seeds in all the pots. Making sure to cover most of the area with seeds. Then we labeled two as controll's (the ones that we wouldn't test with NaCl water) and the other two as experimental. Next, we watered all pots with 50 Ml of miracle grow. We then watered all 4 pots with 100 Ml of water in each pot then lastly placing them in the greenhouse. For the next two weeks, as a group, we took turns watering the controll with 100Ml of water and the experimental with 100 Ml of 1.3g/L NaCl concentrated water every day. After the two weeks we determined the R:S ratio's by measuring and weighing the roots and shoots separately of 5 individual plants from the NaCl watered pot and the controll's pot. We entered our weights and lengths into a spread sheet that computed the results of a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. 

Results:
There was no significent difference between the R:S heights in figure 1 (t_stat=2.02, d.f.= 8, p= 0.07). There was also no significent difference between the R:S weights in the groups (t_stat=0.70. d.f.=8, p_value=0.51). Within figure 1 the controll had a greater average with 1.098g. In figure 2 the controll had a larger average with 0.434 g. 

Discussion:
In conclusion, there was no significent difference in length/height R:S length at 0.0786, we accept the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the means and conclude that a significent difference does not exist. This was the same as the weight ratio's p_value of 0.5059, resulting in accepting the null hypothesis and concluding that there is no significent difference. Although there was a difference in average R:S ratios between the controll and experiment that cannot conclude our overall results. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Salinity did not in fact have an effect, in this experiment, with how plants allocate their resources. This could also potentially mean that the concentration of salt wasn't high enough to make a difference in how the plants allocated their shoot or root weight/height. Another fact to take into consideration is that we didn't water the plants enough and the salinity couldn't take enough effect on the plants. Another thing to note about the reasoning for the hypothesis is the fact that the research I did was not similar to what we did with our plants, the plant that B. L. Haines and E. L Dunn used was a plant accustomed to saltwater marshes [Haines & Dunn: 1976]. They also used different concentrations of salt whereas we just used one concentration throughout or study. 

For future experiments, we could study the breaking point of salinity that can be used to water with till the plants' growth starts to stunt. This study can be used to help those farmers who irrigate their crops with salt water or from a local lake.   The reason we are testing this out is because all over the world there is an irrigation issue with a higher concentration in salinity within irrigation and that can overall affect the growth of the plants and potentially hurt the farmers who are irrigating the crops. Salinity affects around 7% of all the world land area, where many people grow crops. [Munns: 2002] Another aspect of this experiment is the tolerance that the oat plants have on salinity which could be the reason for the results having no significent difference in average R:S values. This experiment can determine if a certain concentration of salt can truly affect the outcome of growth in plants. Therefore determining if there needs to be a reduction of the spread of salinization or to increase the salt tolerance of high-yielding crops which is an important global issue [Munns: 2002] Within an experiment that tested the effects of salt concentrations on crop yield production concluded that salinity stress did have a great effect on crop transpiration and also the grain yields on the particular plant were reduced due to salinity stress[Wang, Liu, Yang, Huang, Yao: 2017]. Another point to mention is that this experiment's results showed that by increasing per saline water irrigation amounts is an effective way to reduce the water use efficiency under the low rainfall seasons, meaning that this form of irrigation can be beneficial when there is low rainfall. [Wang, Liu, Yang, Huang, Yao: 2017].
