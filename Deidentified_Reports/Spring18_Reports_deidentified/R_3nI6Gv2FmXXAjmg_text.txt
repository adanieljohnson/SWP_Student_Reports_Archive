Title: The Effect of an Acetylcholine Inhibitor on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
Calcium binds to the protein covering the binding sites on the actin and this is what causes the contraction of the muscle. If we were to inhibit the uptake of AcH, then the muscle contraction in a frog gastrocnemus muscle would be hindered or stopped completely. We tested the minimal threshold for contraction of the untreated muscle, then we treated the muscle with .1 Ml of 5 % SEVIN, an AcH inhibitor.  A paired t_test was done. The p_value for the minimum applied voltage is .422 and the p_value for the contraction voltage is .0234. In conclusion, the experiment was a statistical success and proved our hypothesis.

Introduction:
Mobility is essentially to life on earth. If you can move, you can eat and thrive. Even plants move and grow, but they do not use muscles to do so. Animals, on the other hand do use muscles to ambulate. Generally, there are three types of muscle fibers: Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. Smooth muscle lines the inside of the organs and the cardiac muscle is found in the heart. Skeletal muscle provides the force for mobility in multicellular organisms that are motile. For example, if you were to move your arm up and down you know that your muscle is what provides that motion. You contract your bicep to move your arm upward and contract your triceps to reverse that movement. According to Sommacal, the twitch fiber of a muscle affects the level of fatigue and tetany (Sommacal). Rania pipiens is the organism used in our experiment. The frog has a dark green skin with strong leg muscles for contraction. 
	To actually contract, there are base units in your muscles called sarcomeres. These sarcomeres have two main filaments, actin and myosin. The actin has myosin binding sites where the myosin can bind and pull the actin but the binding sites are covered by another protein. Acetylcholine (AcH) is the neurotransmitter released where the neurons meet the sarcomeres, and AcH facilitates the release of Calcium. Calcium binds to the protein covering the binding sites on the actin and this is what causes the contraction of the muscle. If we were to inhibit the uptake of AcH, then the muscle contraction in a frog gastrocnemus muscle would be hindered or stopped completely.


Materials and Method:
To begin with, we degloved and exposed the sciatic nerve on three frog muscles. We then separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone. Then we attached a string to each of the separated gastrocnemus muscles with a loop at the top to attach to a stand with only the muscle suspended in the air. We then tested the minimal threshold for contraction of the untreated muscle, then we treated the muscle with .1 Ml of 5 % SEVIN, an AcH inhibitor. The minimal threshold for contraction was found for the treated leg, and this process was repeated for the other two legs. The test we will be using is a paired t_test, because each frog leg is its own controll and treatment.

Results:
A paired t_test was done. The p_value for the minimum applied voltage is .422 and the p_value for the contraction voltage is .0234.
	The values for all the tests were slightly less for the treatment sections than the controll for all o the tests. There were two things that were tested in the experiment: The minimum applied voltage and three peaks for the contraction voltage per frog leg. Both were used in tandem to establish the relationship between the controll and the treatment. The treatment could affect either of these, meaning that the treatment could raise or lower the minimal applied threshold and the treatment could raise or lower the contraction voltage seen. The treatment raised the minimal applied threshold for treatment two and lowered the contraction voltage for the average of all three controlls.


Discussion:
	The t_test shows that the difference in the applied voltage is not relevant to the experiment, as seen by a value of .422. This is over .05 and is considered not vital to the experiment. The t_test for the muscle contraction voltage is relevant however. With a p_value of .0234, which is lower than .05, we see that the treatment influenced the contraction voltage of the frog. This means that while the applied threshold was not influenced by the treatment in a significent way, the contraction voltage was influenced in a significent way.
The first leg only had one stimulus applied to it, due to our error, but the minimal threshold stayed the same and the contraction voltage was decreased, table 1 and figure 1. The second leg had an increase in the applied stimulus and a decrease in the contraction voltage (table 1 and figure 1), and the third leg had the minimal applied voltage be the same and the contraction voltage be less than the controll (table 1 and figure 1).
	In experiment two, the increase in applied voltage could be the cause of the treatment making it harder for the muscle cells uptake acetylcholine. An explanation for the change is that the muscle could experience a different threshold movement at various times, so in the different test we might have seen a need for different applied voltages. All the experiments experienced a decrease in the contraction volume, and this could also be a result of the decrease of the uptake of acetylcholine.  These are a statistically significent change between the controll and the treatment. 
As a side note, the muscles could have been experiencing a fatigue and therefore exhibiting the change that we see. That is important to consider. According to Sommacal, fatiguing of the muscles would have caused a need for more voltage in the second leg, and resulted in less stimulation of the muscles. This would have produces lower contraction readings. These might not have happened, but they are possibilities that need consideration.
In conclusion, the experiment was a statistical success and proved our hypothesis.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: This is an average of the contraction voltages of all of the experiments. Note: The first leg only had one stimulus applied to both the treatment and the controll, so this value is the one value that was recorded for the leg and is not actually an average, the data just needed to be depicted together. This was included to show the comparison between the contraction voltage for the treatment and the contraction voltage for the controll. This does not include the applied stimulus. Numerically, you can see that each leg decreased.
Figure 1: All of the controlls averaged together in comparison to all of the treatments averaged together. This is for Contraction voltage, not the applied voltage. It can be seen from the averages that the legs’ contractions decreased after being treated with an acetylcholine inhibitor.
