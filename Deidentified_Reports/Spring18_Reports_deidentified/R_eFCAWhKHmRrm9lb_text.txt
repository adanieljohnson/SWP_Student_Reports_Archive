Title: The Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
	This experiment led to see how Precor would affect the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta, while tiny, are significent in the way that they can ruin crops. These little insects are pests and need to be treated as so, however it needs to be done effectively and with minimal toxicity damage to the crops. This effectivity can be achieved with the use of Insect Growth Regulator, which are less toxic and more poised at the goal of preventing the insect from surviving. Precor, a known Insect Growth Regulator was used in this experiment to see whether it’d be effective or not. The Precor was mixed into 40 grams of caterpillar food which was divided equally among four caterpillars. The other four caterpillars received the same amount of food, but mixed with water. It was hypothesized that Precor would not correlate with growth of the Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis however was rejected as the group of caterpillars that was given Precor grew more than the group given regular food. A few trends noted in the experiment were that the treatment worms weighed more on average, caterpillar G, a member of the treatment group, was consistently larger, and that the controll group weight increased at a slower rate. Because of the superior growth of the treatment group, it can be deduced that Precor prom

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, or otherwise known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that pertains to the Order Lepidoptera. The Order Lepidoptera houses all butterflies, moths, and skippers. The Manduca Sexta, aside from pertaining to the Order Lepidoptera, Manduca Sexta also pertains to the general classification of the broad term “pest”. This is because the Manduca Sexta is detrimental to crops. The Manduca Sexta has a relatively short lifespan in the eyes of humans, as it’s life only spans on an average of from 39 to 48 days. The life cycle of the Manduca Sexta can be classified as a holometabolous life cycle, as the Manduca Sexta begins as an egg and develops into an adult. This developmental process is pushed by hormones.
	The main hormones in Manduca Sexta that help propel it towards the next steps in its life are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. The main purpose of Juvenile Hormone is to regulate the type of molt that the Manduca Sexta will undergo. Juvenile Hormone is produced in the Corpus Allata, a pair of glands that are located on any side of the foregut. Ecdysterone is a type of steroid hormone. The main purpose of Ecdysterone is to regulate the timing of the molting. Ecdysterone is secreted in the Prothoracic Glands, which are located in the back of the head and the thorax.
The other main type of hormone that is located in insects is the Brain Hormone. The main purpose of the brain hormone is to regulate the release of Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Brain Hormone is mainly produced in the Corpus Cardiacum, which is located in the brain of the insect. 
The hormones all work in conjunction in order to help the insect develop properly. If either were to be tampered with heavily, the insect would result in dying. However, tampering significently with either could yield different changes as well. There are many chemicals that can cause a fluctuation in the balance of Juvenile Hormone and and Ecdysterone, one main one being Precor. 
The main use of Precor is for pest controll. It is a commodity on the market that can be ordered online or bought in convenience stores. Precor is an example of an Insect Growth Regulator. The purpose of Insect Growth Regulators are to offer a substitution to harmful pesticides. Pesticides can harm the crops they are aiming to protect from pests whereas Insect Growth Regulators are less harmful and aim to prevent the insect from surviving. 
As an Insect Growth Regulator, Precor may have a plethora of effects on Manduca Sexta. The purpose of this experiment is to see the effects that Precor may have on Manduca Sexta, whether it be inhibiting or promoting growth. It can be hypothesized however, that precor will lead to the Manduca Sexta not taking a longer period of time to molt, and would not molt at an abnormal rate, if exposed to an Insect Growth Regulator that limits Juvenile Hormone, such as Precor.

Materials and Method:
First, gather eight caterpillars. After that, weigh each caterpillar in grams and then separate the caterpillars into two groups of four, one will be controll and one will be treatment. The next step will be to retrieve 80 grams of caterpillar food, which will be distributed in equal portions of 10 grams to each caterpillar. The 80 grams must be split into 40 grams, in order to mix the first batch of 40 grams with 20 drops of distilled water and the second bath with 20 drops of Precor. Finally, weigh each caterpillar everyday for seven consecutive days and take a record of the weight.

Results:
The T value in the Two Sample T Test performed is 1.135685. The standard deviation in the controll group is 0.737609822 and the standard deviation in the treatment group is 0.558159774. The P value is .299408 and the degrees of freedom is 6.



Discussion:
The Null Hypothesis that precor will lead to the Manduca Sexta not taking a longer period of time to molt, and would not molt at an abnormal rate, if exposed to an Insect Growth Regulator that limits Juvenile Hormone, such as Precor is rejected. It can be deduced that the Precor led to an increase of growth in the caterpillars as the average weight of the treatment group was greater than the average weight of the controll weight. Observations made on the caterpillars include quantitative data. The quantitative data includes information on the horns of the Manduca Sexta. Caterpillar A had no horn, caterpillar B had a very small horn, caterpillar C had a large horn, caterpillar D had a large and curvy horn, caterpillar E had a medium horn, caterpillar F had a medium and curved horn, caterpillar G had a very small horn, and caterpillar H had the largest horn and a curvy horn. The only errors made during the experiment were that day two and day five were missed. Even though we missed these days we were still able to maintain a consistent amount of data because we still recorded the other days and did not leave a large enough gap to skewer results.
