Title: How Methoprene Effects the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Abstract:
 In this experiment we looked at how the process of Juvenile Hormone and 20E affects the Manduca sexta caterpillars. To do this, we utilized the chemical compound Methoprene. Methoprene is a compound that is known to mirror the affects of Juvenile Hormone, JH, when introduced inside the body of insects. JH is found in all insects where it has the role of regulating growth and development of the insect. We believe that by adding Methoprene into the food source of a selected group of caterpillars we can effectively keep them in their instar stages while having them grow abnormally large. We tested this by using two groups of four Manduca sexta. One group was the controll and the other was the test group. Other than food their environments were kept the same through incubation. We found that statistically the mean average weight between the controll group and the test group was not significently different. However, most organisms from the controll group grew larger than the testing group. From this we concluded that our null hypothesis was supported by the data. The methoprene keeps the insects in adolescent stages but does not make them just grow larger in these stages.



Introduction:
Introduction:
In this lab we are studying the effects of hormones on the Manduca sexta. More commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm this insect has around a fifty-day life span. During this time, it will evolve from the egg stage up through instar stages, then complete its cycle by molting into an adult moth. The Manduca sexta was the perfect organism to preform this experiment with. In the research world of insects, the tobacco hornworm is known as the white rat of insect endocrinology (Riddiford, 2016). It allowed us to begin to look at and understand how JH and 20E action correspond with each other. Firstly, the juvenile hormone controlls the rate at which the animal molts. The fifty-day life cycle of the Manduca sexta is also long enough for us to be able to observe any noticeable changes in the caterpillar once the experiment starts. The independent variable would be that of the methoprene. By adding methoprene into the food source we expect to see a change in the dependent variable. This would be a change in growth or weight of the Manduca sexta due to the JH analogue methoprene being introduced into the animal’s system.
This experiment will be focusing on two chemical compounds, Juvenile Hormone and Methoprene. Juvenile Hormone controlls the roles in the regulation of metamorphosis and reproduction inside of all insects (Riddiford, 2016). It is responsible for keeping the Manduca sexta in its adolescent form. Methoprene is a chemical compound that mimics the effects of Juvenile hormone. Both compounds, Methoprene and JH, work by allowing the 20E to initiate molting but prevents its actions in switching genetic programs to allow for metamorphosis ( Riddiford, 2016). Since methoprene preforms as a mirror to the juvenile hormone, would it be possible to keep the tobacco hornworm in the instar stages, having them grow bigger, without letting them become full adult moths? We decided to test this by altering the levels of methoprene in the Manduca sexta through their food. By doing this we believe that we will be able to make the Manduca sexta grow abnormally large while keeping it from adulthood.



Materials and Method:
Materials and Method:
We selected 8 different Manduca sexta that looked around the same size and weighed them. We then divided the eight caterpillars into two groups of 4. From there we labeled for 4 plastic containers. Two were marked controll and two were marked test. We put two Manduca sexta into each container. We utilized index cards to split the containers in half making it where each caterpillar had its own side in the container. From there we mixed the different foods for the caterpillars The four caterpillars in the controll containers received a diet of regular caterpillar food mix. The test caterpillars had a separated diet. We added a 10% concentration of precor (methoprene) into the food mixture of the testing caterpillars, forty drops of this was added into the food. After mixing the food we added it inside of the corresponding caterpillar containers. Test subjects got food with methoprene, controll subjects got regular mixtures of food. From this point we put the lids back on the containers and kept all the caterpillars inside of the same incubator. Each day over a period of 7 days a group member comes to record data and the results.  
This experiment was carried out utilizing the insect Manduca sexta. This insect was collected and distributed to us by the staff of our Wake Forest Bio Lab. During our experiment we maintained the insects by keeping them in the controllled environment of an incubator. As for food the controll organisms were feed with regular caterpillar food. The test specimens were given the same food mixture but with 40 drops of 10% methoprene concentration added in. We compared the test group to the controll group to measure differences, also a  two sample T-test was used to track results.



Results:
From looking at the data collected methoprene does have some type of effect on the growth cycle of the Manduca Sexta. In each the controll group and the treatment group there was one caterpillar that did not develop in size as quickly as the others. Looking at Figure 1. We can see that the group treated with methoprene had an overall smaller mean weight change. We noted a difference between the weights of the treated caterpillars and our controll group. By the end of the experiment the controll group had an average weight of 2.0404g ± 1.0966 sd, while the treatment group had an average weight of 1.766g ± 0.8672 sd showing that on average the treatment group was smaller. Even so, the T-test ran with the data shows that there is not a statistical significance between the mean of the controll group compared to the treated group (t_stat = 1.004, d.f. = 62, P = 0.31882).

Discussion:
In this experiment we set out on a journey that involved the processes of metamorphosis and growth. We intended to look at the relationship of and deepen our current understanding of JH action at the molecular level inside of the Manduca sexta, Tabacco Hornworm (Riddiford, 2016). The hypothesis we set out to test was proven incorrect. We could not make the caterpillars grow abnormally large while staying in the adolescent stages. On the other hand, we found that the compound methoprene does have an influence on the insects, but statistically speaking it is not significent. Even so, we did successfully keep every caterpillar from molting and metamorphosizing. This is because 20E is responsible for the onset of and start of metamorphosis in insects, whereas exposure to 20E and JH, methoprene in this experiment, would maintain the larval state (Riddiforn, 2016). The methoprene is an analogue for Juvenile hormone so it makes sense that the maturation of the caterpillars would be slowed and that no extra weight would be gained. This is especially true due to the fact that we only exposed the caterpillars to methoprene. 
Firstly, the average weight of the controll group was 2.0404 grams ± 1.0966 sd while the test group’s average weight was 1.766 ± 0.8672 sd. It is also important to note that one caterpillar in the treatment section ended smaller than it started. Being that methoprene acts as a mirror to the Juvenile Hormone it would make sense for the tested caterpillars to grow slower. The methroprene helps to keep the caterpillar in the instar stages, it does not help it to gain weight. Originally we knew that methoprene would have some type of effect on the caterpillars, even so, we believed that it would allow the caterpillar to grow bigger while keeping it adolescent. By doing this experiment we merely just kept the Manduca sexta younger than normal. Also, mistakes in the experimental design and plan may have caused some variance. Firstly, we used index cards to separate spaces for each caterpillar. This was because each caterpillar had a set amount of food distributed to them. It was noted that some caterpillars found their way to the other sides of the containers, and many times some food sources were being eaten faster than what they should have. We also didn’t add any extra food for them. This may have caused some of our caterpillars to lack nutrients for a period. This would explain the drop-in weight on the last day for most of the organisms.  Even though our hypothesis was proven incorrect some good discoveries did come from this experiment. Since the average weight of the treated caterpillars was lower than those of the controll group we might say that methoprene effectively keeps the insects smaller and adolescent longer. This would be useful because that would mean methoprene could be used as an insecticide in places with high moth populations. It would keep the caterpillar population down meaning less adult moths. However, these statements are not totally true. The statistics show that there really is not a significent difference between the controll group and test group. This would be in favor of the statistical null hypothesis and would suggest that methoprene does not have that big of an affect on the insect.
