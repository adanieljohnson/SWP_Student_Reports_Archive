Title: Effect of mycorrhizal inoculant on resource allocation Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus.

Abstract:
Selective pressures cause organism to make certain trade-offs. The limitation of these resources in the environment significantly impacts the growth pattern of plants, one example of this is resource allocation. The ratio of the biomass of the roots compared to the ratio of the biomass of the shoots, which are the stems and leaves of the plant, can be used as a measure of resource allocation called the R:S (root: shoot) ratio. Our alternative hypothesis was that the R:S ratio of the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would be lower compared to the control radish plants, since the inoculant would work symbiotically, thus causing resources to be allocated to the shoots. To test this, we planted and grew six different pots of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus radish plants, three of them treated with the myceorrizal inoclunat, the other three forming the control group. We then measured their R:S ratio in relation to mass and length. Our experiment resulted in somewhat conflicted data,  with the R:S ratio in relation to mass, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the control group, 0.269 +/- 0.0128, is lower than that of the experimental group, 0.288 +/- 0.0378, (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.461). However, R:S ratio in relation

to length, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the control group 1.933 +/- 0.149, is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.004).

Plants have differing patterns of phenotypic variation based on both biotic and abiotic factors. Most intra-specific and inter-specific plant interactions, which are biotic factos, are influenced by the plants ability to obtain essential nutrients. These include sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and soil nutrients. Roots serve as the primary absorptive organ for plants and also anchor the plant to the soil below the ground. Leaves are used mainly as a way to capture sunlight through the chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Stems are the supporting structure of the shoot, which are the above-ground parts of the plant. It is impossible for an organism to extract all the resources available in all conditions. Selective pressures cause organism to make certain trade-offs. The limitation of these resources in the environment significantly impacts the growth pattern of plants, one example of this is resource allocation. The ratio of the biomass of the roots compared to the ratio of the biomass of the shoots, which are the stems and leaves of the plant, can be used as a measure of resource allocation called the R:S (root: shoot) ratio. The length of the roots compared to that of the shoots can also be used to measure the resource allocation of the plant. Increased allocation of resources to the leaves because of plentiful light and soil nutrients causes the plant to grow faster. If soil water and nutrients in the soil are scarce resources will be allocated to the roots. To test this thinking, we performed an experiment to measure the R:S ratio of the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus. radish plants with and without mycorrhizal inoculant, which are fungal filaments that form a symbiotic relationship with the plant roots to help them absorb water and nutrients in the soil. They do this by decreasing the distance from the roots to the soil that ion nutrients have to travel and increasing the surface area of the roots, which also facilitates better absorption [Bolan; 1991]. In some cases, plants treated with mycorrhizal fungi absorbed twice as much water from the soil compared to plants grown without the fungi [Kothari: 1990]. The null hypothesis of the experiment was that the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would show no differences in their R:S ratio compared to the radish plants not treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant. Our alternative hypothesis was that the R:S ratio of the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would be lower compared to the control radish plants, since the inoculant would work symbiotically, thus causing resources to be allocated to the shoots.

Materials and Methods:
Assigned six empty plant pots and filled them halfway with vermiculite, making sure to put around the same amount for each one. 50 mL of Miracle-Gro solution was added to every pot. Then, about six holes were made in the soil for each pot, where a handful of radish plant seeds were placed in each one. After that, a teaspoon of mycorrhizal inoculant was put into the holes created in three of the plant pots, forming the experimental group, with the other three being the control group. And then, another small layer of vermiculite was added over the inoculant of all the pots. The experimental and control groups were both labelled and put into a tray that was placed inside the greenhouse. There, the plants were all watered at least every other day for two weeks, sometimes every day, depending on the availability of the lab group members. After the two-week period, one group of ten radish plants from a pot were harvested, with every group of ten radish plants counting as one replicate. Each replicate was weighed on a digital scale and the data recorded in a table. Then, the roots and shoots were separated by cutting the root-shoot junction. The roots and shoots of each replicate was then also weighed, and the data recorded in a table. Then, we measured the maximum shoot length and root length of the longest radish plant in each replicate and recorded the values in a table. The R:S ratio in regards to the mass, as well as the lengths, of each replicate was calculated and recorded in the same data table. The mean of the three replicates in each plant pot was calculated, with its standard deviation. This was then repeated for the remaining five plant pots, including the experimental group. A one-tailed unpaired t-test was run to measure the statistical difference between the R:S ratio of the masses and lengths of the control and experimental groups.

Results:
When calculating the R:S ratio in relation to mass, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the control group, 0.269 +/- 0.0128, is lower than that of the experimental group, 0.288 +/- 0.0378, (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.461). However, when calculating the R:S ratio in relation to length, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the control group 1.933 +/- 0.149, is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.004). While the R:S ratios in relation to length of all three replicates of the control plants were higher than that of the experimental plants, one replicate of the experimental group had a R:S ratio, 0.246, that was lower than all of the R:S ratios of the control group, which were 0.258, 0.266, 0.266.  

Discussion:
Our data on the R:S ratio of radish plants grown with mycorrhizal inoculant and those grown without it neither supported nor disproved our hypothesis that the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would have a lower R:S ratio compared to the control radish plants. The R:S ratio, in relation to mass, of the control group averaged out to be 0.269 +/- 0.0128, compared to the 0.288 +/- 0.0378 of the experimental group (Figure 1), (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.461). This data doesn't support our hypothesis because a higher R:S ratio in the experimental group means that the biomass of the roots was higher than that of the of the shoots in the experimental group. So, resources were allocated to the roots, instead of the shoots, as predicted, since the inoculant was supposed to help with better nutrient absorption in the soil, meaning resources should have been allocated instead to the shoots. However, these values were not statistically significant because the P-value = 0.461, is much higher than the limit of 0.05 which means there was a 46% chance that our data was gotten by chance, which means we can't say that these groups are statistically different from each other. On the other hand, the R:S ratio in relation to length did support our hypothesis. The trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the control group 1.933 +/- 0.149, is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.004). These two sets of data may seem contradictory, but only the R:S ratio in relation to length was significant, p-value = 0.004. More studies should be done to reach a better conclusion on the effect of mycorrhizal inoculant on plant growth. The inoculant added should have caused a negligible increase in the mass of the roots, meaning it wouldn't have affected the R:S ratio in relation to mass. However, how negligible this increase in mass was is unknown, and could have caused an effect, since the roots already were fairly light. Future experiments could have more accurate and more precise measurements in the amount of mycorrhizal inoculant used for each plant and more scheduled watering time, which may have had an effect on the plant growth, along with soil conditions [Kim: 2017].
