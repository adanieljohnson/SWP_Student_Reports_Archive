Title: Betta splendins Introduced to Fake Fish of Varying Authenticity Display No Significant Change in Aggressive Response

Abstract:
Animals respond to stimuli in their environment in a variety of ways, including through aggressive behavior. We decided to investigate how the level of authenticity of a fake fish would affect the aggressiveness of the response of live Betta splendins males and hypothesized that the live fish would respond more aggressively to a more authentic fake fish. During the controll trial, we separately presented other live beta males to the three beta males we were observing. During the first experimental trial, we separately presented an unauthentic fake fish to the same three beta males. Last, during the second experimental trial, we separately presented an authentic fake fish to the same three beta males. All other variables were kept constant. We used a point system to quantify aggressiveness. We then analyzed our data using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-Kramer tests. There was no statistically significent difference between groups, nor was there a difference within groups. The reason for this is probably because the fake fish were floating in the tank in a state of motionlessness, so the live males did not respond aggressively in defense. Scientists can use data from experiments like these to study the evolution of behavior, and this information can benefit pet breeders, as well.

Introduction:
Animals react in a variety of ways to different conditions and stimuli. We observed and described the behavior of Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish. Intraspecific agnostic behaviors are those displayed between two fish of the same species and include broadside movements (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) and facing movements (erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers/opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane”) [Johnson: 2018]. According to a study using robotic fake fish and live Siamese fighting fish, “Fish replica shape was necessary for conspecific opponent perception, evoking significent aggressive responses” [D. Romano: 2017]. We tested to see how males respond to fake fish of varying levels of authenticity and predicted that the fish would show more signs of aggression when presented to a more realistic fake fish. This is important, because ethologists use data like this to learn why certain behaviors evolved and how they contribute to an organism’s fitness, providing insights into ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology [Johnson: 2018]. Consequently, this exercise helped us better comprehend why animals act the way they do, leading to a greater understanding of the complexity of the world around us.

Materials and Method:
We tested our biological hypothesis on male Betta splendins. There were two treatment trials and one controll trial. The controll trial consisted of independently presenting live male fish to the three fish we were observing. The first experimental trial involved independently presenting an unauthentic fish to the three fish we were observing. The second experimental trial involved independently presenting an authentic fake fish to the three fish we were observing. All other variables were kept constant. We observed each pairing for five minutes followed by five minutes of rest to prevent habituation. We observed the same three male betas in each trial. To evaluate and compare their aggressive behavior, we used the following point system:

1 point – pelvic fin flickering
2 points – erect pectoral fins
3 points – tail beating
4 points – spreading gill covers/opercula
5 points – tail flashing
6 points – red “mane”

The independent variable was the authenticity of the fake fish, and the dependent variable was aggressive behavior. We used a one-way ANOVA to test for differences between the three groups. Pairs of groups were then compared with Tukey-Kramer tests.

Results:
We used a one-way ANOVA to test for variation between and within groups. There was not a significent difference between groups (p = 0.051). The Tukey-Kramer tests did not show that any of the groups were significently more aggressive than all other groups, either. The mean point score for the controll trial was 58.7 ± 44.46. The mean point score when presented to the unauthentic fake fish was 1.3 ± 2.31. The mean point score when presented to the authentic fake fish was 0. As shown in Figure 1, there was neither a statistically significent difference between nor within groups. Therefore, aggressive behavior was not influenced by the authenticity of the fake fish presented to the live male fish in this case.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that the male betas would exhibit more aggressive behavior when presented to a more authentic fake fish. However, our hypothesis was not supported by the data. The relevant biological mechanism in this case is lack of visual aggressive cues. In the study involving robotic fake fish, “The efficacy of an artificial opponent eliciting aggressive behaviour in fish can be boosted by exposure to multiple signals” [D. Romano: 2017]. In our case, we simply placed the fake fish into the tank with the beta males. Since the fake fish did not exhibit any aggressive behavior at all, let alone multiple signals, the real fish did not respond. Biologically, it makes more sense for an organism to conserve energy for times of danger than to waste it on aggressive behavior in low-risk situations. This explains why they exhibited little to no aggressive behavior when presented with the fake fish. On the other hand, the beta males did respond aggressively when presented with other live fish, because the live fish were exhibiting aggressive behavior, as well. In the future, we could repeat this procedure to verify our results. In addition, if we decided to complete a new version of this experiment, it would be intriguing to test how opponent size affects whether or not a beta male will attack or retreat. It would also be interesting to see if the males act differently when they are together in the presence of a female, because if they are trying to win over a mate, the type and frequency of aggressive behavior they exhibit may be different.  Overall, experiments like these are important for studying how aggressive behavior evolved and how it contributes to an organism’s fitness. Pet store owners can also use this information if they wanted to breed more aggressive or less aggressive beta fish, depending on which type the consumer prefers.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Effect of presentation of unauthentic versus authentic fake fish on the aggressive behavior of beta males. During the controll trial, three beta males were separately introduced to live beta males. During the treatment trials, the same three beta males were separately introduced to an unauthentic and an authentic fake fish. We used a point system to quantify their aggressive behavior. Each bar represents the mean point value of three replicates; error bars represent two standard deviations of the mean.
