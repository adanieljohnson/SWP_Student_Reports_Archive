Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Photosynthetic Rates in Spinacia oleracea Leaves

Abstract:
Various types of organisms use photosynthesis to produce chemical energy to be used in a number of cellular functions, and this process is affected by many factors, including salinity. A key part of photosynthesis is photosystem II because it is the part that creates the electron transport chain and therefore ATP by oxidizing water molecules. In this experiment, the Hill assay was used to track the reduction of absorbance of DCPIP, as it was added to all of the samples. The results found were that as the salt concentration increased the absorbance reading increased as well, which was the result of the amount of DCPIP in the chloroplasts decreasing at a faster rate in the salt stress. Overall, this caused the photosynthetic rate to decrease. These results were consistent with previous studies that found that growth and therefore photosynthetic rate declined with increasing external NaCl concentration. With support from statistically significant results, the trends concluded that photosynthetic rates decreased as the salt concentration increased.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to get energy to drive the synthesis of organic molecules and energy from water and carbon dioxide. Plant chloroplast cells consist of an inner and outer membrane. The inside of the cell contains chlorophyll and stroma, and the chlorophyll are the particles that absorb light and pass the energy obtained to the thylakoids. The thylakoid membranes contain the electron transport chain, where two electrons from water are excited by light in photosystems I and II to reach a higher energy level (Berry and Downton 1982). This energy is used to convert NADP+ and NADPH and also to drive electrons into the thylakoid space to create a gradient. The gradient is what fuels ATP synthase to create ATP from ADP and Pi. This ATP is then used for many different processes within plants. Amongst all of these things happening, there are processes responsible for using reduction and oxidation reactions to convert light to chemical energy occurring with photosystems I and II. Once light energy is absorbed by the thylakoid membrane, energy bounces around between pigment molecules until it is in the reaction center where there is a special pair of electrons that allows for energy to be passed to an electron carrier (Berry and Downton 1982). The step that directly affects the rate of photosynthesis and therefore what we are looking at in this experiment, is the passing of the special pair to the electron carrier. Because it is hard to observe and quantify the reduction of the electron carrier in photosystem II, DCPIP was added to all of the samples. DCPIP is an artificial electron acceptor that is colorless when reduced and blue when oxidized, which makes the effects of the Hill assay more easily observable because by adding it to the chloroplast cells, it essentially replaces NADP+ along the electron transport chain.
The rate of photosynthesis, which directly affects the rate of growth of a plant, is affected differently by a number of factors. One factor that was explored is the presence of chemicals, known as herbicides, used to kill or control the growth of plants by interacting with photosynthetic electron transport.(Draber Wilfried et al. 2003) The factor focused on in this experiment is salinity, and how it will affect the photosynthetic rate of the chlorophyll within the spinach leaves. The chosen model system is spinach because it is inexpensive, easy to handle, and contains a relatively high number of chloroplasts that can be easily purified.
Photosynthetic rates in salt-stressed spinach leaves should be different than those in normal spinach leaves. Salinity levels play a large role in CO2 uptake, which usually affects the overall rate of growth of the plant. Salt stress can inhibit both the synthesis of proteins and the repair of photodamage to photosystem II (Murata et al. 2007) Intercellular CO2 may be reduced in some plants due to stomatal closure, and the reduction in CO2 fixation can be due to the inhibition of the photosynthetic light or dark reactions (Guenther and Melis 1987a). Based on all previous knowledge of photosynthesis and salinity, it is expected that the rate of photosynthesis in the spinach leaves will be reduced in the presence of increased salinity levels, as indicated by less reduction of the DCPIP in the Hill assay.


Materials and Methods:
Using measurements of DCPIP absorbance in a high salinity solution (200mM NaCl) and a low salinity solution (100mM NaCl), photosynthetic activity was determined. The model organism, Spinacia oleracea, was store bought and kept in the refrigerator between 0 and 5 degrees Celsius for approximately 1 week before being used in the lab. Five leaves were taken, and their central veins were all removed simply by tearing along the sides of the nerve. As this was being done, the mortar and pestle were placed into an icebox to be chilled and once cool enough, the leaves were placed inside along with 10mL cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The contents of the mortar and pestle were ground to a thick paste, which was then transferred into a chilled beaker using a 3-layer, folded piece of cheesecloth. The liquid was moved to a 50mL centrifuge tube A and the centrifuge was balanced and set to spin at 200 x G, or 200 times the force of gravity (1200 rpm in RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After being spun, the supernatant was poured into another chilled centrifuge tube B. This chloroplast suspension was spun at 1000 x G (2800 rpm in RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The resulting supernatant was then poured into another chilled centrifuge tube C and, 20mL of grinding buffer was added to B containing the pellet. The pellet was suspended as a result of stirring the solution with a transfer pipette. At this point, 16 large test tubes were prepared and labeled, with the addition of 100µL of enriched chloroplasts from the centrifuge tube to all but tubes 1-3. Different tubes had different combinations of water, 130mM DCPIP, the reaction buffer (100 mm phosphate, pH 6.5), and a salt solution (either 100mM or 200mM. Each tube was mixed well, and then transferred to a spectrophotometer cuvette to measure the absorbance of each solution. Absorbances were measured in the spectrophotometer set to 600nm because that is the wavelength at which oxidized DCPIP is able to absorb light. It was important to measure the absorbance of each tube immediately after the chloroplasts had been added and it had been mixed. The spectrophotometer was first blanked using tube 0, then used to measure each solution, making sure to blank in between each measurement. After measure the absorbance of all samples at 600nm, all of the cuvettes were placed under a lamp with a 600-lumen lightbulb for ten minutes. The absorbances were then measured again, then placed under the light for another ten minutes, repeating until all had been measured three times. Absorbances were recorded and changed into percent change* using the average of the three tubes in each treatment group, and a two tailed one sample t-test was then used to analyze the results with a critical value of 0.05 to determine significance.

Results:

	The general trend of each chloroplast sample was that after each ten-minute interval, the DCPIP absorbance increased more and more, but at a much slower rate in the high salinity samples. Growth overall decreased with increasing NaCl concentration, as seen when comparing the high NaCl group to the control or low NaCl group. There are some outliers and the percent change values vary a decent amount within each group of samples, but there was a trend of increasing absorbance as NaCl concentration increased. The mean percent change of the data for the samples with no chloroplasts after 30 minutes was 2.81 with a standard deviation of 1.33. The mean for the percent change after 30 minutes for the normal enriched chloroplast sample was 79.6 with a standard deviation of 21.95. For the high salinity samples after 30 minutes the mean percent change was 61.5 with a standard deviation of 4.09, and for the low salinity samples after 30 minutes the mean percent change was 67.9 with a standard deviation of 31.0. The statistical test used to compare the different groups of samples was a two-tailed t-test. A q test was used to determine outliers, and the results justified excluding two data points, 1 from the high salinity sample and one from the low salinity sample. The results of the t-test performed with the high salinity sample, excluding the outlier, and the normal enriched chloroplast sample were: (t(3)=3.18, p=0.0029). When the statistical test was performed with the same groups but including the outlier in the high salinity sample, the results were: (t(4)=2.78, p=0.32). The results of a t-test performed with the low salinity sample, excluding the outlier, and the normal chloroplast sample were (t(3)=4.30, p=0.57) and when this same test was performed including the outliers, (t(4)=2.78, p=0.69).
 


Discussion:
The p-value of 0.0029 that resulted from the statistical test comparing the results of the high salinity samples and the normal enriched chloroplast (control) sample is less than 0.05. This means that there is a significant difference between the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts in a normal environment and those in a high salinity environment. From the 10-minute time to the 30-minute time the absorbances of the chloroplasts changed less than those of the control group, indicating a lower rate of photosynthesis for the high salinity samples. The absorbance readings obtained measured the amount of DCPIP oxidized in the cells and as photosynthesis occurred in the chloroplast cells, electrons were donated to this DCPIP and it was reduced. As photosynthesis continued to occur, there was gradually less oxidized DCPIP available to absorb the light from the spectrophotometer, which explains why the absorbance readings decreased over the 30-minute period in the samples still exhibiting photosynthesis. This also shows that because there was more change and therefore decrease in absorbance in the control samples, photosynthesis occurred at a slower rate in the high salinity group, seen by the fact that the absorbance values did not change as much. Similar results were found in an experiment targeting salinity stress in spinach plants. In this study it was found that growth declined with increasing external NaCl concentration, which is consistent with the results of the experiment performed in this lab (Guenther and Melis 1987b). Although Guenther’s study compared the effect of salt stress internally to what it was externally, the results supported the fact that photosynthetic rate decreased as salt concentration increased and therefore supports the hypothesis. Another study performed on spinach leaves tested the photosynthetic and stomatal responses due to salt stress and provided more support for the hypothesis. It was found that there were lower photosynthetic rates in salt-treated leaves, and that this could be due to a reduction in stomatal conductance and low intercellular carbon dioxide as a result of the high salt concentration (DOWNTON et al. 1985) The possible errors in the experiment performed could be found in the health and condition of the spinach plants provided. Older, less healthy leaves could affect the outcome of the experiment as a whole. If the leaves were cut or harmed before being used the plants could have been oxidized, this would have affected the redox reactions and therefore the photosynthetic rates found at the end. On the other hand, simple procedural errors could have been made with pipetting and using the spectrophotometer. After performing this experiment and analyzing the results, it was seen that there is potential for future studies to build on this one. First, it could be interesting to take measurements for a time period longer than 30 minutes to see the extent of the change in absorbance over time. Also, it would be interesting to see how using different types of plants would affect the results, or using different concentrations of salt. Overall, this lab supported the hypothesis that the rate of photosynthesis in the spinach leaves would be reduced with an increase in salinity levels. This was demonstrated by a decrease in the reduction of the DCPIP, or the presence of more oxidized DCPIP, in the Hill assay accompanied by smaller % change over the 30-minute period for the high salinity samples compared to the normal enriched chloroplast samples.
