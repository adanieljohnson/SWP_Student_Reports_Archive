Title: Juvenile Hormone's Effect on Pupation in the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect's molting and metamorphosis phases are entirely dependent on hormones; particularly JH and ecdysterone. These hormones are released rapidly in a phase called the commitment pulse, which orchestrates the beginning of pupation. By feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars high levels of methoprene, an analog of JH, we would eliminate the commitment pulse, forcing the caterpillars to continue to live in the 4th instar phase. If they are unable to pupate, it is likely that they will stay in the 4th instar stage until they die. This was tested by using a control and treatment group of caterpillars; the control group was fed typical caterpillar food with water, and the treatment group was fed food that contained methoprene. We observed that the treatment group showed no signs of pupation, and instead continual growth (in both weight and length), suggesting they would stay in their 4th instar phase without pupating. This supports previous knowledge suggesting that a decrease of JH is essential for pupation. 

Introduction:
Insects control growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes using both hormone-based and neuron-based signaling [Johnson, 2018]. For our purposes, we are looking at two hormones that control these processes; juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone. In all insects, JH has primary roles in the regulation of metamorphosis and reproduction [Riddiford, 2012]. During the Manduca sexta's (a holometabolous insect) 5th instar phase, their prothoracic glands release a small amount of ecdysteroids. Ecdysone in the absence of JH causes the cessation of feeding and the onset of wandering to find a pupation site [Riddiford, 2012]. If there were to be JH, there would be no Ecdysone, and therefore the continuation of pupation. The release of both hormones is also known as the commitment pulse, and the commitment pulse indicates the larvae is ready to pupate.  JH works alongside the ecdysteroids, but in different concentrations to control growth and metamorphosis. This experiment will utilize Precor, which is methoprene; a juvenile hormone analog. Methoprene is a common insecticide, used to keep larvae in their juvenile phases, and to avoid metamorphosis into the adult phase, where they continue to reproduce. The independent variable is methoprene and the dependent variable is pupation. We predict that drastically increasing the levels of juvenile hormone by methoprene will cause the larvae in the 4th larval stage to be unable to molt into the 5th instar phase (because of a lack of commitment pulse and high levels of JH), ultimately preventing them from reaching adulthood. Instead, we predict they will stay in the 4th in instar stage until they die. 

Materials and Methods:
We used eight 4th/5th instar Manduca sexta caterpillars and separated them into a control and treatment group. Each group had 4 caterpillars. They were given all the same treatment aside from their food. The control group was given normal food, with 1mL of water for every 50mL of food. The treatment group was fed food with 1mL of Precor (methoprene) per 50mL of food. All conditions remained the same, and they were fed once a day. The caterpillars were kept refrigerated and separated by index cards in plastic containers with holes for air. We used a statistical two sample T-test to compare data along with graphs of average weight and length of the caterpillars. 

Results:
The Control group continued to gain weight up until days seven and eight when it began to slow down. They continued to grow in length until day eight, when they regressed and became smaller. The treatment group continued to grow in both weight and length.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that larvae that are treated with methoprene will stay in the 4th instar stage until they die, because they would be unable to pupate due to a lack of commitment pulse because of high levels of JH. Our experiment wasn't long enough to entirely determine whether or not they would die, but our control caterpillars showed signs of beginning to pupate, whereas the treatment group did not. Our control group began to slow in growth on day 8, shortening in length from 8.05cm-7.83cm along with a slowing of weight gain form 12.2g-12.23g. This is an indication of the body preparing for pupation. They also exhibited a color change from vibrant blue to brownish yellow- another indication of pupation. Our treatment group did the opposite and didn't present any signs of pupation, but instead continued to grow in length (8.2cm-8.23cm) and gain weight (11.93g-12.94g). This suggests their bodies were continuing to grow and were not complying with pupation, which supports our hypothesis that caterpillars that are fed high doses of methoprene are unable to pupate. Although our P-values were unusually high for both length and mass of the caterpillars (0.88, and 0.81), it is likely attributed the fact that we were unable to continue the experiment for a long enough period. Only of one of the control caterpillars began pupating, and if they had the chance to pupate, it is likely our P-value would be significantly different because there would have been a more drastic change in length and weight due to a change in exoskeleton. Another experiment suggests that In vitro experiments with the abdominal epidermis from feeding larvae showed that exposure to 20E (ecdysterone) in the absence of JH was sufficient to cause pupal commitment, whereas exposure to 20E and JH maintained the larval state [Reddiford, 2012]. This would support our hypothesis that the caterpillars that were continuously fed high levels of JH would remain in their 4th larval instar stage. If we could change this experiment, we would have continued studying the caterpillars for longer to determine the reactions of the treatment group to the hormone, and determine if they would eventually die. To conclude, we observed that the increase in JH through consumption of methoprene prevents the Manduca sexta from pupating.
