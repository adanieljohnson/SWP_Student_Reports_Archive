Title: Chemical Signaling of Hormones 

Abstract:
During the week of our experiment, our group observed the effect of a juvenile hormone mimic called precor on the maturation of the manduca sexta larva. We predicted if we administer the manduca sexta with .5 dilution (4 drops) of JH each day in its food for a seven-day period, it will mature more slowly than the average manduca because the JH will cause it to develop more slowly. Everyday the larva groups, control and treatment, received 10 grams of food. The food for the control group was mixed with water whereas the food for the treatment group was mixed with .5% dilution of JH. We recorded their weight each day once a day. Overall, it seems that we can conclude that JH has a negative effect on the maturation of the manduca sexta because those of which that were distributed the hormone matured much more slowly than those of which who were not given the hormone.

Introduction:
The manduca sexta is affected by two main hormones, Juvenille hormone (JH) which regulates the type of molt. And Endysterone which regulates the timing of the molt.  When one of these hormones is altered it in turn alters the molting and the pupation of the larva. In the case study written for the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, it was found that due to Juvabione and IGRâ€™s it caused the linden bug to have low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults. We now want to see if similar results can be duplicated by carrying out this experiment on the manduca sexta. If we administer the manduca sexta with .5 dilution (4 drops) of JH each day in its food for a seven-day period, it will mature more slowly than the average manduca because the JH will cause it to develop more slowly. 

Materials and Methods:
We will have one control group of four manduca sexta larva which will be fed with natural food and water for a seven-day period. We will measure the weight of each one once a day. We will also have an experimental grouch of four manduca sexta larva which will be fed with .5 diluted natural food each day for a seven-day period. We will weigh each one once a day. 

Results:
The control group weighed significantly less than the treatment group did. For example, on average the treatment group on average outweighed the control group by at least one gram. There was less movement in the control group than there was for the treatment group. The control group was yellowish/brownish in color whereas, the treatment group was blueish/greenish in color. 

Discussion:
In our experiment we found that JH hormone slowed down the maturing process of the manduca sexta. The caterpillars that were administered .5 dilution of JH hormone were much larger compared to the control group in size and heavier in weight.  The treatment caterpillars were also more plump and blueish greenish in color. They were far from pupation or malting. The caterpillars that were part of the control group were much smaller, brownish yellowish in color, and were in the beginning stages of pupation. Two, of which were even in the early stages of malting. The results did, in fact, support our null hypothesis, if we administer the manduca sext with .5 dilution (4 drops) of JH each day in its food for a seven-day period, it will mature more slowly than the average manduca because the JH will cause it to develop more slowly. This goes to show that the synthetic JH hormone we used in this experiment caused the manducas to not react to the spikes in ecdysterone and caused them to not enter into the early stages of pupation or malting like the control group.
