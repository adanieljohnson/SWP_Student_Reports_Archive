Title: Analyzing the effect that increased levels of cAMP have on phototaxis in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum behavior is controllled by intracellular signal transduction pathways. G-protein coupled receptors are one of the main families of receptors that regulates P. polycephalum behavior in response to signaling molecules. We studied the 2nd messenger cAMP mediated pathway in which adenylate cyclase is activated and converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP binds to protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates other enzymes to trigger a behavioral response. We hypothesized that the P. polycephalum would exhibit positive phototaxis when cAMP is increased because a previous study showed that a single celled green alga, exhibited negative phototaxis with low levels of cAMP. We tested our hypothesis by inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity, which stimulated cAMP production. We compared the results of P. polycephalum with and without the inhibitor after being placed under light for 18 hours. After two trials, our hypothesis was rejected because there was no migration towards or away from light. This is likely due to PDA plate contamination. Further studies can be done to test our hypothesis differently, such as using a different agar plate or testing how increased cAMP affects chemotaxis or gravitaxis. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum exhibit many behaviors in response to their environment. P. polycephalum is an acellular slime mold with a tubular network. This network consists of cytoplasm that streams throughout it and that periodically switches direction to respond to environmental stimuli. It is mainly found in moist forest environments and can range in size. P. polycephalum has been used as a model in biology since the 1970’s and has ideal qualities that make it so beneficial. For our experiment, we focused on its cytoskeletal system movement in response to a light signal. P. polycephalum has a cytoskeleton made of actin and myosin, which is similar to animals and serves as a great model for motility, making them model organisms for our experiment because they can move in response to light[Alim: 2013]. 

	P. polycephalum response and behavior are controllled by intracellular signal transduction pathways. Through cytoplasmic network streaming, molecular signals can be sent throughout the whole P. polycephalum. Acto-myosin based contractions drive the cytoplasm to switch direction, carrying signaling molecules throughout the organism [Alim: 2013]. G-protein coupled receptors are one of the main families of receptors that regulates P. polycephalum behavior in response to these signaling molecules. G-Protein coupled receptors are stimulated by an extracellular signal, and the alpha subunit is activated, activates an effector enzyme to generate secondary messengers, and sends out a cell response. Some different behaviors that are exhibited are phototaxis, chemotaxis, and gravitaxis. We chose to study phototaxis, in which the P. polycephalum may migrate towards or away from light. Phototaxis is shown to involve protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases, which are regulated by second messengers [Allan: 2011].

	We studied the second messenger cAMP mediated pathway in which the effector enzyme is adenylate cyclase and converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP then binds to protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates other enzymes to trigger a cellular response [Johnson: 2016]. Many different responses can be exhibited, such as cell growth, cell differentiation, and gene transcription [Yan: 2016]. We chose to inhibit cAMP phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cAMP. By inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity, cAMP production is stimulated. We hypothesized that the P. polycephalum would exhibit positive phototaxis when cAMP is increased. In a previous study, the effects of light on cAMP signaling was studied in D. discoideum, a slime mold. It was found that with light, the release of cAMP was stimulated and the frequency of cAMP pulsing before and after the formation of cell-cell contacts was increased. This shows that phototaxis has a direct influence on cAMP signaling [Miura: 2000]. We used this finding along with a study in which the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a single celled green alga, exhibited negative phototaxis with low levels of cAMP [Boonyareth: 2009]. Thus, we thought that a similar organism, the P. polycephalum, would show positive phototaxis with increased levels of cAMP. 


Materials and Method:
We obtained six PDA plates from the front table. The stock plates were cultured on water agar and in a 37-degree incubator and constant darkness We poured caffeine+IMBX (1:20 dilution) in three experimental plates and distilled water in three controll plates and let them soak for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, we poured out the liquid. We then drew two boxes on the bottom of each plate with Sharpie. After sterilizing a spatula, we opened the lids of each PDA plate and cut out 2, 1 cm x 1 cm squares of agar and disposed of them. Using the forceps and spatula, we transferred one block from our P. polycephalum stock culture into the two cut squares in each of the six PDA plates. We were careful to re-sterilize the spatula in ethanol for each plate. When the cut squares were filled with the P. polycephalum stock culture, we placed the lids on each plate and secured them with tape. Then we wrapped the six plates in foil and cut out a small window in the foil for the light to shine into. We placed the plates in the light box, making sure they were sitting flat and not on top of each other. After 18 hours, we came back to observe the P. polycephalum movement and score our plates. However, each agar plate looked contaminated and none of them moved, so we redid our experiment. We came back after 18 hours to gather our results. Only one of our slime molds migrated, so we used a millimeter ruler to measure the distance. After recording the results, we disposed of each plate. Finally, we ran a statistical t_test to compare our results. 

Results:
There was no significent difference between our treatment group and our controll group (t_stat= 1 =, d.f.= 10, P= 0.341). The first time we checked our results, there was contamination in all the plates. The second time we checked, the average controll movement was 2 mm away from the light, while the experimental group did not move. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that increased cAMP levels would cause the P. polycephalum to exhibit positive phototaxis was not supported. Each P. polycephalum inhibited with caffeine+IBMX did not show any migration. With both trials, we failed to see any results. This can likely be contributed to a prevalent contamination problem with the PDA plates. Contamination likely prevented P. polycephalum from growing, thus it could not move in response to light. Since phototransduction pathways involve second messengers that activate kinases, we expected signaling pathways to have an influence on chemotaxis. At a cellular level, we thought that since cAMP directly activates PKA, a cellular response would be triggered to show chemotaxis. Based off the previous study on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that showed negative phototaxis when cAMP levels were low, we thought P. polycephalum would move towards light [Boonyareth: 2009]. It has been shown that blocking PKA will inhibit phototaxis [Daiker: 2011]. Therefore, by increasing cAMP and PKA activation, phototaxis should be displayed. However, phototaxis was not shown at all in our results. 

Further experiments can be conducted to test our hypothesis differently. For example, since our PDA plates may have been contaminated, a different type of plate could be used. One study has compared the contamination rates in different types of culture media. They found that the plate with the lowest rate of contamination was Borelli’s lactritmel agar (BLA), followed by Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA), malt extract agar (MEA), brain-heart infusion agar (BHIA), potato dextrose agar (PDA), and finally Lowenstein-Jensen agar (LJA) [Gumral: 2015]. This shows that PDA is very susceptible to contamination, so in the future we could use and SGA or and MEA agar medium. On the other hand, part of our experiment could be altered. We could test the effects of increased cAMP on chemotaxis or gravitaxis. Chemotaxis is when P. polycephalum senses molecules in the environment and it either crawls towards or away from the molecules [Johnson: 2016]. It has been shown in previous studies that cAMP regulates P polycephalum’s ability to contract to sensory information. Since more cAMP could potentially increase contraction and movement, we could test if increased cAMP causes P. polycephalum to migrate farther than normal levels of cAMP [Akitaya: 1983]. Overall, it is important to understand the importance that second messengers have in keeping organisms alive and functioning. Without second messengers, organisms would not grow, transcribe genes, or maintain homeostasis.
