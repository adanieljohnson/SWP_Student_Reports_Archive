Title: A Study of Insect Growth Hormones: How the Manduca sexta caterpillar was negatively influenced by the addition of a Juvenile Hormone mimic to their Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diets

Abstract:
In this experiment, we manipulated the natural growth-related Juvenile Hormone in the natural diet of the Manduca sexta. We used past Case Studies involving the Juvenile Hormone in order to hypothesize that a small administration of this hormone would create more positive growth patterns than that of a controll group. We used a sample of eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, split into two groups of four caterpillars each, to track the growth by mass of each caterpillar over a week. 5 drops of the JH mimic Precor was included in the diets of four of caterpillars and 5 drops of water was added to the diets of the others. We also recorded some observations about the appearances of each caterpillar. Overall, we saw a 2.94 g growth difference in favor of the controll group diet, suggesting that perhaps the JH had a negative effect on the subjects of our study. However, a 2-Sample T-Test deemed our results not statistically significent. Our qualitative observations included some pale JH mimic caterpillars, so we learned that the opposite effect from our Alternate hypothesis appeared to be the case. Generally, we learned some key characteristics of the growth patterns of the Manduca sexta caterpillar.

Introduction:
In our experiment, we surveyed the growth patterns of the Manduca sexta caterpillar with relation to certain growth hormones. These caterpillars begin in the larval stage, and continue growing into stages called Instars, and they were beneficial . The natural diet of the Manduca sexta—the Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet—has been modeled to best provide nutrients needed for flourishing. The question of hydration has been answered by studies that suggest that the caterpillars get proper hydration through their diets alone [Reynolds: 1984]. We altered this diet with the addition of one growth hormone—Juvenile Hormone (JH)—in order to determine if it has any effects on the short-term growth of the Manduca sexta. Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt of young Manduca sexta larvae, and it controlls multiple functions in the adult caterpillar [Johnson 2018]. We decided to focus on this topic after our reading of Case Study 2, an activity that was completed in class. Here, the caterpillars thrived with a slight introduction of a JH mimic in their GLM diets, so we aimed to replicate this study to a certain point. We hypothesized that an inclusion of 5 drops of the JH mimic Precor in the diets of our Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in the largest growth by mass and the most positive overall healthy appearance. 


Materials and Method:
•	Obtain four, clear plastic containers with ventilated tops. Fold a white, paper divider and place it in the center of each container to create a separation between the two sides. Label each container “Control Group 1”, “Control Group 2”, “JH Mimic 1”, and “JH Mimic 2”.
•	Gather a group of 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars of relatively the same size by mass and weigh each one. Place 1 caterpillar on each of the 8 divided sides in the containers.
•	Measure out 8 sets of 10 grams of the Great Lakes Manduca diet. With a clear pipette add 5 drops each of water to 4 of the samples, and 5 drops each of Precor to the 4 left over. 
•	Place the 10 gram Precor samples in each of the 4 divided sides of the containers labeled “JH Mimic”, and the 4 water-drop samples in each of the containers labeled “Control Group”.
•	Over the course of the next 7 days, weigh each caterpillar and record any significance in overall appearances, changing the food completely each day with the same method as from above.
•	Average the weight changes of both the controll group caterpillars and the JH mimic caterpillars.
•	Perform a 2-Sample T-Test with the average controll group weight changes and the average JH mimic weight changes in order to test statistical significance. 


Results:
Upon looking at the mass data from Table 1, one can see that the overall average for the controll group mass differences was 9.04  0.35, and the average for the JH mimic mass differences was 6.10  4.82. Some important observations from this table include an overall weight loss for JH Mimic caterpillar 2A, curiously contrasting with the caterpillar that was on the other side of the same container, having the largest weight gain at 10.85 grams. Table 3 accounts for the qualitative observations about each caterpillar, including some basic overall appearance descriptions. JH Mimic 2B was overall the liveliest and most brightly colored, as well as being the largest. The JH mimics in container 1 were extremely pale and slow-moving compared to their appearances at the beginning of the 7 days. Figure 1 shows these overall weight changes and—aside from the anomaly of the 12.19g JH Mimic 2B caterpillar, one can observe the the trend was a larger growth in the controll group caterpillars. Figure 2 refers to the average and standard deviation data from Table 1, and shows an extremely large standard deviation when compared to the mass data from the controll group. The overall average growth for the controll group caterpillars was also approximately 2.94 grams greater than that of the JH mimic group. In Table 2, our 2-Sample T-test accounted for a result of 0.309, which is not statistically significent on any alpha level.



Discussion:
Overall, we can observe that there was a difference between the growth of the controll group caterpillars and the JH mimic caterpillars, but the statistical analysis produced a value that deemed the difference not statistically significent enough to reject our null hypothesis. Also, because our alternative hypothesis was that the JH mimic would have a positive effect on the caterpillar’s growth and overall appearance, we can suggest a repetition of this study with a greater number of caterpillars, as well as an alternative hypothesis that is the opposite of ours. Of our own experiment’s findings, we can conclude that—while there was a clear difference between the standard deviations and qualitative appearances of the caterpillars overall—we have not produced results with enough statistical significance to come to a logical conclusion about the precise effect on the caterpillars that an increase in the Juvenile Hormone can have on the growth process. Discussing the pale appearance of three of the JH mimic caterpillars and negative weight change in one, a connection can be drawn to the effect of the Juvenile Hormone as whole in the life cycle of the caterpillar. It has been shown that the JH quantity in the Manduca sexta decreases as more instars are reached [Kiguchi: 1978], so one might conclude that this could be the reason for the negative affect that it appeared to have aside from the lack of statistical significance. Pertaining to the abnormally large growth of caterpillar JH mimic 2B, this could perhaps be something inherently natural in the growth of the Manduca caterpillar. The growth of these caterpillars has been proven to be significently fast-moving [Reynolds: 1984]. As for future studies relating to ours, it would further the accuracy of the experiment to include a larger sample of caterpillars—more than just four per group—and complete the measurements over a longer period of time. Also, it might be more accurate to begin the experiment with a younger group of Manduca sextas, as the study mentioned prior suggests that the utilization of JH in the younger caterpillar is much greater than that of a more mature insect. Overall, this experiment has given us a better understanding of specific hormone manipulations, and the ability to alter the hormone levels of the caterpillar with a method as simple as ingestion. We also gained a better understanding of the living conditions and controll-group development styles of the caterpillars that can be retained for future studies involving insects.
