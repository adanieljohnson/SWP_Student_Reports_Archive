Title: The Fertilization of the Plant Species Pisum Sativum Resulted in Growth of the Phosphorous Fertilized Plants but a Lack of Growth from the Nitrogen Plants. 

Abstract:
-In this distinct lab setting, the class engaged in manufacturing their own experiments using different plant species and a variety of different variables to test with. In our particular group we were given a field pea plant species called Pisum Sativum. We decided to test the effect of fertilizer on our plant species and thus, chose nitrogen and phosphorus. The group decided to have nine plants in total, which resulted in three groups of three. The result of the experiment was growth in both the phosphorous and control, but no growth for the plants fertilized with nitrogen. The lack of growth from the nitrogen fertilized plants is easily understood because the plant is of the legume family and is constantly fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. The addition of nitrogen fertilizer with the nitrogen that the plant was constantly producing resulted in an over-fertilization of the plant and thus no growth. The growth of the control, which lacked both nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization, can be attributed to the nature of the plant, which creates its own nitrogen and thus provides reasoning to why the plant was able to grow to such an extent. This is an interesting finding because it can relate back to the real world and agriculture. Farmers that are experiencing nitrogen lacking s

Introduction:

The plant that our group was assigned was a species of field pea plant, scientifically named Pisum, Sativum. Pisum Sativum, also known as "the common pea" and originates from the Mediterranean basin and Near East. [Lee, 2016] The pea plant is a legume, which is a plant which is "noteworthy for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen". Legumes are often utilized by farmers in order to reintroduce nitrogen in nitrogen deficient soil, allowing farmers to plant other nitrogen consumer plants, like that of cotton or corn. [Fabio, 2017] In this lab the group decided to observe the amount of growth, as well as, how the root to shoot ratio was affected in pea plants when exposed to nitrogen, phosphorous, or neither (the control). Nitrogen and phosphorous are both key elements that facilitate an organisms success in a given environment. A lack of nitrogen can negatively affect "cell division and enlargement". The lack of nitrogen will result in plants being shorter than usual, having smaller leaves, and stunted maturity. [Snyder, 2011] Plants cannot survive without phosphorus, because it forms the "backbone of many crucial molecules and key player in energy transfer reactions." A low availability of phosphorous results in "environmental stress" and often result in losses in crop production. [Daque, 2012] The importance of this experiment is to understand the effects of specific fertilizers on the growth of legumes. It is important to understand which fertilizers benefit which plants that way farmers can obtain the maximum output of their crops, which will then lead to the lowering of high crop prices, and thus the feeding of more people. I predict that the plants that are exposed to phosphorous will result in the most growth and thus a smaller root to shoot value. 



Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, it is necessary to obtain the seeds of the pea plant species Pisum Sativum. The experiment also calls for the two types of fertilizer, phosphorus and nitrogen, as well as, nine planting pots, miracle grow, ruler, scissors, vermiculite soil, and water. The first step of the experiment is to fill all nine plant pots with the vermiculite soil. Next, label three of the nine pots "nitrogen", three "phosphorous" and three with "neither" or "control", which represents the control. Once all the pots are labeled mix in the fertilizers that go in each pot. After mixing in the fertilizers, it is time for the seeds. Plant about 5-6 seeds in each pot. Add miracle grow and water to the potted plants once the seeds are planted. Once the miracle grow is added and the seeds are watered place the plant in an area where it will obtain enough sunlight. Leave the plants in this area for two weeks and be sure to water them on a daily basis. 

Results:
The data gathered from the experiment resulted in no growth in the nitrogen fertilized plants, however, in the control and the phosphorous fertilized plants growth was present. The mean value for the nitrogen plants was zero considering that those plants showed no signs of growth, and thus no margin for error. [Table 2] The phosphorous fertilized plants resulted in a mean root to shoot value of 1.01 and a standard deviation of .17. [Table 1] The control resulted in a mean root to shoot value of 1.03 and a standard deviation value of .27. [Table 3] The group decided to perform a T-test on the data to analyze its statistical value. A T-test is acceptable to use in the case of the experiment, because the nitrogen showed no signs of growth, thus we decided to perform the T-test on the two sets of data we had, phosphorous and the control. The P value for total growth was 0.058727. The P value for Root to Shoot weight was 0.646884. The P value for the root to shoot length was 0.932641.

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported because the most growth was found in the phosphorous fertilized plants. The root to shoot value was also smaller in these plants seeing as it had more growth from the shoots. The phosphorous plants being legumes already had nitrogen and phosphorous, thus not many resources were allocated to the roots to find those necessary life building minerals. The plant that our group was given was a legume plant. Legumes are known for their nitrogen-fixing characteristics and thus lack the need for nitrogen fertilizer. Plants that are exposed to too much nitrogen will result in the "burning" or simply over-fertilization of the plant causing it to not be able to grow. [Albornoz, 2016] The limitations of our experiment were that we used miracle grow in order to help facilitate rapid growth, however, miracle grow has components in it such as phosphorous and nitrogen which may have resulted in the growth of our control. If I were to repeat the experiment I would not use the miracle grow. Another limitation of our experiment was the lack of the ability to keep the plants separate from one another. Our group kept our plants close together so they would not be lost, however, that could have possibly lead to the contamination of the other plants due to water runoff. The next step to this experiment would be to test without the addition of miracle grow and perhaps use a plant that is not in the legume family, in order to observe the effects of nitrogen on plants.
