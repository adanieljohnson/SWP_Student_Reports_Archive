Title: Effect of Herbicide Atrazine on [Spinacia oleracea] (Spinach) and [Brassica oleracea] (Kale) photosynthetic activity

Abstract:
Atrazine is an herbicide targeting at photosystem II, an important complex of plants' chloroplasts. In this experiment, spinach and kale are used to test the effect of atrazine on their photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are isolated by centrifugation and used together with an electron acceptor, DCPIP, that changes color as it goes through redox reaction. The rate of photosynthesis is indicated by the % change of absorbance of the experimental solution (color: DCPIP). The experiment results show that atrazine has significantly negative effect on both spinach and kale, and it influences both organisms in a similar manner by decreasing its photosynthetic activity. This experiment shows us that atrazine as an herbicide not only influences unwanted plants species negatively but could also influence photosynthesis in some agricultural crops negatively.

Introduction:
Living organisms need an energy source from the environment surrounding them. Plants and some prokaryotes, as autotrophs, can generate energy of their own by capturing light energy from the sun and converting it into chemical energy. This process is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis "is arguably the most important biological process on earth" and is one of the "only two mechanisms for collecting light energy and converting it into chemical energy" [Bryant: 2006]. Plants photosynthesis consists of two parts, light-dependent reaction and light-independent reaction. In light-dependent reaction, plants capture photons of energy of particular range of wavelength by photosystems and convert it into chemical energy. NADPH and ATP produced in this process is later used as energy source for light-independent reaction, through which plants fix atmospheric carbon into carbohydrate products. Plants serve as a producer in the food chain to higher level consumers as energy source (source of carbohydrate), which is the reason why large range of plants are farmed for food.  By studying the rate of photosynthesis, we learn about different conditions that may have impact on plants growth, for example light intensity, humidity and usage of herbicide. 

DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, is an electron acceptor that is commonly used in the study of photosynthesis. DCPIP is an oxidizing agent, that can gain electron from PSI as an alternative of NADP as terminal electron acceptor. This reaction is known as Hill Reaction (discovered by Robert Hill). DCPIP changes color from dark blue (with aromatic ring, absorb light at 600nm maximum) into colorless (with carbon double bond) after being reduced. By using its property of color change before and after a redox reaction, the rate of photosynthesis can be indicated. This is measured as absorbance using spectrophotometer (at wavelength 600nm).  

To make sure of agricultural productivity, people kept exploring possible chemicals that may act as herbicides to help control the unwanted weeds from competing with agricultural plants for nutrients. Previous studies shown that herbicides usually function by acting at "a large number of sites of metabolic function and energy transfer in plant cells" [O. Duke: 1990]. Metabolic processes that are commonly targeted are: biosynthetic pathways and cell division.  

Atrazine is an herbicide, interestingly known by its side effect (believed by some scientists) of feminizing clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) [Hoseys: 2010]. In light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis, three types of plastoquinones (as electron acceptors) have been identified in previous studies: two of the commonly known plastoquinone QA, QB and a third plastoquinone QC [Guskov: 2009]. Reduction of QB (PSII secondary quinone electron acceptor) take place in two successive steps, once reduced and protonated, QB moves away from its binding site and immediately get replaced by a new PQ molecule, artificial quinones or herbicides [Lambreva: 2014].  Atrazine is one of these herbicides that inhibits Photosystem II (PS II) at its QB site [Trebst: 2009]. By inhibiting the QB binding site, Atrazine inhibits the transfer of excited electron from PS II to electron transport chain in thylakoid membrane. As the result, excited electron cannot reach PS I, which will lead to presumably no or less electron getting passed to DCPIP. Thus, with the presence of atrazine, no or minor color change in Hill Reaction should occur as result.   
The effect of atrazine is tested since it kills off weeds by inhibiting a highly conserved process in wide variety of plants species. In order to learn how much negative effect will atrazine have on some common agricultural crops, Hill Reaction is run with two model organisms, spinach and kale. The targeting plants are chosen since they are very accessible, cheap and easy to keep in lab. In this experiment, absorbance (dependent variable) is measured over a course of 30 minutes, with the independent variable: the presence of herbicide and type of experimental organisms, under a constant environment of controlled humidity, pH level, temperature and light intensity.  Since atrazine inhibit QB site to reduce/stop photosynthesis, decrease in photosynthesis rate of spinach and kale is expected. Two null hypotheses are given in this experiment. The first null hypothesis is: atrazine will have no significantly negative effect on model organism's photosynthesis rate, which is expected to be rejected base on the background information above. The second null hypothesis is: atrazine will not have significantly different effect towards kale over spinach, which is expected to be supported, since plastoquinone is highly conserved in plants. The absorbance is expected to be relatively high and %change of absorbance is expected to remain low with the presence of atrazine (in comparison to assays without herbicide), since we would expect to see most DCPIP molecules will remain oxidized state with its dark blue color.


Materials and Methods:
We used centrifugation to isolate chloroplast from the leaves of spinach and kale. Four leaves from both experimental organisms (with veins removed) were grind with ice-bathed mortar and pestle with 10ml of cold grinning buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Filter by cheesecloth and collected in a beaker, and 200 μl of filtered liquid is transferred into a microtube stored. Filtered liquid in the beaker then poured into a 50ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 G, 4℃ for 3min, with balance tube. Supernatant from the centrifuged solution was poured into another 50ml centrifuge tube, debris left in the bottom of the first centrifuge tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 G, 4℃ for 3min, with balance tube. Based on earlier experiment on enriching chloroplast by differential centrifugation we carried out, the pellet obtained after a second time of centrifugation at 1000 G, 4℃ for 3min contains the chloroplast.  

In the Hill reaction, DCPIP was used as indicator using its color changing property. We labelled 17 test tubes with their content. One blank sample (with 8mL water, 2mL Hill reaction buffer), three negative controls with no chloroplast (and 8mL water, 2mL Hill reaction buffer, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP), three positive control samples (later mentioned as control group) with chloroplast only (and 8mL water, 2mL Hill reaction buffer, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP), three experimental samples with chloroplast and 1mL of atrazine solution(3 sample for kale, 3 for spinach and 8mL water, 2mL Hill reaction buffer, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP). Three replicates for both kale and spinach are tested for positive control (only with chloroplasts) and experimental groups (with atrazine). Enriched chloroplast was added by 100 μl per sample. Transferred the samples into spectrophotometer cuvettes, blanked the spectrophotometer with the blank sample and immediately measured absorbance at 600 nm of each sample and recorded the measurements. Put all cuvette under the light (white light lamp) for 10min, blanked the spectrometer with blank sample, and measured the absorbance of each sample, recorded the reading. Repeat this process for two more times and calculate the %change of absorbance: % change = [(Absorbance at time zero - Absorbance at time 'N')/ Absorbance at time zero] x 100%. T-test was used to examine if atrazine would cause significant decrease in photosynthesis of kale and spinach. T-test was also carried out between the average % change of absorbance of kale and spinach, to examine if atrazine will have significantly different effect on kale and spinach photosynthesis.


Results:
One of the samples in spinach control group barely changed color throughout the experiment, it was suspected to be an outlier. A modified Thompson Tau test was run at all time points (t=10, 20, 30).to examine the outlier (at t=30), tau×standard deviation= 41.216 (sample size= 3), which is smaller than δ = |1.604- 48.219|= 46.615.  At t=10, tau×sd= 24.101 smaller than δ =24.300, at t=20, tau×sd= 36.473 smaller than δ =38.774. This sample is an outlier. Reject the outlier.

As shown in Figure 1, %change of absorbance shows a general increasing trend for all four data groups. At t= 30: control group of spinach has an average %change of absorbance= 48.219 (with standard deviation= 35.806), while the spinach experimental group has an average %change= 6.959 (standard deviation= 0.359), kale control group has an average %change= 3.161 (sd= 1.933), and the kale experimental group %change= 6.974 (sd= 2.433).

To test for significant negative effect of atrazine on photosynthesis, one tail unpaired t-test was used to compare the %change of absorbance at t=30 between control and experimental group of each model organism: In spinach, p=0.026 smaller than 0.05. In kale, p=0.011 smaller than 0.05, both show significant differences. A two-tail unpaired t-test was carried out between the experimental groups of kale and spinach at t=30 to test for significant different effect of atrazine on different model organisms, p=0.835 greater than 0.05, shows no significant difference between kale and spinach experimental groups.


Discussion:
Based on figure 1 and p-values obtained from t-tests, the null hypothesis: atrazine will not have significantly different effect on kale over spinach is supported (p greater than 0.05). The p-values also indicate that atrazine has significantly negative effect on photosynthesis of both model organisms (spinach, kale) (p smaller than 0.05). 

The outlier in spinach control group may be caused by a concentration difference in chloroplast used. During the experiment, after the second centrifugation, when the supernatant was poured out, the sample in the centrifuge tube was accidentally mixed slightly, this may have lowered the concentration of chloroplasts to a certain degree. Beside human error, by repeating this experiment with greater numbers of replicates may help minimizing possible error. The large error bar on figure 1 also indicate the need of more replicates in later experiments as a potential way of improvement. 

Based on the functioning mechanism of atrazine aforementioned, a higher average % change of absorbance will be expected for the control group in comparison to experimental group, which stands true in spinach assay. However, from the actual experiment with kale, we obtained greater % change in experimental group than we did in the control group. The absorbance of experimental group is much greater than that of the control group from t=0, which indicate a possible problem in DCPIP.  The kale control group possibly didn't have enough blue pigments as other groups did although all DCPIP used was from the same container. Thus, this low %change in absorbance may be caused by unknown problems with the DCPIP, which remains as a question that should be verified in future experiments.

In conclusion, atrazine has significant negative effect on photosynthesis of both target organisms and will influence them in a similar manner. Although limited plants species (2) were tested, the result could still suggest a potential negative effect that would be shared by a wide range of plants species, including many agricultural crops. This could make people rethink the usage of atrazine in agricultural activities, since it is not specifically targeting at certain weed species but influencing a highly conserved electron transporting system that is shared by wide variety of plants. Further experiments could be done by testing effect of atrazine on more species of plants with more replication of each sample to increase the reliability of the data and lower the effect of one unreliable data have on the whole result.
