Title: Betta splendins Display Aggressive Interspecific Behavior Towards Poecilia reticulata 

Abstract:
Previous studies have shown that aggressive behavior is displayed interspecifically and intraspecifically with no significance in mean duration of these responses and response type. In our experiment, we hypothesized that, if a male Betta is in the presence of a non-aggressive fish species, then the studied Betta will not exhibit aggressive behavior to the same degree as it will towards another Betta. The behavior of a male Betta by itself and a male Betta in the presence of a non-aggressive Poecilia reticulata were examined and given a behavior score. It was found that the aggressive behavior was greater for Betta with the guppy than the Betta itself. According to the statistical analysis, the difference in mena behavior scores was significent (one-tailed paired t_test: t=6.83, d.f.=2, P=0.0208). Several factors such as tank size, physical appearance of competitor fish, and the method by which the behavior is measured determine the intensity of the aggressive behavior of Betta splenden. Betta display agnostic behavior regardless of the aggressiveness of the opponent since displaying aggressive behavior does not determine the potential threat that the opponent could be. Betta are just one species of many that interact intra- and interspecifically.  


Introduction:
Most organisms interact in some way within their own species and outside of it. These interactions cause organisms to display different behavioral patterns towards the other organism. 
These interactions can be seen in Betta splendins as well. Betta splenden, a Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fish that originated in southeast Asia. Betta display intraspecific behavior, or behavior towards those of its own species, that include two types of movements: broadside and facing. Betta display this behavior to show aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition. 
Poecilia reticulata, also known as a guppy, is a very common tropical, freshwater, fish species that originated in northeast South America. A guppy is a suitable species used to observe the interspecific behavior of a Betta because it is a non-aggressive fish species. This allows the behavior displayed by the Betta to be a response to the presence of the guppy itself, not a response to the aggressive behavior shown by another aggressive fish species. 
Previous studies have shown that Betta show threatening behavior, not only towards members of its own species, but towards other fish species as well [Johnson: 1973]. There is no significent difference in mean duration of agnostic behavior displayed between interspecific and intraspecific interactions [Miley: 1977]. There is also no significent difference in the response type between interspecific and intraspecific interactions [Cain: 1980]. 
In this experiment, the interspecific behavior between an aggressive fish species, Betta splenden, and a non-aggressive fish species, Poecilia reticulata was examined. In order to understand Betta interspecific behavior, we hypothesize that, if a male Betta is in the presence of a non-aggressive fish species, then the studied Betta will not exhibit aggressive behavior to the same degree as it will towards another Betta. 


Materials and Method:
As a controll, a male Betta kept in a small tank was observed by itself for five minutes. To observe the interspecific behavior of the Betta in the presence of a guppy, the same male Betta and a guppy were separated with a clear barrier in the same tank. The behavior of the Betta was observed for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, the fish were separated by an opaque barrier and given a 5-minute rest period. The 5 minutes of observation and 5 minutes of rest was repeated three times. In order to score the intensity of the behavior displayed by the Betta, a key was developed (Table 1). A one-tailed paired t_test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to analyze the data. 


Results:
The mean behavior score of Betta splenden in the presence of Poecilia reticulata (mean score=25.7, SD=6.51) was greater than that of the Betta splenden alone (mean score=0, SD=0) by 25.7. According to a one-tailed paired t_test, the difference in mean behavior score between the Betta splenden in the presence of Poecilia reticulata and the Betta splenden alone was significent (Figure 1. t=6.83, d.f.=2, P=0.0208). When observing the Betta behavior, the displayed aggressive behavior was similar to the previously observed behavior towards another Betta.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported. In our experiment, the Betta splenden did exhibit aggressive behavior in the presence of Poecilia reticulata and the behavior was given a score of 25.7. According to statistical testing, the difference between the behavior score of the Betta in the presence of the Poecilia reticulata and the Betta itself was found to be significent. 
Betta splenden display aggressive behavior as a way of warning potentially threatening organisms, both of its own species and of others. Although this behavior requires a significent amount of energy, it is beneficial in that there is a decreased chance of injury or death. If agnostic behavior is not displayed before attack, the chances of injury or death increases. 
Johnson’s study showed that Betta displayed slightly more aggressive behavior towards an aggressive than a non-aggressive fish species. This shows that Betta do not entirely display agnostic behavior to any species of fish, but use more energy in defending itself against aggressive fish [Johnson: 1973]. This finding correlates with that of our study in that aggressive behavior was shown towards a non-aggressive fish species but with less intensity. Although non-aggressive species, like the guppy, do not display aggressive behavior, they still have the potential of harming the Betta using a mechanism other than aggressive warnings. For this reason, Betta use energy to display agnostic behavior towards both aggressive and non-aggressive species. Chemical cues, tank size, and the method by which the Betta behavior was measured also contribute to behavioral response. Tank size and behavior duration are inversely related [Miley: 1977]. Since the tank used in our experiment was relatively small, this could have contributed to the strong agnostic response of the Betta towards the guppy. Physical features and type of response of the opponent fish also determines the duration and intensity of the Betta’s response. This is why Betta display agnostic behavior more often toward aggressive than non-aggressive fish species, but the duration of time these behaviors were displayed was similar [Cain: 1973]. The appearance of the guppy, its size, shape, and color, used in our experiment may have contributed to the response displayed by the Betta. 
Interactions occurs within and between every species, therefore, it is important to study these interactions in order to understand the impact organisms have on each other intraspecifically and interspecifically, and the impact they all have on the environment. In a future experiment, a different method of measuring behavior will be used to study the interspecific behavior of Betta splenden in the presence of both non-aggressive and aggressive fish species.
