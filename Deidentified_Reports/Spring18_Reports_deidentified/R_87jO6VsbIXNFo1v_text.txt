Title: The Significant Effect of Clay on Resource Allocation to Roots in Avena sativa

Abstract:
The purpose of this report and experiment was to understand the effect of clay on the development, specifically the root:shoot, of Avena sativa (oats). We hypothesized that oats grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay would have a higher root to shoot ratio compared to oats grown in only vermiculite soil due to resources shifting to the roots. The experiment was performed by growing six pots of oats over two weeks and watering every day. The first three potted seeds were placed in only vermiculite soil, and the second three potted seeds were grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay. At the end of the two weeks, we recorded various measurements of groups of five plants from each of the six pots, including root to shoot ratio and branching in the roots. The results revealed that oats grown in soil mixed with clay did have a higher root to shoot ratio for length and a significent difference in the number of branching roots. These results are important in understanding the role the environment, specifically the ground the plants are grown in, plays in oat growth, the effects of clay, and further experimentation.

Introduction:
This report studies resource allocation, which in this case, refers to where resources are acquired during plant growth and where energy is being sent in order to retrieve those resources. Resource allocation is fundamental to plant development, yield formation and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress (frontiersin, 2013). We specifically looked at how the roots and shoots of our plants developed. The shoot includes the leaves and stems of the plants. The leaves are the main photosynthetic organ of the plant, and the stem is the principle support. The roots’ job is absorption of nutrients from soil. Resources for leaves include solar energy and carbon dioxide from the air, while the nutrients absorbed by roots include water and molecules like nitrogen, sulfur, potassium, and phosphorus (Johnson, 2018). The distribution and utilization of resource are overall controllled by concerted actions of membrane-transport proteins and /or metabolic enzymes of cell types located in strategic positions within the plant body (fronterisin, 2013). We used Avena sativa for our research because they are easy to grow, especially in conditions that could be controllled, like the greenhouse and a watering schedule.

Materials and Method:
Avena sativa seeds were used for research of resource allocation in different growing environments. Three pots were set up for each environment for a total of six pots. We placed only vermiculite soil in three pots, and a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay in the other three pots. Then, about fifty oat seeds were placed in each pot and they were not fully covered by the soil or soil/clay. We labelled the pots and took them to the greenhouse. Each pot was watered until water dripped from the bottom. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. When the two weeks were over, we dumped each pot and measured five plants from each group for root length, shoot length, total mass, root mass, shoot mass, and branching. From these, we formulated root to shoot ratios for length and mass, and calculated averages and standard deviation for length and root for the two growing environments. Using the raw results, we made several graphs representing the data. The most relevant ones are included in the Tables and Figures section.

Results:
Measurements and results were taken for each environment. Results from oat plants grown in vermiculite soil were measured first. The average root to shoot length ratio was 0.882 with a standard deviation of 0.145. The root to shoot mass ratio for only soil was 1.571 with a standard deviation of 0.181. The average branching was 2.667 with a standard deviation of 0.115. Then, we measured oat plants grown in the vermiculite soil and clay mixture. The average root to shoot length ratio was 1.539 with a standard deviation of 0.0937. The average root to shoot mass ratio was 1.599 with a standard deviation of 0.0848. The average branching was 4 with a standard deviation of 0.4. These means and standard deviations are found in Table 1, as well as Figures 1-3, which are bar graphs with standard deviations bars. We also found the results of a two-sample T test. There was a significent difference in the root to shoot ratio for length of the two groups (soil vs soil + clay) (d.f. = 4, t-value = 6.59, p_value=0.00274). There was not a significent difference in the root to shoot ratio for mass of the two groups (d.f.=4, t-value = 0.246, p_value = 0.818). Finally, there was a significent difference in the branching of the two groups (d.f. = 4, t-value = 5.55, p_value = 0.00517). These statistical results are found in Table 2.

Discussion:
Most of the data from our experiment does support our hypothesis, stating that plants grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay will have higher root to shoot ratios than plants grown in only vermiculite soil. The number of branches also support our hypothesis because roots that branch more are clearly allocating more resources to get more nutrients from the soil. Our results prove that the mixture with clay made it more difficult for the roots of the plants to absorb nutrients. There was statistical significance in the difference between the root to shoot ratio for length of plants grown in only vermiculite soil compared to plants grown in a mix of vermiculite soil and clay. There was also a significent difference in the number of branching in the two groups of plants. This proves that a difference in soil will cause oat plants to change their resource allocation pattern to better survive in their environment. In this case, clay proved to be a more difficult material for nutrient absorption, which is why the root:shoot ratio for length was greater in the group of plants grown in the mix of soil and clay. This study is important because allocation of resources to fitness-enhancing activities is a major theme in plant evolutionary ecology (Lovett-Doust, 1989).
