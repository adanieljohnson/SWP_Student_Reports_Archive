Title: The Effects of Water Clarity on Aggression Displays in Betta splendins

Abstract:
In this lab, we were interested in analyzing the effects of reduced water clarity on the expression of aggressive behaviors by domesticated Betta splendins. Wild Betta fish are native to southeast Asia and are found in muddy waters, which is why this particular experiment is of interest. We predicted that making the water murky will not have an effect on the aggression of Betta splendins. This experiment was performed by observing replicates of fish pairs in clear and murky water, and counting the number of extremely aggressive behaviors exhibited. A two-tailed paired t_test was run to determine significance and a p_value greater than 0.05 was calculated. This led us to support our hypothesis that the murky water would have no effect on aggressive behaviors.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior, ethology, is a wide-ranging field that can be particularly useful in evolutionary biology. By analyzing the behavior of a particular organism, biologist can determine why that behavior has evolved and what evolutionary purpose it serves or did serve. One type of behavior that is frequently studied is aggressive or agnostic behavior. Aggressive behavior has been shown to positively correlate with boldness and higher activity levels (Archard GA, Braithwaite VA; 2011) and these sorts of behaviors evolved because they improve reproductive fitness. Betta splendins are known for their aggressive behaviors such as caudal fin flashing, protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes from underneath the opercula (known as the “red mane”), and ultimately fighting (Johnson AD; 2016). The first two behaviors are designed to intimidate an opponent and fighting is used a last measure in order to maintain dominance over females and resources such as food and shelter.  In this experiment, we are interested in analyzing the effects of reduced water clarity on the expression of aggressive behaviors by domesticated Betta splendins. Wild Betta fish are native to southeast Asia and are found in muddy waters, which is why this particular experiment could be potentially interesting. Prior research has shown that water clarity had no effect on cannibalism or oviposition in the bluefin killifish Lucania goodei (Sandkam BA, Fuller RC; 2011). The reason why water clarity had no effect is because these fish natively live in water with potentially low visibility and do not need high visibility in order to maintain aggressive behavior. Because Betta fish are also native to murky water with low visibility, we predict that making the water murky will not have an effect on the aggression of Betta splendins.

Materials and Method:
For this lab, we had three separate male Betta splendins individuals. After giving them time to acclimate to the environment, we systematically arranged the fish so that every combination of two fish could be physically separated but also visible to the other. The periods of exposure lasted for five minutes and we counted the total number of majorly aggressive behaviors (tail flashing and red mane displays) displayed during the period by both fish. We made sure to allow the fish time to rest between each period of exposure in order that the fish did not habituate. After observing each combination of fish pairs in clear water, we performed the exact same procedure with the same fish but in water that had added vermiculite. This made the water murky enough that we could not see all the way through the tank but we could still see the brightly colored fish in order to observe their behaviors. After collecting all of our data, we ran a two-tailed paired t_test to determine whether or not our results were significent.

Results:
When observing the fish in clear water, the average amount of majorly aggressive behaviors exhibited was 12.3±5.96. In contrast, the fish in the murky water on average exhibited 6.83±5.85 majorly aggressive behaviors. This information is represented graphically in Figure 1 below. While these averages appear to be distinctly different from each other, the two-tailed paired t_test revealed that difference in our data was not significent different (t_stat = 1.729, d.f. = 5, P = 0.14).

Discussion:
Because of the results of the two-tailed paired t_test, we can accept our original hypothesis that murky water does not cause Betta splendins to exhibit aggressive behaviors differently than when compared to fish in clear water. While these data are insignificent, this tells us a great deal about the power of evolution in Betta splendins. We used domesticated fish in our experiment that have been artificially selected for on the basis of aggression and color, however this experiment shows that they have not evolved to behave differently in their native habitat versus an artificial habitat like a tank. Biologically speaking, this shows just how evolutionarily rooted aggressive behavior is for Betta splendins.
The p_value we calculated is actually fairly low for insignificent data, which leads us to think that a slight alteration in the experiment could yield significent results. Previous research has shown that there are major differences between wild type Bettas and domestically raised Bettas in terms of the extent to which they express agnostic behavior (Verbeek; 2008). This gives us reason to believe that we could see different results if we performed this experiment with fish that had not been bred for their colors or tendency to fight. Additionally, it would be interesting to determine if different degrees of murkiness could cause an increase or decrease in aggressive behavior.
