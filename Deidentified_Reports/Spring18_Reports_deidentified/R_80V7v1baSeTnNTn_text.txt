Title: Decreased Growth in Manduca sexta Exposed to a 20E Blocker

Abstract:
Until Manduca sexta reach their adult life stage, they are considered pests. We fed a group of three Manduca sexta in their 4th larval instar phase Azamax, an ecdysterone (20E) blocking pesticide, to determine if blocking ecdysterone would prevent them from growing normally therefore delaying their commitment pulse. Our caterpillars represent healthy specimens in the beginning of the experiment and were compared to a controll group of three Manduca sexta. In nature caterpillars are exposed to many different elements and potentially a pesticide that block ecdysterone. We forcibly exposed our treatment group to a 20E blocker and saw that they grew differently in average weight and length than our controll group. This shows an increased possibility that blocking ecdysterone production in Manduca sexta inhibits their ability to mature properly. Our results highlight these potential effects on growth.

Introduction:
Hornworm caterpillars, Manduca sexta, are considered pests until they have pupated and metamorphosed into adult moths. During the 5th instar larval phase the Manduca sexta undergo a commitment pulse triggered by a hormonal drop in Juvenile Growth Hormone which triggers a spike in ecdysterone (20E): this occurs simultaneously [Johnson:2018]. This commitment pulse signals the beginning of pupal eclosion, the transition into the adult life stage of Manduca sexta [Johnson:2018].
This study addresses one major question. How would the Manduca sexta be affected if they were exposed to azamax, a pesticide that blocks 20E? It is known that the increase in ecdysterone is an important factor of the commitment pulse [Johnson:2018], however it is unknown to what degree the presence of ecdysterone effects Manduca sexta growth going forward if there is no hormonal surge to signal further growth in preparation for pupal eclosion.


Materials and Method:
For the Manduca sexta experiment we first obtained six healthy caterpillars in their 4th larval instar. Each caterpillar was placed into one of two groups; controll or treatment. Each group contained three caterpillars housed individually in plastic containers divided by index cards taped to the sides. Each of these groups were fed 10 g of “Great Lakes Manduca” food mixed with 5 drops of water if they were in controll group, or 5 drops of Azamax, 1: 1250, if they were in the treatment group. The water and Azamax, respectively, were added using disposable pipets and each drop’s volume was approximately 10 μL. 

To monitor the potential effect of the ecdysterone blocker, we weighed and measured each of the six caterpillars and recorded the initial data. The weight and length of the Manduca sexta were used as our dependent variables. The presence of Azamax in the food provided was our independent variable. To show the data we collected each day, we formed two graphs (Fig.1 and Fig. 2). The final data for weight and length means of the Manduca sexta are shown in two separate bar graphs (Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). For a final comparison of data between controll and treatment groups we used a two-sample T-test method that shows the difference in mean weights and mean lengths between each respective group.


Results:
Manduca sexta that were in each group grew at two different rates (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The average length and weight in the treatment group did not grow significently from the initial means (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The mean length of the controll group grew significently more than that of the treatment group (Fig. 3; t_stat = 2.925347, d.f. = 46, P = 0.005328). The mean weight of the controll group grew significently more than that of the treatment group (Fig. 4; t_stat = 3.83978, d.f. = 46, P = 0.000375).
The controll group grew an overall total of 13.3 cm in length, and 26.2 g in weight. The controll group’s final weights had an average of 9.8 g and an average length of 7.7 cm. The treatment group grew an overall total of 4.2 cm in length and 3.8 g. The treatment group’s final weights had an average of 2.5 cm and an average length of 5 cm. 


Discussion:
The results from this study merit further attention to test whether a longer period of time would affect the results or show a similar outcome in two areas. First, there was a relatively large gap in the growth of Manduca sexta who were fed only Great Lakes Manduca food, and the growth of Manduca sexta who were fed a mixture containing Azamax. These findings support that if a Manduca sexta in its 4th larval instar phase is exposed to a 20E blocker its growth will be inhibited. This will also prevent the commitment pulse or impact the commitment pulse in a negative manner such as a delayed response. Second, while measuring the length of the Manduca sexta there isn’t a sure way to determine if the caterpillar is fully elongated during measurement. This can cause discrepancies in data collected during the experiment. 
Our results show that when comparing the mean lengths and weights of the controll and treatment groups, the 20E blocker Azamax inhibited growth in the treated caterpillars, this would therefore have an impact in the prevention of the commitment pulse. The caterpillars in our study were housed so that they were only fed the food provided to them. The exception to this occurred during the second day of experimentation when the third controll caterpillar and third treatment caterpillar were found in the same compartment. The caterpillars in the controll group were 22.4 grams heavier upon completion of the experiment than those in the treatment group and were 8.3 cm longer than those in the treatment group. These results suggest that the controll group caterpillars were approaching the commitment pulse and pupation.
