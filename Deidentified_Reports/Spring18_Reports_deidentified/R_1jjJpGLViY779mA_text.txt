Title: Red Mane Protrusions of Betta Splendens in Shelter Environments

Abstract:
Animals utilize agonistic behavioral traits to protect themselves from threatening organisms. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if male Betta splendens who have access to shelter will demonstrate less aggression than those without shelter access. This was tested by observing the agonistic behavior of the red mane protrusions in three male Betta splendens interacting with one another, with and without a shelter in their environment. It was hypothesized that the number of times the red mane protrudes without a shelter present would be greater compared to the number of times the red mane protrudes with a shelter present. There was a significant difference between the mean red mane protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5,p-value=0.029). This could be due to the survival behavior of fish to go to shelters in the presence of predators.

Introduction:
Evolution allows the selection of specific traits that increase the fitness of an organism. The evolution of behavioral traits in response to competition is one example of how an organism has increased fitness. These agonistic behavioral traits can increase the likelihood of surviving in competition. Agonistic behaviors are aggressive responses to threats made by other organisms in the environment. However, an organism can choose not to utilize an agonistic approach if they see an unlikely chance of survival. One example of a submissive behavior, is hiding in a shelter. In oceans, a more common shelter for organisms is a coral reef. In our experiment we will investigate the interaction of two fish in an environment where there is a shelter compared to one without a shelter. Betta splendens, commonly known as Betta fish, were used in this experiment due to their known agonistic behavior. The red mane protrusion is one of the most threatening behaviors a male Betta will use when interacting with another betta fish. The natural habitat of the Betta splendens is murky water; where it is hard to see predators. One study found that Betta splendens had utilized their environmental shelters and decreased the agonistic response in order to survive from predation [Forsatkar et al.,2016]. It was hypothesized that the number of times the red mane is used without a shelter present would be greater compared to the number of times the red mane is used with a shelter.

Materials and Methods:
Three male Betta splendens were acquired and placed individually into one of the three divisions in an aquarium. Then, six trials were run of interactions conducted between the male Betta splendens. Three control trials were conducted to observe the average number of times the male betta presented the red mane in the presence of another male Betta splendens without a shelter present in their environments. In trial one, the first Betta splendens and second Betta splendens without any shelter were observed for five minutes. The observations were recorded and the Betta splendens were rested for five minutes. In trial two, the second betta and the third Betta splendens without any shelter were observed for five minutes; then rested for five minutes. Finally, in trial three, the third and first Betta splendens were observed for five minutes; then rested for five minutes. Next, the experimental three trials were conducted the same as the three control trials, but now with a shelter in each environment of the Betta splendens. One shelter was shaped in a dinosaur skull and the other shelter was shaped like a bridge; the shelters were large and covered the bottom of the divisions in the tank. The fish could go inside the skull or under the bridge. The shelter in the environment was random in each trial, no fish was assigned a shelter. One-tailed paired t-test was used to compare the number of times the red mane protruded between the control and the experimental groups.

Results:
The mean number of red mane presented in the control group was 98.15. The mean number of red man presented in the experimental group was 3.173.71. There was a significant difference between the mean red mane protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5, p-value=0.029). The mean number of red mane presented was higher in the control group compared to the experimental group, as seen in figure 1. The third Betta splendens did not display any red mane protrusions when interacting with the other male Betta splendens in each of the trials. This made the range of data larger since the first and second Betta splendens exhibited very agonistic behavior with the utilization of many red mane protrusions, especially in the control group where the most protrusions were identified.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported; the number of times the red mane is used without a shelter present was greater compared to the number of times the red mane is used with a shelter. This demonstrates that the male Betta splendens decreased its agonistic behavior in an environment with a shelter. This conclusion can be supported by the finding in another study where the intra- and interspecific relationships of coral reef fish: beaugregory - Stegastes leucostictus; ocean surgeonfish - Acanthurus bahianus; doctor fish â€“ A. chirurgus; common squirrelfish - Holocentrus rufus. The survival of these fishes was strongly correlated with the availability of shelter sites, predation pressure, and intra- and interspecific aggression among fishes using and defending shelter sites or territories [Shulman, 1985]. There was less aggression among fish who were near their shelter sites compared to those who wandered into open territory [Shulman, 1985]. When frightened by aggressors, the fish would move into their shelter sites in order to promote their survival from predators [Shulman, 1985]. This is similar to what was seen in our experiment where less aggression was observed by the male Betta fish in the environments where there was a shelter present. The presence of a shelter provided an alternative to utilizing agonistic behavior in the interaction with another fish. The open water environment is more threatening because the only choice the Betta fish has is to utilize the red mane protrusion or other agonistic behaviors in order to compete with another Betta fish. In the study, the coral reef fish were observed during a ten-day period, compared to our observation of only 5 minutes per trial [Shulman, 1985]. The aggression and sheltering behavior of the fish was also observed on a small corner of one reef and all interactions and shelter site uses recorded [Shulman, 1985]. Whereas, our experiment only monitored the Betta fish in the partitioned aquarium. The study also monitored multitudes of fish whereas we only monitored the behavior of only three fish. For future study, the experiment should take place in an environment more open and similar to their natural habitat, the behavior of more fish should be looked at, and for a longer period of time so the data is more precise. Identifying fish behavior in environments is necessary to improve fishing technology. The survival of a species targeted by fishing companies and conserving biodiversity of ecosystems is dependent on the knowledge of the behavior of aquatic organisms and the responsibility of fisheries to meet standards. Destructive fishing techniques are a threat to these coral reef habitats. The presence of a shelter lessening agonistic behavior in fish means that there should be more protection for coral reefs in the ocean to prevent the decline of populations. If the fish has a shelter, like a coral reef, the probability of agonistic behavior occurring is reduced and in congruence the likelihood of their death is reduced because they can have places where they can hide and avoid interactions with predators.

Figure Legends: 
This figure shows a comparison between the mean number of red mane present in an interaction between two male Betta splendens of the control and experimental groups. The mean number of red mane protrusions in the control, no shelter environment, group was 98.15. The mean number of red mane protrusions in the experimental, shelter environment, group was 3.173.71. There was a significant difference between the mean red mane protrusions of the control and experimental groups (t-stat=2.44, df=5,p-value=0.029).
