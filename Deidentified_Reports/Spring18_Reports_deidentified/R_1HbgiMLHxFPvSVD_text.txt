Title: Effects of JH Concentration on Weight of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
ABSTRACT: Manduca sextas are a type of insect similar to caterpillars, butterflies, and moths. In order to go through pupation, they are in need of the Juvenile Hormone. Precor has the same effects of JH, and will be referred to as well as used in place of JH for this experiment. This experiment will focus on the weight of the Manduca sextas throughout a week of observing and feeding. 


Introduction:
INTRO: Manduca sextas are a kind of insect that pertain to the Order Lepidoptera and have a life cycle beginning as a pest and eventually turning into a moth. The larvae stage is one of the most important parts of their life cycles as a certain hormone is needed in order to cause pupation. The specific hormone needed is called the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and is produced by the corpus allata. Although there are different kinds of JH, all of them help regulate the type of molt during development in a Manduca sexta. The levels may vary, but right before the commitment pulse, the level drops. According to Margery J. Fain and Lynn M. Riddiford from The University of Chicago Press Journals, the accurate level of JH needed is about 20 pg.  If Manduca sextas are treated with an addition of 3 drops of precor to their food, their weight will decrease. 


Materials and Method:
METHODS: The experiment began as we divided the eight Maduca sextas into two groups of four. For each group of four, we placed two insects into a plastic container with a barrier between them. Two of the containers included the controll group just as the other two containers were the experimental groups. The controll group was given a mixed substance containing 10g of food with 0.15Ml of distilled water. In addition, the experimental group was given 10mg of food and 0.05Ml of 4% precor. Finally, for a week, the insects’ weight was observed and recorded daily as they were kept in 25 degree Celsius refrigerators while alternating a 12 hour time span with light and 12 hour time span without light. 

Results:
RESULTS: None of the Manduca sextas died during the process. All of the insects, except one, weighed more on the last day than they did on Day 1. Control 3 Manduca sexta’s weight, however, started to decline after the first day as it lessened from 1.25g to 0.76g. (Refer to the additional figure and table sheets attached.). Figure 1 shows values in grams as the P-value is 0.002335 as well as before average as 1.15125 and the after average as 2.67875.

Discussion:

DISCUSSION: The hypothesis was proven not correct as the JH levels actually helped the Manduca sextas grow in weight rather than decrease. Although, JH levels drop right before the commitment pulse in a Manduca sexta’s life cycle, overall it still expedites the insect’s pupation which explains why the hypothesis failed. In simpler terms, the Juvenile Hormone is used to regulate development, and this is exactly what was seen through this experiment. The experiment only lasted for a week, so in the future it would be interesting to watch the insects actually follow through with their pupation to observe and see if possibly the effects would be different later on in their life cycle.
