Title: The effect of weight on the frequency of aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
The aggressive behaviors of the species Betta splendins was studied during this experiment. It was hypothesized that the larger the betta fish, the more aggressive behaviors that the fish would exhibit. Seven betta fish were used during this experiment and each fish was weighed in order to obtain the size of the fish. An opposing fish and the fish being observed were separated in a tank by a glass barrier and the number of aggressive behaviors were recorded. The results showed that the data recovered was inconclusive and did not support the hypothesis. No specific weight of fish appeared to perform the highest number of aggressive behaviors. 


Introduction:
The organism Betta splendins, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish or the betta fish, are native to the southeastern area of Asia, concentrated around Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Betta splendins exhibit two types of aggression, front facing and broadside aggression. Front facing aggression includes actions such as erecting the pectoral fins, spreading of the operculum, and the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane, in order of increasing intensity of aggression [Johnson AD: 2018]. Broadside aggression also includes three actions, also in order of increasing intensity of aggression -- pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson AD: 2018]. In the wild, Betta splendins change colors when showing aggressive traits, but due to selective breeding they no longer perform this feat in captivity [Johnson AD: 2018]. The male Siamese fighting fish is known for its displays of aggression towards other males of the same species and their often prolonged fights that can sometimes last over an hour [Simpson M.J.A. : 1968]. However, after some time the betta fish may become habituated to this type of exposure of other males and the aggressive behaviors will become extinct among the two fish [Baenninger R. : 1966]. Typically, fighting over resources or females comes with a cost of resources of its own, be it energy, time, or risk of death and the Siamese fighting fish often display aggressive behaviors when with other males [Arnott G. and Elwood R.W : 2009]. Generally speaking, in the animal kingdom, the animal with the biggest size advantage is the one who comes out as the victor of the battle [Beacham J.L. : 1988]. Because of this, I hypothesized that a heavier the betta fish would display a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors than a lighter betta fish.


Materials and Method:
The experiment was conducted in a lab setting. The betta fish that were experimented on all were bought from the same dealer and all had been in the same environment prior to the experiment. In the fish tank, there were two panes of glass separating two sides of the tank; one pane was opaque and the other pane clear. On one side of the panes of glass was the opponent fish, another betta, and on the other side the bettas being observed were placed, one at a time. While waiting to be observed, the other betta fish were in similar glass tanks. Six different betta fish were used in this experiment and they were all weighed just prior to exposure to the opponent betta fish. The opponent fish was not weighed as his aggressive behaviors were not recorded. The betta fish that were observed were placed in the tank and then the opaque pane of glass was removed so the two fish would become aware of each other. For five minutes, the betta fish that was weighed was observed and the frequency of three aggressive behaviors, gill flaring (spreading of the operculum), pelvic fin flicking, and tail beating, were recorded. Then, the opponent fish was given a five minute waiting period in order to prevent that fish from habituating to an opposing fish’s presence. This was repeated six times, giving the opposing fish a five minute waiting period each time. In order to accurately assess this data, it was placed into a regression line formula.


Results:
Each of these graphs below is a regression line based off of the frequency of the aggressive behaviors and the weight of the six fish that were under observation. The regression line can be seen as the light blue line, with the betta fish’s weight matched with their frequency of the aggressive behavior marked as a blue dot. Figure 1 measures the number of gill flares each fish exhibited. The lightest fish had the lowest number of gill flares while the heaviest fish performed the highest number of gill flares. Figure 2 shows the number of pelvic fin flicks that each fish exhibited. The lightest and heaviest fish both flicked their pelvic fins twice. In this graph, the lighter three fish exhibit pelvic fin flicking more often than the heavier three fish do. Figure 3 shows the number of tail beats that each fish exhibited. The trend line was raised by the high number of tail beats by the fish in the middle of the weight distribution as the fish on the two extremities performed a lower number of tail beats. A base p_value of 0.05 was used to determine if the data found was statistically significent. None of the graphs had a p_value of under .05, meaning that our data was not statistically significent in supporting our hypothesis. If the data supported my hypothesis, the trend line on the graph would have been presented as an upwards moving diagonal line and the R2 value would have been closer to the value of one. The closest results to this were with the behavior of flaring of the gills, with a p_value of 0.078 and an R2 value of 0.5805. The other two graphs, displaying the data about pelvic fin flicking and tail beating, had straighter trend lines with p_values much to high to argue statistical significance.


Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support my hypothesis that the heavier male betta fish would display aggressive behaviors more often than a lighter male betta fish. A possible issue with this experiment is that the fish that we chose to observed could have been habituated to seeing an opponent fish. Repeated exposure to other male betta fish without a long enough time period in between could have contributed to this as these fish under observation had been used by others in the lab previously [Baenninger : 1966]. Because size in fish often determines the victor of a battle, the larger the fish the higher number of aggressive behavior would be expected [Beacham J.L. : 1988]. A larger sample size would also enable more accurate statistics and could have possibly changed the outcome of the experiment in regard to the data of the number of gill flares. Increasing the sample size would be a route taken to continue this experiment. Repeating the experiment with the opponent fish being of different species is also a route that could be taken to build upon the experiments current data. Because food elicits aggressive behaviors among animals, introducing food into the tank with the two betta fish is also a route that could be taken going forward [Arnott : 2009].
