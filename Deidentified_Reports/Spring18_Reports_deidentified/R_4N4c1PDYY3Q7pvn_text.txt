Title: Increasing Amounts of Juvenile Hormone Diminish Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators, which are insecticides that mimic the effects of different hormones in insects, are becoming very popular in the world of agriculture. In order to understand which hormones should be mimicked by insect growth regulators so that crops can be effectively protected, it is important to understand the effects that certain hormones have on insects. The growth and molting of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, are largely controllled by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In order to test the effects of juvenile hormone on growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars we seperated eight caterpillars into two groups, a controll group and a treatment group. We gave the treatment group food with an excess of juvenile hormone and the controll group food mixed with water. We recorded each caterpillar’s mass and length once a day for eight days in a row. We hypothesized that the average mass and length of the controll group would be larger than the average mass and length of the treatment group. Our results showed a statistically significent difference between the masses and lengths of the two groups, with the controll group being larger than the treatment group. From this we were able to conclude that juvenile hormone levels and growth have an inverse relationship.

Introduction:
Hormones, which are chemical messengers that are part of the endocrine system, are key to the physiological functions of many life forms. For example, in many living organisms hormones are released by the pituitary gland, which is a section of the brain that is located below the hypothalamus. The anterior portion of the pituitary receives releasing hormones from the hypothalamus by way of blood capillaries, which causes it to release hormones into the organism. The posterior section of the pituitary stores hormones which are released by neurosecretory cells. After receiving sensory input from one’s body, the brain processes the information and sends out hormones in order to tell the body how to respond. In insects, these signals have two effects; organizational and activational. Activational effects cause a change in function of something in the body, while organizational effects cause a change in how the body is arranged. Two hormones that are crucial to an insects life cycle are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. It is important to understand how these hormones affect insects, because chemicals known as insect growth regulators mimic these hormones and are used as insecticides. Insect growth regulators cause changing levels of these hormones in insects, which results in adverse health effects. According to Priyanka Sharma, Sunil Thakur, and Pamita Awasthi, conventional insecticides are not nearly as effective as insect growth regulators due to their “slowness of insecticidal activity, pest resistance, and environmental concern” [Sharma: 2016], so the continued development of insect growth regulators is extremely important to the future of agriculture. Since levels of juvenile hormone controll the growth and life cycle of insects, juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists have “become the choice for insect pest controll” [Sharma: 2016], because differing amounts of the hormone can greatly disrupt the lives of insects. For example, if a insect receives a surplus of juvenile hormone, it is possible that it will never undergo metamorphosis and die. Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is a holometabolous insect that has a life cycle of about 39-48 days. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone work together to controll the growth and molting of Manduca sexta, so it is perfect to test in order to uncover information about the effects of these hormones on insects. More specifically, juvenile hormone, which is released by the corpus allatum, regulates growth and the type of molt that occurs. Ecdysterone, which is released by the prothoracic glands, controlls the timing of molting of the insect. The amount of juvenile hormone and ecdysterone present during critical periods affects what the Manduca sexta will become during its molt. If juvenile hormone is high, it will molt into an instar. Once juvenile hormone drops to a certain level, a quick rise in ecdysterone levels known as the commitment pulse occurs. This is what initiates the metamorphosis of the larva, and after this occurs juvenile hormone levels stay low and ecdysterone levels continue to rise. In addition, differing levels of juvenile hormone are presumed to have an effect on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. In order to understand how differing levels of juvenile hormone affect the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars, we decided to separate eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups of four, with each group consuming differing levels of juvenile hormone. The treatment group received additional juvenile hormone in its food, while the controll group received no additional juvenile hormone. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no significent difference in mass and length between the two groups of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Our alternative hypothesis was that there would be a significent difference in mass and length between the two groups of Manduca sexta caterpillars, with the controll group having greater lengths and masses than the treatment group.

Materials and Method:
In order to test how differing levels of juvenile hormone affect the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars we randoMly divided eight caterpillars of similar masses and lengths into two groups of four. The first four were selected to be the treatment group, and the last four were selected to be the controll group. Each caterpillar in the treatment group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of Precor, which is an insect growth regulator that replicates juvenile hormone. Each caterpillar in the controll group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of water. We isolated each caterpillar along with its food in the seperate halves of plastic containers. The caterpillars were stored in a refrigerator for the duration of the experiment. We recorded the mass and length of each caterpillar once a day for eight days. We then used a 2-sample t_test in order to test to determine if there was a significent difference in the average mass and length of the treatment and controll groups.


Results:
Total Length P Value: 0.006273
Total Mass P Value: 0.04631
Since both P Values are below 0.05, the null hypotheses must be rejected resulting in a statistically significent difference in both length and mass between the treatment and controll groups.

It is important to note that caterpillars 1-2 appeared to be barley moving by the end of the experiment, while the rest of the caterpillars appeared healthy (fairly plump, characteristically green, and moving without any trouble). Also, caterpillars 7 and 8 ran out of food on the last day.

	From our data, it is evident that level of juvenile hormone and size (length and mass) have an inverse relationship in Manduca sexta caterpillars. There was a statistically significent difference in both length and mass between the caterpillars in the controll and treatment groups, with the caterpillars in the controll group being larger. While there was a statistically significent difference in the mass of the two groups, the two heaviest caterpillars in the treatment group were slightly heavier than the lightest caterpillar in the controll group. Also, caterpillars 1 and 2 had a mass that was much smaller than caterpillars 3 and 4, despite the fact that all four caterpillars were in the treatment group. It is possible that the Precor was not mixed into the food 100% evenly, so that could have cause such a difference. If that was true, than the caterpillars that received slightly more Precor would have been the ones that were smaller than the ones that recieved slightly less Precor. On top of that, caterpillar 2 lost a minuscule amount of weight on the last day, and caterpillars 7 and 8 lost a larger chunk of weight. Caterpillars 7 and 8 were completely out of food on the last day, so that could be the reason for these results. Despite this, on average the mass of controll group caterpillars (3.63 grams) was much larger than that of the treatment group caterpillars (2.52 grams). Also, the average change in mass of the controll group (2.36 grams) was much larger than that of the treatment group (1.35 grams). The difference between the lengths of the treatment and controll groups was extremely statistically significent. The shortest controll group caterpillar was longer than the longest treatment group caterpillar. The average length in centimeter for the controll group (6.25 centimeters) was much longer than the average length for the treatment group (5.01 centimeters). The average change in length of the controll group (1.94 centimeters) was also greater than the average change in length of the treatment group (1.08 centimeters).

Discussion:
Based on our results, we are able to conclude that the difference in mass and length between the controll group (recieved no additional juvenile hormone) and the treatment group (received 5 drops of Precor each in food) of Manduca sexta caterpillars is statistically significent. This is due to the fact that juvenile hormone limits the growth of insects and keeps them in the larval stage. If juvenile hormone levels are high at the time of molting, then the insect will molt into another instar. While juvenile hormone levels are high, a relatively small percentage of an insect's growth occurs. According to Frederik Nijhout, only about 10% of a Manduca sexta’s body mass is from the first four instar periods, while growth during the last instar period “accounts for about 90% of final body mass” [Nijhout: 2013]. This is due to the fact that during the first four instar periods juvenile hormone levels remain high, but they begin to taper off towards the end of the fourth instar period. Once juvenile hormone levels decrease, most of the caterpillar’s growth occurs. After this occurs, a small spike in ecdysterone known as the commitment pulse occurs. The commitment pulse lets the insect know that it has enough body mass to undergo metamorphosis and become an adult. If juvenile hormone levels always remain high, than the insect will never grow to the extent that it otherwise would have. Also, the commitment pulse would never occur, which would prevent the insect from ever undergoing metamorphosis and becoming an adult. Since the treatment group was given additional juvenile hormone, it makes sense that the average mass and length of the group were smaller than the average mass and length of the controll group. The surplus juvenile hormone made it so that the treatment group was not able to grow to the extent that it otherwise would have. Since juvenile hormone levels were higher than normal, it would have taken the caterpillars much more time than usual to grow to the size that allows it to undergo metamorphosis. Similar experiments have resulted in the same results. For example, in an experiment conducted by Christen Mirth in which the effects of juvenile hormone on growth of insects such as Drosophila and Manduca sexta, the results showed that juvenile hormone does infact regulate growth rates. It was found that in regards to Manduca sexta specifically “JH acts to regulate the growth of the imaginal discs” [Mirth: 2014]. As a result, when exposed to increasing levels of juvenile hormone, the insect experiences less growth in a given period of time than an insect that is not exposed to increasing levels of juvenile hormone. According to Mirth, insects that are exposed to more juvenile hormone are “smaller due to a reduced growth rate” [Mirth: 2014]. The next logical step for this study would be to expand the sample size and experiment with multiple levels of added juvenile hormone rather than just one level. Doing this could help us achieve a better understanding of how many different levels of juvenile hormone affect insect growth. Another important step to take in a future study would be to make sure that none of the caterpillars run out of food, for two of ours did. These two caterpillars experienced some weight loss on the last day, and this weight loss could be attributed to the caterpillars running out of food. Finally, it would be important to make sure the juvenile hormone chemical is mixed into the food evenly. If it is not, the results of the experiment could be affected, because some caterpillars will unintentionally receive slightly more or slightly less juvenile hormone than others. It is possible that this happened in our experiment, for caterpillars 1 and 2 were smaller than caterpillars 3 and 4 by a good margin despite the fact that all caterpillars were supposed to receive the same amount of juvenile hormone. As stated in the introduction, the information gathered from this experiment is important because insect growth regulators are used as insecticides in order to benefit agriculture. Insect growth regulators are chemicals that mimic hormones in insects, so understanding the effects that different hormones have on insects is crucial to selecting which insect growth regulators would be most effective. Agriculture is crucial to society as a whole, so it is extremely important that we have a thorough understanding of how certain hormones affect insects.
