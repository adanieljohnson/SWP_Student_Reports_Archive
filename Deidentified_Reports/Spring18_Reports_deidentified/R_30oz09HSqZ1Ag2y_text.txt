Title: The Impact on Neomycin on the IP3 Signaling Pathway 

Abstract:
Signal Transduction plays a crucial role in the growth and movement of many organisms in response to their environments. The model organism that was used in order to analyze and interpret this idea was the P. polycephalum plasmodium. The purpose of this study was to use cytoplasmic streaming to study the periods of oscillation within the P. polycephalum plasmodium. Our hypothesis for this experiment was that the oscillation period in the presence of neomycin would be shorter. In order to properly measure and analyze this data, the P. polycephalum plasmodium, coated in water, were given 100 microliters of diluted neomycin then three timed trials were taken; one after 1 minute of being exposed to the neomycin, one after 11 minutes and finally one after 21 minutes. After these trials were performed it was reasonable to conclude that the oscillation periods of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium became shorter, which was seen through our decreased or “faster” times across the three trials. This ultimately supported our hypothesis and thus leads us to conclude that the mobility of a Physarum polycephalum plasmodium cell or the length of the oscillation periods is greatly impacted by the presence of neomycin. Therefore PLC plays a role in the oscillation of P. polycephalum plasmodium.

Introduction:
Signal Transduction is a widely complex system that utilizes an extensive amount of different pathways in order to trigger cellular responses. The first messengers of signaling are most often hormones or ligands that facilitate a response and stimulate the continuation of the signal along the chemical pathway (Kramer, 21). These messengers help to progress the signaling process overall and bring the signals to the second messengers. Second messenger serves as means of activation for a cascade of reactions within the cell. These reactions propel the activation of various protein kinases, which leads to protein synthesis and gene expression (Keltner, 60). 
There are a wide variety of different factors that can inhibit and affect the gene expression through the inhibition of the first and second messengers. The blockage of PLC production causes a variation in the auto-oscillatory function of the P. polycephalum plasmodium (Matveeva, 255). Our model that we are using in order to study these factors are Physarum polycephalum plasmodium cells, which are multicellular organisms. These Physarum polycephalum plasmodium are ideal for this study of signal transduction due to the fact that they allow us to properly analyze the auto-oscillatory state of motility (Matveeva, 758). Additionally, the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is an ideal model organism due to the fact its oscillatory movement mirrors many tissue cells (Matveeva, 758). The one of the major pathways that has an effect on this Physarum polycephalum plasmodium model are the ion channel coupled pathways, which specifically involves the coupling of phospholipase C and IP3 (Matveeva, 255). The ion channel coupled pathway known that facilitates the production of PLC through the use of two second messengers, calcium ions and diacylglycerol (Matveeva, 255).  Based on the knowledge and understanding of this pathway, we can analyze what hormones could possibly inhibit this pathway. Neomycin is one of these inhibitors that could have an extensive impact on the functionality of the PLC pathway. This hormone serves as a substrate inhibitor for the PLC protein causing a variety of different alterations to the cellular responses through its binding to various other proteins (Matveeva, 758). Based on the information above, it is reasonable to assume that the presence of neomycin plays an inhibitory role in the PLC pathway overall. The presence of the calcium ion used cytoplasmic streaming, which is a second messenger in the IP3 pathways, plays a large role in the oscillation patterns of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium (Smith, 171).
 Based on the information above, we are aiming to analyze and interpret the specific ion-channel coupled pathways of the phospholipase C and the possible inhibition of this pathway that occurs as a result of the presence of concentrated neomycin. In order to properly analyze this principle we utilized a process known as cytoplasmic streaming. Cytoplasmic streaming shows the in-phase oscillations of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium and their frequencies (Smith, 171). These frequencies of oscillation are usually based on the varied levels of calcium throughout the cell (Smith, 171). The research question that will allow us to further investigate these ideas is what impact does the presence of neomycin have on the oscillation periods of our model organism, P. polycephalum plasmodium, in a slime agar stock plate.  Our hypothesis was, that as a result of the presence of neomycin, the distance of the oscillation period becomes smaller, thus causing a decrease in the amount of time in oscillation. Based on the above information, we predicted that the time trials taken of each strand of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium would increase due to the fact that it would take them a larger amount of time to change directions. 


Materials and Methods:
This lab used the model of Physarum polycephalum plasmodium stock plates in order to test the inhibition of the hormone neomycin on the PLC pathway. These stock plates were cultured 5 days prior to the experiment at 37 degree celsius using oatmeal and water agar solution. The process that was used in order to test this idea was cytoplasm streaming. Firstly, a three baseline-timed trials were taken by looking at each of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium plates under the microscope. In order to measure this base-line, the phase microscope must be properly focused. Before beginning the trials, it was necessary to locate a particular strand to time and then eventually treat with the pipette. Once the proper strand was located, the movement of the strand was timed. When the direction of the strand’s movement changed the time trial began, then when it changed direction again was when the time trial ceased. This process was repeated for each of the three time trials. Additionally, it was crucial to utilize the same strand for each of the time trials. Then, following these timed trials, 100 microliters of distilled water was added onto the stand on each of the plates of agar. Next, the three timed trials were repeated, solely measuring the times between when each of the strands changed directions. After these trials were taken, the diluted neomycin solution was made using the original 1 micrograms/ml of neomycin. The concentrated neomycin was diluted into 5 mL of distilled water to make 143 micrograms/ml. This 1:6 dilution was used to help elevate the effect of the neomycin due to the fact that it is a more concentrated solution. 100 microliters of the diluted solution was added to form a bubble on top of the strand. After the neomycin was added to the top of the strand, it was necessary to wait 1 minute. Then, the movement of the strand that was coated in the neomycin was measured in the same manner as the two previous trials. Once these three time trials were taken, a ten-minute time period was taken between the next three time trials. After the ten-minute break was taken, the measurements were taken using the same timing process seen above. Once the three time trials were completed another ten-minute time period began. After the final ten-minute period was finished, the timing process was repeated for a final time. The statistical test that we used to analyze the data collected above was a two-sample paired t-test for means. In this test, we compared the data from each of the three plates (1 min neomycin, 11 min neomycin, 21 min neomycin) and compared it to the data from the three time trials with just water. 

Results:
The mean of the data for the three plates for water was 61.69 and the standard deviation for the same data was 62.68. Additionally, for the data of the 3 plates for 1 minute neomycin the mean was 63.60 and the standard deviation was 325.62. The mean for the 11-minute neomycin was 50.29 and the standard deviation was 347.66. Finally, the mean for the 21-minute neomycin was 44.40 and the standard deviation was 153.62. When compared to water to the 1 minute neomycin yielded the results t(2)= 2.92, p = .83. For the comparison of water to the 11- minute neomycin, were not significantly different (t(2)= 2.92, p =.26). Finally, 21 minutes after strands treated with neomycin they oscillated at a faster frequency compared to strands treated only with water (t(2) = 2.92, p = .026). 


Discussion:
The overall results of our cytoplasmic streaming support our hypothesis due to the fact that we hypothesized that the length of the oscillation period of the movement of the Physarum polycephalum polycephalum plasmodium would decrease or become shorter due to the presence of the neomycin. Based on the results, it is possible to conclude that after 21 minutes of neomycin exposure the oscillation periods of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium were most likely shorter. We observed while performing our experiment that the movement of the strand would increase then when it was about to change direction it would slow down extensively. This decrease in time seen in the graph above is likely due to the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium across a smaller distance. A particular study that emphasizes these points analyzes the oscillations period of the P. polycephalum plasmodium. This study displayed the relationship between the binding of neomycin and the effects that it causes to the PLC pathway (Matveeva, 758). In this experiment, the neomycin caused a variety of different contractile oscillations for approximately 30 minutes (Matveeva, 758). Although our study tested similar fundamental ideas, we possessed varied results numerically due to the fact that our more rapid oscillations were not due to the increase in speed of the P. polycephalum plasmodium, but actually due to the fact that the overall the decrease in the distance of the oscillation period (Matveeva, 759). In other words, the shorter the oscillation period, the more rapid the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium seemed. The oscillation time periods were shorter, which ultimately lead to the seemingly trend of increasing speed across the timed trials (Matveeva, 759). Possible sources of error that could have caused skew in our data could be found in the variation of light across the three different microscopes that were used. One phase microscope, in particular, made it increasingly difficult to completely view the strands and as a result the timing each change in direction could have been affected negatively. Additionally, it is almost impossible to view that the movement of the strands are in fact increasing due to the fact that it is simply based on the perspective of the timer or the viewer of the strand. The only way a scientist can properly determine and observe the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is by recording it to see the oscillating of the P. polycephalum plasmodium. Finally, when adding the water and neomycin to the strand it was very easy to injure the strand with the pipette tip thus greatly inhibiting its movement. In the future, it would be reasonable to perform this same experiment over a longer amount of time so that the oscillations between the varied phases can be viewed more explicitly. Additionally, another possible variation that could be made to this experiment would be to use an even more concentrated sample of neomycin. Instead of doing a 1:6 dilution, it could also help to decrease the amount of distilled water the neomycin was dissolved in. It is important to not make a solution too concentrated due to the fact that if it was too concentrated it would kill the P. polycephalum plasmodium. Overall, this lab shows the mobility of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is inhibited by the presence of neomycin. This inhibition comes as a direct result of the decrease in length of the contraction phase in the oscillation periods.
