Title: Effect of Herbicide Atrazine on Spinacia oleracea (Spinach) and Brassica oleracea (Kale) photosynthetic activity

Abstract:
Atrazine is an herbicide targeting at photosystem II, an important complex of plants chloroplast. In this experiment, spinach and kale are used to test the effect of atrazine on their photosynthesis. Chloroplasts are isolated by centrifugation and used together with an electron acceptor, DCPIP, that changes color as it goes through redox reaction. The rate of photosynthesis is indicated by the % change of absorbance of the experimental solution (color: DCPIP). The experiment results show that atrazine has significently negative effect on both spinach and kale, and it influence both organisms in a similar manner by decreasing its photosynthetic activity. This experiment shows us that atrazine as a herbicide not only influence unwanted plants species negatively but could also influence photosynthesis in some agricultural crops negatively.

Introduction:
Living organisms need an energy source from the environment surrounding them. Plants and some prokaryotes, as autotrophs, can generate energy of their own by capturing light energy from the sun and converting it into chemical energy. This process is known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is "is arguably the most important biological process on Earth, and only two mechanisms for collecting light energy and converting it into chemical energy" (Bryant, Frigaard, 2006).
 
Plants photosynthesis consists of two parts, light-dependent reaction and light-independent reaction. In light-dependent reaction, plants capture photons of energy of particular range of wavelength by photosystems and convert it into chemical energy, NADPH and ATP produced in this process is later used as energy source for light-independent reaction. In light-independent reaction, plants take in CO2 through stomata and convert them through Calvin cycle into plant biomass. Plants serve as a producer in the food chain to higher level consumers as energy source (source of carbohydrate), which is the reason why large range of plants are farmed for food.

By studying the rate of photosynthesis, we learn about different conditions that may have impact on plants growth, for example light intensity, humidity and use of herbicide. DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, is an electron acceptor that is commonly used in the study of photosynthesis. DCPIP is an oxidizing agent, that can gain electron from PSI as an alternative of NADP as the terminal electron acceptor. This reaction is first discovered by Robert Hill, thus later known as Hill Reaction. DCPIP changes color from dark blue (with aromatic ring, absorb light at 600nm maximum) into colorless (with carbon double bond) after being reduced. By using its property of color change before and after a redox reaction, the rate of photosynthesis can be indicated by the change in absorbance of reaction solution (containing chloroplasts and DCPIP), which can be measured using a spectrophotometer (with wavelength set 600nm).

To make sure of agricultural productivity, people kept exploring possible chemicals that may act as herbicides to help controll the unwanted weeds from competing with agricultural plants for nutrients. Previous studies shown that herbicides usually function by acting at "a large number of sites of metabolic function and energy transfer in plant cells" (O. Duke, 1990). Common targeting metabolic processes are: amino acid and biosynthesis, photosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis, cell division and carotenoid biosynthesis.

In light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis, three types of plastoquinones (as electron acceptors) have been identified in previous studies: two of the commonly known plastoquinone QA, QB and a third plastoquinone QC (Guskov A., 2009). Reduction of QB (PSII secondary quinone electron acceptor) take place in two successive steps, once reduced and protonated, QB moves away from its binding site and immediately get replaced by a new PQ molecule, artificial quinones or herbicides (Lambreva, 2014).

Atrazine is an herbicide, interestingly known by its side effect (some scientists believe) of feminizing clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) (Hoseys, 2010). Atrazine function as herbicide by targeting at plants photosynthesis. Atrazine inhibits Photosystem II (PS II) at its QB site (Trebst, 2009). By inhibiting the QB binding site, Atrazine inhibits the transfer of excited electron from PS II, to electron transport chain in thylakoid membrane. The excited electron cannot reach PS I, there will be presumably no or less electron accepted by DCPIP. Thus, with the presence of atrazine, no or minor color change in Hill Reaction should occur as result. 

The problem of atrazine as herbicide is, this system of passing electrons from primary electron acceptor to plastoquinone is a highly conserved process in different plants species. Atrazine kills off weed by disrupting its photosynthesis, in the meantime, agricultural plants may also be influenced negatively. In order to learn how much of negative effect will atrazine have on some of common the agricultural crops, Hill Reaction is run with two model organisms, spinach and kale. (These two plants are used since they are very accessible, cheap and easy to keep in lab). In this experiment, absorbance (dependent variable) is measured over a course of 30 minutes, with the independent variable presence of herbicide and type of experimental organisms, under a constant environment of controllled humidity, pH level, temperature and light intensity.

Since atrazine inhibit QB site to reduce/stop photosynthesis, photosynthesis rate of spinach and kale are expected to be influenced negatively. Null hypothesis in this experiment would be atrazine will have no significently different effect towards kale over spinach. This null hypothesis is expected to be supported, since plastoquinone is highly conserved in plants. Also, the absorbance is expected to be relatively high and %change of absorbance is expected to remain low with atrazine presence (in comparison to assays without herbicide), since the transport of electron is disrupted between PS II and PS I, there should not be a large amount of electron reach to DCPIP, thus most DCPIP molecules will remain oxidized state and remain its dark blue color.  


Materials and Method:
Enriching of Chloroplast

We used centrifugation to isolate chloroplast from the leaves of spinach and kale. Four leaves from both experimental organisms (with veins removed) were grind with ice-bathed mortar and pestle with 10Ml of cold grinning buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Filter by cheesecloth and collected in a beaker, and 200 l of filtered liquid is transferred into a microtube stored. Filtered liquid in the beaker then poured into a 50Ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 200 G, 4℃ for 3min, with balance tube. Supernatant from the centrifuged solution was poured into another 50Ml centrifuge tube, debris left in the bottom of the first centrifuge tube. The supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 G, 4℃ for 3min, with balance tube. Based on earlier experiment on enriching chloroplast by differential centrifugation we carried out, the pellet obtained after a second time of centrifugation at 1000 G, 4℃ for 3min contains the chloroplast.


Hill reaction

In the Hill reaction, DCPIP was used as indicator. It served as an electron acceptor as an alternative to NADP. DCPIP undergo reduction reaction and lose its dark blue color:
2H2O+2DCPIP (dark blue)→2DCPIPH2 (colorless)+O2

We labelled 17 test tubes with their content. One blank sample (with 8Ml water, 2Ml Hill reaction buffer), three samples with no chloroplast (and 8Ml water, 2Ml Hill reaction buffer, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP), three samples with chloroplast (and 8Ml water, 2Ml Hill reaction buffer, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP), three samples with chloroplast and 1Ml of atrazine (3 sample for kale, 3 for spinach and 8Ml water, 2Ml Hill reaction buffer, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP) (detail seen in table 1.1). All samples beside the blank and three controlls without chloroplast needed to have three replicates for both kale and spinach. Enriched chloroplast obtained from centrifugation was used and added by 100 l into each assay that require presence of chloroplast. Transferred the samples into spectrophotometer cuvettes, blanked the spectrophotometer with the blank sample and immediately measured absorbance of each sample and recorded the measurements. Put all cuvette under the light (white light lamp) for 10min, blanked the spectrometer with blank sample, and measured the absorbance of each sample, recorded the reading. Repeat this process for two more times and calculate the %change of absorbance.


Results:
Determine rate of photosynthesis

The color change property of DCPIP before and after redox reaction was used, as aforementioned, to indicate the rate of photosynthesis. The greater change in color (measured as absorbance) over a certain period of time means greater rate of photosynthesis. Thus, % change of absorbance is calculated to indicate the rate of photosynthesis over a set period of time. % change is calculated by the equation: % change = [(Absorbance at time zero - Absorbance at time 'N')/ Absorbance at time zero] x 100%.

Testing effect of herbicide towards photosynthesis

T-test was used to examine if atrazine would cause significent decrease in photosynthesis of kale and spinach. T-test is also carried out between the average % change of absorbance of kale and spinach, to examine if atrazine will have significently different effect on kale and spinach photosynthesis.

In spinach photosynthesis, the p_value obtained from one tail paired t_test with data groups: average %change of absorbance s overtime (t=10, 20, 30; average %change of absorbance shown in table 2.1) with and without the presence of atrazine equals to 0.011039094, which is smaller than 0.05, which indicate a significently different %change of absorbance over time. However, p_value calculated from one tail paired t_test based on %change of absorbance of three replicates at 30min has a p_value of 0.121049, which is greater than 0.05, shows an insignificent difference of % absorbance between assays with and without atrazine.

In kale, from the same type of t_test, the p_value of average %change over time with and without herbicide presence (value represented in table 2.2) equals to 0.000918873, and p_value obtained from % change of absorbance of three replicates at 30min equals to 0.011322. Both p_value are smaller than 0.05, in kale both p_value indicate atrazine have significent effect on kale photosynthesis.

T-test is also applied to the %change of absorbance between kale and spinach, to test if atrazine has significently different effect on one experimental plant (kale) over the other (spinach). Unpaired two tailed t_test is used in this situation, since two different experimental groups involved and the direction of influence (more negative or more positive effect on kale over spinach) is unsure. Like in previous tests, p_value is calculated for both average %change (p=0.857258) of absorbance and %change of absorbance of three replicates at 30min (p=0.834752) between kale and spinach group. Both p_values obtained are larger than 0.05, no significent different effect is indicated.

The average % change of absorbance in blank solution remained the lowest compare to measurements from other groups and had very slight fluctuation on its data. In spinach, the average % change of absorbance with atrazine present was much lower than that of the group without atrazine. In kale, the average % change of absorbance with atrazine present is generally higher than that of the sample with no atrazine present. One of the samples in spinach chloroplast without atrazine assay lose its color rapidly in the course of experiment.


Discussion:
Based on the data we obtained, student t_test is carried out. A paired one tailed t_test is used on testing if there was a significent difference in absorbance of each sample groups with chloroplast from model organisms (spinach and kale) under the influence of the presence or absence of atrazine. Based on the p_value listed out above, the null hypothesis: atrazine will not have significently different effect on kale over spinach is supported (p&gt;0.05). For kale, the p_value indicate that atrazine does have a significently negative effect on its photosynthesis. While spinach has two conflicting p_values, one is greater than 0.05, one is smaller. Since atrazine does not have a significently different effect on kale and spinach photosynthesis, and atrazine does have a significently negative effect towards kale photosynthesis, atrazine should also have significent negative effect on spinach photosynthesis. The possible reason of a p_value greater than 0.05 may be related to the observation and measurement that shows one of the 3 samples in our spinach chloroplast without atrazine assay has abnormally fast color change and high %change of absorbance. This outlier could be the reason of causing an imprecise p_value. This may be caused by a concentration difference in chloroplast used and by repeating this experiment with greater numbers of replicates may help minimizing this error. The large error bar on the graphs attached also indicate the need of more replicates in later experiments as a potential way of improvement. Besides the limitation of the replication, during the experiment, after the second centrifugation, when the supernatant was poured out, the sample in the centrifuge tube is accidentally mixed slightly, this may have lowered the concentration of photosynthesis to a certain degree.

Also, graph 1.2 and table 2.2 both showed a greater % change of absorbance in the sample with atrazine than that of the sample without atrazine. The absorbance measured of the assay of kale without atrazine is lower than the absorbance of the assay with atrazine. Which support the hypothesis, that since atrazine is inhibiting the electron being accepted and passed through the electron transport chain, and reaching PSI, there will be no or reduced amount of electron to be passed to DCPIP, thus, with the presence of DCPIP, a higher absorbance is expected. The only outlier is one absorbance reading of one of the 3 samples with atrazine present at t=30min. The reading is slightly smaller than that of the samples without atrazine and is around 27% smaller than other two samples in its assay.

From the results shown above, we can reach a conclusion that atrazine will have negative influence on photosynthesis of both target organisms and will influence them in a similar manner (will have significently negative impact on their photosynthesis). This suggests a general and possibly widely applied influence of atrazine on agricultural plants as well as the "unwanted" plant species. This could be important for people to rethink the usage of atrazine, since it is not specifically targeting at certain weed species but influencing a highly conserved electron transporting mechanism in photosynthesis. This experiment could be carried out using more species of plants species and more replication of each sample should be used to increase the reliability of the data and eliminating possible effect of one unreliable data influencing the whole set of data negatively.
