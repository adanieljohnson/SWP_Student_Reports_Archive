Title: Neuromuscular Control in Rana Pipiens using Lanthanum Chloride

Abstract:

The Sciatic nerve controls the actions of the Gastrocnemius muscle which demonstrates some basic properties of neuromuscular control in Rana pipiens, a kind of frog found throughout regions of  North America.  Lanthanum Chloride is an inorganic compound that is used as a Calcium blocker, which sometimes inhibits reactions and contractions of muscles in muscle systems. The amplitude threshold is the minimum amplitude that can be applied to still create a pulse in the muscle.  If we inject the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle with a calcium blocking substance such as Lanthanum Chloride, the amplitude threshold will be higher after a relatively long exposure time.  For our experiment, we tested 4 legs, measuring their amplitude threshold pre injection and post injection.  We were able to note that the average of the pre injected group had a lower threshold amplitude than the injected group, but only by a small margin of 0.014 V.  The p-value was &gt; .05, meaning that our data was not statistically significant.  Ultimately, we were unable to accept our hypothesis that if we injected the Rana pipiens Gastrocnemius muscle with Lanthanum Chloride, the threshold will be higher after a relatively long exposure time because our data was not statistically significant.

Introduction:
The Sciatic nerve controls the actions of the Gastrocnemius muscle which demonstrates some basic properties of neuromuscular control.  Skeletal muscle in both vertebrates and invertebrates consist of thousands of myofibers which are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups [Johnson: 2018].  There are a variety of factors that affect muscle contraction such as its ability to stretch, the amount of fluid surrounding the myofibers, and the chemical environment [Johnson: 2018].  The Specialized Displacement Transducer, the SMT-100 or SMT-220 Striated Muscle Transducer, demonstrates the effect of increasing the stimulus strength on the strength of contraction of a muscle, the effect of increasing weight on twitch amplitude and work of a preloaded muscle, and the effect of increasing the frequency of stimulation on the contraction strength and muscle fatigue [Johnson: 2018].  The amplitude threshold is the minimum amplitude that can be applied to still create a pulse in the muscle. The application of these stimulus pulses prompt a muscle reaction [Johnson: 2018].  These pulses can be observed in Rana pipiens, or the Northern Leopard Frog, an amphibian found in various states around the United States and Canada. Theses amphibians are characterized by their brownish green color and dark round spots.  Lanthanum Chloride is an inorganic compound that is commonly used in research and can be used to block the activity of divalent cation channels, although mainly calcium channels [Glusa:1987].  Lanthanum Chloride has been tested on its blocking capabilities of dihydroergotamine which induces contractions in spirally cut human postmortem femoral veins [Glusa: 1987].  Through this experiment, Lanthanum Chloride inhibited the dihydroergotamine- induced contraction by about 90% [Glusa: 1987].  Using these results from a previous experiment, our hypothesis is that if we inject the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle with a calcium blocking substance such as Lanthanum Chloride, the minimum amplitude threshold will be higher than the pre injected muscle after a relatively long exposure time.  


Materials and Methods:

In order to conduct this experiment, we gathered four Rana pipien legs and peeled away the skin to expose the muscles.  We then separated the the Gastrocnemius muscle, cutting it at the Achilles and tying it up to the force transducer connected to the iWorks software to measure how much it moved after each electric shock was administered.  We then fully exposed the Sciatic nerve and connected silver string under it which conducted the shocks, making sure that the two pieces of silver string were not crossing.  We repeated this process with each of the four legs.  Then, we tested the amplitude threshold of the leg, starting with 1V, without injecting any substance until we got to its minimum amplitude threshold.  We repeated this process three times for each leg. We then injected 0.1mL of Lanthanum Chloride with a concentration of 1 mM into the Gastrocnemius muscle and waited 8 minutes, massaging the muscle to get the chemical across the membrane.  Once we found the amplitude threshold, we waited another minute and found the amplitude threshold at that time, and then waited another minute and found the amplitude threshold again.  We repeated this process for each leg.  We then averaged the values found for each of the legs, and then averaged those values to create an overall average for the pre injected legs and the injected legs. We used a paired t-test. 

Results:

For the pre injected legs, the average amplitude threshold was 0.046 V with a standard deviation of +/- .037 V, while the injected legs amplitude threshold was 0.059 V with a standard deviation of +/- 0.023 V.  This shows that the legs there were injected with Lanthanum Chloride had a threshold that was 0.014 V higher than that of the average pre injected leg.  The amplitude threshold for the pre injected leg remained constant after each test.  Contrastingly, the injected tests for leg 1 fluctuated by .05V after each minute, while still staying above the amplitude threshold of the pre injected tests.  However, for leg 2, the injected tests remained constant at a high amplitude threshold.  It should be noted that the 2nd leg had a higher starting amplitude threshold than that of the rest, which made the averages of the injected and pre injected muscles much closer together, creating a smaller difference. We had a p-value of 0.22, a t-value of 1.52, and degrees of freedom of 3. 


Discussion:
This experiment did not support my hypothesis that if we injected the Gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipien with a Calcium blocking substance such as Lanthanum Chloride, the amplitude threshold would be higher than that of the pre injected muscle after a relatively long exposure time because the p-value was &gt; .05, causing us to fail to reject the null hypothesis.  Lanthanum Chloride serves as a blocking element to Calcium channels and in some cases creates calcification in muscles, inhibiting reaction times.  While we were able to see the Lanthanum Chloride slightly increase the amplitude threshold, prompting it to be slightly more than the amplitude threshold of the pre injected leg, there was not enough variation in the data to prove that these results were statistically significant.  If given a larger dosage of Lanthanum Chloride and for a longer period of time, it is reasonable to conclude that the amplitude threshold of the injected muscle would be much higher than that of the pre injected muscle.  It would give the chemical a longer amount of time to diffuse through the membrane and affect the muscle, slowing down processes.  Scientists have done a variety of similar experiments to see if Lanthanum Chloride does in fact act as a Calcium blocker in a variety of different areas of the body [Glusa:1987].  The presence of Lanthanum Chloride made it more difficult for contractions to occur, which is similar to the experiment that we just conducted with the blocking of Calcium channels, making it more difficult to trigger a reaction, thereby yielding similar results, although with more variation and a statistically significant outcome [Glusa: 1987].  This particular experiment tested a relatively longer exposure time and was conducted on human femoral veins rather than the Gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipien, causing a discrepancy between our results [Glusa: 1987].  Knowing what causes and inhibits muscle contraction is important to understand as muscles make up a significant portion of our bodies and play a key role in how we live our lives and function in everyday society.

The difference between the two groups is very small, with the injected group voltage being slightly higher than that of the pre injected group.  The p-value is &gt; .05, the two groups are not statistically different from one another  (n=4).  The measure of error shown is the standard deviation.  The average of the pre injected group is 0.046 +/- .037, and the average of the injected group is 0.05975 +/- 0.023.  The t-value was 1.52 and the degrees of freedom was 3.
