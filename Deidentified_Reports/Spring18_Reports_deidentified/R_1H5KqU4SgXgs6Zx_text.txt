Title: Murky Water Decreases Aggressive Facing Behaviors in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
	The murkiness of water affects the behaviors of Betta splendins. There are three aggressive facing movements that betta fish exhibit—erecting pectoral fins, spreading gill  covers, and showing “mane.” In this experiment, we observed and rated on a scale system the aggressive behaviors of male betta fish when encountered with another male betta fish. The biological question we addressed was: does water murkiness affect a fish’s aggressive behaviors towards other male fish? We hypothesized that in murky water, a male betta fish will display less aggressive behaviors. We used a one-tailed paired t_test to test our hypothesis, and our results were statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.029. The betta fish in murky water averaged to be less aggressive, supporting our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Betta fish behave differently in murky water and clear water. Murky water is their natural environment, and they are less likely to see clearly. Therefore, if a fish can’t see another fish clearly, particularly a male fish in the same enclosure, we predicted that it is less likely to demonstrate aggressive behavior. 
Paul M. Bronstein found that when observing aggressive behaviors of male betta fish, it is ideal to use distilled clear tap water and avoid colors on the bottom of the aquarium tank. He found that bettas exhibit their most aggressive behaviors when the water has no chemicals or color tints, and they become less aggressive when the environment is more similar to their natural habitat. His study allows us to conclude that bettas in murky water are less likely to behave aggressively towards one another (Bronstein: 1985). 
	Additionally, Harlioglu and Yonar conducted a study of how the color of a betta fish’s habitat affects its behaviors. They observed both the aggressive behaviors and the nesting behaviors of betta fish and concluded that the closer the color of their water was to their natural habitat, the more positive the effects were on their behavior, such as decreased agitation. The natural habitat of betta fish is vegetated swamps, in which water is typically brown or green-tinted. The water colors Harlioglu and Yonar found lead to the most positive behavioral effects on betta fish were green and grey. They also studied the effects on the behavior of betta fish in habitats containing real plants versus plastic plants, and found that habitats containing natural water plants led to the creation of more bubble nests and less aggressive behaviors of betta fish. Harlioglu and Yonar’s study demonstrates how betta fish have evolved to live in domesticated habitats, but how these habitats often lead to changes in nesting patterns and aggressive behaviors (Harlioglu, Yonar: 2007). 
Our biological question is: will murky water affect facing behaviors of the male betta fish? Our hypothesis is that murky water will decrease aggressive facing behaviors. Facing movements, an expression of aggressive behavior in betta fish, include facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading gill covers, and showing “mane.” 
It is important to study animal behavior because it shows us how animals evolve over time in response to their environment. It also demonstrates how domesticated betta fish that are not in their natural habitat may behave differently than betta fish in environments that are more similar to their natural habitat. 


Materials and Method:
	For this experiment, we had a small aquarium with three fish in it, separated by both opaque and clear dividers. First, we ran our experiment with clear water. We removed the opaque divider, leaving the clear in place, and observed the aggressive behaviors of the fish for five minutes. To quantify the aggressive behavior of the betta fish, we used a points system. After counting how many times each fish exhibited a facing movement, we ranked it on a scale from one to three—erecting its pectoral fins receiving a score of 1, spreading its gill covers scoring 2, and protruding the branchiostegal membrane scoring 3. We multiplied the scores with the number of times the facing movements were exhibited and added numbers up to quantify an overall rating of aggressive behavior. After observing the fish for five minutes, we let them rest for another five minutes. Next, we repeated the procedure, but compared fish B and fish C. Following a five minute break, we repeated the procedure for fish A and fish C after switching the placement of fish B and fish C. 
	After recording our observations, we poured potting soil into the aquarium and mixed it with the water to create murkiness. We repeated the procedure above and recorded our observations. 
	Preceding quantifying the aggressive behaviors of each fish, we used a one-tailed paired t_test to determine whether our results were statistically significent. 


Results:
	Based on our data, the fish in clear water were more aggressive than the fish in murky water. As seen in Figure 1, the mean aggressiveness score of the fish in clear water was 56.83 ± 15.94, and the mean in murky water was 30.17 ± 22.37. Our results were statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.029. Overall, the fish in clear water demonstrated more aggressive behaviors than the fish in murky water. 

Discussion:
	The results of the experiment supported our hypothesis and were statistically significent. We predicted that the betta fish in the murky water would be less aggressive, and our predictions were correct. Because they couldn’t see as far, they lost interest soon after recognizing the other fish, so while they still displayed aggressive behaviors, we observed that the behavior didn’t last as long, making the aggressiveness score average among the fish in the murky water lower than the scores of the fish in the clear water. Also, it is likely that their behavior was affected by the fact that the murky water is their natural habitat. 
	A source of error could be that the fish’s behaviors were affected throughout the experiment because of familiarity with the other fish. If we had spaced out the trials more, it is possible that we could have obtained more accurate results. Dzieweczyński and Perazio found in their 2012 study that familiarity with other betta fish could influence a fish’s behavior. They claimed that bettas showed signs of familiarity with other fish they encountered for up to four hours. Their gill flaring and tail beating behaviors were affected, and the familiarity effect almost always lasted at least 4 hours (Dzieweczyński et al: 2012). Therefore, throughout the trials, it is possible that the bettas were becoming familiar with one another and their aggressive behaviors were impacted. 
	It is important to observe the behaviors of animals to understand how they have evolved over time. The aggressive behaviors of betta fish, in particular, are important to study to see how they have evolved throughout a history of domestication. It reveals the human impact on the evolution of the species.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Effect of murky water vs clear water on aggressive behaviors of Betta splendins. Aggressive behaviors of three male betta fish were observed and quantified on a scale from 1 to 3, then multiplied by the number of times they occurred. Aggressive behavior data was grouped by water type. The bars represent the average aggressiveness score of the fish in the clear water and the fish in the murky water. Error bars are ± 15.94 s.d. for the clear water group and ± 22.37 for the murky water group.
