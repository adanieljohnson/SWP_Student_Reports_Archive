Title: Precor Causes a decrease in weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effect of Juvinielle Hormone, JH, on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. There were eight caterpillars in this experiment; four were given the controll diet and the other four were given 1: 1250 Precor having JH in their diet. Each caterpillar had their own food and half of the container to live in, isolating them. Every day for eight days, the caterpillars were weighed and the data was recorded. They also were given 10 more drops of Precor for the test caterpillars and 10 drops of water for the controll caterpillars. This paper sought to answer: How does JH affect the weight of M. Sexta Caterpillars? This paper will show were the JH caused the test caterpillars to weigh significently less than the controll hormones at the end of the eight days. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta Caterpillar is part of the Sphingidae family. They have a holometabolous lifecycle with four main stages: the egg, larvae, pupa and adult. The eggs are small, spherical, and are either colored or translucent. The larvae are vermiform, (worm-like), having clear segments. The pupa is enclosed by the final larval cuticle or by a cocoon. Finally, the adult has wings and reproductive organs. (Wake Biology 2018) While some insects look similar to their adult form as a baby, the M. Sexta looks very different in each stage of life. Juvenile Hormone, JH, naturally occurs in the caterpillar regulating the type of molt during development. These hormones are long chained organic molecules produced by the corpus allata; a pair of glands located on either side of the foregut. (Wake Biology 2018). This lab focused on JH and the effects it had on the M. Sexta. By adding additional JH to half of the caterpillars food, the affect of JH will be able to be determined. A similar study regarding JH on mosquitoes’ ovaries concluded that the hibernation of mosquitoes may be disrupted when JH is added orally to their diet or topically to their ovaries, (Spielman 2014). This shows where the JH hormone affects other creatures lifecycle. This leads to our hypothesis; an increase in Precor 1: 1250, the substance that has Juvinielle Hormone in it, the independent variable, added to the food of 4 M. Sextas will cause an increase in weight, the dependent variable, of the caterpillars. 


Materials and Method:
Gather 4 plastic containers with 4 notecards. Put a notecard in each container so that the container is divided in two halves. Label two of the containers for the controll group, (the caterpillars not receiving JH hormone) and the other two containers for the Precor test group. In each half of the container, put 10 grams of the food in each container. In the two controll containers, put 10 drops of water onto the food. In the two test containers, put 10 drops of the 1: 1250 precor mixture. Now weigh and record 8 M. Sexta caterpillars. Put one caterpillar in each half container. For the next week, come back everyday to weigh the caterpillars and give the controll 10 more drops of water and the tests 10 more drops of precor. If the caterpillars run out of food, give them 10 more grams.For a picture of the setup, see figure 1.  


Results:
The M. Sexta caterpillars that were given the precor weighed less than the caterpillars that ate the regular food at the end of the experiment. However, for the first three days the results were very similar. The test group did not start substantial growth until day 6; three days after the controll group. The total growth of the test group was less than half that of the controll group. The graph of figure 2 shows these results. The statistical data is a two sample t_test. As shown in the graph above, the first sample is the controll group, and the second is the test group.




Discussion:
These results did not support the hypothesis because instead of growing bigger than the controll group, the test M. Sexta actually were smaller than the controll group. Upon further reflection, the results may be a logical result of the timing of the natural production of JH. JH is a juvenile hormone that is only produced when the caterpillars are young. As caterpillars mature, their natural product of JH decreases, allowing them to gain weight and grow much larger. By giving the caterpillars the precor that included JH, the natural development of the caterpillars may have been fooled into remaining a younger phase longer; consequently, their growth was slower than the controll group. In another study on fruit flies, the effects of JH and TH were tested with similar results. 
 In another study on fruit flies the affects of JH and TH were tested shows there may be similarities in the hormonal regulation of programmed cell death between insects and amphibians. These observations go to show where THs may have similar effects to 20E (Flatt 2006). The hormone 20E and JH work together so there would also be a relationship between the TH and JH. 
There are a few sources of error that could lead to small differences in results. The first systematic error is the accuracy of the scale. The scale may have been off skewing the results when weighing the M. Sexta. Another source of systematic error is not feeding the caterpillars on a regular basis. Every night, more drops of water or JH was added to the food, but giving the caterpillars fresh food may have caused them to eat more causing an increase in weight. If this lab were to be repeated, I would put each caterpillar in their own container. This is because two caterpillars in our experiment began to eat the index card separating them from each other. This created a confounding variable because this was not expected to happen. However, because the two caterpillars that shared this container had a great variance in weight, it was easy to tell which caterpillar was which. By putting each caterpillar in their own container, it eliminates the possibility of the M. Sexta getting mixed up with each other.
