Title: Effects of Decreased Calcium Presence on Neuromuscular Junction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Positive calcium ions flowing from action potential in neuromuscular junction are responsible for contraction of vertebrate and invertebrate muscles. This experiment tested the significance of decreased calcium ion presence in the gastrocnemus muscle of leopard frogs (Rania pipiens) by comparing thresholds of muscle movement (V) in calcium-decreased and calcium-regular legs. The prediction was that the legs tested with lower calcium levels would lead to higher threshold. Overall, the data was faulty and spotty, probably due to experimental procedure error.The two-sample t_test ran against the data gave a p_value of 0.239, which was not significent enough to accept the hypothesis.  

Introduction:
Neuromuscular controll in vertebrates is controllled in part by the neuromuscular junction, the synapse between motor neurons and myofibers such as actin and myosin. To create an impulse that will hop from muscle to muscle, a reaction must be jump started. In the neuromuscular system, this reaction is jump started by the release of acetylcholine (ACh) as a result of a stimulus (such as a prick of the finger). The binding of ACh to the postsynaptic myofiber releases an action potential that then releases a source of positively charged calcium ions (Ca+). This calcium release is what signals for contraction. With this in mind, the importance of calcium was tested in this experiment to see if in decrease of calcium would change the voltage at maximum contraction could be reached. The experiment utilized the legs of leopard frogs (Rania pipiens), as the different muscles in this species are easy to see and manipulate [Hirabayashi: 1970]. Specifically, because of its visibility and size, the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog legs was chosen to be manipulated and injected with a calcium supplement. It was predicted that lower concentrations of calcium would lead to higher threshold than in tests run with regular calcium concentrations. 

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were used in the experiment, each to be tested with and without the calcium inhibitor. Each of the legs was skinned and then wet with frog Ringer’s solution. The thigh muscles were then separated, so that the sciatic nerve could be unattached. One at a time, the legs were carefully tied vertically to a stand, with a knob being used to tighten the apparatus- the legs were suspended using a force transducer. Pins were used to keep the legs steady on the dissection pad. Two wires were attached to the leg, which was then connected to a laptop with LabScribe. Starting at 0.1V, the legs were shocked with an electric current, and the frequency of exertion was recorded until threshold was reached. This process was repeated with an injection of calcium, and then completely repeated with the other two legs. A 2-sample t_test was ran against the controll (non-calcium) and experimental (calcium inhibited) legs to determine if the presence of increased calcium is indeed significent to threshold levels. 

Results:
There was not much correlation between lower calcium levels in the Rania pipiens legs than in the legs with regular calcium levels. The second leg, when tested on controll, had a noticeably higher threshold (0.126V) in comparison to the next highest voltage, the controllled first leg (0.44V). A two-sample t_test was run on the thresholds for the controll and experimental legs. The t-value was found to be 1.383, while the p_value was found to be a rather insignificent 0.239. 


Discussion:
The results of the threshold for calcium inhibited and normal legs of Rania pipiens were rather inaccurate, perhaps due to poor experimental method- the injection of calcium into the legs was particularly spotty, with possibly not the same amount of liquid reaching the sciatic nerve or even fully the gastrocnemus muscle. This is easily seen in the high variance of threshold (maximum: .126V; minimum: 0.016V). The p_value of 0.239 was not significent enough to support the hypothesis stating that the calcium-inhibited frog legs would show higher levels of threshold; the hypothesis was rejected. Further studies could explore the effects of different levels of calcium in different species (although neuromuscular manipulation on most vertebrates is difficult to attain ethically) [Birnbaum: 1997]. Another study could explore Rania pipiens again, but using different parts of the specimens’ bodies, such as the spinal cord [Bizzi 1995], and the same experiment testing the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens could be repeated with better scientific procedure. Such studies could help further knowledge in neuromuscular junction and its processes.
