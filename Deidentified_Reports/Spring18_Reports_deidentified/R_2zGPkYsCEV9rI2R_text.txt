Title: Presence of household laundry detergent does not diminish photosynthetic reduction activity in Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris

Abstract:
Household pollutants have been shown to pose risk for plants by potentially reducing photosynthetic ability. The present study was aimed at investigating the relationship between the presence of diluted laundry detergent, a household pollutant, and photosynthetic capacity in Spinacia oleracea (spinach) and Beta vulgaris (chard). Enriched chloroplast samples were treated with diluted detergent, and the change in DCPIP absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer and used as an indicator of photosynthetic reduction activity. Percent change in absorbance was calculated at four different incubation times (0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes). No significant differences in photosynthetic reduction activity were observed between the treated and control groups. It was concluded that spinach and chard chloroplast function is insensitive to the presence of dilute detergent over this time interval. Any genetic cause of this insensitivity could have potential implications for native vegetation and agriculture in areas with higher household pollutant concentrations in rainwater or irrigation. 

Introduction:
Household pollutants are chemicals released into the environment during everyday activities. These pollutants include bleach, paint, disinfectants, and cleaners. The release of such chemicals can harm human health and cause environmental issues, a fact that many people are unaware of. Detergents are one of the most widely used household pollutants. These water-soluble cleaning products can easily reach aquatic and terrestrial environments through wastewater, where they often remain for years since many contain surfactants which are resistant to biodegrading [Cirelli: 2008]. 

The presence of detergents in water can affect the process of photosynthesis in plant chloroplasts. In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, solar energy excites electrons in chlorophyll which travel through an electron transport chain, building a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase to produce ATP. At the end of the electron transport chain, electrons are passed to NADP+ to produce the reduced form, NADPH. The energy of the ATP produced and the reducing power of NADPH are then used to produce sugar by fixing and reducing CO2 in the light-independent reactions. The electron transport chain in photosynthesis is dependent on membrane proteins such as reaction center polypeptides, the cytochrome b6f complex, and ATP synthase. Hydrophobic membrane proteins can be dissolved by detergents in aqueous solutions [Voigt: 2007].   In addition, detergents reduce chlorophyll concentration [Azizullah: 2011], so less light is absorbed to power the electron transport chain. Thus, detergents have the potential ability to diminish photosynthetic reduction activity. This concept has been confirmed in past research. In a 2009 study, bean plants treated with detergent-containing water for 21 days were shown to have no more than 45% of photosynthetic activity [Jovanic: 2010]. 

The goal of the present experiment is to quantify the extent to which the presence of laundry detergent (independent variable) alters short-term photosynthetic reduction activity (dependent variable) in spinach and chard leaves. Because these species are representative of nutritious leafy greens included in many human diets, is important to understand the potential effects of household pollutants on their photosynthetic capacity. Changes in photosynthetic reduction activity can be visualized and quantified by adding 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) to a chloroplast reaction mixture. DCPIP is an alternate electron acceptor to NADP+ that changes from blue to colorless when it is reduced. This color change is measured with a spectrometer. If laundry detergent reduces photosynthetic activity in spinach and chard leaves, then there will a significant difference in % change in DCPIP absorbance over time between the chloroplast samples treated with detergent and positive control chloroplast samples with no detergent

Materials and Methods:
This study was performed on Spinacia oleracea (spinach) and Beta vulgaris (chard). Prior to this experiment, spinach and chard were grown under normal conditions (no detergent present). Before photosynthesis measurement, major veins were removed from the leaves, and they were ground into a paste with cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The paste was filtered and spun in a centrifuge at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4C. The resulting supernatant was spun at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4C. The pellet from each type of leaf was suspended in cold grinding buffer and used for chloroplast-containing samples. 
	
Samples were prepared by combining 6 mL diluted water, 2 mL 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Except for the no chloroplast controls and blank (no DCPIP), 100 L of enriched chloroplasts were added to each sample. Treated samples from each species received an additional 5 mL of either 10% diluted detergent or 20% diluted detergent. Diluted detergent solutions were prepared with Tide Free and Gentle, a commercially available liquid laundry detergent with no dyes. Spinach and chard samples were each treated with different concentrations of the detergent (0% (positive control), 10%, and 20%), and the effects on photosynthetic reduction activity were evaluated at different incubation times under artificial light (after 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes). Test tubes were prepared and tested in triplicate.

As a proxy for photosynthetic reduction activity, solution absorbance was measured at each designated time using a Gensys 20 Spectrophotometer. The % change in absorbance was calculated as % change = (Ai - Af)/Ai x 100%, where A was the measured absorbance at 600 nm. A higher %  represented a greater decrease in DCPIP absorbance and therefore more photosynthetic reduction activity. Statistical analysis of data was performed in Microsoft Excel. A t-test was used to compare the %  for each treatment at each time to the %  for the positive control. The difference was considered significant if p was less than 0.05.

Results:
The short-term effects of detergent treatment on photosynthetic reduction activity in terms of % change in absorbance are shown in Figure 1 (spinach) and Figure 2 (chard). Throughout the experiment, the samples with no chloroplasts showed no photosynthetic activity. After 30 minutes, the positive control (0% detergent) samples exhibited the highest % change in DCPIP absorbance, indicating the greatest photosynthetic reduction activity. However, all detergent-treated samples also showed little to no inhibition of photosynthesis. No significant differences in % change in DCPIP absorbance were observed between detergent-treated samples and untreated positive control chloroplast samples at any given time. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, we expected that the presence of diluted laundry detergent would diminish photosynthetic reduction activity in spinach and chard chloroplast samples. However, our results did not support our hypothesis; according to our t-tests, there were no significant differences in % change in absorbance between the treated and untreated groups. Little to no change in absorbance between the treated and untreated groups signified continued photosynthetic reduction activity in the presence of detergent. 
	
The lack of change in absorbance between treated and untreated groups likely indicates that spinach and chard chloroplast membrane proteins are not degraded by the presence of detergents in a 30-minute time period. This possibility is supported by a past study of the effects of detergent on photosynthetic activity in Euglena gracilis. This study found that the most severe response to diluted detergent exposure occurred in the light-harvesting pigments after 72 hours [Azizullah: 2011]. If membrane protein degradation takes hours, rather than minutes, to occur, the light-dependent electron transport chain would remain functional throughout the experiment and DCPIP absorbance would still decrease in the treated samples due to the continued reduction of the compound. 
	
Additionally, it is possible that photosynthetic activity remained unchanged because spinach and chard chloroplast proteins are generally insensitive to detergent exposure. While most studies have found the reverse, this phenomenon has been observed for chlorophyll a in the microalga Attheya ussurensis [Markina: 2007]. 
	
This experiment was also limited by confounding variables such as the presence of non-active ingredients in detergent-treated samples. For example, water was a main ingredient in the Tide Free and Gentle formula, and its abundance increased when the detergent was diluted. Because the treatment groups received 5 mL of this solution, their DCPIP absorbance values started off lower, mitigating any changes that did occur. The chemical properties of other non-active ingredients introduced another element of uncertainty into the experiment. The way that these ingredients interacted with DCPIP remains unknown. 
	
Future studies could account for these confounding variables in order to better quantify how detergent impacts photosynthetic activity in spinach and chard leaves. A greater number of treatment groups (various concentrations of detergent) and a greater number of replicates for each sample type could clarify results and better work toward the end goal of better understanding the link between household pollutants and photosynthesis in terrestrial plants. It would also be useful to attempt this experiment with leaves that had been grown with water containing a diluted detergent solution. This would mimic how plants are exposed to detergents in their natural environments. In addition, since solubility of membrane proteins depends on temperature [Schnitzer: 2003], it would be useful to perform a similar experiment with a temperature matrix to better understand how trace amounts of detergent would affect the photosynthetic abilities of leafy greens in a non-laboratory setting.  
	
While most studies in the past have found that household detergents have detrimental effects on photosynthetic activity, a lack of response to the stressor is not unprecedented. In the previously mentioned Euglene gracilis study, a recovery trend in quantum yield of photosystem II was observed after initial exposure to detergent solutions [Azizullah: 2011].  Immediate non-response, as observed in our experiment, could have significant implications for both wild and cultivated plants of many species. For instance, plants that are more resistant to chloroplast functional degradation in the presence of detergent could be naturally protected from pollution-induced productivity losses and would have an advantage as water pollution increases worldwide. Locating any genes responsible such adaptations could be highly influential in the field of agricultural genetic engineering.
