Title:  The effects of variable light intensity on photosynthetic activity of spinach chloroplasts

Abstract:
This experiment served to examine the effects of varying light intensities on the photosynthetic activities of the chloroplasts of spinach leaves. As the photosystems of the electron transport chain are initiated by solar energy, it was expected that as the intensity of light received by a plant increased, the photosynthetic activity would also increase until a point was reached where the activity plateaued. This was achieved by isolating the chloroplasts of spinach leaves in solution with DCPIP, a color changing electron acceptor, and placing them under different light intensities and measuring the absorbance of the solutions over time intervals. These tests produced no significent difference between the low intensity light versus either of the two higher intensity lights. This was ascribed to having too wide of time intervals and in the confounding variable of the light sources, including the proximity of the samples to the light and the direction the light was faced in the experimental area. Further research in this field would assist in the fine tuning farming practices as well as furthering agriculture that is powered by man-made light. 

Introduction:
In photosynthesis in the chloroplast of plant cell, solar energy is utilized to drive the production of ATP as well as convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. When electrons within the photosystems II and I of the thylakoid membrane are excited, a concentration gradient of protons are created, which drive ATP synthase in its production of ATP molecules. The start of this electron transport chain occurs in photosystem II, where photons of light are captured in chlorophyll as energy. This energy then can excite an electron in the center of the photosystem that can be carried down the electron chain by cofactors. For photosystem II, the high energy electron is transferred via a plastoquinone to cytochrome C. Upon the addition of another electron acceptor, such as DCPIP, the extent to which the high energy electrons are produced may be monitored. In the Hill reaction, which generally utilizes natural electron acceptors, DCPIP will change from blue to clear in conjunction with its acceptance of the high energy electron. Therefore, the photosynthetic rate and overall efficacy of the process may be monitored. This allows for researchers to specifically monitor the processes of photosynthesis and how they may relate to external factors, yielding a more complete knowledge of agricultural and environmental growth.  Specifically, as the cultivation of crops is so essential in the maintenance of societies across a plethora of environments, studying the light exposure of plants can be essential in assessing the viability of plants in varying environments. Light intensity is a measure of the overall weighted wave-length power that is emitted from a light source and is measured in lumens. The proximity of light sources and the path of the light waves can alter this intensity. Thus, examining how the different intensities of light effects photosynthetic activity can shed light on necessary information for maximizing plant growth and crop production. This can allow for better alternative farming sources to be viable as well as increase the overall success of traditional practices [Blackman: 1951]. In a study performed on leaves of plants with both sun and shade plants, it was discovered that different plants increased their photosynthetic activities at different intensities and to different extents [Bohning: 1956]. In examining this research, it begs the question, to what extent does an increase in light intensity increase the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves? And furthermore, is there a point where the alteration of light intensity has no effect? Spinach leaves were used as they have easily separable and durable chloroplasts, are readily available, and are low cost. It is predicted that the increase in the light intensity will cause a significent increase in the activity of the electron transport chains of spinach leaf chloroplasts. It too is predicted that at the higher end of the light intensity spectrum, there will be a plateau in the photosynthetic output. 

Materials and Method:
In this research experiment four spinach leaves were deveined and grinded in a chilled and dried mortar and pestle with 20Ml of grinding buffer solution. This heterogenous mixture was strained through a cheesecloth into a 50Ml centrifuge tube, to be spun for three minutes at 200G and four degrees Celsius. The supernatant was transferred to another 50Ml centrifuge tube without dislodging the pellet and was spun for ten minutes at 200G and four degrees Celsius. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 20Ml of pH 6.5 buffer, with shaking to ensure the full dissolution of the pellet. Thirteen test tubes were then made. The first, contained 8Ml of distilled water and 2Ml of Reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), as a blank. The rest of the tubes contained 6Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of Reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), as a blank, and 2Ml of DCPIP. The DCPIP was utilized as it is dark blue when it is unbound to a high energy electron. As it picks up electrons, the DCPIP becomes progressively clearer, thus making it viable for photo spectrometry as an analytical tool. To each of these 100 microliters of the chloroplast solution was added, mixed, and immediately run through the spectrophotometer at 600nm emittance. The first three tubes with DCPIP were placed in a dark cabinet, the second three into a cabinet with a 600 lumen light, the third three into a cabinet with a 1300 lumen light, and the fourth three into a cabinet with a 1630 lumen light. After ten minutes, the absorbances were measured again, and then twice more at ten-minute intervals. The percent changes in absorbance across the time was calculated for each of the trials. 
|A_i-A_f |/A_i  x100%=Percent Change
The total percent change over the time period for each of the two higher intensity trials were compared to the lowest intensity data using a two-tailed t_test, in order  to find if there was a significent difference in the absorbances over time at each light intensity. 


Results:
The general trends in data showed that there was greater photosynthetic activity over the thirty minute timeframe for the higher light intensities versus the lower light intensity. The negative controll of the three trials that were kept in a dark cabinet all maintained very low levels of photosynthetic activity as their percent change was only around 1.79% on average. The 600 lumen intensity light showed an average percent change of 58.37 +/- 34.24%. The 1300 lumen light had an average percent change of 90.22 +/- 6.44%. This average shows that the solutions under the 1300 lumen light generally had a greater percent change when compared to the 1630 lumen light which had a percent change of 88.79 +/- 5.59%. The two higher intensity lights were compared the low intensity light. The 600 lumen and 1300 lumen light showed no significent difference (t_stat = 1.790, d.f. = 3, P = 0.1714) between their percent changes. Additionally the 600 lumen and 1630 lumen light showed no significent difference between their percent changes (t_stat = 1.519, d.f. = 4, P = 0.2033).

Discussion:
The results obtained from this experiment did not support the overall hypothesis. While there were general trends that were within the bounds of the predicted result, there was no statistical significent differences between the three trials. Thus, the null hypothesis could not be rejected. This means that there was no difference in photosynthetic activity across the three trials over the thirty-minute time period. The intended effect of the varying intensities of light was to increase photosynthetic activity by increasing the number of light waves that would hit the chloroplasts themselves. Thus, as light intensity increased, theoretically the photosynthetic behavior should have increased. This is supported by the findings of Benckiser with the Royal Society of Chemistry, photosynthetic activity increases in direct proportion with light intensity [Reckitt: 2014]. This occurs because as the light intensity increases, a greater number of photons from the light source will interact with photosystem II. This means that more higher energy electrons can be passed along the transport chain, thus boosting overall photosynthetic activity.  Along similar lines Paul J. Kramer discovered this direct proportionality, but also uncovered that some trees would have statistically insignificent increases in photosynthetic activity following a certain light intensity increase [Kramer: 1944]. This means that after a certain point, the increase of energy captured by photosystem II would no longer effect the photosynthetic rate. This occurs as all chlorophyll molecules become saturated with light. Although the two higher level intensities showed relatively similar percent changes in the absorbance, as there was no significent difference from the lower intensity light, it cannot be said that any plateau occurred, as there was no established difference from the lower intensity to the higher intensity. As demonstrated by the high standard deviation, there was a large amount of variance across the three trials. Thus, in examining these alternate data points, it is believed that confounding variables or error caused the lack of significent results in the light-intensity research experiment. The research method are a prime area for likely errors or inconsistencies in variables. First, upon the resuspension of the pellet after centrifuging, if the pellet is not completely homogenized in the buffer solution, there is potential for chloroplast densities that vary across trials. This could explain large variances, or, for lower light intensities, higher photosynthetic activity. There is also a potential confounding variable in the distance and placement of the lightbulb in reference to the cuvettes. If one light was more directly fixed upon the samples, whereas another was faced slightly away, there could be a difference in the light energy’s ability to excite electrons in Photosystem II. This indicates a need for a replication of this experiment with a more rigorously controllled environment and more consistency in the addition of the chloroplasts. In future experiments, a better methodology would involve testing across a wider range of lightbulbs with varying lumens. It may also be improved by increasing the frequency of testing the photosynthetic activity. By making it over four minute intervals, it could more positively show percent differences over each interval being significently different. There is the potential that after thirty minutes, all of the chloroplasts were able to reach a certain level of photosynthetic activity. By examining each interval, it could show better the trends for each change in the independent variable.  While this specific experiment did not yield any significent data, the intent and drive of this experiment should be pursued to greater lengths. As land area decreases with population growth, and usable land urbanized, the push for alternative method of farming shall rise. By examining ideal light intensities for maximizing photosynthetic growth, it will allow the general populace to remain fed and still mass produce crops. Through expanding to testing this same research goal on a variety of plant types, it will allow for specificity and fine tuning of indoor or alternative farming methodologies. In a more general sense, exploring the minute variations in photosynthesis is necessary in truly understanding the nature of plant life.
