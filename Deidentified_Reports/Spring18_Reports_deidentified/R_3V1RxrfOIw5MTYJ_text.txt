Title: The effects of caffeine on amplitude of response to gastrocnemus muscle stimulation of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment focused on the effects of caffeine on amplitude of response to the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.  Caffeine increases calcium ion release.  We hypothesized that if caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens then the amplitude of the muscle response would be greater than a muscle that wasn’t exposed to caffeine.  In our experiment we tested muscle response in three frog legs before and after caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle.  The statistical test ran in this experiment deemed our results significent.  However, not for the reason we had hypothesized.  The amplitude of the response was lower for the legs injected with caffeine due to chemically-induced tetany. 

Introduction:
The goal of the experiment was to learn about muscle contractions in the body and how they can be altered.  My lab group decided to investigate the impact of caffeine on muscle contractions.  We chose to test the response of the gastrocnemus muscle to electrical pulses of Rania pipiens.  Through a process called excitation contraction coupling, we can see how nerves stimulate muscle contraction and see how acetylcholine and calcium play a role in muscle contraction.  Action potentials travel down axons within a nerve until they come in contact with a neuromuscular junction.  There the neuron depolarizes and causes acetylcholine to be released into the synaptic cleft.  Acetylcholine then diffuses and binds to its receptor causing sodium channels to open and generate action potentials.  These action potentials cause calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum activating the contractile function of muscle fibers.  The calcium binds to tropomyosin causing the myosin filament to use energy from ATP and rub against actin filaments causing the myofibers to shorten.   The muscle fiber relaxes when the calcium unbinds from tropomyosin causing the myosin to return to its resting position.[Johnson: 2018].  Caffeine increases calcium release by lowering the threshold that must be reached for calcium to be released into the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Kong: 2009].  We hypothesize that if caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens then the muscle will have a stronger muscle response then the muscle that was not injected with caffeine.  

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were selected to test muscle response before and after caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle.  The legs were prepared by placing the legs into a dissecting pan and using forceps to grab the skin and pull it down towards the foot.  Then lay the skinned leg in the dissecting pan and moisten with Ringer's frog solution. Seperate the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone and cut off the achilles tendon from the bone, allowing it to be tied with a string from the force transducer.  Tie the achilles tendon with string and hang the muscle, making sure the string isn’t too loose.  Secure the thigh muscle to the dissecting dish with pins.  Connect pin probes to the gastrocnemus muscle for stimulations to be administered.   Apply increasing thresholds single stimulus amplitudes until a threshold is found and record the response in volts.  Once a threshold is found administer amplitudes 1,2,3,4, and 5.  Inject 0.1Ml of caffeine solution into the gastrocnemus muscle and watch the muscle respond to the caffeine on the screen.  Find the threshold of the leg with caffeine and record the response of the leg to amplitudes 1,2,3,4, and 5.  Perform a 2 tailed paired t_test. 

Results:
Figure 1 illustrates the average muscle response amplitude of a Rania pipiens leg without caffeine and a leg that has been injected with caffeine. Frog legs treated with caffeine had a lower response amplitude than the frog legs not treated with caffeine. The difference between the two groups was shown to be statistically significent (t_stat:7.18, p_value: 0.0008).

Discussion:
Overall our data at first glance did not support our original hypothesis that caffeine would increase the muscle response.  Our p_value was much lower than 0.05 so our data was significent.  While we were injecting the caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle we saw that the response amplitude was gradually increasing even though no stimulus was applied.  This gradual increase can be explained as chemically-induced tetany.  In another experiment caffeine was used to test fatigue compared to legs not treated with caffeine [Rosser: 2009].  The legs took longer to fatigue due to the supply of calcium being greater in the legs treated with caffeine [Rosser: 2009].  Chemically-induced tetany was seen in our experiment and even though the response to the actual stimulus was lower, there was actually already 0.614 V responding in the muscle from the caffeine allowing more calcium in.  Therefore, our results partly supported our hypothesis and the caffeine allowed in more calcium like we predicted.  If we were to conduct another experiment we would see if the amount of caffeine injected varied the amount of chemically-induced tetany.  This experiment makes a lot of sense because when coffee is consumed in large quantities it makes people jittery which is a sign of that it affected muscle contraction.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1:  The graph above shows the average muscle response of the controll frog leg and the caffeine-injected leg so that they can be seen side by side.  The error bars represent the standard deviation of the data.  The controll frogs had a higher average muscle response than the controll frog legs.
