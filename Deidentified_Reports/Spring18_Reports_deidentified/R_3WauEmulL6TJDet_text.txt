Title: Effect of Juvenile Growth Hormone in (Manduca Sexta)

Abstract:
The effect of juvenile hormone on (Manduca Sexta) caterpillars is tested in order to see if an increase in JH will cause issues with metamorphosis. If there is an increase in juvenile hormone, then (Manduca Sexta) growth will be stunted and molting will stop. The independent variable is a diet consisting of Azaguard for the treatment and a normal diet for the controll. On the other hand, the dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars. In order to verify the hypothesis, an experiment using eight caterpillars is conducted, four under an Azaguard treatment and four under a controll treatment, and each caterpillar was consistently weighed over the course of seven days. The results show that the controll group had constant growth; while, the treatment group had stagnant growth. In conjunction, the statistical test had a p_value of 0.020871, showing that the results are statistically significent. Thus, the experiment illustrates that juvenile hormone increases do affect the growth of (Manduca Sexta) as the treatment group showed little to no development. This experiment can help farmers develop method for controllling pests like Tobacco Hornworms. In future experiments, it is pertinent that one prepares new food each day in order to obtain accurate results.

Introduction:
(Manduca Sexta), or more commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms, are the main focus of this lab. These caterpillars are in the Order Lepidoptera and has many common names like the sphinx moth or Carolina sphinx [Johnson: 2016]. Tobacco hornworms are specifically used in this experiment because of the short timing of the molts in between larvae stages. Each molt between the instar stages is approximately two to three days, which allows for the observation of a full life cycle. Moreover, the caterpillars are cheap and easy to keep in lab, These caterpillars are used to determine the effect of varying levels of juvenile hormone (JH) in the growth stages. The two main growth hormones in (Manduca Sexta) are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone (20E), and both work together to ensure the caterpillar properly grows and molts. The (Manduca Sexta) has a growth cycle of five instar larvae stages, a pupa stage, and an adult stage that approximately 39 days. During the larvae stages, JH occupies higher levels than 20E. Based on previous studies, it is shown that the levels of juvenile hormone decrease near the fifth instar growth stage [Kiguchi: 1978]. This decrease is due to the fact that there is an increase in 20E so that the caterpillar can develop into a pupa, and move on to the adult stages. Moreover, an increase in JH during the fifth instar larvae stage prevents the molt of the (Manduca Sexta) into a pupa [Zhou: 1998]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine how juvenile hormone affects the growth of a caterpillar as it moves through its life cycle. More specifically, will the increase in juvenile hormone allow the (Manduca Sexta) to move from the larvae stages to the adult stages? The independent variable is whether the caterpillar obtains a normal diet or a diet infused with ten percent Azaguard. Azaguard is a chemical that contains juvenile hormone. The dependent variable is the weight of each caterpillar. With increased exposure to juvenile hormone, in the form of Azaguard, in (Manduca Sexta), it is expected that the (Manduca Sexta) will remain in the younger stages of development. 



Materials and Method:
	First, eight (Manduca Sexta) larvae are obtained and each one is weighed. All of the caterpillars are approximately one gram and are reared in similar conditions at room temperature. Then, four containers and four perforated lids are acquired, and an index card is placed in the middle of each container. One side of the container is the controll group with normal food diet and the other side is the treatment group with ten percent Azaguard incorporated in the food. To measure out the normal food diet, 40 grams of food is weighed out and 40 drops of water is added. Out of this 40 grams, ten grams is added to each of the four controll groups. To measure out the treatment food diet, 40 grams of food is weighed out and four drops of Azaguard is added. As with the controll group, ten grams out of the 40 grams is added to each of the four treatment groups. One caterpillar is added to each of the sections. Data is collected and recorded every day for seven days. The hypothesis is tested by using the weights of the caterpillars in order to see if the juvenile hormone caused a change in the sizes of (Manduca Sexta). After the experiment was completed, a statistical analysis using a two sample t_test is conducted. The two sample T-test is conducted using the average change in the weights of the caterpillars in the controll and treatment groups. The degrees of freedom are 6, the t- value is 3.109163, and the p_value is 0.020871.

Results:
In the data, it can be seen that the experimental group weighed significently less and had a slight increase in weight over time compared to the controll group.  The results from Figure 1 show that (Manduca Sexta) are affected by an increase in juvenile hormone. The controll group in the experiment has an average change in weight of approximately 2.2 grams, while the treatment group has an average change in weight of approximately 0.75 grams. The caterpillars without the addition of Azaguard were able to grow normally and develop according to the usual growth cycle of (Manduca Sexta). On the other hand, the caterpillars with the addition of Azaguard grew minimally and did not experience much growth in comparison to the controll group. General trends in the data showed show that the controll group had a constant increase in weight over time. The caterpillars in the controll group grew normally as they had normal levels of JH. The treatment group, however, showed little growth as the change in weight was small. 

Discussion:
The results support the hypothesis because the addition of juvenile hormone in the (Manduca Sexta) displays a decrease or stagnancy in growth. The reason for this occurring biologically is that the addition of juvenile hormone causes the caterpillars to stop molting. The molting process stops because in order to move to the next developmental stage in the life cycle the caterpillar must have low levels of JH and high levels of 20E. Moreover, the high amounts of JH stop the caterpillar from developing large enough to pupate. In conjunction with the experimental results, the statistical results support the conclusion that JH does affect the growth process in (Manduca Sexta). Since the p_value of 0.020871 is less than the alpha level of 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. Thus, there is evidence that there is a significent difference in (Manduca Sexta) weight between the controll group diet and the treatment group diet. In the experiment, however, there is one error in the method where the food is not switched out every day the data is collected. Thus, the caterpillars did not gain as much weight as the would have if they had received more food. Despite the error, the results in this experiment are similar to the findings of previous studies as it shows that juvenile hormone levels in Tobacco Hornworms does matter when it comes to growth and development. Other published studies found that an increase in JH levels does, indeed, prevent the molt of the caterpillars [Zhou: 1998]. This increases our understanding of the world as this information can be helpful to farmers and other industries that need pest controll. With this study, people can develop effective method in controllling pests like adult moths that develop from (Manduca Sexta). In future experiments, the method need to be revised in order to acquire more accurate and precise results. One alteration in the method would be to change the food given to the caterpillars every day in the course of the experiment. With this modification, the caterpillars can grow, molt, and move through the life cycle. There should also be future experiments to verify the results through replication. (Manduca Sexta) growth and development is affected by the increase in juvenile hormone as it results in the prevention of molting and metamorphosis.
