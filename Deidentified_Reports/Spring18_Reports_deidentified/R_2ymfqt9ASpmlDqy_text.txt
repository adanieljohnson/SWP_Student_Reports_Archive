Title: Betta Splendins show reactive behavior towards guppies

Abstract:
Betta splendins are Siamese fighting fish.  Males of this species can not live together as they are really aggressive towards one another. The goal of this lab is to see how a male betta fish react towards a guppie. It is predicted that the betta fish  will not react towards the guppie. The guppie and the betta fish were in the same tank with a glass divider. The betta fish behaviors was observed and given a number  based of the behaviors it exhibited. The behaviors  of the betta fish were also observed when the betta fish could not see the guppie. The betta fish showed aggression to the guppie and was significent after a paired t_test was ran. With the betta fish showing aggressive behavior towards the guppie it did not support my initial hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins are also known as Siamese fighting fish. Betta fish have aggressive behaviors toward each other when they feel threatened as they are very territorial. Male betta fish are particularly aggressive to other male betta fish. One would think that betta fish would be aggressive towards other species since they are aggressive to their own species but Bettas can forms schools of fish with other fish[Simpson: 1968]. The goal of this lab is to see if a betta fish is aggressive towards a guppy. Since guppies are non aggressive fish, it is predicted that the Betta fish will not act aggressively towards the guppy.  
				


Materials and Method:
First, a male Betta splendins was placed  in the presence of a guppy with a glass divider. Then observe the Betta fish for five minutes. Then,based on the chart below,  a number was given to them based on the behaviors the betta fish demonstrated. This was repeated three times, with a five minutes rest in between with an opaque divider. When the Betta splendins was resting, we observed them and recorded if the Betta fish demonstrated any behaviors on the chart.

Results:
The data showed that the Betta fish with the guppies demonstrated aggressive behaviors toward the yuppie . The mean of behavior score of betta fish by itself was 0. The mean behavior score of betta fish with guppie was 25.67. The t=6.8326,d.f.=2, and P= 0.0208. The P value is lower  than 0.05 which makes the data significent. 


Discussion:
 Since the data was significent, the data did not supported  my hypothesis. With a P-value of 0.0208 it is lower than the ideal P-value of 0.05.   According to Alyan, Betta splendins are equally aggressive to intruders in their territory[Alyan:2010].  This could have been a reason why the Betta splendins reacted so aggressive to the guppy. The color of the guppy could of have been a factor of the aggressiveness of a Betta splendins.  Todd showed that Betta fish react more aggressive when the fish is a brighter color [Todd:2008].  The guppy was bright purple and that could have been the reason why  the Betta fish reacted so aggressively to the guppy.  In the future, an experiment can be done with a gray guppy and brightly colored guppy to see if the Betta fish react in the same aggressive manor to all of the colors including dull colors.

The graph represents the average score of the behavior the betta fish showed to the guppy. The error bars represent +/-  one standard deviation of 0 of betta fish by itself and 6.51 for betta fish with guppy. .
