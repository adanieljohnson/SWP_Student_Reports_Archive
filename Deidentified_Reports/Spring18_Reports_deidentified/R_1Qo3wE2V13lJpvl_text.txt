Title: Effect of Caffeine of Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The aim of this lab was to test the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction, specifically in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. We hypothesized that adding caffeine to the gastrocnemus would lead to stronger muscle contractions. We measured response of a muscle to an electric stimulus to the sciatic nerve of the leg. For the controll, we simply found the threshold voltage and then increased the stimulus, measuring the response. Then, using a syringe, we injected a 0.1 Ml solution into the same gastrocnemus and repeated the steps, measuring the response in voltage. We found that once the muscle was injected with caffeine, it underwent chemically induced tetany, and felt hard and tense to the touch. However, our data was not statistically significent and was unable to support our hypothesis.

Introduction:
In vertebrates, skeletal muscle is composed of myofibers, cylindrical groups of multi-nuclear cells [Johnson, 2018]. In the fibers motor neurons, located in the grey matter of the spinal cord, stimulate muscle contraction through neuromuscular junctions. This process is initiated by a stimulus, and then initiates an action potential which travels down the icon to the synapse, where it releases neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ACh then initiates an action potential in the muscle fiber, causing Ca2+ to be released from the SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum), triggering the sliding of myosin and actin filaments, causing contraction. Summation occurs when action potentials generated by motor neurons is added to produce muscle tension. Within summation, there is temporal and spatial summation. Spatial summation is the condition when a number of motor neurons fire at the same time, causing a greater force. Temporal summation is when a neuron fires repeatedly, helping the threshold to be reached quicker. Both summations cause a twitch - when axons are stimulated often and repeatedly enough and build upon each other to create a sustained contraction. At the point where maximum force is created, tetanus results. However, the muscle eventually runs out of ATP and myosin and actin separate. The muscle relaxes, called fatigue. Fatigue is distinct from the relaxation stage of contraction because even the muscle cannot be re-contracted when it is fatigued [Johnson, 2018]. Caffeine is the drug that we will use to test muscle contraction strength. Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid which acts as a central nervous system stimulant by reducing drowsiness and restoring alertness [Olorunshola, 2011]. For our purposes, we will use the leg of a Rania pipiens, specifically the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve. We hypothesize that if caffeine is directly injected into the gastrocnemus, the flow of calcium ions in the muscle will be optimized. thus, the muscle will have more intense contractions. 

Materials and Method:
We used three Rania pipiens legs to test the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction. Each leg was used as both a controll and an experimental group, as we treated each leg after the controll tests. We removed the skin of the leg off of the muscle using forceps and a scalpel, then separated the inner thigh muscles using a dissecting probe, to reveal the sciatic nerve. We then removed the nerve from its connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. Then, we suspended the gastrocnemus muscle using a stand and thread. We attached stimulatory electrodes to the sciatic nerve and put the force transducer on the leg. Starting with the first controll leg, we used varied stimuli voltage to find the threshold voltage at which we first see the muscle twitch. We then increased the voltage to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 volts, and recording the magnitude of the amplitude (response) of the twitch. After the controll legs were tested, we injected the gastrocnemus of the leg with a 0.1 Ml solution of caffeine and conducted the same steps as the controll leg. We will record six myograms for each leg (one for controll and one for the experimental group). A two-paired t_test will be our statistical test.

Results:
Figures 1, 2 and 3 demonstrate that the measurement of amplitude (response) during the treatment was generally less intense than that of the controll group. At no point does the graph of the experimental response become greater than the controll response. Figure 4 depicts the two-paired t_test that we used to interpret our results. The average response voltage for the controll was 0.414333±0.28226, and 0.262221±0.190302 for the treatment. However, the p value was 0.155184 for our experiment. On the other hand, during the course of the experiment, I noticed that the muscle injected with caffeine contracted more intensely than during the controll phase of the experiment. This is because of chemically induced tetany. Once the gastrocnemus was injected with caffeine, the muscle immediately went into chemically induced tetany, when the muscle undergoes summation until it reached the maximum sustained contraction: tetany. In our raw data, the value for chemically induced tetany is the response that the leg held during the course of the experiment, and the response voltages are contractions upon the tetany voltage.

Discussion:
I believe that the data does not support my hypothesis. I hypothesized that injecting the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens would lead to strong muscle contractions. Yet as the two-paired t_test reveals, our data was not able to support that hypothesis. As seen in Figure 4, the p_value for our t_test was 0.155184, which misses the significance threshold. However, I feel like the data said something else about the impact of caffeine on muscle contraction. Although the individual contractions during the caffeine injection phase of the experiment were weaker, there was chemically induced tetany which made the muscle feel hard and tense to the touch. Yes, the contractions were weaker, and that does not support my hypothesis, but looking at the myogram, it is clear that the voltage of the contractions recorded by the force transducer are stronger than the ones of the controll, even though the increase of voltage from tetany is negligible. However, there are studies that support my hypothesis. A study by Kolawole Victor Olorunshola and L.N. Achie from the Faculty of Medicine at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria found that with increasing doses of caffeine, the strength of skeletal muscle contraction increased [Olorunshola, 2011]. This supports my hypothesis and indicates to me that had we conducted the experiment slightly differently, we could have attained trustworthy results. To start off with, I would have liked to use similar sized frog legs for the experiment. In our experiment, one of the legs was significently larger than the others and may have skewed our data. Additionally, I would like to find a better was to deliver caffeine to the muscles. Although the injection was easy to use, I think that something like a topical cream or a surer delivery system could ensure that all of the caffeine in the syringe is delivered to the muscle. To take this experiment to the next step, I would like to investigate how chemically induced tetany affects the capabilities of the muscle. For instance, I would investigate if muscles in tetany fatigue quicker than muscles that are not in tetany.
