Title: Effect of Light on Plant Allocation on The Growth of Radish (Raphahus Sativus) Plants 

Abstract:
Plants adapt to their environment and allocate their resources to maximize growth and survival potential. Our study analyzes the effect of light on the growth on plants. I hypothesized that the plants in the shade condition would grow taller in order to obtain the limiting resource of light, resulting in a smaller root to shoot ratio. We grew two pots of radishes in a sunny condition and two pots in a shady condition for two weeks. Then we measured the root to shoot ratio for weight and length. The results showed that these ratios were smaller in all given instances for that of the shady condition, but at the same time, the mean of the root to shoot weight ratio for the group grown in full sunlight was not statistically significently greater than that of those grown in the shade (P=.1210), while we saw the same insignificance in the root to shoot length ratio in the two given conditions (P=.0914). My hypothesis was not supported and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected; although there was a trend in the average of length and weight root to shoot ratios being smaller, through a two sample one tailed t test, the results proved insignificent. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is important in organisms across any given environment because it allows them to adapt to the resources that are present. The main sources of nutrients for plants are solar energy and co2, which come in from the shoots/leaves and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur, which are taken up from the soil through the roots. These resources are then harnessed for new growth and storage of leaves, stems, and roots. In this lab, we will be looking at the effect of light on radish plant, Raphahus sativus, resource allocation which will be observable in the form of the weight and length root to shoot ratio. This is something that is genetically predisposed, but there can be phenotypic plasticity in response to different environments. The limiting resource is what determines the growth rate of the given feature that the organism chooses to put its resources into. My hypothesis is that in the shade condition, the root to shoot ratio will be smaller than that of the sunny condition because the plant will grow tall in order to obtain light. This biological concept is important because plants are able to respond to their environment and allocate their resources to maximize their chances of survival. 
In Eldridge, Hill, Bebbington, Meatyard’s experiment analyzing the effect of light on ivy plant leaves, those in the shade were observed to have thinner leaves with a larger surface area and an even distribution of chloroplasts. This is a form of resource allocation that plants adapt to in order to maximize their resource intake potential. When sun is a limiting resource, the plant will respond with these phenotypic changes, evenly distributing their chloroplast in a thin layer to maximize photosynthesis [Eldridge, Hill, Bebbington, Meatyard: 1997]. My hypothesis was made based on the findings of this study, which indicate that the plants in the shaded environments will make alterations whether they are allocating their resources to growth of their leaves or stems in order to obtain more sunlight.


Materials and Method:
We planted two pots of radish plants, sprinkling seeds thoroughly and placing a thin layer of soil on top. Then, we placed them in a greenhouse and watered them daily. One pot was set in a sunny condition, while the other was placed under a shade cloth to provide a shady environment. Aside from light, the plants were exposed to the same abiotic factors, such as air, water, space, temperature, and soil (nutrients). After allowing them to grow for two weeks, we carefully took the plants out from the soil, making sure to obtain the whole root. To ease this process, water was be used to separate the soil from the plant. Next, we measured the weight and length of the whole stem and proceeded to measure the weight and length of the root and shoot. This process was repeated three times, for each given condition: light and shade. Given that my hypothesis suggested that the mean of the shade root to shoot ratio would be smaller, using excel, we employed a two sample one tailed t_test, comparing the means of the root to shoot length and weight for the two conditions in order to determine the statistical significance of our data. 

Results:
As seen in figures 1 and 2, the root to shoot weight and length ratio was higher in all given replicates for the light condition. The root to shoot ratio of the weight of the shade plants was .057±.024, while the ratio of the length of the shade plants was .36±.06. On the other hand, the weight root to shoot ratio of the sun plants was .10826±.0597, and the ratio of length was .48±.11. Our two sample one tailed t test showed gave us a p value of .12 for the root to shoot weight ratio and .091 for the root to shoot length ratio. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was not supported that in shade the plant would grow high above the soil in order to obtain the limiting resource of light. The mean of the root to shoot weight ratio for the group grown in full sunlight was not statistically significently different than that of those grown in the shade (t_stat=1.372, d.f.=4, P=.1210), while we saw the same insignificance in the root to shoot length ratio in the two given conditions (t_stat=1.609, d.f.=4, P=.0914). Even though my hypothesis was not supported, there was a trend that showed plants grown in the shade had root to shoot ratios that were smaller than those grown in the sun. A low root to shoot ratio signifies more allocation to the shoots, whereas a large root to shoot ratio would be defined by a larger amount of allocation to the roots. 
It was interesting to observe over the two weeks of plant growth that the plants grew more sideways rather than up, in particular those in the shaded condition. At first, I inferred that this was due to some factor of our watering process, which I assumed pushed the plants away from their normal upward growth pattern. Then I thought that this was due to the shoots being thin and weak and that they were not getting the necessary support from the shoot. This would go along with the reasoning behind my hypothesis. Through further analyzation, I think that this phenomenon is caused by the effect of the shade cloth, which forced the plants to grow out toward the light. At the same time, this was observed in the light condition plants but to a lesser extent, so I conclude that multiple factors were at play. In our shade condition, etiolation was observed. This is defined as a lack of light that leads a plant to elongate its shoot, resulting in a weakening of the plant support.
In another given experiment with radishes, this same biological phenomenon, resource allocation, can also be seen not only in amount of resources a given environment provides but also type of resource provided. Bouchard, Harmon, Markham, Vandefifer observed length, weight, and leaf count of radish plants in order to determine that MiracleGrow is the most productive solution over rain, tap, and aquaponics water (water with fish in it). The results suggested that this type of solution led to the greatest amount of growth due to the large amount of nutrients like nitrogen, chloride, and carbon [Bouchard, Harmon, Markham, Vandefifer: 2007]. This information is important in a larger context because plants are very good at adapting to their surrounding. They are unable to maximize their potential in all given areas, but rather they must choose how to react to their environment and allocate their resources effectively and efficiently. On the other hand, when presented with an environment that has an excess of chemicals unnecessary and unnatural to the environment, like air pollution, plants still show these same alterations. For example, Lechowicz looked at resource allocation by plants under air pollution stress by O3, SO2, and NO2 and their implications on root and shoot length. He found that on average the pollutant stress treatments resulted in a 25% reduction in plant growth, and in the most severe stress regimes growth reductions were as high as 87%. He observed that the overall impact of pollutant stress generally appears to be greater on roots than on shoot tissues. This shows that plants that were in the pollution condition showed a reduced rate of photosynthesis [Lechowicz: 1987]. Environments effect how organism react. Even so, our results show that a plant growing in light or dark does not make a difference to their root to shoot ratio. In the future, in order to obtain potentially more significent results we could lengthen the duration of the study and increase the sample size, which would help us prove what other previous studies have already supported. This biological concept of resource allocation is important in agriculture. For agro forestry, our study shows that plants will have no significent difference if they are grown in shade opposed to light. This crop plant fitness is determined by the length and weight of the shoot, which is the part that we eat. The results here prove as influential information in a forest where there are taller trees compete with for light.
