Title: Rana pipiens and the inhibition of calcium in the gastrocnemius muscle

Abstract:
The objective of this investigation was to discern the effects of calcium inhibitor on skeletal muscle control of the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens frog. Skeletal muscle control is controlled by the release of calcium (Ca2+) into the neuromuscular junction, which promotes contraction of the muscle. Researchers hypothesized that the inhibition of calcium would cause the legs Rana pipiens to be unable to contract and raise the threshold of stimulus for the action potential to fire. The experiment was conducted by separating the legs into two groups of three legs; one group was the experimental that would receive the calcium inhibition treatment, while the other was the control group that would not receive treatment and would be used to compare the results of the experimental group. We evaluated our data two ways: though comparing thresholds and amplitudes. It was found through a paired t-test and a p-value for threshold and amplitude that the data was not significantly different because our p-values were more than 0.05, which does not indicate a significant difference. Thus, the hypothesis, that the experimental group would have a higher threshold was not supported by our data and observations, but the amplitude data suggested inhibition.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles, which are connected to the skeleton, are what allow organisms to move and interact with their surroundings, and this is true in the case of model organism, the frog Rana pipiens. Organisms’, like the Rana pipiens, skeletal muscles also consist of myofibers which are filaments that bundle together that allow for movement [Jonson: 2016]. Movement is also controlled by the motor neurons which fire action potentials, electrical impulses the carry message about movements, down the axon to the neuron terminal which causes release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [St. John: 2016]. This upcharge of calcium concentration sets off an energy-consuming chain reaction that causes the myofilaments to change shape and shorten. The simultaneous shortening of thousands of microscopic myofilaments leads to muscle contraction [Szent-Györgyi: 1975]. In this investigation, we will inject a calcium inhibitor, 5 M D-600 (methody-verapamil), into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard frog. We predict that by injecting the frog’s leg with calcium inhibitor, the legs will be unable to contract and raise the threshold of stimulus for the action potential to fire because calcium inhibition reduces the electrical conduction within the muscle, therefore decreasing the force of contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
The investigation was conducted by separating relatively the same size legs of Rana pipiens into two groups of three legs using each frog as its own control and experimental group. One group was the experimental that would receive the calcium inhibition treatment, while the other was the control group that would not receive treatment and would be used to compare the results of the experimental group. We used our finger and forceps to skin the legs, and we moistened each leg with Ringer’s solution as necessary to make sure the legs did not dry, as it would have tremendously affected our experiment. Once again using our fingers, we exposed the sciatic nerve from the muscle tissue and we mounted the leg to a force transducer. Through attaching two electrodes into the muscle, we discovered the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in 0.1V increments, and the myogram recording software would give us a number to record. We stimulated the muscle seven times and recorded observations and data from the myogram recording software. Repeating this with the two other legs created the control group and a baseline set of recorded data to compare the experimental group with. We did the same for the experimental group, expect we inject 0.2mL of 5 M D-600 into the gastrocnemius muscle of the mounted frog leg. From there we increased the voltage in 0.1V increments; we stimulated the muscle seven times and recorded observations and data from the myogram recording software. To analyze our data and we ran a paired t-test on the averages for the threshold values and for the amplitude values.

Results:
The average threshold of the control frog legs 0.066 V while the experimental group averaged 0.026 V. The results of the t-value and p-value for the difference in threshold, in the control group the t-value was 1.124495 ± 0.05257 standard deviation, and in the experimental group it was 1.124495 ± 0.009165 standard deviation. The p-value for the difference in threshold was in the control group was 0.377628± 0.05257 standard deviation and in the experimental group it was 0.377628 ± 0.009165 standard deviation. We also performed statistical test for the difference in amplitudes, control group the t-value was 0.456272 ± 0.08058 standard deviation and in the experimental group it was 0.456272 ± 0.04091 standard deviation. The p-value for the difference in threshold was in the control group was 0.692952 ± 0.08058 standard deviation and in the experimental group it was 0.692952 ± 0.04091 standard deviation. Figure 1 shows average thresholds for the control and experimental groups along with the error bars; while Figure 2 displays average amplitudes for the control and experimental groups along with the error bars.

Discussion:
This investigation did not confirm our hypothesis that the experimental group would have a higher threshold. We deem our experiment not significant through two paired t-test and a p-value that measure both amplitude and threshold, because our p-values was more than 0.05, which does not indicate a significant difference. When we began to run our tests on the experimental group the first leg deviated greatly from what we expect; the first leg’s threshold was higher in the experimental group and we had predicted the exact opposite. Over the course of the experiment our results were not corresponding to our hypothesis at all. For that reason, we decided to not only review the data on the difference in threshold but also the data in amplitudes. The data from the amplitudes showed us that the control’s amplitude was higher; since control amplitude was higher, that means that the experimental group likely had something inhibiting their ability to twitch which would mean that the calcium inhibitor functioned. We suspect that our hypothesis was not proved through the threshold data because some of the chemicals that we used I the lab tampered with the muscles ability to twitch, or we might not have cleaned the dissection board as well as we though we did. Also, when trying to replicate this experiment would be beneficial to increase the amount of Rana pipiens in the experiment to obtain more accurate results. Based on the results if this study we concluded that our data was inconclusive, and we would have to redo the experiment with more frogs. Numerous study have been conducted to about calcium inhibition on muscle contraction. In Ivana Y. Kuo and Barbara E. Ehrlich’s 2015 study of signal pathways in muscles contractions they determined that many signaling proteins in both smooth and striated muscles are activated by changes in cytosolic calcium levels, and these signaling pathways often lead to alterations in gene expression [Kuo:2015]. Their study goes even more in depth into the repercussions on calcium inhibition, while our investigation focuses more on surface level details like the force of muscle contraction and how inhibition effects threshold and amplitude. According to a 1994 study conducted by Jiang and Stephens, calcium has been a central player in mediating smooth muscle contraction through binding with calmodulin, although there is evidence showing that under special circumstances smooth muscle can contract without change in intracellular calcium [Jiang: 1994]. This study correlates to the results that we found with the amplitude data because inhibition disrupted the amplitude of the muscle contraction. The release of calcium after the action potential has fired, liberates the myosin's binding site on actin filaments [St. John: 2016]. This enables a contraction, and a return of the calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum allows the muscle to relax. Calcium plays a very integral part of understanding muscle contraction and a relationship that researchers could further explore would be calcium inhibition and how it is really integral to understanding the field of prosthetics.
