Title: Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta splendins Not Affected by Blue-Dyed Water

Abstract:
Agonistic behaviors are prevalent throughout the animal kingdom, which makes the study of them relevant to understanding the ecology, genetics, and evolution of both individual species and trends among all animal species. Our experiment examined the agnostic behaviors of males of one particular fish species, Betta splendins, which react aggressively in the presence of male conspecifics. As agnostic behavior relies on the ability to first identify the target of a display, we decided to test the impact of a Betta's ability to distinguish the color of another male as it relates to levels of aggression. We hypothesized that, if placed in blue-dyed water where a fish's color decreased in contrast to its environment, blue Betta splendins males would exhibit less agnostic behavior towards each other than if in clear water. We tested this by allowing male Bettas to interact in an environment with clear water, then with water dyed by blue food coloring. We used a paired t_test to evaluate our data, which revealed no significent difference between agnostic behavior levels between the clear and blue-colored water environments.

Introduction:
Agonistic behavior has been observed in many species across the animal kingdom. Species use agnostic displays when engaged in intraspecific and interspecific competition, which can include competing for resources or a mate. Usually such behavior consists of physical signals which serve as a way to deter the competition and prevent more dangerous method of resolving conflict. If the conflict can be resolved without harm to the organism, energy is saved and the organism's survival is not at risk. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are well known for intraspecific agnostic displays and highly aggressive fighting between males.  Studying such agnostic behaviors of animals can elucidate the relationships of that animal with other organisms and its environment. In this experiment, we explored the question of how Betta splendins recognize each other and initiate agnostic displays, specifically testing the idea that color is a determining factor in the reaction of one male to another. The study of body color in relation to the agnostic behavior of another Betta fish has showed that, generally, a male will respond with the most aggression toward a male with coloration the least like its own (Thompson and Sturm: 1965). A red fish, for example, would respond the most to a green fish, less to red, and the least to blue (Thompson and Sturm: 1965). We reasoned that if color was a determining factor in conspecific male recognition, similarity in color to the environment would lessen the ability of males to identify each other and the likelihood of engaging in agnostic displays. We hypothesized that if placed in blue-dyed water, the ability of male Betta splendins of blue coloration to recognize each other would diminish, and agnostic behavior would, therefore, decrease.

Materials and Method:
The experiment used three sets of two male Betta splendins. Each Betta was of blue coloration, but there were minute variations in the darkness or lightness of color and whether their fins were red tipped. To begin, the first set of fish was placed in a tank where they were separated by an opaque barrier and given 5 minutes to adjust to their new environment. Then, the opaque barrier was removed and a clear glass barrier remained, allowing the fish to perceive each other while unable to make physical contact. Their behavior was observed for 5 minutes before the barrier was replaced. Data was recorded regarding the time until the first display of agnostic behavior by either male, total broadside displays, total facing displays, and total instances of darting motion observed of both males in the trial. Broadside displays include the extension of the pelvic fin, tail beating, and tail flashing. Frontal displays include holding the pectoral fins forward, spreading the opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes. We defined "darting" as a rapid movement made towards the opposing male.  This procedure was repeated with the other two sets of male Bettas. Next, the entire procedure was conducted again for all three sets of fish, but this time three drops of blue food coloring were added to water on each side of the tank. The fish were given at minimum five minutes to recover from their last agnostic encounter and five minutes to adjust to their new environment before beginning another trial. Data was recorded as before. We then created a composite score for each group of Bettas before and after the administration of blue dye. Frontal and broadside displays counted for one point each, while darting counted for 1.5 points each. The composite score data was analyzed using a one-tailed paired t_test (p &lt; 0.05). 

Results:
The data yielded no clear connection between blue water color and level of agnostic behavior, which was determined by the frequency and type of display. Set one Bettas displayed a moderate amount of agnostic behavior in the clear water, but none whatsoever in the blue water. Yet, the set 2 Bettas displayed moderately in the clear water but with a very high intensity in the blue water. It was noted that the dark blue Betta from set 2 displayed much more actively than the one of gradient coloring. Set 3 Bettas, on the other hand, displayed very similarly in both trials. The mean composite score of the trials in clear water was 39 ± 9.17 while the mean of the blue water trials totaled 46.5 ± 22.59 (Figure 1).  Thus, the data here indicated no significent difference between agnostic behavior of Betta splendins in blue and clear water (t_stat = 0.17, d.f. = 2, P = 0.88).

Discussion:
	Color did not seem to be a major factor in the ability of the Betta splendins males to identify and direct displays at each other. The blue water and Bettas were similar in coloration, which would theoretically reduce the effectiveness of body color as a trigger for agnostic response. Thus, there should have been a greater agnostic response in clear water than blue water. The experiment, however, did not indicate a significent difference in agnostic interactions according to water color (Figure 1), and, therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Yet, Betta splendins also recognize each other by silhouettes and texture (Bando: 1991), so the shape of expanded fins and the appearance of scales allows them to identify and respond to other males.  In addition, research has found that greater brightness and color of an opposing male increased the agnostic response (Bando: 1991), which would seem to contradict the results of our experiment. Nevertheless, it is possible that a combination of factors—color, silhouette, and texture—is used for conspecific male identification. This would suggest that silhouette and texture could still be used to identify another male, and the reduction in ability to distinguish that fish's color from its surroundings would not be enough to reduce agnostic behavior.
	The data from this experiment also shows a large difference in agnostic behavior 
displayed by the second set of Betta splendins when compared to the other two sets. The composite behavioral score is especially high for the trial in blue water, where the second set's score of 44.5 is compared with scores of 0 and 2 from the other two sets (Figure 1). Betta splendins generally display behaviors that are individual but consistent over a variety of contexts and interactions (Dzieweczynski and Forrette: 2013). As a result, it is reasonable one fish may tend to display more aggressively than another. As we noted during the experiment, one of the Bettas in set two accounted for most of the recorded behavior during both trials. It is possible the characteristically individual behavior of this fish accounted for this notable difference in set two's composite score. Individual behavior aside, our data supports the idea that animal behavior and intraspecific interactions are complex.  If it is true that multiple factors are important for Betta conspecific male recognition—color, texture, and silhouette for example—then the same is likely the case for numerous other species. Further research on agnostic behavior benefits from the understanding that responses cannot be easily reduced to identify a single trigger.
