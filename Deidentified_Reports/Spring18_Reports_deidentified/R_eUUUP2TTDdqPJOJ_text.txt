Title: Investigating the Effects of Ecdysone Inhibition on the Growth of Pre-Commitment Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The use of hormone blockers as pest control is a promising solution to the concerns of toxicity and immunity that other pesticides introduce. The ability to effectively use an insect’s biology against itself is fundamental to any pesticide, however many hormone blockers have a specific window of time in which they are effective. Ecdysone inhibition functions on the principle that by preventing the surges of ecdysone at each molt the insect will not be able to reach its adult phase. While the relation between ecdysone and molting is well documented, the window in which ecdysone inhibition is a viable method of pest control requires more research. This study sought to compare the growth of Manducta Sexta caterpillars treated with ecdysone blockers to those developing naturally. M.Sexta caterpillars were weighed, measured, and observed for any major changes in their physiology.  The data provided no evidence that the introduction of ecdysone blocker had any effect on M.Sexta weight or time of pupation. This study suggests more investigation into the effectiveness of ecdysone blocker over specific stages in M.Sexta development. 


Introduction:
While the totality of insect development contains large amounts of complex mechanisms and interactions, three primary factors are juvenile hormone, insulin, and ecdysone. (Nijout et all, 2015). Insulin signaling in the prothoracic gland stimulates the production of ecdysone; the hormone responsible for stimulating cell divisions and instar development. In general, ecdysone is believed to control the molt times, although the mechanism through its production occurs both in the prothoracic gland in the production of a-ecdysone followed by its oxidation to B-ecdysone in the abdominal oenocytes. (Fukada, 1944)
. 
The ecdysone blocker azadirachtin functions by inducing apoptosis in the prothoracic gland through a currently unknown mechanism in calcium signaling. (Zhang J et. all,2017). Therefore, azadirachtin cannot prevent the creation of B-ecdysone in the abdominal oenocytes directly. 


Materials and Methods:
Methodology for the Investigation of the Effect of Ecdysone Inhibition on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars
	This study will investigate the growth of M.Sexta caterpillars treated with azadirachtin and compare it to the growth of untreated M.Sexta caterpillars before and after the commitment pulse to investigate the  effectiveness of azadirachtin as a growth and feeding suppressing pesticide relatively late in in juvenile development of M.Sexta caterpillars. 
Subjects
	8 M.Sexta caterpillars will be selected for testing. All caterpillars will have been in the same container and feeding from the same source. All attempts to obtain equally healthy and physiologically identical caterpillars will be made. Each caterpillar will be approximately in the same instar phase and will be expected to have their commitment pulse within a week. Half will have their diet supplemented with azadirachtin and the rest will serve as a control. 
Apparatus
	Each caterpillar will be weighed and measured. The commitment pulse will be determined by the characteristic appearance of a small dark vein on the back of the M.Sexta caterpillar. 

Procedure
	Before testing begins, each caterpillar will have been kept in the same container, experiencing similar conditions and feeding from the same food source. Caterpillars will be removed from these containers and isolated into individual habitats. Caterpillars will be kept in 25 C environments with a 12-hour day night cycle. Caterpillars will be fed 10 grams of food daily, and food will be cleaned out each day to ensure cleanliness. 4 of the caterpillars will receive 10 drops of 1/1250 azadirachtin/water mixture as opposed to the 10 drops of just water received by the control group. Each day, the caterpillars will be weighed and measured, as well as observed for any signification physical transformations, such as entering into the commitment pulse. Once the data has been collected, caterpillar growth will be compared between the groups to attempt to observe any significant differences in each group. Finally, due to the extreme tenacity of M.Sexta caterpillars and their status as harmful pests, the subjects will be either flash frozen and thrown away, incinerated, or fired into the surface of the sun, depending on the remaining budget. 
Significance
	If a significant difference between the growth of the M.Sexta caterpillars emerge between test groups, it will be attributed to the presence of, or lack of, azadirachtin as a supplement in their food. 


Results:
Observations of Collected Data and Possible Significance
This section attempts to explain the significant aspects of the data and as well as address certain errors that may have occurred in the experiment. The primary focus is on the mass of the caterpillars and the time they entered the commitment pulse. Secondary factors are the time of pupation and length, however due to errors in the methodology these were deemed unreliable.
Mass
	The caterpillars all showed highly similar distributions of weight and mass. (fig 1) For most of the caterpillars, the beginning weights fell between 6 and 7 grams and ended at three to four grams. The only exception was specimen 1 and specimen 8. Specimen one started off at 8 grams, but afterwards showed the same weight loss per day as the rest (-.65 average grams per day). Specimen 8 started at 5.7 grams, and continued to grow far after the others had entered their commitment pulses. For this reason, it is suspected that specimen 8 was too young, and should be disregarded from the data. 
Time of Commitment and time of Pupation
All Caterpillars except for specimen 8 entered the commitment pulse by the third day of the experiment. At this point, weight loss increases significantly before falling off again (fig. 1). Due to how quickly the experiment ended, time of pupation will not be considered, although it may be important to note that the control had more complete pupa by the end of the experiment. It is estimated that for most pupation began between the seventh and 8th day.
Statistics
	Statistical analysis was done using an unpaired T test by comparing the weight loss per day between the two groups. Our P value was .84 and was not deemed significant. 

Data Analysis and Errors
	This section will address significant trends observed in the data, and suggest potential rationale. It will also cover potential errors, their effects, and how they could have been prevented or avoided. 
Trends
	Beginning with the time of the commitment pulse, the test group with azadirachtin showed no difference from the control group. This is believed to be due in part to the caterpillars entering the commitment pulse so suddenly. It is possible that there was not enough time for the azadirachtin to take effect, or the commitment pulse had already begun at the start. With mass, both groups had extremely similar changes in mass over time, appearing to be completely unaffected. 
Errors
	The previously stated sudden commitment pulse is a primary concern, as if the caterpillars did not eat a sufficient amount of food before the commitment pulse, the drug would not have had any effect. Next, errors in food handling led to the caterpillars being exposed to, and resting on, a large amount of food. It is unknown what effects this could have had on the experiment, and it could have been prevented through due diligence. This error is of particular note due to it occurring sometime between the first and the third day, during which all but one caterpillars entered their commitment pulse. Finally, different methods of measuring the length of each caterpillar led to unreliable data. Depending on the individual measuring them, caterpillars would be either stretched out fully or measured at rest. This led to inconsistent recording and could have been prevented through communication.
Significance
	Due to the low sample size and severe errors, the study is unreliable at best and requires more testing to be certain. Should this study be proven valid, it opens several questions about the duration of ecdysone in the body and the role of abdominal oenocytes in its processing. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the time sensitive nature of hormone based insecticides and suggests potential room for improvement in the field of ecdysone blocking insecticides.
