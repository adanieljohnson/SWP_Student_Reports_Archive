Title: Effects of Precor on Caterpillars

Abstract:
	Manduca sexta goes through 4 stages of development which is controllled by 3 main hormones – PTTH, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. When juvenile hormones’ levels in the blood lowers suddenly, insects get ready to proceed to the next stage of development. In this lab, we examined the effects of Precor which mimics the Juvenile hormones on the development of caterpillars. To do this, we fed food that contains 10 drops of Precor to treatment group and recorded their visual characteristics and weights. The hypothesis was that the addition of Precor will delay caterpillars’ development, and we used two sample t_tests. Our results supported the hypothesis that the treatment group did not develop very well and p_value of 0.0369 shows that the change in caterpillars’ weights after 7 days are significently different between two groups. This is because high levels of Juvenile hormones in the blood prevents development of caterpillars. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect that goes through a holometabolous life cycle with 4 distinct stages – egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, adult. The life cycle can be longer or shorter depending on the diet and average daily temperature. It is also controllled mainly by 3 hormones that include PTTH, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. Ecdysterone regulates timing of molting; when its levels suddenly increase and decrease, insects perceive that as a sign to proceed to the next stage of development. Juvenile hormones are composed of “long chain organic molecules produced mainly by the corpus allata” [Johnson, 2018]. This hormone regulates the type of molt and can delay the development depending on its levels. During the stage of 5th larva, if juvenile hormone levels does not drop, the caterpillar would not receive the signals that it is large enough to pupate and form a normal size moth. 
	The purpose of this lab is to see the effects of Precor on caterpillars. As Precor mimics the Juvenile hormones, it should regulate the caterpillars’ developments when it is added to their diets. My hypothesis is that the addition of Precor to caterpillars’ diets will alter the life cycle of caterpillars and delay its development.   


Materials and Method:
First of all, we selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighing approximately 1 gram, and divided them into 2 groups of 4 each. We prepared 4 round plastic containers for their homes, and divided each container into 2 sections by using index cards. We placed each caterpillar in its own separate home. 
	For controll group, we fed 10 g of food for each caterpillar and added 10 drops of water. For treatment group, we fed 10 g of food for each caterpillar and added 10 drops of 1: 1250 Precor to maximize the effects. All 8 were kept in the same incubator for 7 days, and we recorded their mass and visual observations every day and prepared new food. 
	We conducted two sample t- test to determine if the change in caterpillars’ weights after 7 days are significently different between controll and treatment group. Mean difference in weights after 7 days was also calculated to analyze the data. 


Results:
The treatment group that had Precor in diets did not grow as much as the controll group did, and they got weaker as days passed. The treatment group was not as active as the controll group. The difference in visual was obvious – the treatment group turned to greyish and more transparent color while the controll group maintained its bright green color. The average weight for controll group at day 8 is 13.67 g with the standard deviation of 1.67, and the average weight for treatment group at day 8 is 10.83 g with the standard deviation of 1.59. According to t_test, the t-value is 2.6736 and p_value is 0.0369. Figure1 shows that the controll group increased in weight more steeply than the treatment group increased.  Figure 2 shows that for controll group the average difference in weight after 7 days is 12.6275g with the standard deviation of 1.43. For treatment group, the average difference in weight after 7 days is 9.86 g with the standard deviation of 1.496. 


Discussion:
The results supported the hypothesis that treatment group that received Precor did not develop as much as the controll group did. The p_value which was 0.0369 shows that the difference between the controll group and treatment group is statistically significent. This result is due to the effect of Precor which mimics Juvenile hormones in caterpillars. When caterpillars are treated with Precor, it does not develop further and eventually starve to death. That is the reason the treatment group grew weaker and weaker every day. Juvenile hormone (JH), produced by the corpora allata, regulates development. The amount of JH in the blood determines the degree juvenility of the next stage; the caterpillars can’t proceed to the next stage when it has high level of juvenile hormones in their blood.
