Title:  The Effect of Caffeine on the Contractile Rate of Frog Legs

Abstract:
I.	
Calcium is an important element of the contractile mechanism in skeletal muscle. When calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds to other proteins to the sliding between myosin and actin filaments. Once the contraction occurs calcium is reuptaken, and the muscle is able to relax. Caffeine is a drug that blocks the reuptake of calcium therefore produced uncontrollable contractions. This phenomenon was tested through 3 frog legs and injected each with 0.01 mL of caffeine, firing a stimulus, then analyzing the myogram to see caffeine’s effect on the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle. 


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to direct stimuli within milliseconds of stimulation. It does so through skeletal muscles that have hundreds of complex myofibers, which are them composed of myofilaments like actin and myosin. The skeletal muscles have functional groups called motor units that work innervate myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. Nerve impulse at these junctions allow for the release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine or ACh, which then binds to receptor of the muscle fiber and opens the sodium gates through depolarization [Johnson: 2018]. Next, an action potential allows for the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This calcium then binds to troponin, which moves tropomyosin out of the way and exposes the myosin heads to begin the muscle contraction. Calcium is key to the contractile mechanism of vertebrae’s. Contractions are seized when calcium is reuptaken into the sarcoplasmic reticulum to be recycled. Thus, teetering with the release or blockage of calcium would affect the contractile rate of twitches. One drug in particular that blocks the reuptake of calcium is Caffeine. Because calcium cannot be reuptaken, contractions will not end normally, but instead when the organism has reached tetanus, or a period of max tension. Tetanus can be seen through graphs of twitches called myograms. In this experiment, injections of caffeine into the isolated gastrocnemius muscle will allow for uncontrolled contractions because the caffeine would block calcium from being reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rate of uncontrolled contractions will be evaluated by measuring the amplitude of the twitches during the contractile period of the myograms. 


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were obtained for both the control, before the injection of caffeine, and the treatment group, after the injection of caffeine. The gastrocnemius muscle was exposed on each leg by pulling away the skin. After a string was tied around the top of the muscle, it was isolated from the first hanger attached to device measuring the myograms. The rest of the frog leg was pinned down with pins and pin probes were attached to the gastrocnemius muscle, making sure they were not intertwining or touching. Different amplitude stimuli were fired from the computer program until the threshold was found for each leg. Once the threshold was obtained, three mygorams recorded. For the treatment group, after each of the control myograms had been taken, 0.1 mL of caffeine was injected into the middle of the gastrocnemius muscle using a syringe. The amplitudes were set to the same values used for the treatment group. The contractile response was again recorded for the treatment group. 


Results:

Figure 3: Response of Three Frog Legs Three With Amplitude 0.6 V



Discussion:
The hypothesis can be accepted because according to the figures and graphs displayed above, the treatment frog legs consistently produced a stronger response than the control group. The mean of the treatment group was significantly larger than the control group (t-stat=10.66, df=2, P=.009). The response in this experiment was how high the amplitude of the contraction was when analyzing the myogram. A higher amplitude indicates that the contractions were sped up over time; therefore, tetany, or a state of max tension was reached faster until fatigue happened and the tetany began to drop off. Referring back to results of the t-test, the data of the experiment can be deemed statistically significant due to the extremely low p-value. Therefore, caffeine does cause higher amplitudes of myograms, or uncontrolled contractions.  However, the controversy lies in whether or not the reasoning for the uncontrolled reactions was accurate or not. According to other published studies, when caffeine is injected into the frog leg, it promotes the release of Ca2+ which in turn will enhance the contractile rate, or increase the amplitude of the twitch [Kumar, Tomar, Rao: 2015]. On the contrary, another experiment’s results were conclusive with the hypothesis of this experiment that the blockage of reuptake of Ca2+ allows for uncontrolled contractions, specifically, a prolongation of the activation state [A. Weber, R Herz: 1968]. There are conflicting conclusions on how caffeine indefinitely increases the contractile rate within the gastrocnemius muscle in a frog leg.
