Title: Precor's Effect on Pupation in the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect's molting and metamorphosis phases are entirely dependent on hormones; particularly JH and ecdysterone. These hormones are released in proportion to one another in a phase called the commitment pulse, which orchestrates the beginning of pupation. By feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars high levels of methoprene, an analog of JH, we would inhibit the commitment pulse, forcing the caterpillars to continue to live in the 5th instar phase. If they are unable to pupate, it is likely that they will stay in the 5th instar stage. This was tested by using a controll and treatment group of caterpillars; the controll group was fed typical caterpillar food with water, and the treatment group was fed food that contained methoprene. We observed that the treatment group showed no signs of pupation, and instead continual growth (in both weight and length), suggesting they would stay in their 5th instar phase without pupating. This supports previous knowledge suggesting that a decrease of JH is essential for pupation. Our results were statistically insignificent, but our observations supported our hypothesis.

Introduction:
Insects controll growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes using both hormone-based and neuron-based signaling [Johnson, 2018]. For our purposes, we are looking at two hormones that controll these processes; juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone. In all insects, JH has primary roles in the regulation of metamorphosis and reproduction [Riddiford, 2012]. During the Manduca sexta's (a holometabolous insect) 5th instar phase, their prothoracic glands release a small amount of ecdysteroids. Ecdysone in the absence of JH causes the cessation of feeding and the onset of wandering to find a pupation site [Riddiford, 2012]. If there were to be JH, there would be no Ecdysone, and therefore the continuation of pupation. The release of both hormones is also known as the commitment pulse, and the commitment pulse indicates the larvae is ready to pupate.  JH works alongside the ecdysteroids, but in different concentrations to controll growth and metamorphosis. This experiment will utilize Precor, which is methoprene; a juvenile hormone analog. Methoprene is a common insecticide, used to keep larvae in their juvenile phases, and to avoid metamorphosis into the adult phase, where they continue to reproduce. The independent variable is methoprene and the dependent variables are length, weight, and pupation. We predict that increasing the levels of juvenile hormone by methoprene will cause the larvae in the 4th larval stage to molt into the 5th instar phase but be unable to eventually pupate due to lack of commitment pulse because of high levels of JH.  



Materials and Method:

We used eight 4th/5th instar Manduca sexta caterpillars and separated them into a controll and treatment group. Each group had 4 caterpillars. They were all given the same treatment aside from their food. The controll group was given normal food, with 10 drops of water per grams of food. The treatment group was fed food with 10 drops of Precor (methoprene) per 10 grams of food. Both groups were fed 40 grams of their corresponding food over the period of the eight day experiment. All conditions remained the same, and they were fed once a day. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator that regulated light and dark cycles and maintained temperature. The caterpillars were housed in plastic containers (with holes for air) that separated the animals by index cards. We used a statistical two sample T-test to compare data along with graphs of average weight and length of the caterpillars (weight p_value= 0.63, length p_value= 0.53).



Results:
The Control group continued to gain weight up until days seven and eight when it began to slow down. They continued to grow in length until day eight, when they regressed and became smaller. The treatment group continued to grow in both weight and length.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that larvae treated with methoprene will stay in the 5th instar stage, because they would be unable to pupate due to a lack of commitment pulse because of high levels of JH. Our controll caterpillars showed signs of pupation, whereas the treatment group did not. Our controll group began to slow in growth on day eight, both in their weight and length. This is characteristic of the body preparing for pupation. The controll group also exhibited a color change from vibrant blue to brownish yellow- another indication of pupation. Our treatment group did the opposite and didn't present any signs of pupation, but instead continued to grow in length and gain weight. This suggests their bodies were continuing to grow and were not complying with pupation, which supports our hypothesis that caterpillars that are fed high doses of methoprene are unable to pupate. Our p_values were unusually high for both length and weight of the caterpillars (weight p_value= 0.63, and length p_value= 0.61), suggesting that our data is not supported statistically. If the experiment had lasted longer, more of the caterpillars would have begun to pupate, which would have led to smaller p_values because of a more drastic change in length and weight due to a change in exoskeleton. Ideally, we would have continued studying the caterpillars for longer to determine the reactions of the treatment group to the hormone. Another experiment suggests that In vitro experiments with the abdominal epidermis from feeding larvae showed that exposure to 20E (ecdysterone) in the absence of JH was sufficient to cause pupal commitment, whereas exposure to 20E and JH maintained the larval state [Reddiford, 2012]. This would support our hypothesis that the caterpillars that were continuously fed high levels of JH would remain in their 5th larval instar stage. To conclude, we observed that the increase in JH through consumption of methoprene prevents the Manduca sexta from pupating.

Figure 1. Total Change in Weight (from day one to day eight) of Control and Treatment Manduca sexta Caterpillars
Figure 1 displays the difference in weight between the controll and treatment Manduca sexta caterpillars over a period of eight days. The caterpillars that were fed Precor (treatment group) were heavier than the controll group, but the results were statistically insignificent (p_value= 0.63, t_stat= 0.5). 

Figure 2. Total Change in Length (from day one to day eight) of Control and Treatment Manduca sexta Caterpillars
Figure 2 displays the difference in length between the controll and treatment Manduca sexta caterpillars over a period of eight days. The caterpillars that were fed Precor (treatment group) were longer than the controll group, but the results were statistically insignificent (p_value= 0.53, t_stat= 0.61). 

Figure 3. Images of Animals 4 (controll group) and 6 (treatment group) on Experiment Day Eight
Figure 3 shows two images, both taken on day eight of the experiment. The left image shows Animal 4, from the controll group. It is turning yellowish brown, shrinking in size, and beginning to grow an exoskeleton. The right image shows Animal 6, from the treatment group. It is bright blue, continues to grow, and shows no signs of pupation.
