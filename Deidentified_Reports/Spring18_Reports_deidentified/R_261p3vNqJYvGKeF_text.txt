Title: The effects of Martin’s IGR, a juvenile hormone mimic, on the growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a pest that is easily affected by hormone levels. They are easily studied as that they have distinct stages of growth and certain hormones that directly affect growth. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone levels affect the development of this species. In this experiment, four caterpillars were placed in a control group, feeding them each 10 g of food mixed with distilled water, and four caterpillars in a treatment group, feeding them each 10 g of food mixed with Martin’s IGR. The weight and length were compared between the control groups and treatment groups every day for seven days and observed how Martin’s IGR affected their growth. After analyzing the data collected, the hypothesis was rejected which stated that adding Martin’s IGR to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would not allow the caterpillars to molt and would cause them to enter a 6th instar, or a supernumerary nymph. As two of the caterpillars, one from the treatment and one from the control group molted and were about to begin to pupate, the hypothesis is rejected. Due to a variation of starting sizes of the caterpillars and a time restraint, no data was able to provide a clear enough conclusion. 


Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth of the family Shingdae present throughout the American continent [Johnson: 2018]. These pests have an important model system for understanding the physiological control of growth. This species goes through four major stages of growth throughout their lives [Johnson: 2018]. They begin as eggs where they will stay for 2 days then they enter the larva stage where they continue to grow through 5 larva instars [Johnson: 2018]. Then the species will begin to molt and enter the pupa stages and then finally become an adult moth. This whole growth cycle lasts about 39-48 days [Johnson: 2018]. Two hormones are essential for the growth of the Manduca Sexta: juvenile hormone and ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. In order to pupate, Manduca Sexta must molt and go through a commitment pulse. The commitment pulse occurs when the caterpillar is large enough and has stored enough nutrients to pupate. At the commitment pulse, ecdysterone levels will drastically rise, as it is a necessary hormone for molting [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile hormone will begin to fall after the fourth instar and continue to decline during the fifth instar. This drop in juvenile hormone is necessary as it allows for the caterpillar to successfully molt and grow. Juvenile hormones helps regulate the type of molting the Manduca Sexta will do, and the levels of this hormone present will determine whether the caterpillar can enter the pupate stage. 
In this experiment, amounts of juvenile hormone were altered with the use of an insect growth regulator, Martin’s IGR. Very common IGR’s are substances that either interfere with or over-activates processes regulated by the insects hormones: juvenile hormones and ecdyteroids [Tunaz: 2004]. The IGR used in the experiment was used to over-activate and mimic the purpose of juvenile hormone. Martin’s IGR will interfere with the corpus allotum, which is responsible for releasing juvenile hormone [Tunaz: 2004].  Martin’s IGR will act on the corpus allotum to essentially mimic juvenile hormone in the caterpillars [Tunaz: 2004]. The independent variable is the diet that the groups of caterpillars were given and the dependent variable is the size and length of the caterpillars after digesting their diet. Our hypothesis states that increasing the amounts of juvenile hormone with Martin’s IGR at the onset of the 5th larval instar growth will be disrupted and a 6th larval instar will come forth, instead of the commitment pulse to pupation, and this is known as the supernumerary nymph. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected, and each caterpillar was around the fourth and fifth larva instar. All caterpillars weighed between 2.6-3.9 g and were separated into two groups, with four caterpillars in each group. The groups were a control group and a treatment group. The control group’s diet consisted of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) with distilled water added and the treatment group’s diet consisted of GLM with Martin’s IGR added. Each caterpillar in the control group received 10 g of food with 150 uL distilled of water, and each caterpillar in the treatment group received 10 g of food with 150 uL of Martin’s IGR added. The caterpillars were kept in closed containers with small holes on the lids and kept in an incubator at 23 °C, in 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light. Every day for seven days, the caterpillars weight and length were recorded, as well as obvious changes to appearance.


Results:
As both the Martin’s IGR Treatment Manduca sexta and the control group Manduca sexta were observed over eight days, both their weight and length increased and then began to decrease after day seven (Figure 1 and 2). The weight on day 8 of the animals were similar between caterpillars treated with distilled water and those treated with Martin’s IGR (t-stat=0.07, p value=0.94). The biggest change in weight were observed in day six, but there was no significant difference (t-stat=0.44, p value=0.67). Similar results were obtained for the length of the caterpillars treated with Martin’s IGR and the caterpillars treated with distilled water (t-stat=0.12, p value=0.91).
In both groups, 1 individual from both the Martin’s IGR treatment group and the control group began to pupate, showing that Martin’s IGR did not stop the caterpillar’s ability to pupate. As well, within the same group the caterpillars varied drastically in size and stages, as one caterpillar shown is large and in the fifth instar, while the other caterpillar within the same group is smaller and molting (Figure 3). 


Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment the hypothesis was rejected. Our hypothesis was that adding Martin’s IGR to the Manduca sexta diet will lead to a 6th instar and will not allow the caterpillars to pupate. This is rejected because one caterpillar in both groups molted and were going to begin to pupate (See Figure 3). Additionally, the caterpillars from both groups were similar in weight and length over the eight days. Something that could have affected our results was that not all the animals were the exact same size on day 1. Most of our caterpillars were very large and possibly could have already entered the commitment pulse and were unable to stop the process of metamorphosis. In addition, 150 uL of Martin’s IGR per 10 g of food may not have been enough to stop the caterpillar from molting. Since 150 uL in 10 g of food only attributes to 0.3% of the diet, we can consider that this dose is very low. For future experiments, testing with higher doses could help see a greater effect on Martin’s IGR on the growth of Manduca sexta.
