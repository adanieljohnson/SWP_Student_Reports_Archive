Title: Effect of Acetylcholine on Twitch Amplitude of Gastrocnemius muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
	This experiment was designed to test the effects of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh) on the twitch amplitude of a muscle contraction of the Gastrocnemius muscle in Rania pipiens frog. Based on previous research, we determined the concentration of the ACh that we would inject into the muscle, and hypothesized that this concentration of the neurotransmitter would cause the twitch amplitude to increase. We dissected three frog legs and tested each of them first with no injections and recorded the twitch amplitude, then injected ACh into the legs and recorded the new twitch amplitude. After running statistical tests on the data, it was concluded that our hypothesis was supported and that the concentration of ACh that we chose did cause the twitch amplitude to increase.


Introduction:
The Gastrocnemius muscle is located in the leg of the Rania pipiens frog, close to where the human calf muscle would be located. It is used to controll the motion of the knee and ankle joints. It is connected on one end to the Sciatic nerve, which connects the Gastrocnemius muscle to the spinal chord, where it can receive signals from the brain. In this experiment, we will be determining how direct electrical stimulation causes the muscle to twitch. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter that is released when nerve impulses signaled by the brain arrive at the neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2018]. When ACh binds with its receptor, sodium channels open and an action potential is generated throughout the muscle fiber, which causes calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson:2018]. The influx of calcium causes the muscle to contract [Johnson:2018]. In an experiment conducted by Chiba et al., the effect of addition of ACh on muscle contraction was tested in rats, and it was found that “In the presence of GTP, ACh elicited a further contraction of the β‐escin‐permeabilized intrapulmonary bronchial smooth muscles from controll rats, even though the Ca2+concentration was clamped” [Chiba:2009]. Another study conducted by Robert Furchgott on the arterial smooth muscle of rabbits found that the response to ACh in the muscle was increased intensity of contractions [Furchgott: 1980]. Both these studies mention that ACh could have a relaxing effect on the muscle if the ACh levels were increased by such a magnitude that calcium stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum were depleted. However, a concentration of 0.1Ml of ACh should not have a relaxing effect. If additional ACh were to be injected into the leg, the twitch amplitude of the contraction would increase because if the normal amount of ACh released causes the muscle to contract, additional ACh would cause a more intense contraction. If we inject the leg with 0.1Ml of Acetylcholine, the twitch amplitude will increase because the intensity of the contraction would increase. 


Materials and Method:
Place the leg of Rania pipiens on the dissecting pan. Using tweezers, gently pull the skin off of the leg, exposing the muscle. Moisten the leg throughout the experiment using the frog Ringer’s solution. Separate the two inner thigh muscles gently with the tweezers. Identify the Gastrocnemius muscle, and use a pair of scissors to cut the other end of the sciatic nerve, that is attached to tissues. For this experiment, we will be stimulating the muscle directly, so use a piece of thread to tie the Gastrocnemius muscle to the force transducer and adjust its height so that the rest of the leg lays flat on the dissecting pan. Pin the leg down onto the pan. Put the needle probes into the Gastrocnemius muscle of the frog and connect the iWorks machine to the computer on which the software is installed. Using the LabScribe toolbar, set the Hz at 1, the Amplitude at 5, and pulses at 1. For the controll, fire an electric current into the leg and record the response based on twitch amplitude. Next, use a syringe to inject 0.1 Ml of Ach into the muscle. Repeat the firing of the electrical current and record the new voltage of the twitch. Repeat this procedure on two more legs. Analyze results using a paired T-test. 



Results:
The controll group had an average Hz of 0.154 Hz +/- 0.181Hz, and the experimental group showed an average Hz of 0.672 Hz +/- 0.222Hz. After conducting the paired T-test, it was found that the P value is 0.024, which is statistically significent. The average difference between the controll and experimental was 0.518 Hz. 
Figure 1 shows the change in Hz from the controll to the experimental group. The figure indicates that the average Hz for the experimental group was significently higher than the Hz of the controll. 


Discussion:

	Our hypothesis that the addition of 0.1Ml of ACh to the Gastrocnemius muscle of Rania pipiens was supported because the twitch amplitude increased from the controll to the experimental group, with a statistically significent P value of 0.024. This indicates that our reasoning was correct in believing that such a small addition of ACh, 0.1Ml, would have the effect of increasing twitch amplitude due to increased influx of calcium, but would not be enough to fully deplete the calcium stores and cause the muscle to relax. Furchgott found that any concentrations of ACh about 0.1 microgram would increase the intensity of muscle contractions, and our measurement of 0.1Ml (equivalent to 100 micrograms) was much higher than his concentration, and therefore should definitely elicit a response [Furchgott: 1980]. 
	Further experimentation should be done to determine the concentration of ACh at which the muscle begins to relax instead of contract, due to depletion of calcium. This could be done by repeating the same experiment but increasing the Ml of ACh incrementally until twitch amplitude of experimental began to decrease.
