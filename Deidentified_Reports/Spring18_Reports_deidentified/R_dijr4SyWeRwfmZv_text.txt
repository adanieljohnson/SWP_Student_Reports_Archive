Title: Effects of Light and Darkness on the Root:Shoot Ratio of Mung Bean Plants 

Abstract:
   The main objective of this experiment was to test what plants will do in the presence of little to no light. For the experiment we used mung bean plants, or, vigna radiata. Our group wanted to see what the tradeoffs of the plants are in this kind of scenario. If a group of mung bean plants are placed under a light protective cover, I predict that the mung beans with light access will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the group placed under the light cover. We had a control group that had access to sunlight while another group of mung bean plants were covered with a light protective cover. We watered them every day for two weeks and then we separated them out and calculated the root:shoot ratios with weight and length. The average root:shoot weight ratio had a p-value of .029 (t-value: 2.619133, df: 4). The average root:shoot length ratio had a p-vaule of .078 (t-value: 1.737603, df: 4). The hypothesis was supported and the mung bean plants with more access to sunlight had a higher overall average root:shoot ratio than those that did not get sunlight. 

Introduction:
   Plants interact with abiotic and biotic stimuli in their natural environments and depending upon what resource is most abundant or least abundant, they will change their allocation strategies. Resources needed for plant growth are divided between what can be acquired from above ground or below ground from the soil. Stems above ground support the shoot and are used during light capture and growth, especially during competition for light resources. The roots are used as an absorptive organ but also anchor the plant to the soil. Normally depending on which resource is less available, the plant will allocate resources to either root or shoot growth in order to thrive. My team and I want to know what will happen to the root:shoot ratio of mung bean plants (vigna radiata) if they are grown in the dark versus in the shade. Their growth rate and the environment in which they grow are ideal for the restraints of this lab. This is important as any tree or plant under a forest canopy are subjected to different levels of light, and usually limits plant growth. It is also important to the study of a plant's circadian rhythms. For plants, being without sunlight leads to energy allocation being more important than something like reproduction [Korhonen:2004]. Resource limitation leads to tradeoffs and with some plants they will tradeoff longer shoots for shorter roots, so they can try to attain more sunlight, especially if the soil is rich with nutrients. If a group of mung bean plants are placed under a light protective cover, I predict that the mung beans with light access will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the group placed under the light protective cover. 

Materials and Methods:
   We used mung bean seeds/plants for this experiment. A handful of seeds were used for each planting container and we added 50 mL of Miracle Grow to both of the containers. Both groups were watered every day for two weeks at 11 AM. They received enough water for it to seep through the bottom of the containers. The control group was placed in a greenhouse, and while the other group was also in the greenhouse, that group did not receive direct sunlight due to a light blocking cover. After the two-week period, the plants were taken out and carefully separated by their respective groups, with sunlight and without sunlight. We washed and dried them with paper towels and then weighed the whole plant together and recorded their weights. After that, we separated the roots from the shoots and measured the weights again. The roots were cut at the root, shoot junction where the stem starts to change color. Lastly we measured the root and shoot length to the nearest millimeter, as well as measuring the root and shoot weights separately to get weight and length root:shoot ratios. We used a one-tailed t-test to analyze the difference in the average root:shoot ratios for weight and length.

Results:
   The control group had an average weight of .82 ± 0.16 grams which decreased to .57 ± 0.040 grams in the experimental group [t-value: 2.6, df: 4, p-value: .029]. The trend in Figure 1 is that the average root:shoot ratio for weight decreased. 

   The control group had an average length of .82 ± .24 centimeters which decreased to .58 ± .062 centimeters in the experimental group [t-value: 1.7, df: 4, p-value: .079]. The trend in Figure 2 is that the average root:shoot ratio for length decreased. 

Discussion:
   In the end of this experiment, the null hypothesis was rejected, and my hypothesis was supported. The mung bean plants with full light access had higher average root:shoot weight and length ratios. The plants with light access did not need to tradeoff smaller roots for longer shoots to break through a hypothetical forest canopy to attain sunlight. Plants in in a situation of lower levels of light or even light competition will work harder to try to attain resources in other ways or will work to reproduce more rapidly so that the plant can pass on its genes to the next generation. [Nam: 2017] The plants with sunlight access had nutrients from the soil as well as full nutrients from photosynthesis, which the non-light plants did not have. The non-light plants would have a smaller average root:shoot ratio because they need to tradeoff long roots for taller shoots so that they could break through the hypothetical forest canopy. There was a significant difference in weight ratios but not in length ratios which means that the test group allocated more of its resources to shoot growth than to root growth which allowed for there to be similar lengths between the groups. Although this occurred, the weight ratios were significantly different because the control group had heavier roots due to the ample amount of sunlight and nutrients in the soil. The control group did not have to work as hard as the test group to allocate its resources to different places like the test group. Due to the p-value being below .05, this can be interpreted as a significant difference between the sun and shade groups for the average root:shoot weight ratio. This research is important in the study of circadian rhythms of plants as they pertain to what season it is and when to flower. Some behaviors showing rhythms include leaf movement and growth which pertains to allocation of resources and when a plant could grow and pollinate. The next logical step for this study would be to see if doing the same experiment with lower nutrient soil would yield similar results. The plants with sunlight had higher root:shoot ratios than the plants without light. In a larger context this shows how plants will adapt and change when not in the presence of natural light, as well as furthering experiments to tell if people can grow plants in places of low levels of natural light. This information could be used to help create new, untapped places to farm such as places in Scandinavia where there is not a lot of sunlight year-round. In the future there is a possibility of plants being grown on farms in Scandinavia where there is not a lot of sunlight. This would not only battle world hunger, but also helps improve the GDP of those countries.
