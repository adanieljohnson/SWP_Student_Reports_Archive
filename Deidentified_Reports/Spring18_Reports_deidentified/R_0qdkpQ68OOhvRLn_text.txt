Title: Effects of Ecdysterone on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
       The Manduca sexta (also known as the tobacco hornworm) is considered a pest. Itâ€™s growth is regulated by several hormones. In this study we analyzed the effects of Ecdysterone on Manducas. To do this, we utilized synthetic Ecdysterone and delivered it to Manducas mixed in their food. We compared the growth of these Manducas to the growth of Manducas that were eating untreated food. We hypothesized, from prior knowledge, that the synthetic Ecdysterone would drastically inhibit the growth of the Manducas. After concluding the experiment we confirmed that the synthetic Ecdysterone does inhibit growth of the Manducas. The data we collected through the experiment shows that the untreated Manducas grow at a more rapid pace than those that were given the synthetic Ecdysterone.

Introduction:
       Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) affect processes in insects regarding molting, growth, and progression through stages of life. Manduca sexta has IGRs that control molting and each instar stage. Ecdysterone is an IGR that controls the stage of development after each molt in Manduca sexta. IGRs were first discovered by accident when paper towels cause low hatch rates in linden bugs. These became popular to study since IGRs are less harmful to the environment than broad-spectrum insecticides and are more compatible with pest management systems (Krysan and Dunley 1993).

	In our study of Manduca sexta, we will be utilizing a synthetic form of Ecdysterone called Azamax. The Manducas will be in the fourth larval stage. Naturally, they would molt into a larger fifth larval stage after a drop in Ecdysterone levels. During the fifth larval stage, the Manducas should have a mass ranging between 1.1 to 11 grams (Johnson 2018). We will be examining Manduca sexta treated with Azamax to confirm that Ecdysterone regulates the larval stages. We are studying these effects in order to better understand how this IGR impacts the Manduca sexta and to determine if Azamax would be useful in pest control.

Materials and Methods:
        We began the experiment by utilizing a plastic container and a balance to measure 10 grams of food for each experimental caterpillar. Then we used a new transfer pipet for each 10 grams of food, and added 4 drops, per 10 grams of food, of Azamax and stirred it well to ensure the Azamax is distributed evenly throughout the food. The Azamax was at a concentration of 1:1250 of 4 mL of reagent in 100mL of water.
	Next we created the environment where the Manducas were kept. This was done by dividing clear plastic containers in half with an index card and taping the ends to the walls to ensure there is no transfer of food and that the Manducas could not cross over into the other half of the container. Then the food treated with Azamax was added to one half of each of the containers.
	Turning to the control groups, we again measured out 10 grams of food per caterpillar using the same method as before. 4 drops of water were added to each 10 grams of food to ensure that moisture was not the determining factor in the effects. The control food was then stirred well and then placed in the other half of the containers.
	All of the caterpillars were massed and then placed in the containers, one caterpillar per section. The containers were housed in an incubator at 27 degrees Celsius. We replaced the food daily and recorded both the mass of the caterpillars and the amount of food eaten. With all of the data, we used a two-sample t-test to determine if our results were due to our experiment or a result of chance.

Results:
In the experiment, we found that the synthetic Ecdysterone, Azamax, did inhibit the growth of the Manduca sexta. In the trials conducted, it was observed that the control groups were larger than the groups treated with the Azamax as shown in Fig. 1 below. Both groups began at approximataely the same mass, however the control group grew to nearly twice the size of the experimental group. The control group also had a healthier green color. The control group did begin to eat more as the experiment progressed.

Discussion:
        Our hypothesis was supported by the results and we calculated a P value of P=0.04, and therefore confirm our hypothesis. The experiment concluded that the added Ecdysterone prevented the Manducas from growing and molting into the next larval stage. This is shown by the significant delta in size between our control group and the experimental group. The control groups grew to the expected size of a fifth instar Manduca sexta while the experimental groups did not reach this size. The Ecdysterone never dropped in the experimental group and as a result, their bodies did not grow and prepare for the next stage. In the control group, the Ecdysterone was allowed to drop naturally and they grew in preparation for the molt.
	In future studies, the experiment should be extended to include the molt of the Manducas. As a result of time constraints, we terminated our study prior to the molting of the Manducas. Observing how the control and experimental groups are affected by Ecdysterone during the molts will even further the understanding of the effects on growth and molting.
