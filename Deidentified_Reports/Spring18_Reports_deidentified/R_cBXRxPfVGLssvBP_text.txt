Title: Manduca Sexta Growth is Stunted When the Insects Consume the Ecdysone Inhibitor Azamax

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine how the weight of Manduca sexta 4th instar larvae will be effected by the consumption of the pesticide Azamax. I hypothesized that the presence of Azamax in the Manduca sexta’s food would affect the weight of the Manduca sexta, so if Azamax is consumed by the subjects, then the Manduca sexta will weigh less than they would if they had not consumed Azamax. Manduca sexta are pests that attack crops such a tobacco plants, so it is beneficial to know how a pesticide such as Azamax will have an effect on these organisms. To test our hypothesis, we put 0.60 mL of an Azamax solution that was 1 part chemical to 20 parts water into 40 grams of food. We broke this food up into clumps of 10 grams each and fed it to 4 Manduca sexta. Our other 4 subjects acted as our control group and were fed food that was just mixed with 0.60 mL of distilled water. We found a statistically significant difference between the change of weight in the control group and our experimental group. Our hypothesis was correct, the Manduca sexta that consumed Azamax grew less than the control subjects that did not consume the chemical. We concluded that the chemicals contained in act as a 20E inhibitor and thus stunt the growth of Manduca sexta. 


Introduction:
In this lab, we will look at how the consumption of Azamax/Azadirachtin, a 20E inhibitor, effects the weight of Manduca sexta when it is mixed into their food. Manduca sexta are part of the Order Lepidoptera and has a holometabolous life cycle meaning that it has 4 major life stages: egg, larvae, pupa, adult. A holometabolous also means that the larvae and the adult do not look similar; major body reorganization occurs during pupal metamorphosis [Johnson 8]. Manduca Sexta, also referred to as the tobacco hornworm, are common pests to plants such as tobacco, tomato, pepper, and eggplant. When the hornworm attaches onto a plant, it can cause “significant defoliation” of these crops which are of high importance in our economy [Byron: 2017]. The hormone Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that regulates the timing of molting during insect development. Near the end of the 4th larval instar, 20E levels increase, followed by another small rise in the 20E levels during the 5th instar (called the commitment pulse). Azamax/Azadirachtin is a natural insecticide that inhibits the production of the 20E hormone. Azamax is on the rise as a key insecticide in the global bio pesticide market and has shown to be effective against pests such as whiteflies, leafminers, fungus gnats, thrips, aphids and many leaf-eating caterpillars [Immaraju: 1998]. I hypothesize that Azamax does effect the weight of the Manduca sexta, so if Azamax is consumed by the subjects, the Manduca sexta will weigh less than they would if they had not consumed Azamax. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment designed to test how consumption of Azamax (independednt variable) effects the weight of Manduca sexta (dependent variable), we obtained 8 Manduca sexta all in their 4th instar larval life stage. To keep the experiment as controlled as possible, we tried to pick caterpillars that were generally the same weight. We took an initial measurement of the weight of each subject, recorded it, and then randomly assigned the subjects into 2 groups of 4. One of the groups of 4 was our control group and was used to compare our experimental group’s results to. This group was fed normal premade Manduca sexta food with no added chemicals. The other group of 4 was fed food that had Azamax mixed in. We obtained 80 grams of manduca food total, and divided it into 2 clumps of 40 grams. In the food intended for the experimental group, we added 0.60 mL (equivalent of 12 drops) of an Azamax solution that was 1 part chemical to 20 parts water and thoroughly mixed it into the food. In the food that was intended for the control subjects, we thoroughly mixed 0.60 mL of distilled water into the food. Each subject was put into a plastic container with a lid that had holes for breathing and was given 10 grams of their designated food (depending on if they were control or experimental). To save space and resources, we put an index card in the middle of each plastic container as a divider and put a caterpillar on each size. We labeled the outside of each container (C1, C2, E1…. etc.) to keep track of each subject. To further try and control the experiment, we kept all the subjects in an incubator that kept their living condition at a constant temperature and constant amount of light. Every day for 8 days, we weighed each Manduca sexta and recorded their new weight as well as any other observations that seemed critical, such as “experimental subject 2 is barely moving”. On day 5 we had to make new food for all the subjects because some of them were coming close to running out. After 8 days, we calculated the change in weight of each caterpillar from day one to day eight. We then found the average weight change for the control group and the average weight change for the experimental group. To conclude our experiment, we performed a two-sample T-test to compare the mean weight change of the experimental group to the mean weight change of the control group. 


Results:
After running a 2-sample T-Test, we found that the mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 4.78, df = 6, P = 0.003). On average, the control subjects weighed 6.44  1.375 grams more on day 8 than they did on day 1 compared to the experimental subjects that weighed 1.67 1.61 grams more on day 8 than they did on day 1. However, the average weight change of the experimental group could have been slightly skewed because experimental subject 2 lost 0.56 grams over the course of the 8 days rather than gaining weight. 


Discussion:
The experiment results supported our hypothesis that Azamax does effect the weight of the Manduca sexta, so if Azamax is consumed by the subjects, the Manduca sexta will weigh less than they would if they had not consumed Azamax. The Manduca sexta that consumed the Azamax gained significantly less weight than the caterpillars who consumed no chemicals, thus showing that the chemicals in the pesticide Azamax stunt the growth of Manduca sexta. This is the result we expected to find because the function of Azamax is to inhibit the hormone 20E that is in Manduca sexta. 20E is a hormone that works to regulate the timing of molting. A peak in 20E levels are needed for the instar to reach commitments pulse and move on to its next developmental stage (Johnson 12). If 20E is inhibited, like it was when Azamax was consumed by the experimental subjects, the organism will never be able to mature to the next life form. For this reason, it makes sense that when Azamax was present, the Manduca sexta did not grow as much because they were not preparing for the next life stage. The results of a previous study showed that the weight-gain in Manduca sexta who consumed Azamax was so poor that the larva was not able to meet the critical weight that is necessary for pupation [Schlüter: 1985]. These findings regarding the effects of Azamax on Manduca sexta can help us in preventing these pests from destroying economically important plants such the tobacco plant. If the larvae are unable to mature into later developmental life forms, then they will be less destructive to these crops. To further study the results of this experiment in more detail, I would repeat this experiment but with multiple experimental groups, all consuming different amounts of Azamax. This experiment could help us to determine how much of the pesticide is really needed to have the desired effect. From our study, we were able to determine that when 20E is inhibited, the growth of the Manduca Sexta is stunted.

Figure 1. Effect of Azamax on Manduca sexta weight. This figure shows the average change in weight of both the control and the experimental subject groups over a span of 8 days. The experimental subject group is the 4 Manduca sexta 4th instar larvae who ate food containing 0.6 mL of an Azamax solution that was 1 part chemical to 20 parts water. The control group consists of the 4 Manduca sexta 4th instar larvae who ate food that was mixed with 0.60 mL of distilled water rather than a chemical solution. The graph also shows the standard errors of each group using standard error bars. The standard error bar of the control group is   1.375 grams and the standard error bar of the Azamax experimental group is 1.61 grams.
