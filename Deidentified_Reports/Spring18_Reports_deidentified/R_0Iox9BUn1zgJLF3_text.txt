Title: The effect of juvenile hormone on larval Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
This study investigates the role of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the life cycle of a Manduca sexta by testing the effects of adding excess JH to the food of larval Manduca sexta.  We hypothesize that if larval Manduca sexta were fed methoprene, brand name Precor, then they would have a smaller average weight gain.  The larva would fail to pupate and therefore continue to molt into additional larval instar stages because JH blocks the release of Prothoracic Hormone (PTTH).  This means that the caterpillar will remain a larva, never transitioning into an adult.  To test this hypothesis eight caterpillars were separated into two group, control and treatment.  The treatment group was fed food with added methoprene whereas the control was fed food containing no methoprene.  They were weighed for 8 days and their weights were recorded.  It was concluded that the control group larva had a greater change in average weight over the eight days than the larva in the treatment group.  However, the hypothesis could not be supported because the null hypothesis could not be proven false.  The p-value (p=0.067107) concludes that the data is not significantly different. 

Introduction:
The insect, Manduca sexta, is part of the Lepidoptera order which includes skippers, butterflies, 
and moths [Johnson: 2018].  The Manduca sexta begins as an egg, transitions to a larva, where it typically has five instar stages, then becomes a pupa, and eventually an adult [Johnson: 2018].  The timed lifecycle of a Manduca sexta makes it an ideal organism to test when the role of hormones is in question. The timing of the lifecycle of Manduca sexta is regulated by Ecdysterone (20E), a hormone secreted by the Prothoracic Gland.  Whereas, the type of molt, what the insect will become, is regulated by Juvenile Hormone (JH) produced by the Corpus Allata [Johnson: 2016].  When the Manduca sexta weighs about five grams, there is a rise in Ecdysterone and a drop in Juvenile Hormone levels [Nijhout: 1974].  This is known as the commitment pulse and indicates that the caterpillar is ready to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. Two scientists, H. Fredrik Nijhout and Carroll M. Williams, injected fifth instar larval Manduca Sexta, weighing about five grams each, with Juvenile Hormone (JH) a few hours prior to the estimated release of Prothoracic Hormone (PTTH).  PTTH acts on the prothoracic gland which responds by releasing molting hormone (Ecdysterone).  They observed that the injection of Juvenile Hormone prolonged the instar stage by one to four days.  These findings prove that JH prevents the release of PTTH and therefore prolongs the larval stage leading to additional instar stages [Nijhout: 1974].  Additional instar stages, supernova stages, lead to minimal weight gain because the caterpillar gains the majority of its’ weight in the final larval instar stage [Grunert: 2015].  
The experiment described below tests the effect feeding methoprene, the Juvenile Hormone found in blue floss-flower, has on the weight of Manduca sexta.  Discovering the effects of excess Juvenile Hormone on the weight gain of Manduca sexta will further explain the role of JH in the lifecycle of many different insects and indicate whether Precor could serve as an effective insecticide.  We hypothesize that if larval Manduca sexta are fed methoprene than they will have a smaller average weight gain over the eight days of the experiment because the excess Juvenile Hormone would ultimately lead to additional instar stages, preventing them from pupating.

Materials and Methods:
To carry out the experiment eight Manduca sexta were separated into four different containers, each container separated in two.  Four caterpillars were assigned to the control group and four were assigned to the treatment group.  The caterpillars were weighed prior to the experiment and their weights were recorded.  Forty grams of food was then massed for the control group and 0.6 mL of distilled water was added to the food.  The food was separated into four different portions of equal size and fed to each of the caterpillars in the control group.  Another forty grams of food was massed for the treatment group and 0.6 mL of Precor, a type of Methoprene, was added to the food.  The percent concentration of the Precor mixture added was 4.17%.  Once again, the food was separated into four different portions of equal size and fed to each of the caterpillars in the treatment group.  The caterpillars were kept in an incubator to control their environment.  Each day for seven days, the caterpillars’ weights were massed and recorded.  On days one, four, and six the food appeared dry and was replaced by newly mixed food.  On day eight, the caterpillars were disposed of properly so as to avoid harming the environment.  After sufficient data was collected, the weights of the control group and treatment group were compared using a two sample T-test.  


Results:
Overall, the data collected during the experiment shows that the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the control group had a greater average weight gain over the eight-day experiment than the caterpillars in the treatment group.  In addition, it was observed that, during the first three days of feeding, there was a minimal change in weight of caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups.  On the fourth day of feeding the majority of caterpillars in both groups began to show more significant weight gain.  However, the larva in the control group continued to grow more significantly.  The average weight gain of the treatment group from day 1 to day 8 is 5.73g ± 2.91g and the average weight gain of the control group is 9.28g ± 1.45g.  This shows that the control group grew faster than the treatment group.  The standard deviation of the treatment group is ± 2.91g and the standard deviation of the control group is ± 1.45g.
After performing a two-sample t-test using the averages and standard deviations of the weights of both the control and treatment groups, it was determined that the t-value is 2.23172 and the p-value of the results is 0.067107.  Because the p-value is greater than 0.05 or 5% it is concluded that the data is not significantly different, and there is no difference between the means. 


Discussion:
Although the Manduca Sexta fed Juvenile Hormone did have a smaller mean weight gain, overall, the results did not support the hypothesis because the null hypothesis could not be rejected (p=0.067107).  The data is not significantly different so no conclusions can be drawn.  However, according to a study completed by Laura W. Grunert, Jameson W. Clarke, Chaarushi Ahuja, Harish Eswaran, and H. Frederik Nijhout the hypothesis is correct.  They explain that larval Manduca sexta gain most of their weight during the last instar stage [Grunert: 2015].  They have concluded that about 90% of a Manduc sexta’s body mass in accumulated during the final, typically the fifth, larval instar stage.  The study also discovered that caterpillars undergoing a greater number of instar stages, supernova stages, typically grow in smaller weight increments between each molt [Grunert: 2015].  The treatment group caterpillars are undergoing a greater number of instar stages because the excess JH in their food prevents a drop in JH and rise in ecdysterone which will trigger additional larval stages rather than pupation [Nijhout: 1947].  Therefore, the treatment group caterpillars were growing in smaller weight increments and had not yet reached their final instar stage whereas the control group caterpillars underwent fewer instar stages but grew at much larger weight increments, gaining more weight by the end of the experiment [Grunert: 2015].  
Moving forward, in order to receive statistically significant results, it may be beneficial to test a larger number of larval Manudca sexta for a longer period of time. Variations of the experiment described are applicable today because they could prove whether or not methoprene would serve as a good insecticide.
