Title: Mung Bean Root-to-Shoot Ratios Not Effected by Restricted Visible Light Spectrum

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of limited resources on a plant's resource allocation abilities. It is already known that plants can exhibit phenotypic plasticity when faced with insufficient resources. We specifically examined Vigna radiata, commonly known as mung beans, and the effect that limiting available wavelengths of visible light would have on their growth. Our experiment allowed mung beans to grow in either full spectrum or partial spectrum visible light, which excluded all wavelengths but those at about 650 nm. We hypothesized that beans grown under partial spectrum light would have longer shoots—thus a lower root-to-shoot length ratio—and a higher root-to-shoot mass ratio than beans grown under full spectrum light. Our results showed no significent statistical difference between treatment groups, either in length or mass of the plant roots and shoots, and therefore our hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
Plants, as photoautotrophic organisms, need resources including light, carbon dioxide, water, and soil nutrients to survive, grow, and reproduce. When faced with insufficient access to a supply of these resources, they still need the ability to survive and carry out vital functions. Thus, plants exhibit phenotypic plasticity to cope with resource shortage by altering how they distribute their resources to perform the functions that benefit the organism most.  This ability to allocate resources was demonstrated in a study of perennial grasses of the Great Plains, USA which showed that various species of grasses responded to years of low precipitation with more growth in roots than shoots, whereas in years of sufficient precipitation they produced similar growth of both roots and shoots [Sainju: 2017].  The grasses in this study responded to environmental conditions by allocating resources to increasing their root system's capability of accessing the limited water supply. Knowledge of how specific species of plants respond to water, nutrient, or light conditions can provide important insight into the effects of agricultural practices. Farming practices that grow crops under certain ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum or provide essential nutrients, for example, can be implemented to improve productivity. Our experiment aimed to examine how plant resource allocation changes as alterations in the light environment limit resources. We reasoned that restricting a plant's access to certain wavelengths on the visible light spectrum could reduce its ability to photosynthesize, and thus affect its method of allocation. Our experiment specifically examined the mung bean, also known as Vigna radiata. We reasoned that limiting the visible light spectrum available to the bean plant would cause it to expend more energy to acquire the limited light resource, thus increasing the growth of its shoot. We hypothesized that, grown under partial spectrum light, the beans would have longer shoots and a lower root-to-shoot length ratio as well as a higher root-to-shoot mass ratio than beans grown under full spectrum light.

Materials and Method:
To begin, six identical pots were filled with vermiculite and soaked with water until thoroughly moist.  About 20 mung beans were planted in every pot, each of which then also received 50 Ml of Miracle Grow plant food.  The pots were separated into two groups of three and placed under different tipis of translucent polypropylene film.  The first group was covered by clear film in such a way that all light had to pass through the film to reach the mung beans beneath.  With clear film, this group theoretically received the full spectrum of visible light wavelengths from about 400 to 700 nm.(380-760) The same was done with the other group of pots, this time with red film. This second group theoretically received a partial spectrum which excluded all wavelengths of visible light except at about 650 nm. Both groups were placed in a greenhouse where they grew at the same temperature and under equal amounts of sunlight.  The mung beans were watered every day for two weeks.  After the two week period, the lengths and masses of the beans were measured and the root-to-shoot ratios were calculated.  More specifically, three random bean plants were selected from each pot under a tipi, and then the length (in millimeters) and mass (in grams) of each plant's shoot and roots were measured. The lengths and masses from each pot were averaged and then used to calculate each pot's mass and length root-to-shoot ratios. The same was repeated for the mung beans under the second tipi.  Finally, a one-tailed t_test (p &lt; 0.05) was performed with the root-to-shoot ratio averages from each pot.

Results:
Examination from this experiment's data shows that the ratio of mung bean root and shoot length was noticeably lower in the group receiving partial spectrum visible light. Mung beans under the partial spectrum tipi had a mean root-to-shoot ratio of 0.93 ± 0.16 while those under the full spectrum tipi had a mean ratio of 1.12 ± 0.14 (Figure 1).  A one tailed t_test revealed, however, that these means are not statistically significent (t_stat = 1.60, d.f. = 4, P = 0.185). On the other hand, the mass root-to-shoot ratios appear to have very similar values: the partial spectrum beans had a mean mass ratio of 0.98 ± 0.34 whereas the full spectrum beans had a mean ratio of 0.96 ± 0.08. A one tailed, two-sample t_test confirmed that there was no significent difference between the two groups (t_stat = 0.092 d.f. = 4, P = 0.931).

Discussion:
The length root-to-shoot ratio of the mung beans was lower in the partial spectrum group than the full spectrum group, indicating that the bean shoots grew longer on average under conditions with limited light. Longer shoots suggests that resources were allocated to growth of photosynthetic organs which increase the plant's ability to obtain the wavelengths of light of which it was deprived. This would support our hypothesis, yet, a t_test revealed that the discrepancy between the two treatment groups was not large enough to be statistically significent. Furthermore, the average mass root-to-shoot ratios of both treatment groups were very similar and had no significent difference. This gives no indication that the mung beans either supplemented or restricted the resources preferentially to the roots or shoots. However, the interpretation of this data could be affected by considering a measurement we did not use in this experiment, called leaf area ratio (LAR), which quantifies photosynthetic surface area per unit of a plant's dry mass. While no significent difference was assigned to mung bean shoot length, it may have been true that the LAR increased between treatments. Higher LAR values generally correspond to the growth of plants under reduced light intensities, a condition which a red polypropylene cover would produce (Casierra-Posada et al. 2014). A higher LAR value indicates a plant possesses greater photosynthetic surface area per unit of dry mass. Our mung beans may have exhibited greater leaf area under the red film, while maintaining similar mass ratios to the controll due to a higher LAR. While we have no LAR data, from the measurements our experiment used, we can conclude that our hypothesis was not supported, suggesting that mung bean plants do not exhibit a resource allocation response to growth under a visible light spectrum which excludes wavelengths around 650nm. Still, reference to other studies suggests that plant resource allocation does indeed respond to light color. A 2015 study on the impact of light quality and quantity on aspen seedlings showed that, when subjected to various wavelengths on the visible light spectrum, the seedlings demonstrated a significent difference in shoot growth.  The shoots under low red/far red light or blue light grew the most, but as for root growth, no significent difference was shown [Kelly: 2015].  Similarly, our experiment looked at the effect of red light on plant allocation, and we predicted exposure to red light would increase the plant shoot length. Yet while Kelly's 2015 study showed a statistically significent increase in shoot length under red light, our data is not consistent with these findings. The possibility exists that this may be due to variance between plant species, or that our small sample size and the length of growing time allowed should be increased to improve the accuracy of our data. However, of the many studies on the subject, no consistent numerical parameter characterizing the relationship between light and the growth and development of a plant as a whole has been defined (Casierra-Posada et al. 2014). Different colors have been shown to affect specific measureable traits—such as growth rate and leaf area—but not others, and these findings can be contradictory across studies (Casierra-Posada et al. 2014). Despite this, understanding a plant's phenotypic plasticity in response to limited resources continues to possess important applications for agriculture. Even with an understanding of one specific species' allocation responses, we can better target our efforts at increasing desirable characteristics of that species. With continued research the  cultivation of plants can constantly improve nutritional benefits, economic benefits, and more.

Figure 1.  Root:shoot ratios of mass and length for mung beans.  This figure shows treatment groups growing in different wavelengths of visible light, full spectrum and partial spectrum (excludes all wavelengths except ~650 nm), and their respective average root:shoot ratios. The mean root:shoot ratio of length was not significently different between the full spectrum and partial spectrum groups (t_stat = 1.60, d.f. = 4, P = 0.185). The mean root:shoot ratio of mass was not significently different between the full and partial spectrum groups either (t_stat = 0.092 d.f. = 4, P = 0.931).  Error bars show ±1 s.d.
