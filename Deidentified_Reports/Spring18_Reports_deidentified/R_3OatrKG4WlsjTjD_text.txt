Title: Effect of 1: 1250 Precor feed on 4th Instar Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
In this study, Manduca sexta larvae were used to determine whether or not the pesticide “precor” could mimic the effect of Juvenile hormone and increase the mass gained by the larvae as they developed. Over the course of eight days, four Manduca Sexta larvae were fed a controll manduca feed while four larvae were fed the manduca feed with a 1: 1250 Precor solution incorporated within the food under incubator conditions. The average mass gained in each group was determined to be statistically insignificent due to the p_value and therefore, the hypothesis was not supported by the results of this experiment. 


Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect that is referred to as tobacco hornworms during the larva stage and develop into moths as adults that range in names from the “sphinx moth, hawk moth…and the Carolina Sphinx” (Johnson, 2016). It is classified in the Order of Lepidoptera and in the Family of Sphingdae. Manduca sexta are commonly used in laboratory settings as an experimental organism because of their ease of upkeep and diet. They prefer to be kept in humid environments, which is easily mimicked by keeping the larvae in incubators. However, they are considered pests as larvae because they feed on tobacco and tomato plants. Manduca sexta typically have five larval instars, which are stages between each molting of the insect where physical changes occur.

Juvenile hormones, or JH, are a family of insect hormones produced by the corpus allata that are crucial to the development of Manduca sexta. Specifically, it induces molting processes and maturation. Generally, maturation is associated with weight gain. In this experiment, the effects of JH on Manduca sexta larva were investigated by using a pesticide called Precor that mimics the effects of JH in small doses. Precor is a derivative of methoprene that is marketed as an “insect growth regulator” (Dhiadialla, 1985).  The hypothesis stated that Manduca sexta larva treated with Precor and larva food would gain more mass over the course of a week in comparison to a controll larva group treated with only water and larva food. The mass of food and amount of treatment (water and Precor) was kept constant every day for eight days of experimentation. 


Materials and Method:
A specific set of procedures were followed and repeated in the duration of the experiment. Eight Manduca sexta larvae in the 4th instar were obtained and split into two groups of 4. The first group (larvae 1-4) was designated as the controll group and were to be treated with water and food only. The second group (larvae 5-8) was designated as the treatment group to be treated with Precor and food.

Two larvae of the same group were placed in to a single container to total 4 containers. The two larvae were separated by an index card that served as a divider between them. Each larva was weighed and recorded before being placed in their labeled, respective sides of the container. Then, ten grams of “Great Lakes Manduca food” is weighed out on a balance and 5 drops, or 50 microliters, of water were added and combined with the food. This was repeated four times in total for larva 1-4. Then, the same procedures were followed for larva 5-8, except 50 microliters of a pre-made 1: 1250 Precor solution was mixed with the 10 grams of manduca food. All larvae were kept in an incubator at 27C for the duration of the experiment. Every day, for the next eight days, a member of the group cleaned out the larvae feces and fed each of the 8 larvae with their respective, treated food, and then placed the larvae back into the incubator.

After the determination of the procedures, it was decided that the most appropriate statistical test to use would be a two-sample t_test. 


Results:
Both groups experienced a gain in mass each day. The controll group, on average, gained more mass during the entire experiment. This was based on an average mass taken for each group, each day and the controll group had higher averages each day of treatment. This data is illustrated in the graph below. 

We performed a two-sample t_test on with the two sets of averages. The p_value was calculated to be 0.566, which means there was no statistical difference between our two sets of data. This also reared our results as statistically insignificent.


Discussion:

The results of this experiment did not support our hypothesis because the data collected was reared statistically insignificent. Since there was no statistical difference between the controll and treatment groups, the Precor treatment did not have any effect on the weight gain of the larvae as they developed, such as with previously published literature (Watson, 1988). There was one specific, potential source of error that we noted during the experiment. We noted that some of the larvae broke through the divider and seemed to be feeding on the other larva’s food. We corrected and fixed the divider so it did not happen again. However, this could have possibly altered the mass gained of either larvae and therefore alter the averages and p_value. We also noted that the notecard dividers were stained after the second day of treatment. This potentially means that since we inserted the treatment/water saturated food into the containers each day, the treatment/water could have been absorbed by the notecard and not ingested by the larva. This is another potential source of error that could have skewed our results and not allowed us to fully observe the effects of both Precor and water. 

Since we only used 50 microliters of the Precor solution, increasing the amount could have potentially created a difference in mass gained. If the experiment were to be repeated, increasing the dosage of Precor is a potential alteration. In addition, sturdier dividers and containers could be implemented in order to ensure that the larvae are not able to switch sides and disturb the other.
