Title: The effects of Lidocaine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle contraction in Rana pipiens 

Abstract:
Rana pipiens legs go through muscle contraction like most other vertebrates. Muscle contraction happens when action potentials release Acetylcholine, which causes sodium gates to open and more action potentials are produced, leading to the increase in calcium ions. Contraction ends when the calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Lidocaine blocks the sodium gates from opening, so contraction should not occur as it does when Lidocaine is not present. We believe that my injecting Rana pipiens legs with Lidocaine (into the Gastrocnemius Muscle), it will cause the muscle to contract less than when Lidocaine is not present. Our results show that when Lidocaine is present, we can confidently conclude that the muscle contrasts significantly less than Lidocaine is not present (paired t-test: p= 0.0188). These results show us that Lidocaine can be used in order to slow down muscle contraction in animals, and this can be very important in the treatment of problems where muscles are contracting too frequently. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is important because it allows vertebrates to move by muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle works because of motor neurons and action potentials. Muscles are able to contract because action potentials cause the release of Acetylcholine. The release of Acetylcholine causes sodium gates to open, and more action potentials are produced. Contraction ends when calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2016].  In this experiment, we will be examining the effect of Lidocaine (a sodium channel inhibitor) on the contraction of a Rana pipiens leg (especially looking at the Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius Muscle). Previous studies have examined the effects of Lidocaine on muscle contraction, and have found that it decreases muscle contraction and causes muscle relaxation [Tetsuya: 1993]. We believe that because the sodium channels are inhibited when Lidocaine is injected, the Gastrocnemius Muscle will contract less than when the leg does not have Lidocaine in it because action potentials will not be able to be produced. 

Materials and Methods:
We prepared two Rana pipiens legs by removing the skin, exposing the Sciatic Nerve, and detaching the Gastrocnemius Muscle from the rest of the leg. We then set up the leg to the force transducer as shown in Figure 1. We used the iWorx software to send the stimulus into the Gastrocnemius Muscle to make it contract. For the first Rana pipiens leg, we had difficulty finding the minimum stimulus that will cause contraction, so we had to send the stimulus directly to the muscle instead of through the Sciatic Nerve first. We found our minimum stimulus to be at an amplitude of 2 Volts. From there, we measured the voltage of the three contractions. We then injected the leg with 0.1 mL of 25 mM Lidocaine, and we measure three contractions of the muscle at the same minimum stimulus. We repeated this process with our second Rana pipiens leg, but the minimum stimulus was at an amplitude of 0.5 Volts, and we measured the voltage of the three contractions. We injected the leg with the same amount of Lidocaine as we did for the first leg, and we measured three contractions. The independent variable in our experiment was whether the leg had been injected with Lidocaine or not. The dependent variable was the voltage of the contraction we recorded. We used a paired t-test in order to determine the statistical significance of our results. 

Results:
Our Rana pipiens leg showed a difference in the strength of contraction before and after being injected with Lidocaine (Figure 2; Paired T-test: p=0.0188).  Our response stimulus was fairly consistent for each leg and group. The standard deviations are all relatively small, showing that there was very little variation in our results from leg to leg and group to group. There was a significant difference in response voltage between the leg with and without Lidocaine, especially in leg 2, as we were able to correctly set up the leg. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by our results. We believed that the Lidocaine would cause the Gastrocnemius Muscle to contract less than when the leg was not injected with Lidocaine. Our p-value (p= 0.0188) confirms that there was a difference in the experimental and control groups. Our results are similar to those found in previous studies where the muscle contracts less because action potentials cannot be produced when the sodium channels are blocked [Tetsuya: 1993]. The first Rana pipiens leg we used had some problems, as we could not get the muscle to contract because the Sciatic Nerve was too small to deliver the stimulus to the muscle. As a result, we had to put the stimulus directly into the muscle instead of the stimulus going through the nerve first. This could be the cause of a bigger difference in our second Rana pipiens leg (that we could properly deliver the stimulus to) and the first Rana pipiens leg. However, even with this problem, we were able to see a statistically significant difference in the muscle contractions of the leg before and after it was injected with Lidocaine. Our results show why Lidocaine is useful in the treatment of heart problems where the heart has too many contractions. The Lidocaine is able to block the sodium gates, so the motor neurons will not depolarize, and action potentials will not be able to be produced, which causes smaller contractions [Johnson: 2016].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This is one of our Rana pipens leg that we had prepared for our experiment. The Gastrocnemius Muscle is the part of the leg that is being held up. The force stimulus probes were placed directly into the muscle in order to make the muscle contract properly. The Sciatic Nerve is not entirely visible in this photograph, but it is a white nerve located behind the Gastrocnemius Muscle. 
Figure 2. Two Rana pipiens legs were injected with 25mM of Lidocaine. The Gastrocnemius Muscle contraction was measured with the same stimulus before and after the Lidocaine was injected. The average response for the leg 1 control group was 0.22V +/- 0.0146V, the average response for leg 1 experimental group was 0.09V +/- 0.0151V. The average response for the leg 2 control group was 0.638V +/- 0.0062V, and the average response for the leg 2 experimental group was 0.013V +/- 0.001V.
