Title: Lanthanum chloride affects amplitude of muscle contraction in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Lanthanum chloride is a chemical that is responsible for blocking the activity of calcium channels. We hypothesized that the presence of Lanthanum chloride in a muscle of Rania pipiens would decrease the muscle contraction at the same stimulus. We tested this hypothesis by using minimal threshold values before and after the injection of the chemical. We first tested for the lowest value in which a contraction occurred. 8 minutes after Lanthanum chloride was injected into the muscle, we again tested for the lowest threshold that produced a contraction. Our hypothesis was incorrect as the threshold values decreased to produce the same response. This data is important because it studies the effects of Lanthanum chloride and the importance of the presence of calcium in the muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus. 

Introduction:
The contraction of a muscle is arguably dependent on the presence of calcium. It is necessary in both the relaxation and contractile systems in muscles. When calcium is released into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the contractile movement occurs. When calcium is then removed from the muscle fiber, the relaxation system is activated [Ebashi: 1968]. Calcium plays a key role in the contractile movements of a muscle. The calcium triggers the interaction between actin and myosin, and ultimately causes the contraction of the muscle [Ebashi: 1968]. Therefore, it is in the absence of Ca2+ that prevent the interaction between actin and myosin and the contractile movements [Greig: 2013]. Though Ca2+ is not directly involved in the interaction of myosin and actin, it is a factor for the release of the tropomyosin attached to the actin, which prevents the interaction of myosin and actin. This brings us to the question: what happens if the amount of calcium produced in Rania pipiens is decreased?
Lanthanum chloride is a common salt that is typically used in water treatment products. However, previous studies have shown Lanthanum chloride to be responsible for blocking the activity of cation channels, mainly calcium channels [Knight: 1997]. This study helped dictate exactly how calcium functions in muscle contraction. Therefore, we chose Lanthanum chloride specifically to affect the amount of calcium present in the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens to observe the effects on the strength and voltage of the muscle contraction. We chose to use the Rania pipiens for this experiment because the size of the leg was smaller and allowed for greater accessibility to the sciatic nerve as well as a more visually evident contraction. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of Lanthanum chloride on the activity of Ca2+ in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens as we hypothesize that the minimal threshold value will increase because it would require a larger stimulus to produce a contraction after the injection of Lanthanum chloride.


Materials and Method:
We first collected the leg and degloved it by removing the skin completely. Then, we exposed the sciatic nerve and detached the gastrocnemus, and a portion of the Achilles tendon. We suspended the gastrocnemus from the force transducer and attached the probes to the sciatic nerve, making sure they did not overlap. We pinned down the leg, femur, and tibia to prevent further movement.
	Once the specimen was prepared, we set the amplitude to 0.1 and and sent the signal to the leg to find the lowest value of amplitude that would produce a visible contraction. Once the minimum threshold value was found, we injected 0.1Ml of 1 mM of Lanthanum chloride in the gastrocnemus and massaged the leg to help facilitate the spread of the chemical. After 8 minutes, we sent signals to the leg to find the new minimum threshold that produced a contraction. We then repeated the experiment on a second and third leg. We chose to use a paired t_test because it compares the measurements of a specimen before and after the chemical was injected. 

Results:
The overall trend of both groups showed that after the injection of Lanthanum chloride, there was a decrease in threshold values. The average difference of threshold values was 0.0629 +/- 0.0248. The average threshold values before the injection were 0.1135 +/- 0.0528. The average values after the injection were 0.0725 +/-0.0776. Other results of this experiment included a degree of freedom of 2, a t-value of 4.378, and a p_value of 0.048. These results depicted a significent difference between both groups.

Discussion:
Our original hypothesis proved to be incorrect, as we argued that the value of the minimal threshold would increase when Lanthanum chloride was injected into the gastrocnemus, when actually the threshold value decreased. According to Figure 1, the p_value is significent, which proves the data supports the opposite of our hypothesis. We originally believed the threshold value would increase in the presence of Lanthanum chlorides because it would require a larger stimulus to produce a contraction. 
In a previous study, the effects of Lanthanum chloride and cocaine on the transmembrane influx of calcium were tested. Previous knowledge of cocaine shows that it facilitates the response of a calcium-induced contraction. However, in the presence of Lanthanum chloride, as well as cocaine, there was no influx of calcium and therefore, no contraction [Araki: 1982]. From this study, we gathered our hypothesis, that there would be a decreased contraction, due to the injection of Lanthanum chloride. However, in our study, we hypothesized that the lanthanum chloride would increase the threshold by blocking the calcium channels from opening. In discussing the role of calcium in muscle contraction, it is important to understand the basis of how a muscle contracts.
When a muscle contracts, an action potential causes the depolarization of the neuron and the release of acetylcholine. Ach binds to the receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber which opens the sodium channels and signals an action potential in the muscle fiber to stimulate the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca2+ then activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber by triggering the release of the tropomyosin attached the actin, revealing the binding sites for actin on the myosin. As previously stated, calcium acts as the essential trigger for contraction in a muscle [Ebashi: 1968]. 
Our results prove that the calcium channels were not fully inhibited by the Lanthanum chloride because the minimal threshold value decreased upon the presence of the chemical. This data is important as the results of our experiment prove the role and importance of calcium in a muscle contraction as well as the implications of decreased amounts of calcium during a muscle contraction. In another experiment, measuring the effects of increased calcium on muscle contraction could also provide more information on the effects of the amount of calcium during muscle contraction. Possible errors in our experiment could’ve originated from the needle not being injected fully into the muscle and could’ve resulted in the loss of some Lanthanum chloride, and therefore not enough of the calcium channels were blocked.

Figure 1. Amplitude of contraction before and after injection of Lanthanum Chloride. The lowest value of threshold that produced a contraction were tested for in both groups. The “before” group threshold values were found before a chemical was added and the “after” group values were tested after 8 minutes of the injection of Lanthanum chloride. The average difference between groups is 0.0629 +/- 0.0248. Threshold was measured in Volts.
