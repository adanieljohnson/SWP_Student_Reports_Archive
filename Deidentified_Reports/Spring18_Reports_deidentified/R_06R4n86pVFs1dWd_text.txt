Title: Precor and its Impact on the Growth (weight) of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of synthetic juvenile hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca sexta development.  The experiment tested whether Precor, which contains methoprene, caused a difference in the weights of caterpillars.  This was done by testing a control group of Manduca sexta which ate a diet without Precor and comparing to a treatment group of Manduca sexta which ate a diet with Precor.  I hypothesized that if a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene, then JH levels won't drop, and therefore weight will be affected (will drop).  The results concluded that even though there were differences in average weights between the control and treatment groups the difference was not statistically significant and therefore no conclusion of a difference can be made.

Introduction:
Hormones are essential when it comes to regulating insect physiology.  One big family of insect hormones are the juvenile hormones (JH) which are a long chain of organic molecules produced mainly by the corpus allata (a pair of glands located on either side of the foregut) [Johnson:2018].

This experiment tested the effects of synthetic juvenile hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca sexta development.  The Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers, and as the Manduca sexta goes from egg to adult in its holometabolous life cycle it is greatly affected by hormones [Johnson:2018], [Grunert:2015].  The Manduca sexta is a prime choice for this experiment because hormones (particularly JH) strongly influence the Manduca sexta which has a development process that depends strongly on hormones.

During development, the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt [Johnson:2018].  Also pupae and adult insects don't grow, so body size as an adult depends by the size at which larva starts the metamorphic molt to the pupa which depends on hormones [Grunert:2015]. Grunert's study examined the mechanisms which control how body size is achieved [Grunert:2015].  It did so by looking at whether the kinetics of growth and size determination were able to explain body size and development time [Grunert:2015].  Through examining growth molt to molt with variation in factors like temperature and nutrition, the study found that the kinetics of growth and size determination were indeed able to explain body size and development time [Grunert:2015].

The experiment we conducted was a small feeding experiment in which eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were examined in how consuming a chemical called Precor, which is mixed with food, impacts growth and behavior.  Precor contains methoprene, an IGR which mimics JH functions [Johnson:2018].  Studying the impact of Precor on the caterpillars' differences in weights can lead to a better understanding of hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars as a whole.  The methoprene causes JH levels not to drop, and in order for the caterpillar to develop during the 5th larval instar, JH levels must drop [Johnson:2018].  Because the JH levels don't drop, the caterpillar won't be able to reach the commitment pulse to mature into an adult, and therefore the caterpillar's growth will stop and the weights of these high JH level caterpillars will be lower [Johnson:2018].  I hypothesize that if a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene, JH levels won't drop, and therefore weight will be affected and will drop.


Materials and Methods:
First 8, 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars, ordered from a service which houses them weighing 0.9 to 1.5 grams, were divided into two groups and each group of caterpillars were given 1 of 2 diets.  The control group was given the Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) recommended diet with 0.5mL (10 drops) of water added, and the other (treatment) group was given the same recommended diet with 0.5mL (10 drops) of the Precor (methoprene) chemical with a 4.17% concentration (2 parts of chemical per 48 parts of water) [Johnson:2018].  Each caterpillar is given 10g of the recommended diet.  All caterpillars are then kept in the same incubators under the same condition and the weights are recorded every day for 7 days.  The differences in weights between the treatment and control groups were examined to test the hypothesis.  A two-sample t-test was then used to compare the two groups and test for statistical significance.

Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the average weights of the control group Manduca sexta caterpillars are higher than the average weights of the treatment group Manduca sexta caterpillars. The average weight of the treatment group was 1.79 0.550g compared to the control group average weight of 2.04 0.657g.  Despite this difference, however, the two groups are not statistically different from one another as the two-sample t-test had a p-value of 0.289.

Discussion:
My hypothesis seemed to be supported by my results at first glance with the average weight of the treatment group at 1.79g compared to the control group average weight of 2.04g,  however my hypothesis was not statistically supported as the two-sample t-test came out with a p-value of 0.289 which is nowhere near the significance level of 0.05.  Therefore a statistical difference in the populations between caterpillars effected by Precor vs caterpillars not effected cannot be proven in this study.  Though not statistically supported the differences in weight shows that when a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene weight and development are affected possibly creating difficulty (JH levels not dropping) in reaching the commitment pulse and in development.

Another study showed that when increasing the hormone levels in food the average weights of the hormone altered groups were significantly lower than the non-altered groups [Grunert:2015].  

A possible error could have occurred in the experiment in how they were only fed the original amount of food (10g) over the 7 days and were not given any more when the food ran out.  If the experiment was run again I would choose to add food every day when weighing the caterpillars to test if that change would produce an even further disparity in weight which would be statistically significant.

Overall, the experiment provides an excellent way into examining how the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt and affects development in insects [Johnson:2018].  The experiment allows a way to look into an emerging approach to insect pest control which uses substances that affect insect growth and development [Tunaz:2004].  The IGRs "insect growth regulators", which were created based on an understanding of biochemistry and physiology of development in insects, impair insect survival and are being used in many ways [Tunaz:2004].  The experiment allows a simple way to look into the effects of IGRs on development and insect development as a whole.

Figure 1: Effect of the treatment (Precor vs control) on the average weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars.  The control group (blue bar) is the group of caterpillars eating the GLM recommended diet with just water added.  The treatment group (orange bar) is the group of caterpillars eating the GLM recommended diet with Precor chemical added.  4 caterpillars were put in each group and studied (weights recorded) for 7 days and the average weights of each one over time was recorded.  Each bar is the mean of the average lengths from either the treatment or control groups; error bars are  0.657 for the control bar and  0.550 for the treatment bar.
