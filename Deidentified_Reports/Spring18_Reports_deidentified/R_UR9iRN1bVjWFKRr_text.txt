Title: Reduction in Visibility has no Effect on Aggression in Beta splendens

Abstract:
Beta splendens fighting fish use color identification as a means of assessing whether an intraspecific behavioral response is necessary. These behaviors are used to protect or obtain resources, but result in energy expenditure and a risk of physical harm. Therefore, the potential benefits and harms must be assessed. Agonistic behaviors in Beta splendens fish include facing behaviors, broadside behaviors, and darts, each of which is used by male fish generally towards other males, and can be elicited in one male by their presence in another male. Throughout the experiment, we sought to assess the impact of visibility on Beta splendens’ displays of agonism. We hypothesized that if we placed two Beta splendens fish in a tank of clear water, separated from each other by a transparent divider, then they will exhibit higher levels of aggression than when they are once again exposed to each other in a tank of dyed blue water. We believed the reduction in visibility would inhibit the fish’s capacity to identify an opposing organism as a threat, and would therefore decrease the likelihood of the fish’s use of intraspecific behavior. We exposed to male Beta splendens to each other in 6 trial sessions, with three sets of fish. We then repeated this process in dyed blue water.(Cont in intro)

Introduction:
(Cont from abstract)
Aggressive behaviors were monitored over a five minute trial period. Following our trials, it became evident that there is no significant difference suggesting that reduced visibility affects agonistic behavior in Beta splendens. This suggests that introducing a colored dye to the fish’s environment does not affect its capacity to assess the relative benefits and harms of employing intraspecific behavior. 


Introduction: 
Intraspecific behaviors are those exhibited by organisms towards members of their own species as a means of competing for or protecting a resource. This results in each organisms expenditure of energy and generally poses a risk of physical harm. Therefore, the cost of expending energy and exposing oneself to harm must be weighed against the necessity of obtaining a particular resource [Georgiev: 2013].  Various stimuli are considered in a fish’s assessment of the threat associated with another individual. Many species of fish are known to use color identification as a visual cue to their infraspecific agonistic behaviors. Fish exposed to robotic conspecific facsimiles spend the most time interacting with fish models that resemble realistic colorations of their own species, suggesting color plays a central role in facilitating social interaction [Polverino: 2013]. Broadening our understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and behavior is essential in understanding the adaptive functions of physiological features in organisms. Throughout our experiment, we sought to gauge whether a reduced visibility environment would lessen the agonistic behavioral tendencies of Beta splendens fish in situations where two male fish are visible to each other. We hypothesized that if we placed two Beta splendens fish in a tank of clear water, separated from each other by a transparent divider, then they will exhibit higher levels of aggression than when they are once again exposed to each other in a tank of dyed blue water, as we believed the reduction in visibility would inhibit the fish’s capacity to identify an opposing organism as a threat, and would therefore decrease the likelihood of the fish’s use of intraspecific behavior.


Materials and Methods:
To execute this experiment, we used one fish tank, subdivided into three sections by 2 sets of dividers. Each set of tank dividers consisted of one opaque and one transparent divider the could be removed independently of each other. We began the experiment with the tank filled with clear water. We obtained 6 blue male Beta splendens fish and divided them into groups of two. Each member of each group was placed on either side of a divider in the tank such that they were in the section adjacent to their group member. After receiving a five minute rest period, the opaque barrier was removed, leaving the transparent barrier between the two fish. Over a trial period of five minutes, facing behaviors, broadside behaviors, and darts were recorded. After each group’s five minute trial period, three drops of blue dye were added to the tank water and stirred until the tank water in the two trial sections were equally blended. Each fish group was again added to the tank, allowed a five minute rest, then exposed to each other via the removal of the intermediate opaque barrier. Aggressive behaviors were once again recorded. After each group’s trial in colored water, the records of aggressive behavior were aggregated into a composite score in which darting behaviors were weighted as being 50% more aggressive than broadside and facing behaviors. The resulting composite aggression score was used to gauge wether any significant difference existed between aggression levels in clear water and in blue water. We used a paired t-test to assess statistical significance.

Results:
Our statistical analysis found no significant difference at the .05 level to suggest that the reduced visibility environment affected aggression in Beta splendens fish. Our statistical analysis consisted of a one tailed T test of a composite aggression score, calculated from the aggregation of intraspecific fish behavior data. For this statistical analysiys, darts, facing movements, and broadside movements were compiled with darts bearing a weight of 50% more than those of broadside and facing. The T test indicated that df=2, t value= 0.17, and p=0.88, suggesting there to be no significant difference at the .05 level. We found the standard deviation for the clear trial to be +/- 9.165, and the standard deviation of the blue trial to be 25.13.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that fish in a reduced visibility blue environment would exhibit less aggression than when in a clear environment, was not supported. We observed no significant difference at the .05 level, suggesting that the presence of dye in the environment does not effect aggression in Beta splendens. It is possible that the dye had no effect on the vision of the fish, thus failing to inhibit their ability to identify and interact with other fish. Additionally, past investigations have found color to be a less significant visual cue as fin vibrations and size [Johnson: 1973]. This could suggest that the fish were still able to identify opposing individuals as conspecific males from their shape, behavioral patterns, and fin movements, and thus exhibited normal levels of aggression. Understanding the beta fish’s visual capabilities in the context of environmental variation and the relatedness of vision and behavior could further our understanding of the adaptive functionalities and evolutionary success of eyesight in certain fish.
