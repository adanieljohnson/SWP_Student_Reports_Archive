Title: Title: The Effects of Sand on Root:Shoot Mass and Length Ratio in the Mung Bean (Vigna radiata)

Abstract:
Abstract
Aiming to determine the effects of a sandy environment on the growth of the mung bean (Vigna radiate), this study was conducted over the course of three weeks using three groups: a controll and two different treatment groups, to investigate whether the hypothesis that mung beans placed in an environment containing sand would have smaller root:shoot ratios for both mass and length. Using an ANOVA statistical test, it was determined that there was a significent difference in the mass or the root:shoot rations but no significent difference in the length ratio, which does not agree with the initial hypothesis.  This could be the result of potential human error, or assumptions about potential salt exposure to the plants in a sandy environment in the determination of the initial hypothesis, but conducting more trials is vital to furthering the understanding of sands role in plant growth and development. 


Introduction:
This experiment is designed to test the effects that a sandy environment has on the root:shoot mass and length ratio for the mung bean (Vigna radiata) plant. The mung bean serves as a good plant to study in this case because it grows quickly in a lab setting and given the lab resources, it relatively easy to reproduce to further study them. It is known that the salt stress that is incurred on plants, especially plants like mung beans, growing in a sandy environment takes its toll on the plant and does not serve as a conducive environment for a plants health to flourish [Balasubramanian: 1976]. We also know that we can get an idea of a plants health by measuring their root:shoot ratios [Johnson:2016]. In order to answer the question of whether it a sandy environment is beneficial to the growth of the mung bean plant, it is imperative that a study is conducted that compares the root:shoot ratios of mung beans in their natural soil environment, a sandy environment and an intermediate mixture. Understanding that sandy environments can often have a negative impact on plant growth due to a general lack in resources needed to maximize plant health and growth, it was hypothesized that the plants exposed to sand would have smaller root:shoot ratios. This experiment is vital to our understanding of plants because it is important to know what types of environments certain plants will grow best in because after all, we do eat plants and being able to maximize their health and growth is beneficial for the world and all of its inhabitants.

Materials and Method:
Materials and Method
In this experiment, we created three groups: one with purely vermiculite, one with purely sand and one with a half-and-half mixture of both. Each group had three potting trays that were filled with their respective soil or sand along with approximately 20 evenly spaced mung bean seeds. Once the seeds were planted in the soil or sand, the trays were watered until all of the contents of the rays were damp. They were then placed in the greenhouse for three weeks and watered daily. At the end of three weeks, the plants were removed from their respective trays. The roots and shoots were then separated using scissors to carefully cut at the base of the shoot and the top of the root. Afterwards, the roots and shoots were weighed using mass scale and their length was measured using a ruler. The groups that were being compared in this experiment were the sand treatment group, the mixture treatment group and the controll group of vermiculite and were compared using a ANOVA statistical test followed by a Turkey-Kramer test. This statistical test was used because we were comparing the dependent variable (root:shoot mass and length ratios)  of more than two groups.

Results
The results of the experiment showed a that on average, the weights of the Root:shoot were greater (figure 1). The data collected also showed very little difference in the root:shoot lengths. Thus, there was a significent difference in the weight of the roots and shoots of the mung bean groups. However, the study did not show a significent difference in the length of the mung bean (p_value: .05).

Discussion
Discussion:   As a whole, the study was only not supportive of the hypothesis that the Root:shoot ratios would be greater in the mung beans exposed to vermiculite alone. This is so because the Root:shoot weight ratios were greater in the treatment groups than in the controll group. Additionally, due to the fact that the Root:shoot length ratios were the same, our study led to the conclusion that a sandy environment does not necessarily have a negative impact on the development of the mung beans. In the initial questions we posed before conducting the experiment, it may have been assumed that when placed in sand, the mung beans would also be exposed to salt, like they would be in a naturally sandy environment such as on the shoreline of the beach. However, that is not necessarily the case and should have been considered when designing the experiment. Had there been salt, there may not have been a different result, given that we were merely collecting data from the roots and shoots of the plant, but according to research, the leaves would have been different [Munns: 1993]. Thus, our particular experiment may have shown very similar data even there were biological processes within the plant being altered. One of the reasons that we feel our data turned out the way that it did is due to structural support. When a plant has a larger root:shoot mass rato, it has a stronger base in the ground and because sand is not nearly as dense of an environment, a greater root mass is needed to support the plant since it cannot rely on the sand itself for support. Error is always a possibility in any study and there are some potential factors that we should address. First is the amount of water given to the plants each day. They were watered using a garden hose and there was no uniform way to make sure that each tray received the same amount of water, an aspect of the experiment that could have been better operationalized. Additionally, there was no way to ensure that each plant received the same light exposure, something that is vital to plant growth and development. With other groups constantly moving their trays in and out of the greenhouse, there could have been many instances where our plants were blocked from the light. Lastly, there was no effort made to ensure that the seeds were exactly evenly spread out. Though it may not have played a significent role in the resource allocation of the plant, there is no definitive way to argue that it didn't. Moving forward, it is always important to conduct many more trials to validate and grow data while also making efforts to eliminate error.
