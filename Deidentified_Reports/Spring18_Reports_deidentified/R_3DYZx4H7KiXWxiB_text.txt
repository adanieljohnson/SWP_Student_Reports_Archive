Title: The Effects of Blocking Ecdysterone in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is an animal that produces many hormones relevant to growth, development, and survival. The M. Sexta has a life cycle of about three weeks and goes through 5 instar larval phases, pupates, and becomes an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormone work simultaneously as the M. sexta molts. Blocking one or both of the hormones causes the animal’s life cycle to be altered. I hypothesize that because ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting, blocking it with Azoguard would slow the weight gain and ultimately prevent the M. sexta from reaching its full weight potential, causing it to die without molting. The results were as expected; Azoguard as a supplement to the M. sexta’s food blocked ecdysterone, preventing growth. Based on these results, M. sexta cannot reach moth stage without going through 5 instar stages and going through these stages requires ecdysterone.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm (at its larval stage), is a species that has a holometabolus life style, producing various hormones necessary for growth, development, and survival [Johnson, 2018]. This species is helpful to study because it transitions completes its life cycle rather quickly, is large, and usually survives in lab conditions. Normally, the hormone ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and controls additional functions in adult insects and juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone work together to control growth, molting and metamorphosis of M. sexta [Safranek: 1984]. If ecdysterone is blocked the weight/development of the M. sexta could be altered, and the animal might never reach the commitment pulse, the start of a series of sequential changes that happen at the beginning of metamorphosis. I hypothesize that because ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting, blocking it with Azoguard would slow the weight gain and ultimately prevent the M. sexta from reaching its full weight potential, causing it to die without molting.


Materials and Methods:
First, 8 M. sexta were selected and their weights and appearances were recorded. Each animal weighed around 1 gram. Two caterpillars were placed in each container with an index card diving them. The control animals were fed 10 grams of normal food moistened with 10 drops of water and the treatment groups were fed 10 grams of normal food moistened with 10 drops of the growth blocking hormone, Azogaurd (concentration 1:1250). All specimens were kept in an incubator for 8 days. Each day the specimens were weighed, fed, and examined. After 8 days, the weights were recorded and results were graphed. Animals 1,2,3, and 4 were control and animals 5,6,7, and 8 were treatment. A t-test was used to compare the mean values of the measurement variable.


Results:
It is clear from the graph [Figure 2] that the control animals (in blue) consistently gained weight over the 8-day period and the treatment animals (in red) consistently gained weight until around day four and then remained the same or lost weight. Blocking ecdysterone clearly decreases the ability for the M. sexta to grow. A two-sample t-test was performed and the t-value was 10.805291, the p-value was 3.72E-5, and there were 6 degrees of freedom. With a p-value of less than .05, it is evident that the results of the experiment are significant and that blocking ecdysterone slows growth rate in M. sexta. These results support my hypothesis because the Azogaurd did prevent the M. sexta from reaching the commitment pulse, and therefore prevent it from being able to molt. The control and the treatment animals looked and felt very different from each other. The control animals were larger, fatter, and more firm to the touch whereas the treatment animals were smaller, thinner, and softer to the touch. We could tell animal #4 was near the commitment pulse by day 8 because it had a thick black line down its back. The results were expected, but animal #3 did grow bigger, faster than the others.


Discussion:
The final data allowed me to support my hypothesis. After 8 days, the results conclude that blocking ecdysterone slows and eventually prevents weight gain in M. sexta. The treatment animals grew significantly larger than the control animals, proving that ingestion of Azoguard blocks the hormone ecdysterone, which makes it impossible for the animal to molt. If we kept feeding the animals Azoguard as a supplement to their normal diets, they would eventually die. It is interesting that animals #6 and #7 lost weight from day 7 to day 8. This could be evidence that they no longer are interested in eating food supplemented with Azoguard, making them lose weight. I believe the experiment could be improved if we observed the animals for a longer period of time. It would be interesting to see how long the treatment animals would survive and if the control animals would successfully molt in lab conditions. Because two of the treatment animals lost weight I would think that they would not survive for very long. Other experiments similar to this one that have been done in the past have had comparable results. In a similar study, researchers seemed to think that oxygen levels and nutrients might affect molt timing along with hormones [Kemirembe:2012]. This study proved that amino acids are necessary for molting. It would be helpful to know what amino acids were present in the food we fed out M. sexta. If the food did not contain the amino acids needed for the M. sextas to grow to their full potential, that could have affected the experiment without us knowing.
