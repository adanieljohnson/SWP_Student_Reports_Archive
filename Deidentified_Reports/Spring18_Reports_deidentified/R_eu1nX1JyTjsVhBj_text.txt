Title: The Perturbation of Growth and Development in Manduca sexta by Manipulating the Levels of Ecdysone 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we looked at how ecdysone affects the growth and development of Manduca sexta. We predict that the inhibition of ecdysone levels through manipulating the Manduca sexta diet will lead to the slow growth and development. This was done by placing an ecdysone inhibitor called Azamax in the Manduca sexta caterpillar diet, which was designated as a treatment group. We then observed the caterpillars for seven days by recording their weights. Based on the data, that caterpillars with Azamax weighed much less than the ones without. This meant that ecdysone controls part of the growth and development and by inhibiting it, it led to the delay of molting time. 

Introduction:
The purpose for this experiment is to test the effects of ecdysone hormone modulator (Azamax) on the growth and development of Manduca sexta. We choose this species because of its short growth period and how easy they are to distinguish if they have grown or not. The main hormones in Manduca sexta are Prothoracicotropic or brain hormone (PTTH or BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). 20E and JH work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis with 20E regulates the timing of molting while JH regulates the type of molting. In order for the Manduca sexta to transition into the next developmental stage, it has to have a certain weight [Danielsen: 2013]. For this particular experiment, we are to confirm that ecdysone influences the growth and development by observing the effects it has on Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis states that the inhibition of ecdysone levels through manipulating the Manduca sexta diet will lead to the slow growth and development.

Materials and Methods:
The procedure of inhibiting levels of ecdysone through manipulation of Manduca sexta diet will lead to slow growth and development is outlined below.

PART I

Procedure:
1.	Obtain 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars, making sure that they weight about the same (from 0.60-0.75 grams) and divide them into 2 groups, 4 caterpillars each.
a.	4 caterpillars will be the control group and the remaining 4 will be in the treatment group. 
2.	Obtain 4 containers, preferably a round container big enough to fit 2 caterpillars and their food.
3.	Acquire 4 index cards and tape each card in the middle of the container to divide the space into 2. 
4.	Label each container by its appropriate group type and number (don’t forget your names).
a.	For example, the first container consists of #1; Control Group and #2; Control Group. The second container consists of #3; Control Group and #4; Control Group. Repeat the same for treatment group.
5.	Weigh the Manduca sexta’s food, each caterpillar will get 10 grams.
a.	Control: 10 grams of regular food with 8 drops of water using disposable pipet tips.
b.	Treatment: 10 grams of regular food with 8 drops of Azamax (ecdysone inhibitor) using disposable tips.
6.	Place caterpillars inside their appropriate containers with their assigned diet. 
7.	Then place the 4 containers inside an incubator with standard conditions.
8.	Make sure to clean up any spilled food and liquids. Wash hands before leaving the class as caterpillars have chemicals on them.

PART II

Each day for a week, students are to replenish the food and mass the caterpillars.

1.	Take the containers out of the incubators. 
2.	Take the old food and caterpillars’ feces out of the containers. Be sure not to harm the caterpillars. 
3.	Replace the old food with new food (according to which group they are in).
4.	Mass the caterpillars, write down any pertinent and unusual observations.

In order to interpret and understand the observations we record, we will be using the T-test (on Microsoft Excel). 



Results:

Based on the data, we see that the caterpillars without Azamax weighed more than those that do. In Figure 1, the average weight on Day 7 for the control group is 5.4 grams with the error bar being between 4.2 to 6.5 grams. The average weight on Day 7 for the treatment group is 1 gram with the error bar being between 0 and 1.2 grams. 

In order to see if these two groups are statistically significant, we did the t-test on it and found the p-value to be 0.000433. 



Discussion:
Based on the data, we can confirm that Azamax or the ecdysone inhibitor does indeed slow down the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. We can see that the control group was able to grow in a regular manner while the treatment group grew in an unusual manner due to the ecdysone inhibitor and other variables such as weighing at different times of the day and if they had pooped yet. For the treatment group, even though they grew, they were having a hard time getting bigger because Azamax was delaying the time of molting by keeping it from reaching a certain weight. By measuring their weights, we are able to conclude whether the caterpillars growth and development were affected or not. 

In the study of “A role of juvenile hormone in pupal development of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta” by Kenji Kiguchi and Lynn M. Riddiford, allatectomizing the instar larva will lead to a quicker pupation as the “black larvae begin metamorphosis one day sooner than controls”. This is because taking out the corpus allatum, which secretes neotein (a juvenile hormone that make sure the larvae will grow, leading to delayed metamorphosis) will lead to the stimulation of a quicker metamorphosis [Kiguchi: 1978]. Similar to our experiment, the inhibition of ecdysone leads to the slow or lack of growth and development because of the delay in transitioning into the next phase as the caterpillars were unable to reach their set weights. We can conclude that ecdysone does indeed control parts of the growth and development. 

The next step for us would be to repeat this experiment using the same procedure until the data is consistent and the p-value is still less than 0.05. If possible, a larger sample of caterpillar population is ideal to limit any confound variables. All in all, this experiment gives a glimpse of what alterations in hormones can do to an organism. For example, it can be used when dealing with insecticides. If farmers were to spray insecticide on these caterpillars in order to stop them from eating the crops, it would be useful to know which hormone and how the alterations of that particular hormone speeds of the growth of caterpillars (as caterpillars do more damage to crops in early stage). If we know this alteration of hormone to be true in caterpillars, we can apply this knowledge to other organisms.
