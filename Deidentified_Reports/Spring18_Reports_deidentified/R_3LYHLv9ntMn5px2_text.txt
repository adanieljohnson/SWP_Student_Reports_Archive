Title: Neuromuscular Control in the Rania pipiens: How Acetylcholine Affects Skeletal Muscular Control

Abstract:
The ability to respond to outside stimuli is one of an organism’s most important facets when it comes to maintaining homeostasis. The nervous system connects neurons to muscles, allowing for muscle contraction and, of course, movement. Skeletal muscles can be broken down into muscle fibers and myofibrils, which are excited at the neuromuscular junction. In the muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens, or Northern Leopard Frog, Acetylcholine is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in muscle contraction, as it is responsible for depolarizing the postsynaptic cell after being released across the synaptic cleft. The main objective behind this experiment is to isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from the R. pipiens leg and explore the fundamental properties of neuromuscular controll, and how Acetylcholine receptor blockers affect muscle contraction. After observing the muscle twitch threshold before and after injection, it was found that there are is a statistically significent difference between the frog leg’s muscle contractions before and after injection of the Acetylcholine receptor blocker.

Introduction:
Homeostasis is a crucial facet of an organism’s wellbeing: it allows for the regulation of body functions, movement, development, and much more. Unlike hormonal responses in an organism, which take between hours and weeks to come into full effect, neuromuscular responses are very quick. The nervous system allows organisms to respond to environmental stimuli in a matter of milliseconds, which makes it extremely important in fight-or-flight situations. Skeletal muscles are composed of muscle fibers/cells, which consist of myofibrils that contain thick and thin myofilaments [Johnson: 2018]. Motor neurons excite myofibrils at the neuromuscular junction, which is where muscles receive the stimulation for contraction [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter found at the neuromuscular junction – it is released at the presynaptic membrane and binds to postsynaptic receptors, which causes depolarization and triggers action potentials and muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. It is evident that Acetylcholine plays a key role in muscle contraction; when removed or inhibited, it may prevent the communication between an organism’s central nervous system and muscles. Examples of Acetylcholine inhibitors can be found in nature: the venom from snakes in the Viperidae family contain neuroactive components, which block certain Acetylcholine receptors in the neurons of the fresh-water snail Lymnaea stagnalis [Vulfius : 2011]. This experiment, however, will explore the gastrocnemus muscle in the leg of the Rania pipiens, or Northern Leopard Frog, and how muscular contraction can be manipulated when the muscle is introduced to an Acetylcholine receptor blocker. The twitch threshold of each R. pipiens frog leg will be measured, then measured again an injection of an Acetylcholine receptor blocker. The twitch threshold of the frog legs will be compared before and after injection and analyzed statistically using a paired t_test. Given what is known about the function of Acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, a reasonable hypothesis is that if Acetylcholine receptor blockers are injected into the muscle, then it will inhibit the uptake of Acetylcholine and prevent depolarization of the postsynaptic cell, which would prevent the muscle from contracting.

Materials and Method:
Set up the software on the laptop and ensure settings are appropriate for the nerve stimulation of a muscle. Prepare the frog leg by removing the skin and locating the sciatic nerve (Figure 1). Tie the gastrocnemus muscle with string and hang it from the first hook in the apparatus (see Figures 2 and 3). Find twitch threshold in each frog leg first without any receptor blocker. Then, administer ACh receptor blockers to each leg, wait 10 minutes, and record twitch threshold in the leg again. Make sure to administer 1 mM of tubocurarine, Nicotonic ACh receptor antagonist using a clean syringe.

Results:
It appears that holistically each of the frog legs had a higher twitch threshold after the administration of the tubocurarine. Before the administration of the tubocurarine, the frog legs had an average twitch threshold of .235 ± .0783 volts, while after treatment had an average twitch threshold of .397 ± .181 volts. The twitch threshold was higher after exposure to tubocurarine for every frog leg measured, which indicates that the ACh receptor antagonist behaved as predicted. Figure 4 shows the average twitch threshold for the controll vs. experimental data. After running a paired t_test, I recorded a t-value of -2.284 and a p_value of .0312 with 3 degrees of freedom (n=4). Because the p_value was less than .05, we may claim it as statistically significent.

Discussion:
To summarize, my lab group’s results supported our hypothesis that Acetylcholine receptor blockers, when injected into the muscle, inhibit muscle contraction. This makes sense, because we hypothesized that the average twitch threshold would be higher for the treatment group, as blocking the ACh receptor sites would inhibit depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane and inhibit muscle contraction. Out results were supported due to a p_value of .0312, which is less than .05. This means that our hypothesis may be accepted, as our p_value is statistically significent. The biological reasoning behind this is because of the effects tubocurarine had on the postsynaptic cell membrane’s uptake of ACh. As tubocurarine is an antagonist, it functions as a blocker to receptor sites. While we were able to obtain a low p_value, our experiment was not free of error. Possible sources of error may include the amount of time that elapsed between our measurements. While we were sure to wait 10 minutes before testing muscle contraction after administration of the treatment, the testing of different voltages after that was not consistent between experimental groups. Because of this, the tubocurarine may have had a longer time period to affect muscle contraction in some of our trials more than others. One area of future study regarding this experiment could be to explore the varying degrees to which tubocurarine is able to inhibit muscle contraction, depending on the muscle targeted. In this lab, we only worked with the gastrocnemus muscle. One study done by N. H. Secher, N. Rube, and O. Secher found that maximum effects from tubocurarine in males resulted in reduction in usage of the soleus muscle by about 30% of the controll value, while the gastrocnemus muscle had an even greater effect: approximately a 53% reduction compared to controll values [Secher : 1982]. These results imply that tubocurarine affects human muscles proportionately, depending on slow twitch muscle fiber content [Secher : 1982]. Overall, understanding the science behind the movement of organisms is important when considering the bigger picture of how organisms respond to outside stimuli and maintain homeostasis.
