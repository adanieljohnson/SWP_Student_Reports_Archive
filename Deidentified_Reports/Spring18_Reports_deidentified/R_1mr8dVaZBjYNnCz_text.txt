Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Inhibition on muscle contractions in the Rania pipiens.

Abstract:
The objective of this lab was to look deeper into the role of Acetylcholine inside of muscle contraction, more specifically, how it relates to voltage threshold. We used the chemical Sevin to act as an inhibitor of the ACh. This allowed us to effectively test whether the absence of ACh would affect the overall amount of stimulus needed to create a contraction. The first step to this study was a dissection of frog legs from the Rania pipiens. In this dissection we exposed the sciatic nerve while detaching the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg. After this  we utilized a transducer to send the stimuli into the leg for data recording. We tested four legs. Each leg was first tested in its regular state. This gave us the voltage threshold of the untreated muscle. Afterwards, we injected the legs with Sevin ( ACh inhibitor) and ran the same test. The results showed that inhibiting acetylcholine has a big affect on the muscle. The average muscles’ voltage threshold from all four legs before treatment was 0.145V ( No standard deviation). The average voltage threshold recorded after treatment was 0.075( No standard deviation). The test showed us that after treatment the voltage threshold at which a contraction was noticeable was nearly half of what it used to be. The data we fou

Introduction:
In this lab we are studying the inhibition of Acetylcholine (ACh) and the effects of it on muscle contractions. The body consist of many different muscle fibers, complexes, and structures. Almost 40% of the human body is skeletal muscle. Inside of the body, muscles are used for stability and motion. Your muscles contract when you need to lift something heavy, or when you need to move swiftly. Still, how are contractions caused? To successfully do the experiment, we required an appropriate test subject. To test the contractions, we utilize the legs of the Rania pipiens frog. This organism was perfect for testing because of many different things. Firstly, the hind legs of the frog mimic much of the motion that human legs use while hopping, skipping, or jumping. The hind legs of the R. pipiens have muscles that are used to being used for short quick burst of power (contractions) when it is needed to move and hop. Also, the muscles of the leg offered an easier way of testing as the sciatic nerve could easily be found and exposed. The gastrocnemus (calf) muscle also mimics how the gastrocnemus muscle works in humans being built in a similar fashion and placed in similar manners. The goal of this work was a comparative analysis of the contracture responses induced by acetylcholine (ACh)—the so-called acetylcholine contracture (AChC)—in the twitch and tonic fibers. The AChC, the process involving the entire ECC system, reflects the development of contractile response in an intact muscle in a most adequate manner [I.E. Katina: 2008]. ACh is a key part in muscle contractions. For a muscle to contract it must receive an electrical message from the motor neuron. This signal is called an action potential. This Action potential causes the release of neurotransmitters from the sarcoplasmic vesicles into the synapse. This neurotransmitter is ACh. From Acetylcholine receptors bind with the receptors which then transport the signal to the muscles. Sevin is a chemical compound that blocks ACh, it inhibits the flow of the Acetylcholine inside of the muscle cells. In this experiment the dependent variable will be the threshold voltage for contractions. The chemical Sevin is the independent variable because it will always block the movement of ACh. The threshold voltage for contractions will depend on how well Sevin work at blocking the ACh flow. By injecting Sevin into the muscle fibers of the Rania pipiens leg we believe that we can block the flow of ACh, thereby stopping action potentials from reaching muscles in the frog leg leading to contractions at the threshold voltage stimulus. 

Materials and Method:
The experiment was performed on two isolated frog legs from the R. pipiens. We recorded contractile responses of the legs and compared them to responses that were tested after the muscles had been treated with Sevin (ACh inhibitor). Before any test could be ran we had to prepare the frog legs. Firstly, we skinned each frog leg making sure not leave any on. Starting from the top portion of the leg we slowly worked our way down in preparing the specimen for testing. Looking at the top portion of the leg we located the Sciatic Nerve. In doing this we made sure to expose enough of the nerve so that we could use It in the test. From here we separated the Gastrocnemius Muscle from the rest of the bone cutting it at the tendon down by the foot on the frog leg. During this whole process we are making sure not to cut the muscle or the nerve. After preparation of the leg we used a stand and pins to position the leg in a way so that we could use a force transducer for testing the muscle contractions. Look at Figures 1-3 for how the setup looked. From here we sent small electrical stimuli through the nerve until we found the smallest about that would cause a noticeable contraction. This was the threshold of the muscle. We tested these three times to make sure we were as accurate as possible. After finding the threshold of the muscle we injected 0.1 Ml of the chemical Sevin (2%) into the gastrocnemus muscle. We massaged to make sure Sevin was properly proportioned around the entire muscle. We then waited about 7 minutes for the chemical Sevin to be fully introduced inside of the muscle fibers. After this we sent electrical signals through the nerve working our way back down to the smallest signal with noticeable contractions. From here we would compare our recorded results. 

Results:
The data collected does show that the inhibition of Acetylcholine inside of the muscles do influence muscle contractions. To get our results we ran three separate tests on each of the controlls and each of the test groups. We then took these numbers and averaged them to gain the average voltage threshold of the muscle. Figure 4 shows these averages as a comparison to one another. The average voltage threshold of controll 1 was 0.13V +/- 0 Sd. The average for controll 2 was 0.08V +/- 0.005 Sd. Test 1 voltage threshold was 0.15V +/-0 Sd. The average voltage threshold for test 2 was 0.1V +/- Sd. Testing and controll groups three and four were ran by another group. The data was shared to us by our teacher assistant. Their averages go as follows; controll 3- 0.15V +/- 0 Sd and controll 4 – 0.15V +/- 0 sd. The average voltage threshold for testing group 3 was 0.07V +/- 0 Sd and testing group 4 was 0.05V +/- 0 sd. Only one set of this data allowed for standard deviation to be calculated.  A general trend we saw through the whole experiment was that after Sevin was added the voltage threshold seem to decrease. We also ran a Paired T-Test with this data. It compared the change in the frog leg contractions before the introduction of Sevin to after the ACh blocker was added giving us the results (t_stat= 5.715, d.f.=3, P= 0.01) meaning that there was a significent difference between the tests.

Discussion:
In this experiment we looked at the processes that account for muscle contractions. More specifically, we explored the role of Acetylcholine inside of the contraction process. We utilized the legs of the Rania pipiens frog to test the effect of an Acetylcholine inhibitor, Sevin, on the muscle contraction process. ACh plays the role of the neurotransmitter inside of muscle contractions. Signals are sent from receptors that cause the release of ACh into the synapse causing contractions. The hypothesis we created was proven correct, the data we collected supported our assumptions. When Acetylcholine is blocked the voltage needed to create a contraction is less. When Sevin was not introduced into the muscle cell the threshold voltage for contractions was higher. This means that ACh requires a bigger signal from the body for it to reach voltage threshold. This threshold level creates slower responses compared to no Acetylcholine induced contractions. It is almost like the difference between slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers inside of the human body. The results make sense in the way that ACh works inside of the body. After stimulation it must wait to be released from vesicles into the synapse. This process in it self takes time so blocking ACh should make the muscle easier to contract. It basically lowers the overall voltage threshold of the muscle for contractions. Another study looks at the effects of cannabinoids on Acetylcholine and Choline contractures. Inside of this study it was found that Blocking the isoform of the ryanodine receptor (−RyR) with 150 μM dantrolene caused a reduction of the ACh contracture leading to weaker tension of contractions [Xochitl Trujillo: 2014]. Since the study did not focus on voltage threshold it was not that prevelant inside of the results, however the amount of stimulus needed to create a contraction inside of the muscle did decrease once either ACh or an AChR was blocked. This effectively backs up our results. In our data there is a possibility of error, but it is very unlikely. Firstly, the last two legs were not tested by our group, we received this processed data through our TA. For this reason, we didn’t have enough information to calculate the Standard deviation of their results. Also, there is a possibility that the data we collected was written down in the wrong order causing our numbers to become a little off. The next logical step in this experiment would be to test the affects of excess ACh inside of the muscle, or even test the affects of another molecule such as Ca++ or K+. Overall the experiment we ran was successful in determining the importance and role of ACh in muscle contractions. It places the voltage threshold at a certain spot making the contraction process slower compared to when it is not active inside of the process.
