Title: Azamax Hindering Growth in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment seeks to examine the effect of azamax on growth in Manduca sexta. The independent variable was the food as half of the caterpillars received azamax while the controll group received food mixed with water. The weights of the caterpillars were then measured each day for one week. It was found that azamax does stunt the growth of the Manduca sexta, however, the results were not found to be statistically significent. 

Introduction:
Hormones are essential to the development of organisms such as insects. In this experiment, the development of the Manduca sexta will be manipulated. The Manduca’s common name is the tobacco hornworm and it is in larval stages as a caterpillar before it becomes a moth. Since they are pests as caterpillars, researchers are commonly interested in how to prevent their growth. By blocking the necessary growth hormones, method to prevent or delay their transformation can be found. The most essential growth hormones in Manduca sexta are ecdysterone and juvenile hormone. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting in insect development. Azamax is a chemical that blocks the functioning of ecdysterone. This experiment seeks to identify the effects of azamax on the growth of Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis is that if we treat the experimental group with azamax it will decrease the weight of the treatment group when compared to the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
First we divided four plastic containers into halves using index cards. Next we collected 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and placed them the separate sections. Using a marker, we then wrote on four of the sections “controll” and the other sections “Azamax” and numbered each section from #1 through #8. Next we weighed each caterpillar using a scale to obtain the starting weights. To make the food, we weighed out 40 Ml of caterpillar food and added 28 drops of water for the controll group. The same process was then repeated except 28 drops of azamax were used for the experimental group. We then formed the food into balls. Both lumps of food were then divided into four smaller lumps of 10Ml and placed in the containers. Each evening, one group member weighed each caterpillar and added food when there was none left. After 8 days, we cleaned out the containers and disposed for the caterpillars. We then calculated the total change in weight for each caterpillar. Next a T-test was done to find out if the results were statistically significent. 

Results:
The tobacco hornworms in the controll group grew to be larger than those in the experimental group. The changes in the average weights between days were consistently greater for those in the controll group. The average overall change in weight for the controll group was nearly 8 times as great as the experimental group. A T-test was done to test statistical significance and the results were found to not be statistically significent. The P value was .000074 while the critical value is 1.943. The standard deviation for the azamax group is .92 and .71 for the controll group.

Discussion:
The results suggest that our hypothesis was correct; azamax does hinder the growth hormones in Manduca sexta causing them to not grow as much compared to the growth of a controll group. The average weights for day 8 demonstrates just how dramatic the growth differences are. The change in weight was always lesser for the azamax group which demonstrates that the effects on the growth were consistent throughout the week. It would be logical to assume that the azamax successfully blocked the ecdysterone hormone which promotes growth. However, one could also speculate that azamax intensifies the effects of juvenile hormone which play a role in hindering growth. One possible error in this experiment is that some Manduca sexta were given more food than others depending on how much they were eating. We couldn’t exactly controll how much they were eating and we couldn’t risk starving them for ethical reasons. However, this means that some caterpillars were having more azamax than others were having water and vice versa. If I were to readminister this experiment, I would double the number of caterpillars used to increase the data and number of trials. I would also give them food in smaller portions to track how much they were consuming.
