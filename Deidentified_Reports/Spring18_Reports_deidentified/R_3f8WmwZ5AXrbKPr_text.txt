Title: Plant Resource Allocation: Sunlight Increases Root:Shoot Height and Weight Ratios in Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus

Abstract:
Sunlight is necessary for a plant’s survival. For this experiment, we placed three radish plants in the sunlight and three in the shade. After two weeks, we cut samples of each radish plant at the root: shoot junction and weighed and measured the separate parts, comparing the root:shoot ratios of the radishes grown in the sunlight versus the shade. The biological question we addressed was: how does light affect radish resource allocation and root:shoot length and weight ratios? It was hypothesized that in the shadier condition, the shoots will be taller than the roots. It was predicted that the radishes would allocate their resources to the shoots to maximize the sunlight they received and take advantage of their resources. While the root:shoot length and weight ratios supported this prediction, the results were not statistically significent because the weight p_value was 0.12, and the height p_value was 0.091—both of which were greater than 0.05. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is important for a plant’s survival. Depending on its environment, a plant must adapt to the resources available. If a plant lacks sufficient sunlight, it’s shoot will grow longer in order to possibly reach more sunlight or expand the surface area receiving sunlight. The solar energy can be allocated to new growth, existing leaves and stems, root storage, and root growth. For this experiment, we are studying the effects of sunlight on radishes, or Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus. Radishes are a reliable organism to study in the lab because they germinate and grow quickly and are generally predictable. Radishes are commonly used to study the effects of light on plants [Snowden, Cope, Bugbee: 2016].  
	Our biological question is: how does light affect radish resource allocation and root:shoot ratio? Our hypothesis is that in the shadier condition, the shoots will be taller than the roots. 
	It is important to understand resource allocation and solar energy in plants because it shows how plants adapt to their surroundings and maximize their resources. This knowledge can be applied to agriculture, growing plants in greenhouses, sustainable farming, and more. 
	A study about radish plant growth in different levels of nitrogen-infused soil, Revista Ceres showed that radishes allocate their resources based on the conditions they are in [Ceres: 2016]. 

Materials and Method:
To prepare for this lab, we planted radishes two weeks before and placed three in the sun and three underneath a shade cloth. We watered each set equally every day.  We analyzed the root:shoot ratio of radishes grown in the sun versus radishes grown in the shade. To begin, we harvested the plants by pulling them out of the tray and separating the roots. After washing the plants, we weighed them, then cut them at their root:shoot junction. We then weighed the roots and shoots separately and measured their lengths. The procedure was repeated three times for each condition—light and shade. In this experiment, the independent variable was the amount of sunlight and the dependent variables were the root:shoot length and weight ratios. We used a two-sample t_test to compare radishes grown in the sunlight vs. the shade. The t_test was used because we compared the root:shoot ratio averages to find how far off from .05 the p_value was. 

Results:
The root:shoot weight ratio averaged higher in the plants grown in the sunlight. As seen in Figure 1, while the average of the root:shoot weight ratio of the plants grown in the shade was 0.057, it was 0.108 for the plants grown in the sunlight. The standard deviation of the shaded plants was 0.057, while the standard deviation for the plants that received more sunlight was 0.0597. The p_value was 0.12093. 
	As seen in Figure 2, the root:shoot length ratio also averaged higher in the plants that received more sunlight. The average root:shoot length ratio of the plants grown in the shade was 0.36 and 0.48 for the ones grown in more sunlight. The standard deviation of the shaded plants was 0.0597, and 0.1106 for the plants that received more sunlight. The p_value was 0.091. 
In Figure 3, it is clear that the radishes grown in the sunlight (on the right) look fuller, healthier, and less stringy than the ones grown in the shadier conditions (on the left). 


Discussion:
Our results were not statistically significent, so our hypothesis was not correct. We predicted that in the shadier condition, the shoots will be taller than the roots because the radishes would allocate more resources to their roots to take advantage of the ample sunlight, but the difference between the results of the two sets of data was not significent enough to support our hypothesis. However, the root:shoot weight average and height average were higher in the radishes grown in the sunlight, which agreed with our predictions. 
	A source of error could have been marking the root:shoot junction inconsistently on each plant. We used silver sharpie to mark the junctions, but the marker faded off slightly when we washed the radishes, so it could be considered a source of error. If we had possibly measured the weight and length of the roots and shoots within a week or less of planting them, our results may have been more consistent and immediate. Also, measuring the roots and shoots three or more weeks after planting them could have given us more consistent results and more time to see the differences between the radishes grown in the sunlight versus shade. 
	In L.F.M. Marcelis and J. Van Hooijdonk’s study on the effects of salinity on plant growth, water use, and resource allocation in radishes, the results showed that the greater the salinity of the water, the more resources there were allocated to the roots [Marcelis, Hooijdonk: 1999]. The plants allocate their resources to the roots in order to absorb the nutrients of high salinity. Both our experiment and this experiment demonstrate how plants in different environments respond to their surroundings by allocating their resources. Although our results were not statistically significent, they did slightly vary from one another, reaffirming our predictions about resource allocation.
