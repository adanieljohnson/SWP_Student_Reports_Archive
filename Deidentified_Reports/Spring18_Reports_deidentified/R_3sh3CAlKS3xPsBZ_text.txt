Title: Introduction of Tetraetylammonium and Electric Pulses to Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana Pipiens Frog Leg

Abstract:
In this experiment researchers tested the effects of Tetraetylammonium, a potassium channel blocker, on the contractile times and Hz needed for tetany in a Rana Pipiens frog leg when subjected to electrical pulses. Researchers hypothesized that if 10 mL of 100 mM Tetraetylammonium is injected into the Gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana Pipiens frog then the muscle will take much longer to return to its resting state and require an electrical pulse with much lower amplitude to reach tetany than the control. When the contractile times and Hz need to induce tetany were recorded of both control legs and those that had been injected with 10 mL of 100 mM Tetraetylammonium researchers found that average Hz needed for tetany was notably lower for treatment group legs. Although statistically insignificant, researchers did find there was a great increase of 478.33 msec on average in contractile time from control to treatment legs. The hypothesis was supported in term of Hz needed for tetany but, technically, the contractile times were not different enough to rule out coincidence.

Introduction:
The contraction of muscles is a complex process that begins with an action potential that is communicated by a motor neuron. When this electric pulse reaches the neuromuscular junction the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine (ACh) is released and binds with channels on the membrane that release Calcium [Johnson, 2016]. This calcium then attaches to troponin on actin fibers which then shifts tropomyosin and allows myosin and actin to attach to one another and therefore contract the sarcomere—which results in muscle contraction. When ATP then comes in contact with the myosin, it disconnects the myosin and actin [Johnson, 2016]. It is then transformed into ADP and provides energy for the next contraction. During this process, calcium detaches and reattaches from troponin until reuptake occurs. During this reuptake process, Potassium channels allow for the repolarization of the cell by reinstating the original ion gradient [Johnson, 2016]. This complex process is very delicate, and relies on many moving parts for optimal, yet necessary performance. Therefore, many questions can be raised by adding and or blocking certain ions. For example, an experiment published in the Journal of Physiology explored the addition of protons and Potassium in the skeletal muscle of rabbits and measured contraction velocity, isotonic tension and presence of ATP [Cooke, 1988]. Through their research, they found the consequences of these changes had additive effects on muscle fatigue—especially slowing contraction velocity [Cooke, 1988]. In this lab, researchers will be studying the effects of a potassium channel blocker, 100 mM Tetraetylammonium, will have on the leg muscle Gastrocnemius of a Rana Pipiens frog by emulating action potentials with short electric pulses. We are using the Rana Pipiens frog because it has nerves that allow for rapid communication in their neuromuscular system and can therefore be compared to humans in their responses [Johnson, 2016]. We believe that if Tetraetylammonium is injected into the Gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana Pipiens frog then the muscle will take much longer to return to its resting state and require an electrical pulse with much lower amplitude to reach tetany than the control. 

Materials and Methods:
1. Take three separated legs of the Rana Pipiens and de-glove them before locating the sciatic nerve and separating it from the muscle without breaking or tearing it. Then snip the end of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog. 
2. Attach a string to the end of the gastrocnemius muscle and tie it in a 90-degree angle so it is taut. Then insert two BNC connector electrode probes into the muscle.  
3. Then, still having not injected anything into the muscle, record the contractile time of the first pulse in a series of 3 at 1 Hz. 
4. After the first contractile time has been recorded, find the necessary amplitude to induce tetany of the frog leg. 
5. Do this for all of the frog legs before you inject them. 
6. Then inject the frog leg with 10 mL of 100 mM Tetraetylammonium and wait a full minute before conducting the same tests you did on the control legs. 
7. Do this for each frog leg after control tests have been done.  
8. Utilize a paired t-test to organize data collected.

Results:
The average contractile time in the control frog legs was 258.33 msec while the average treatment contractile time was 736.66 msec and the P-value was 0.0812 (see Figure 1). The average Hz needed to induce tetany in control frog legs was 17 Hz, while it was 10 Hz in the treated frog legs, and the P-value was 0.0067 (see Figure 2).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was mostly supported by our results. In terms of contractile times, our P-value of 0.0812 was technically statistically insignificant. This result was due to of the frog legs reacting differently to the Tetraetylammonium, as the treatment only extended the contractile time by 100% rather than by more than 300% as seen in the other frog legs. This phenomenon could have been due to human error and researchers could have injected less Tetraetylammonium than in the other frog legs. Nevertheless, looking at the change of contractile time average went up 478.33 msec from control to treatment (see Figure 1). This, I believe, is still a meaningful difference and still speaks to the potassium channel blocker reducing the muscle’s ability to repolarize and therefore lengthening contractile time. The amplitude needed in order to induce tetany, however, was extremely statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0067 (see Figure 2). This directly supports that the potassium channel blocker, Tetraetylammonium, specifically inhibited the muscle reuptake process and this constant supply of calcium allowed tetany to be induced quickly and with less amplitude. The effects this one miniscule change in the contraction system had massive results in terms of its performance. These results were very similar to those found in the study of effects of proton and potassium addition to the skeletal muscles of rabbits. They found that contraction velocity was supremely affected and that the consequences were additive [Cooke, 1988] and, although we only had one factor that we changed, further proves the enormity of these small changes. Both these and our findings are very important because they speak to the delicacy of the skeletal muscle contractile system. Movements of skeletal muscle are both conscious and found in almost every moment of the lives of every animal and insect on the planet. Further understanding of additive or subtractive changes and their consequences would immensely increase our understanding of ourselves and other animals and could lead to better treatment and even preventative measures in the medical field.
