Title: Effect of Fish Decoy Authenticity on Aggression Levels in Beta splendis  

Abstract:
Our study analyzed the effect of fish authenticity on aggression levels. I hypothesized that the more authentic the fish the more aggression would be shown. In order to test this, we imposed a fish to an unauthentic and authentic beta fish decoy and a live fish in 5 minute intervals with 5 minute rest periods. We separated them in an aquarium with a glass and an opaque white wall. 
We used an one-way ANOVA test to test the significance (p=.051), proving the results insignificent. My hypothesis was not supported and so the null hypothesis cannot be rejected; although there was a trend in the average of length and weight root to shoot ratios being smaller, through an ANOVA test, the results proved insignificent. 


Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, is important in understanding the world as an animal sees it to try and explore the evolutionary basis for their behavior. Beta fish, Beta splendis, have been bred into domesticity, increasing bright colors and aggression levels. There are two types of intraspecific (between betas) aggression displays, also known as agnostic responses: broadside movements (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) and facing movements (erect pectoral fins, spreading gills/ covering opercula, protrude branchiostegal membrane). The other fish can respond to these agnostic behaviors with four possible responses: ignore it, match it, flee, or escalate. In order to obtain accurate results, ethologist must set many periods of patient observation both in the field and in the wild. This can account for habituation, the process in which the fish becomes accustomed to the present stimulus and stops responding. In addition, one should not interpret the animals behavior in human terms. 
In this lab, we will be looking at the effect of fish decoys authenticity on beta fish aggression levels. I hypothesize that that the more realistic the fish the more aggression will be shown. This has a biological importance because fish ability to analyze whether or not something is a threat allows them to conserve their energy. 
Serra, Wolkers, Mello, Urbinati’s (2016) experiment measured the effect of the imposition a mirror on aggression levels in B. amazonicus fish. They measured aggression in latency, bites, rushes, locomotion, plasma glucose, and serum cortisol and compared them between the winning fish and the losing fish. The results showed that escalation of aggressive behaviors was similar in real and mirror trials, although the magnitude was smaller against a mirror. On the other hand, number of rushes, locomotion, and glucose levels after the fight against a mirror were significently lower. The results showed that the absence of an opponent that flees from an attack causes a lower fight cost in terms of energy mobilization. This study helped me form my hypothesis that in the presence of fish decoys the aggressive response would be minimal. 


Materials and Method:
To analyze these introspective interactions, we imposed 3 different experimental groups onto a beta fish: an unauthentic decoy, an authentic fish decoy, and a real fish. The fish were separated  into three compartments of an aquarium by a glass wall and an opaque white wall. We then would pull up one of the white opaque walls, revealing the fish to the other. We observed its behavioral responses for a period of 5 minute intervals. Our trials were repeated 3 times per experimental group. Our objective scaling will be based off of a point system, which is shown in the table below. Given that my hypothesis suggested a difference in the mean of three different variables, using excel we employed a one-way ANOVA test.

Results:
As seen in figures 1, the average betta fish aggression level for the unauthentic decoy was 1.33±.1, and the average mean for the authentic decoy was 0±0. On the other hand, the mean aggression level when in the presence of an actual beta fish was 58.67±1. Our ANOVA test suggested that there was not a significent effect of the authenticity of the fish on aggression levels [F (2, 6)= 5.095, p=0.051]. Further tests indicate that the average real fish aggression displays were significently more than the two decoys. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was not supported that there would be a difference between the mean aggression levels for a fish exposed to an unauthentic and authentic fish decoy and a live fish. With our p value of .051, our data proved insignificent, but if one more aggressive behavior was noted, this would not be the case. A possible reason for this insignificance could be that the fish tested habituated to the lab environment. To avoid this problem in the future, we could use fish that have not been exposed to experimental design. Even though my hypothesis was not supported, there was a drastic difference between the aggression levels shown in the presence of the decoys and those shown in the presence of a live fish, suggesting that there is some biological importance in being able to identify the authenticity of a fish and analyzing its potential danger. It's a way to conserve energy. It is not necessary for a beta fish in a dangerous environment with another male beta fish to show constant signs of aggression when after time, they have not been attacked. At the same time, it also preserves the meaning of the signs of aggression. 
In Alyan’s experiment Male Betta splendends are equally aggressive toward neighbors and strangers (2009), we can see that male Siamese fish reacted similarly to familiar and stranger males. Like our experiment, a male beta fish was placed into an aquarium separated from another male beta fish. This represented the familiar fish, one who had been exposed to for 24 hours. However, in addition, a second trial was done in which another male beta fish was placed in a small glass jar in the corner of the other side of the aquarium, representing the stranger fish. After the waiting period of 24 hours, the glass wall was removed. This is shown as a lack of dear enemy effect. Possible explanations for this behavior are an inability to discriminate between neighboring males and non-neighboring males. Males could be equally aggressive to all intruders because they all can produce equal danger.
