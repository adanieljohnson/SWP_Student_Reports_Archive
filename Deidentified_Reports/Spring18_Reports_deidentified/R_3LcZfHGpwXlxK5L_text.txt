Title: Tetraethylammonium Chloride induced contractions in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) is a chemical that inhibits the reabsorption of Ca++ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in a muscle cell by blocking K+ channels. Muscle contraction is stimulated by the release and binding of Ca++ ions to actin. Relaxation of the muscle is stimulated by the reabsorption of Ca++ ions. The study tested the effects of TEA Cl on the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens. Using TEA Cl to block K+ channels, preventing Ca++ from being reabsorbed, should increase the duration of each muscle contraction. We tested a control group by stimulating the sciatic nerve of the Rana pipiens, causing contractions and then recording the duration. We injected the muscle with 1 mL of TEA Cl and stimulated the sciatic nerve and recorded the duration of contraction. Our P-Value (.0187) showed a statistical difference in the rate of contraction from the control group to the treatment group. The group that received 1mL of TEA Cl showed longer duration of contraction than the control group that received no K+ channel blocker. K+ channels control the reabsorption of Ca++ ions so, blocking these channels allow for Ca++ to continue to bind to actin causing muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Muscle contractions occur when an action potential depolarizes the cell causing sodium and calcium to rush into the cell. The released calcium binds to the troponin on actin causing a conformational change in the filament which exposes a myosin binding site. Myosin heads then bind to the exposed site which stimulates muscle contraction. Muscle relaxation is cause by ATP breaking apart the cross bridge between myosin and actin and Ca++ being absorbed back into the cell (Johnson: 2018). However, if Ca++ is never absorbed back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it will continue to bind to troponin causing the muscle to repeatedly contract. This study tested the effects tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA Cl) induced contractions had on the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens. A previous study using the sartorius muscle of a frog showed that the effects of TEA Cl increased the duration and length of the muscle contractions by inhibiting the amount of Ca++ absorbed back into the cell. They found that K+ channels control the flow of Ca++ ions, which bind to troponin and stimulate the binding of myosin heads to actin (Beaulieu: 1967).  TEA Cl is a chemical that blocks the potassium channel that allows Ca++ to be absorbed back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. By blocking the potassium channel, the Ca++ will be unable to be reabsorbed and it will continue stimulate muscle contraction. The effects of TEA will increase the duration of contraction, causing the relaxation period to be lengthened. 

Materials and Methods:
We started the study by separating the gastrocnemius muscle from two severed legs bone of Rana pipiens. We then isolated the sciatic nerve from the rest of the thigh muscle and laid it across two pieces of silver thread, which were to be stimulated later on. The thigh of the Rana pipien was pinned down to restrain it from moving when stimulated and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated and lifted up by a string. After stimulated, we measured the contraction period up until the muscle started relaxing. We gathered the results and then injected the gastrocnemius muscle with .1mm of TEA Cl. The sciatic nerve was then stimulated again and the duration of contraction for the muscle inject with TEA Cl was recorded. Two trials of both a control group and a treatment group were run and a paired T-test was used to analyze the difference in duration of contractions between the control and treatment groups.

Results:
Results of the paired T-test showed that durations of muscle contractions were longer for the muscles that were injected with TEA Cl than the muscle that received no treatment. Figure 1 shows the results from the control group presented an average contraction time of 166.391 +/- 43.43ms. While, the results from the treatments group showed an average contraction time of 1135.4 +/- 989.31ms. These results show that statistically, the contraction period for the muscle injected with the potassium blocker was almost seven times as long as the contraction period of the control muscle. The P-value of .0187 shows that there is a statistical difference between the contraction periods of the control and treatment groups. 

Discussion:
Our results show that TEA Cl prolonged muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens. Muscle contractions are stimulated by the release of Ca++ that binds to troponin. Relaxation occurs when Ca++ is absorbed back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cell. TEA Cl blocks the K+ channel that allows for the reabsorption of Ca++. Ca++ then continues to bind to troponin which allows for myosin to bind to actin. The P-Value (.0187) showed that there was a statistical difference in the lengths of contractions between the control group and the treatment groups. The muscles that received treatment showed longer durations of contraction because TEA Cl blocked the K+ channel from allowed Ca++ to be reabsorbed. Immediately after injecting the muscle with TEA Cl, the muscle started visibly contracting even before stimulation occurred. We determined that we did not allow sufficient enough time for Ca++ to absorb back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum fully before injecting the muscle with TEA Cl. The previous study done by Beaulieu showed similar results. Results showed that muscle injected with K+ channel blocker TEA Cl increased the duration of contraction by slowing the amount of Ca++ absorbed back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Beaulieu: 1967). Stimulation of muscle contraction can be important for certain cases of paralysis. By decreasing the amount of Ca++ that is reabsorbed and stimulating longer durations of contractions, paralysis victim maybe be able to regain some forms of muscle movement.

Figure Legends: 
Average rate of contraction (shown in ms) of gastronemiucs muscle injected with K+ channel blacker (TEA Cl; experimental group) vs. normal contraction (control group). Error bars represent +/- on standard deviation. Average of control group is 166.39 +/- 43.43 and average if experimental group is 1135.4 +/- 989.3. T-test results showed duration of contraction to be much longer when exposed to TEA Cl (p=.0187).
