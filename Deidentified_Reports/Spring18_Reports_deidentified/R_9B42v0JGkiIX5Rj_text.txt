Title: Effects of Ecdysone Blockers on the Insect, Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Similar to Puberty, Metamorphosis is the rapid transition from larval to pupal in insects and this process is monitored by fluctuating levels of hormones, primarily the hormones Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). In this experiment, ecdysone blockers were used on the organism, Manduca sexta, which should inhibit the growth and development of the insect. Ecdysone blockers work to inhibit the joining of ecdysone with an ecdysone receptor and thus inhibits the production of Ecdysterone. Azamax solution (ecdysone blocker) was used on the Manduca sexta, which had a dilution of 1:1250. There was a total of eight caterpillars, four of which were a control group and where each caterpillar was fed ten grams of food supplemented with six drops water. The other four caterpillars were the treatment group, where each caterpillar was fed ten grams of food, which was supplemented with six drops of Azamax solution (1:1250). The presence of the ecdysone inhibitor did not indicate any statistical significance compared to that of the control group, due to large p-values calculated by the T-tests, most likely due to multiple factors. The T-tests for length (cm), weight (mm), and amount of food eaten (%) gave p-values of 0.493, 0.062, and 0.434.


Introduction:
Hormones are very critical to all life on Earth. They begin and mark the end of changes in an organism’s body. One of these changes is known as puberty, which involves fluctuating levels of hormones causing change and maturation of the human body. Something similar to puberty can happen to insects, better known as metamorphosis [Riddiford: 1993]. Metamorphosis is the radical transition for certain insects, both chemically (involving hormones) and physically, from a “worm-like larval stage,” also known as a caterpillar, to the pupa stage [Johnson 2016]. However, there are steps that must occur before metamorphosis; the overall process that occurs before metamorphosis and encompasses those multitude of steps is molting. Molting involves the transition from one life stage to the next due to an insect producing a new outer layer called a cuticle. The insect’s outer-layered skin cells are responsible for producing this cuticle and molting separates larval instars and the pupal and adult stages due to changes in size and morphology [Johnson: 2016]. 

Through Metamorphosis, the physical development of the insect undergoes significant change, leading to drastic differences in appearances between the larval stage (caterpillar) and the pupal stage [Johnson: 2016]. Metamorphosis in the Manduca sexta, as well as other insects, involves two hormones responsible for physical change – Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). The fluctuating levels of these two hormones are primarily responsible for molting and metamorphosis within the Manduca sexta, due to the general notion that both vertebrates and insects control their growth, development, and behaviors using hormone signaling [Johnson: 2016]. Therefore, there are a multitude of hormones that are responsible for physical development within the Manduca sexta and as a result, JH and Ecdysterone are not the only hormones that are responsible for significant physical development within the insect. There is a third hormone, Prothoracicotropic or Brain Hormone (PTTH or BH), which is produced by the Corpus Cardiacum (neurosecretory organ) and which regulates the production of ecdysterone from the prothoracic glands [Johnson: 2016]. Ecdysterone (20E) is a part of the steroid family of hormones, called ecdysteroids, which are unique in each insect [Johnson: 2016].
 
In the Manduca sexta, the specific ecdysteroid that will be focused on will be referred to as ecdysone. Ecdysone is a product that precedes and is therefore responsible for the production of 20E; ecdysone is produced from “dietary cholesterol” in prothoracic glands of an insect, carried to the hemolymph, and undergoes oxidation to become 20E in the peripheral tissues [Nakagawa: 2016]. In this case, ecdysterone is responsible for the timing of molting [Johnson: 2016]. The last hormone, Juvenile Hormone (JH), is responsible for the type of molt during development; it is produced by the Corpus Allata [Johnson: 2016]. The proper levels of both JH and 20E are responsible for the overall health and development of the insect; if one is not produced, the insect will die. Both hormones are responsible for molting, growth, and metamorphosis in the Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2016]. Therefore, one may find it interesting to speculate and research what would happen if one of the hormones were to be inhibited. 

Similar to this notion, a case study was performed by Tunaz H. and Uygun N. and they found evidence of insect growth regulators (IGRs), which “adversely affect insect growth and development” [Tunaz: 2004]. These IGRs do not provide any toxicity hazards but rather lead to a multitude of abnormalities that impair insect survival. These researchers first discovered IGRs by observing the cultures of the Linden Bug, which had low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults. Likewise, in our experiment, we hope to find the same results when inhibiting the hormone, ecdysone, in the Manduca sexta, because varying levels of ecdysone and ecdysone inhibitors should cause changes in development and growth [Schlüter: 1985]. Molting within the Manduca sexta is due to ecdysteroids joining with an ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle protein to activate a certain number of genes which are responsible for the appropriate later responses in other genes for the growth and development of the insect [Riddiford: 1993]. Therefore, in the presence of the Azamax solution (ecdysone inhibitor) and when ecdysone receptors are inhibited, we hope to see the overall inhibition for the production of the hormone, ecdysterone, thus inhibiting the growth and development of the insect, just as the IGRS affected the Linden Bug. Thus, the results of the growth and development of the Manduca sexta will be analyzed when in the presence of Azamax solution and not in the presence of Azamax solution. Manduca sexta is a model organism for this experiment because of their small size, ability to easily be contained, and ability to be easily measured and weighed. They required little food and little space to develop and did not pose any threats to students. 


Materials and Methods:
First, as a group, we selected eight, 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing about 1.0 to 2.0 grams, dividing them into groups of two. Four containers were utilized in order to provide an environment for the caterpillars; each container was separated by a notecard and two caterpillars were placed in one container. Two containers were marked as treatments and the other two containers were marked as controls. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets. One of these diets, (1) the control, was ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet, made as recommended by the manufacturer and had six drops of water added to the ten grams of food. There was a total of four caterpillars that received this food diet. The second diet, (2) the treatment, was ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet, made as recommended by the manufacturer and with the addition of six drops of Azamax solution (ecdysone inhibitor), which had a dilution of 1:1250, per ten grams of food per caterpillar. All eight of these caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 25 degrees Celsius, in a 12 hour dark : 12 hour light cycle. Every day, for approximately seven days, our group recorded the final weight, length, observations, and amount of food eaten by each caterpillar while wearing gloves. In this experiment, we will be using a two-sample T-test in order to analyze our data, and thus our experiment. Overall, our hypothesis was tested by comparing the growth and development of the caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups. 

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the weight (g), length (mm), and amount of food eaten (%) by each group of caterpillars was that they all generally decreased as time passed. The majority of the caterpillars remained a bright greenish blue color throughout the experiment. There was however a major color change from control #3 from green to yellow and there was a slight color change from green to yellow in treatments #1, 2, and 4. Also, control #3 and treatment #3 started to pupate towards the end of the experiment. However, there was no clear difference in trends between the control and treatment groups. This can be seen in Figures 1, 2, and 3, as well as in the statistical tests. In Figures 1, 2, and 3, the overall trend is that both the control and treatment groups decrease in weight, length, and amount of food eaten. For example, in Figure 1a), on February 11th, the average for the control had a weight of approximately 6.10 grams and the treatment had a weight of approximately 5.00 grams. By the end of the week, their average weights declined. On February 15th, the control had a weight of approximately 4.90 grams and the treatment had a weight of about 3.40 grams. Therefore, the general trend was that both groups decreased in their values. Although, as seen in all the three graphs, the treatment groups (at times) produced lower values in length, weight, and amount of food eaten as the week progressed. The T-test we ran for the length of the caterpillars gave us a p-value of 0.493 (t-stat = 0.70, df = 14, P = 0.493). The mean of the control does not hold any statistical significance over that of the experimental group for length because the p-value is significantly larger than 0.05 (t-stat = 0.70, df = 14, P = 0.493). The T-test we ran for the weight of the caterpillars gave us a p-value of 0.062 (t-stat = 2.03, df = 14, P = 0.062). The mean of the control does not hold any statistical significance over that of the experimental group for weight because the p-value is larger than 0.05 (t-stat = 2.03, df = 14, P = 0.062). The T-test we ran for the amount of food eaten by the caterpillars gave us a p-value of 0.434 (t-stat = 0.81, df = 12, P = 0.434). The mean of the control does not hold any statistical significance over that of the experimental group for the amount of food eaten because the p-value is significantly larger than 0.05 (t-stat = 0.81, df = 12, P = 0.434).  

Discussion:
Based upon on our data, we cannot come to the conclusion that the presence of Azamax solution in the caterpillars’ food did in fact affect and inhibit the hormone, ecdysone, and thus inhibit the growth and development of the insect. The data for both our control and treatment groups were very similar; the general trend for both groups for the recorded length, weight, and the amount of food eaten all decreased as time passed during the experiment. Despite in some cases where some graphs showed some treatment groups producing a smaller value in length, weight, or amount of food eaten as the week progressed, the statistical analyses produced P-values that ultimately concluded that there was no statistical difference between the two groups. There is no clear distinct difference based upon the charts when analyzing the data and no difference in trends when comparing the presence of the ecdysone blocker to the absence of ecdysone blocker. This can be seen with our P-values and T-tests, as well as the standard deviation bars in the figures above. In order to conclude that one’s results were not by mere chance, or coincidence, the P-value should be less than 5%, which is equivalent to 0.05. As seen in Figure 1 (weight), Figure 2 (length) and Figure 3 (amount of Food Eaten), the P-values are significantly higher than 0.05. The T-test we ran for the length of the caterpillars gave us a P-value of 0.493. The T-test we ran for the weight of the caterpillars gave us a p-value of 0.062. The T-test we ran for the amount of food eaten by the caterpillars gave us a P-value of 0.434. All of these P-values are higher than 0.05 and because the T-test is a measure of the range of the statistical estimate, this shows that our experiment did not produce accurate data. Therefore, our group cannot rule out the possibility that our data resulted due to pure coincidence and thus does not allow our group to come to a conclusion based upon the prescribed amounts of ecdysone inhibitors provided to our caterpillars in the experiment. The standard deviation bars in our figures are large as well, meaning the data spreads over a large range compared to that of the mean.

There may have been no clear effect on the caterpillars due to a multitude of potential factors. One, there may not have been enough Azamax solution added to the caterpillar’s food. As a result, there was not a sufficient amount of ecdysone inhibitors in order to have an effect on the development of the caterpillars. Therefore, because there weren’t enough ecdysone inhibitors in the organism and molting within the Manduca sexta is due to ecdysteroids joining with an ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle protein to activate a certain number of genes triggering growth and development of the insect, there was no clear visible difference between the two groups [Riddiford: 1993]. Due to this, normal levels of ecdysone may have been produced in the caterpillar to reach the commitment pulse, which then could be cause for the color change and pupation of certain caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups [Johnson: 2016]. It is also stated in a journal that Azamax solution may affect growth of Manduca sexta, although, low amounts of ecdysone inhibitors did not cause any change in growth; the caterpillars still grew and pupated. Although, when given larger dosages, the caterpillars were not able to grow, did not completely development, and thus did not pupate, ultimately dying in the end [Schlüter: 1985]. This allows our group to conclude that our inaccuracy of data was most likely due to an insufficient amount of ecdysone inhibitors. Another potential cause for the inaccuracy of data could be the stacking of containers within the incubator. Some of the containers may have been stacked within the incubator, thus limiting the amount of oxygen that was received by the caterpillars. This condition would affect both the treatments and the controls, limiting the amount of oxygen circulating through their body and inhibiting their development and growth. Another potential reason for why there is no significant difference between the two groups could be the fact that our group used the wrong ecdysone blocker. There are multiple ecdysone blockers but each one has different conditions and effects on the Manduca sexta. In Gilbert’s and Gill’s book, Insect control: Biological and synthetic agents, it states that the ecdysone blocker, Azamax solution, potentially may not inhibit the hormone ecdysone and thus does not inhibit the growth and development of the Manduca sexta [Gilbert: 2010]. Also, it states that Azamax solution may potentially increase and extend the JH peak, thus causing the caterpillar’s body to not acknowledge the commitment pulse and therefore not pupate and thus continually grow in weight and length [Gilbert: 2010]. This could have led to similarities and a lack of differences between our control and treatment groups. Based on our results and lack of significant effects of the Azamax solution, we cannot reject our null hypothesis. Our experiment did not run parallel to the IGRs in the Linden bug, discovered by Tunaz and Uygun in that the ecdysone blockers did not significantly and clearly impair the development of the caterpillars. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported by our data. In order to improve our data if we were to do this experiment again, we should be careful not to stack the containers in the incubator, target an ecdysone blocker that directly has effects on the Manduca Sexta, and most likely apply more drops of the ecdysone blocker to the caterpillars’ food.
