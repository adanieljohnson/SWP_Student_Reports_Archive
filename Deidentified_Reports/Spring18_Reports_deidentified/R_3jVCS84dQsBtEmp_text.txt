Title: The effect of lanthanum chloride on gastrocnemius muscle contraction amplitude in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system can respond to stimuli within milliseconds. Stimulation of a motor neuron causes contraction of a muscle fiber. In this lab, muscle contraction of the Rana pipiens, commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, will be tested. Their muscles remain alive for several hours after death making these frog legs useful for lab purposes. Muscle contractions are controlled by the influx of calcium ions. We predict that if 1 mL of a calcium channel blocker called 1mM lanthanum chloride is injected into the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, then the contraction amplitude (V) will decrease. However, we found that the injection of lanthanum chloride increased the contraction amplitude. Therefore, we rejected the hypothesis. Similar studies have found that lanthanum chloride is effective in decreasing muscle contraction amplitude of smooth and cardiac muscles but not skeletal muscles. In all, injection of lanthanum chloride does not decrease the gastrocnemius muscle’s contraction amplitude. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles consist of a collection of cells called myofibrils that are linked by connective tissue. Skeletal muscle contains motor neurons. At the neuromuscular junctions, the motor neuron axons extend to the myofibrils. When an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open moving calcium into the axon allowing the muscle to contract [Ebashi : 1968]. The legs of Rana pipiens, commonly known as Northern Leopard Frog, were used in this lab as their muscles remain alive for several hours after death. This was necessary in order to gather data on how stimulation of the sciatic nerve affects muscle contraction amplitude. In this lab, the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of a Northern Leopard Frog were studied to find the effect of a calcium channel blocker called lanthanum chloride on the muscle’s contraction amplitude. The release of calcium in the postsynaptic terminal of the nerve axon stimulates muscle contraction [Ebashi : 1968]. Therefore, if 1 mL of a calcium channel blocker called 1mM lanthanum chloride is injected into the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, then the contraction amplitude (V) will decrease.

Materials and Methods:
To perform this lab, 4 R. pipiens frog legs were obtained. Each leg was skinned and moistened with frog Ringer’s solution as needed. The white sciatic nerve was located and freed from the muscle. The leg hung from an apparatus allowing the gastrocnemius muscle to hang vertical. The lower leg was pinned to the bottom of the dissecting tray to hold it in place. The freed sciatic nerve was placed on top of the nerve stimulators. See figure #1 for lab setup. 

In this lab, the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of a Northern Leopard Frog were studied to find the effects of a calcium channel blocker on the muscle’s contraction amplitude. For each leg, the control twitch threshold (amps) and contraction amplitude (V) were found. A computer software system called LabScribe was used to administer the stimulus and collect the data. The twitch threshold and contraction amplitude of the muscle were determined by analyzing the myogram after nerve stimulation. The LabScribe settings were set as follows:
o	# Pulses = 1 pulse
o	Frequency = 1 Hz
o	Pulse width = 5 ms 

For frog leg #1, the voltage was increased by 0.1 amp increments. The control threshold was found when the first twitch was observed at 0.1 amps. The control values are the contraction amplitudes of both legs before calcium channel blocker was injected. The muscle was then injected with 0.1 mL of 1mM lanthanum chloride. After 10 minutes passed, we began stimulating the nerve. The LabScribe settings remained as listed above for the treatment. However, this time we started the voltage at 0.04 amps to determine a more accurate threshold value. This was repeated for all 4 legs. When muscle contraction was visualized on LabScribe, we designated the stimulator voltage to be the twitch threshold. Then, the contraction amplitude was measured at that voltage. 

The averages of the control and treatment groups were calculated and displayed in a bar graph showing standard deviation in the form of error bars. Then, a paired t-test was performed because the control and treatment groups were not independent of each other. The paired t-test calculated the probability that the results were due to chance.

Results:
When calculating the averages and performing the paired t-test, the data calculated for frog leg #1 was omitted. This data is omitted because we did not record the contraction amplitude (only the voltages). Therefore, the averages are from the data collected for frog legs #2, #3, and #4. 

The average contraction amplitudes (V) were found for the control and treatment groups, as shown in Figure #2. The average of the control group was 0.0783 V +/- 0.0189 V. The average of the treatment group was 0.0873 V +/- 0.0112 V. After completing a paired t-test, I found t=0.842, df=2, and p=0.489. I came to the conclusion that my data is not statistically significant because the value of p is greater than 0.05. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the average treatment contraction amplitude was larger than the average control contraction amplitude. Therefore, I cannot accept my hypothesis because the data shows the contraction amplitude increased and my data is not statistically significant. Possible errors could have occurred in the lab due to the frogs contracting Red Leg disease, which causes lethargy. Also, we did not record the contraction amplitude for frog leg #1 (only the voltage) limiting the amount of data to average by decreasing the sample size.

A similar study conducted yielded similar results. They treated rats with lanthanum chloride and analyzed behavioral responses. The scientists found no significant differences in the ability of control and treatment rats to escape a platform and found no significant difference in their swim speed [Xiao : 2008]. However, they did find a significant difference in their spatial reference memory. The lanthanum chloride decreased calcium ion-ATPase activity in hippocampal cells rather than skeletal muscle cells [Xiao : 2008]. 

Lanthanum chloride affects smooth and cardiac muscles, rather than skeletal muscles. Therefore, scientists have found that medications containing calcium channel blockers are useful in treating hypertension because they make the cardiac muscle contract less forcefully, allowing blood vessels to relax [Roth : 2018]. Typically, when an action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open moving calcium into the axon [Ebashi : 1968]. Then, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Ach) is released from the presynaptic terminal, crosses the synapse, and binds to receptors on the postsynaptic terminal [Ebashi : 1968]. Consequently, sodium ions move into the cell and potassium ions move out. The release of calcium stimulates muscle contraction. In conclusion, a calcium channel blocker such as lanthanum chloride is not effective in decreasing the contraction amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle, but rather is effective in decreasing the contraction amplitude of smooth and cardiac muscles.

Figure Legends: 
Figure #1. This image shows the general lab setup. The skinned frog leg was hung from the apparatus pulling the gastrocnemius muscle vertical. The nerve was freed and placed on top of the stimulators. The rest of the leg was pinned to the dissecting tray to hold it in place. The muscle was moistened with frog Ringer’s solution as needed. 

Figure #2. The bar graph shows the average contraction amplitude (V) for the control and treatment R. pipiens. The average is for the 3 frog legs from which we gathered conclusive data. The error bars represent +/- a standard deviation. The average of the control group was 0.0783 V +/- 0.0189 V. The average of the treatment group was 0.0873 V +/- 0.0112 V. After conducting the paired t-test, we came to the conclusion that the data is not statistically significant as there is a probability that it could be due to chance, as reflected by p=0.489.
