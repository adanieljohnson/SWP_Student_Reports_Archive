Title: The Effect of AzaGuard on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The effect of IGRs, or insect growth regulators, was explored in this experiment and utilized the Manduca Sexta. A controll group and treatment group containing AzaGuard, an IGR, was designed to compare the weights over the course of a week. The hypothesis stated that if AzaGuard was added to the food given to the caterpillars, their weights would be lower in comparison to the controll group due to the presence of an IGR containing juvenile hormone which prevents them from moving to the next stage of development. After weighing them for a week, a trend of decreasing weight was shown in the treatment group, as expected. The calculated P value of 0.039 showed that the data was statistically significently different, allowing us to reject the null and accept the alternate hypothesis. 

Introduction:
This experiment explores the effect of an IGR, insect growth regulator, on the Manduca Sexta, or Tobacco Hornworm. Insect growth regulators are insecticides that affect the growth and development of insects. They mimic the actions of hormones [Rechcigl: 1999]. IGRs are widely used, as their use is not as detrimental to the environment as pesticides and are highly specific to insects. This experiment aims to define the trend in weight in the Manduca Sexta as an IGR is added in their food. The IGR used in this experiment is AzaGuard, consisting of 3% Azadirachtin, that prevents molting from larval to pupal and nymphal stages of insect development [BioSafe Systems.com]. IGRs, like AzaGuard, contain Juvenille Hormone, that keeps the insect from moving to the next stage of development.The goal of this procedure is to determine the effect of this IGR on the weight of the Manduca Sexta by adding AzaGuard to their food source, a pre-prepared basic caterpillar food. The expectation is that the group of the Manduca Sexta given the food mixed with AzaGuard will weigh less, as the IGR prohibits them from growing to the next stage of development. Knowing how this IGR affects growth and development is valuable information in that it may serve as an insecticide that may have more benefits than the pesticide. 

Overall, the goal if this experiment is to determine the affect of IGRs on insect development. If AzaGuard, an IGR, is added to the food given to the Manduca Sexta, then their weight will be lower than the controll group, as the IGR keeps them from moving to the next stages of development due to the Juvenille Hormone in the IGR. 


Materials and Method:
Materials 
•	AzaGuard
•	Caterpillar food
•	Spoons
•	4 round plastic containers (4 for the Manduca homes)
•	4 perforated lids
•	1 square container for mixing the food
•	Index cards and tape
•	Incubator
•	Scale


Method
1.	Obtain 4 round plastic containers and place an index card in each container, separating the it into two areas. Label each container as “Control/Treatment #1-4”.
2.	Weigh 80g of food and stir.
3.	Since there are 4 caterpillars getting the controll food, weigh 10g of food for each.
4.	With a transfer pipet, add 3-10 drops of distilled water to each 10g portion of food.
5.	Make sure that the food remains in a large clump, as it keeps the food from drying out.
6.	Place each 10g portion of food mixed with the distilled water in each controll area for each controll caterpillar in containers 1-4.
7.	Taking from the remaining food, weigh 10g of food for each treatment caterpillar. 
8.	With a clean transfer pipet, add 3-10 drops of the reagent, AzaGuard, to each 10g portion of food. 
9.	Place each 10g portion of food mixed with the reagent in each treatment area for each treatment caterpillar in containers 1-4. 
10.	Obtain 8 Manduca Sexta and weigh each of them. Record each weight in an organized table.
11.	After weighing each caterpillar, place one in each individual caterpillar home.
12.	Place them in the incubator.
13.	For the next 6 days, weigh each caterpillar and record its weight. 
•	To analyze this data, a T-test was used.

The P value calculated using the two-tailed T-test was 0.039.



Discussion:
In calculating the P value of the data set using a two-tailed T-test, it was determined that the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. A P-value of 0.039 allows us to reject the null and accept the alternate hypothesis that states that AzaGuard, the IGR added in the food given to the tobacco hornworms, does affect their development due to the presence of JH in the IGR. Studies show that the presence of IGRs prevent insects from moving forward to the next stages of development. The IGRs contain Juvenille Hormone, which is the hormone that prevents development [Rechcigl: 1999]. The results obtained in this experiment are consistent with the results of other published results. Although the results we obtained were consistent with other studies, there were a few problems related to the logistics of the experiment. During the week of data collection, there were several occasions on which we noticed the controll caterpillar climbed over the index card and onto the treatment side of the container. This means that the controll caterpillar may have eaten some of the treatment caterpillar’s food. On the last day of data collection, we realized that one of the treatment caterpillars, which had decreased in weight for the duration of the experiment, was eaten by the controll caterpillar. The controll caterpillar, as well as most of the other caterpillars, did not have enough food towards the end of the experiment, which is likely why it ate the smaller treatment caterpillar. 
	In order to confirm the role of IGRs on insect growth, more experiments need to be conducted. Perhaps with a variety of different insects, the effect may be different. With the Manduca Sexta, however, the results were consistent with previously conducted experiments.
