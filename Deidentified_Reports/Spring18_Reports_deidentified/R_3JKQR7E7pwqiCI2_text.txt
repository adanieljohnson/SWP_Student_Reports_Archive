Title: The Determination of the Optimal Wavelength of Red and Blue Light Compared to the Suboptimal Green Light

Abstract:
Photosynthesis produces the energy needed for a plant to grow through redox reactions in the thylakoid membrane. There are many factors that affect the photosynthetic rate of plants. In this experiment, we studied the effect of different types of light on the photosynthetic rate of spinach. The types of light that we analyzed look directly at blue, red and green lights with varying wavelengths. We hypothesized that the red and blue lights would be the optimal wavelength for photosynthetic rate compared to green light. We were able to conclude that there was a significent difference in the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts of red and blue light versus the green light. Thus, making it clear that the wavelength of red and blue light is optimal for photosynthesis compared to the suboptimal green light. Additionally, the trend of the absorbance over the 30-minute time period at each 10 minute trial decreased compared to the initial absorbance calculated. This decrease in the absorption of the enriched chloroplasts ultimately causes an increase the photosynthetic rate. Overall, this study displays the need for further studies or research on the effect of wavelengths and type of light on the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the energy generating process that occurs in the thylakoid portion of the chloroplasts of a plant cell. Photosynthetic rate or more generally plant growth is greatly affected by a variety of factors. The particular factor that we are aiming to investigate is the overall effect of the variation of wavelengths on the photosynthetic rate of the chlorophyll present in spinach. Spinach is utilized as the model system in this particular experiment due to the fact that it is cheap, easy to access and possesses a significent amount of chloroplasts. Light, overall, plays an instrumental role in the functionality of the photosystems in the thylakoid membrane due to the fact that it excites the electrons in photosystem II, which propels the rate of photosynthesis in plants, like spinach. Overall, the over-exposure to light sources can inhibit and have a widely negative effect on the process of photosynthesis by causing the hindrance of the function of photosystem II (Li, 132). 
 In this lab, the photosynthetic rate of spinach plants or chlorophyll was tested in various different lighting environments. The mechanism that we are aiming to manipulate is the based on the color of lights seen at varied wavelengths and its relationship to rate of photosynthesis. Variations in light intensity or wavelength have an effect on the functionality of the photosystems responsible for photosynthesis, particularly in photosystem II (Li, 132). Based on this idea, we distinguished that the types of light that should be observed were green, blue and red due to the fact that they all possess distinct wavelengths. The reason that these specific light sources were chosen was to display the absorbance of the chlorophyll at varying wavelengths. The red light possesses the approximate wavelength of about 630 nm, the blue light has the wavelength range of roughly 470 nm (Sahin, 1). Finally, green light has the wavelength of about 510 nm (Johkan, 128). Using all of the wavelengths, the absorbance of the DCPIP reduced in the enriched chloroplasts is measured and analyzed. The presence of DCPIP allows for the effects of various herbicides and other photosynthetic rate altering factors to be interpreted. DCPIP is also known as the electron acceptor of the process of photosynthesis and therefore plays a key role in photo inhibition, which occurs within photosystem II and thus allows for explicit observation of the Hill Reaction (Ramalho, 320). 
	Based on all of the information above, we were able to form a well-informed conclusion or hypothesis that allowed us to investigate the following questions about our topic: what is the optimal wavelength of light for the photosynthetic rate of spinach (chlorophyll) and which of these three types of light has the largest effect on the photosynthetic rate of spinach. Our hypothesis was that the photosynthetic rate of spinach varied for red and blue light compared to green light. Additionally, we hypothesized that the red and blue lights would be the optimal wavelengths for the photosynthetic rate of the spinach and the green wavelength will be the suboptimal wavelength.  Overall, we predicted that the effect or the percent change of the absorbance of the test tubes would decrease at a relatively steady rate as time continues.


Materials and Method:
The model of spinach leaves was used to test the varied effects of light on the photosynthetic rate. This spinach was obtained, washed carefully and removed from their central veins. The spinach was kept in an environment of 0-5 degrees Celsius prior to the experiment. Once all of materials were cooled properly, the spinach was put into the mortar and pestle then 10 Ml of the grinding buffer was added. The spinach was then grinded with the grinding buffer into a “slurry”. Then, another 10 Ml grinding buffer was added to the “slurry”. Following the addition of the second 10 Ml of grinding buffer, the liquid was placed into a tube then centrifuged for the first time at 200 x G in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes 4oC. After the initial centrifuge, the supernatant was poured out into another tube. Then, the same tube was centrifuged a second time at 1,000 x G in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant produced from the second centrifuge was poured into another tube and then was placed on ice to cool. While this tube cooled, 10 test tubes were filled with 100 microliters of the enriched chloroplasts to begin the Hill Assay. Then, 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP (130 mM) and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH = 6.5) were placed into each tube. The 1st of the tubes that was made was a blank, which possessed everything above but the active ingredient (DCPIP). Once all of the components above were added, the test tubes were put into spectrophotometer cuvettes and placed in their respective light environments. The first three test tubes were placed in green light, the next three test tubes were placed in blue light and the final three test tubes were put into red light. All of the above light bulbs were 13 watt bulbs. Each cuvette was left in their environment for 10 minutes then the absorbance was measured at 600 nm, making sure to blank the spectrophotometer between light groups. This process of measurement was repeated 3 times in total until the absorbance over a 30 minute time period could be analyzed. Finally, after all of the trials were performed the percent change was determined across each 10 minute trial by subtracting the initial absorbance from the absorbance after each 10 minute trial and dividing that value by the initial absorbance and multiplying that entire value by 100. Additionally, a one-tailed t test was performed by comparing the red light versus the green light and the red light versus the blue light, with a critical value of .05. 

Results:
The trend of the average percent change each of the enriched chloroplast samples across of all the trials shows the variation in absorbance across the three trials. The absorbance in red light, green and blue light can all be seen to have alterations in their percent changes. Specifically, red light clearly possessing the largest percent change, followed by green then blue. Overall, in a more general sense, the absorption of the enriched chloroplasts decreased across all 3 trials. The mean of the data for the red light after 30 minutes was 25.83 and the standard deviation for the same data was 33.94. Additionally, for the green data the mean was 9.60 and the standard deviation was 25.27. The statistical test used to compare the red light to the green light was a one-tailed t test, which yielded the results t(4)= 3.63, p = .011. For the comparison of red light to blue light after the 30 minute time period, the results yielded t(4)= 3.94, p =.0085 after a one tailed t test was interpreted. For the blue data after 30 minutes, the mean was 7.25 and the standard deviation was 32.11. 

Discussion:
It is reasonable to conclude that our hypothesis was supported due to the fact that the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts was higher in blue and red light versus green light. Our hypothesis stated that there the photosynthetic rate of spinach in the blue and red light was optimal compared to the suboptimal green light. Overall, as time continued on the absorbance of the enriched chloroplasts decreased, thus leading to the conclusion that the DCPIP absorbance is inversely proportional trend-wise to the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts. In other words, as absorbance goes down, the photosynthetic rate of the enriched chloroplasts increases.  A particular study that emphasizes our findings studied the effects of varied wavelengths of green light specifically in lettuce. This study concluded overall that the wavelength of green light is not absorbed well by chlorophylls, which were found extensively in the green coloring of plants (Johkan, 128). This summarizes the idea that as a result of the green light being reflected by the spinach plant, it likely will not be absorbed an extensive amount compared to red, white and blue light either combined or individually, which absorbs more light (Johkan, 128). Although this study did not use different types of light, it still helps to emphasize our overall hypothesis, that there is a significent difference in the photosynthetic rate of plants that are exposed to light at different wavelengths. Next, another study that could also strengthen our point looked directly at the combination of red and blue light and determined that they have the highest impact on plant growth due to that fact that they are resources for photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation (Lin, 87).  The possible errors that could be found throughout this experiment could be seen through the health and age of the spinach plant. If they were older or unhealthy plants, it would have a negative effect on the results of the experiment overall due to the fact that it could affect the ability of the spinach to absorb and reflect varied types of light. This could cause skewing in the overall data of the experiment. Additionally, it is possible that the varied types of wattage of light bulbs could cause variation due to the fact that not every plant is experiencing the same type of light intensity in addition to the variation of the wavelengths. There are a variety of different studies that could expand this topic of study. One possible future study could be using a different plant as opposed to spinach or continuing using different types of light at various wavelengths. Additionally, it is possible to collect absorbance for longer than 30 minutes, which could give us a broader time period to analyze and interpret the effects of altered wavelengths of light. Overall, these findings show that the type of light plays a key role in the photosynthetic rate of plants due to the fact that the light reaction portion of the process photosynthesis is dependent on light. Moreover, the varied wavelength of lights has an extensive impact on the functionality of the process of photosynthesis in plants based on the findings of this experiment.
