Title: An Increase in Juvenile Hormone Has Limited Effect on the Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we explored how an increase in Juvenile hormone affects the weight of the hornworm caterpillars. Manduca Sexta is an insect found in Order Lepidoptera which has 5 stages of instar as a lava. A commitment pulse signals the molting from a larva to a pupa. The occur commitment pulse is controlled indirectly by level of growth hormone JH and directly by the level of ecdysterone.  Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) affects the level of growth hormone (juvenile hormone) in order control the growth of insects. It can either interfere or over-active JH level. In this experiment, we use Precor chemical to maintain JH level high before the commitment pulse. Study of IGR can help the regulating of the pests by keeping the pests in harmless larva state or accelerate them to grow into the harmless state. Our hypothesis is an increase of Juvenile hormone would cause a significant difference in the weight of the hornworm caterpillars. This hypothesis is not supported by the result of this experiment as there is no statistically significant difference (P-value=0.09) between the change of weight of Manduca Sexta caterpillars treated with and without JH-increasing IGR. Our next step is to explore how does an increase in Juvenile hormone affect the time caterpillars take to molt into

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect found in Order Lepidoptera area. As a lava, it has 5 stages of instar. After 19 to 23 days, it would turn into a pupa. This process is controlled by the amount of Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone drops significantly while Eyestone rises slightly at the end of stage four of instar. This would lead to a commitment pulse. Black lines on the back of a caterpillar indicate the start to commitment pulse. After the commitment pulse, JH would continue to drop while Eyestone would rise significantly [Johnson: 2018]. This first minor pulse of ecdysone causes a larva to stop feeding and enter the wandering stage. This pulse also tells the polymorphic epidermis to stop producing a nymphal or larval cuticle but only an adult cuticle. Thus, during the growth of Manduca sectas, ecdysterone controls the body size directly as its secretion results in the stop of growth. On the other hand, JH hormone controls body size indirectly. Because the sudden decrease of JH hormone marks the stop of growth [Nijhout: 2013]. Growth Regulator (IGR) is a kind of chemical which controls the growing process of insects, either slowing down or speeding up, by influencing the hormone level [Johnson: 2018]. According to previous researches, IGR can be used to control body size by controlling cessation and growth rate of insects. For Maduca sextas, insulin and ecdysterone are the principal genetic regulators of growth. The secretion of these hormones are controlled by complex interactions of other endocrine and molecular mechanisms. The physiological mechanisms that sense body size and some external environmental factors such as nutrition work together to complete this interaction [Nijhout: 2013]. In this experiment, we want to find out how hormone secretion play a part in the growth rate of Maduca sextas. Basing on that, we want to find out if a change in growth rate would result in a difference in body size. Our hypothesis is, an

Materials and Methods:
We separated eight Manduca extas into two groups, the control group and the treatment group. The four caterpillars in the control groups are supplied with 10 grams of normal food without IGR chemicals. The four caterpillars in the treatment groups are supplied with same amount of food with  To start with, we weighted the starting weight of each Manduca Sexta. We recorded the weight and observed the physical appearance of Manduca Sexta every day during the following seven days. We added normal food and treated food to the container on daily base. All treatment and control groups were separated and placed in a large container with a stable temperature of 23 degrees Celsius. After seven days, we compared the change in weight of each groups. We applied a two-sample T-test to evaluate if there exists a significant difference. If the resulting p-value is smaller than 0.05, there exists a significant difference between the weight of Manduca Sextas treated with and without an increase of Juvenile hormone. Our hypothesis would be supported. If the resulting p-value is not smaller than 0.05, there exists no significant difference between the weight of Manduca Sextas treated with and without an increase of Juvenile hormone. Our hypothesis would not be supported. 

Results:
After seven days, we recorded the final weights of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The control group 1caterpillar is an outliner. The difference of its weight is -0.38, which is different from the significant growth of other control group caterpillars. Thus, this data is neglected for the statistic test. Referring to figure 1, the average change in weight of control group is 8.2333 (+/- 2.2744) and the average change in weight of treatment group is 8.3625 (+/- 1.2967). The resulting p-value from the t-test is 0.09, which is greater than 0.05, indicating that there exists no significant difference. Figure 2 and figure 3 record the physical appearance of caterpillars at the end of this experiment. According to our observation, control group caterpillars appeared darker green while the treatment group caterpillars appeared lighter green. There are clear black lines on the back of control group caterpillars. Treatment group caterpillar 3 and 4 have no black lines on their backs. Treatment group 1 and 2 have vague black lines on their backs. 

Discussion:
Since there is no statistically significant difference in the change in weight of Manduca Sexta caterpillars treated with or without JH substance IGR, our hypothesis that an increase of Juvenile hormone would cause a significant difference in the weight of the hornworm caterpillars is not supported by the result of this experiment. We predict that it might because the subjects are not fully exposed to IGR. The amount of IGR is not significant enough to cause a difference in weight change. Yet, according to the observation on the physical appearance of subjects, there exists a difference in appearances.According to the previous research, the expose to IGR in the environment in long-term would cause a ill effects of insect growth [Saha, 2016]. Between treatment group and controlled group. The black lines on the back of caterpillars serve as an indicator of occurring of commitment pulse. Thus, we predict that an increase in JH hormone does affect the growth of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. To prove that, we would extend our experiment period longer to compare the time it takes for caterpillars treated with or without IGR to molt into a pupa.

Figure Legends: Figure 1. The bar chart includes the average weight change of the control group and the treatment group. The standard deviation is shown on the graph. The weight of the treatment groups is slightly higher on average.   Figure 2. This figure is the final observation of the control group. The color of the caterpillars appears to be green. There are clear lines on the back of caterpillars, indicating the pass of commitment pulse.   Figure 3. This figure is the final observation of the treatment group. The color of the caterpillars appears to be lighter green, comparing to the control group. There are no black lines on the back of subject 3 and subject 4, indicating they have not entered the commitment pulse. There are vague black lines on the back of subject 1 and subject 2, indicating an incomplete commitment pulse.
