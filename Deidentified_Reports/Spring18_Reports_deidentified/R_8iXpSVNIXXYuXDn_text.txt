Title: The effects of Martin's IGR, a juvenile hormone mimic, on the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Ecdysone and juvenile hormone are important in regulating molting and metamorphosis in the life cycle of Manduca sexta. At the end of the 4th instar, a spike in ecdysone launches the larva towards pupation due to the low levels of juvenile hormone that are present. In this experiment, Martin's IGR, which is a mimic to juvenile hormone, is used to evaluate the effects of hormone on the development of the caterpillar. It was hypothesized that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar will prohibit proper development and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph, and this rejected. The Manduca treated with Martin's IGR grew similarly to the controll group. Additionally, one caterpillar from each group molted so there were ultimately no differences seen with the application of Martin's IGR.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are pests present in much of the American continent and are used in a variety of biological scientific experiments due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle of only 38-48 days [Johnson: 2018]. Within this short holometabolous cycle, they go through four major life stages: egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. Manduca sexta has five larval instars, which are separated by molting. Insect development and the emergence of adults are controllled mainly by two hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysone [Johnson:2018]. During insect development, ecdysone regulates the timing of molting and juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt [Johnson: 2018].

Up to the fourth larval instar, JH levels stay fairly high. During the fifth larva instar, JH levels drop very low. Additionally, there is a small rise in ecdysone, called the commitment pulse. It is produced when the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018]. This is the first time in the caterpillar's life so far that it has been exposed to rising ecdysone and very low JH simultaneously.

Insect growth regulator ultimately interferes with the normal function of the corpus allatum- the organ responsible for secreting JH [Johnson: 2018]. Researchers observed that cultures of linden bug had low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults [Tunaz: 2004]. Their investigations traced the abnormality to the paper towels used in the rearing jars. Ultimately the cause was found to be juvabione, an IGR compound produced by balsam fir trees, which were the primary pulp tree in the US at the time. This discovery led to industrial interest in IGRs as possible alternatives to broadly toxic insecticides. In this experiment, increased amounts of Martin's IGR will be added to the diet of Manduca sexta. It is hypothesized that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar in the Manduca sexta will prohibit proper development and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph (or 6th instar).


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta were selected that were about to enter the 5th instar weighing 2.6 to 3.9 grams. Four caterpillars were placed in either the experimental or the controll group. The experimental group received 10 grams of food every other day with 3 drops of Martin's IGR. The controll group received 10 grams of regular food with 3 drops of water. All eight caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 23 Â°C in 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light. Every day for seven days, the weight and length of each caterpillar was recorded. A two-sample t_test was carried out to compare the means from the weight and lengths of the controll group and the treatment group.

Results:
The weight of the caterpillars in the controll and treatment group were very similar on days 1,2, and 3 but the weight of the treatment group started to decrease on day 5 while the controll caterpillars grew larger (Fig. 1). On day 7, there was not a statistical significance between the weight of the caterpillars of both groups (t_stat=0.44, p- value=0.68). This pattern can similarly be seen in the length of the caterpillars as well. Around day 4, the treatment caterpillars decreased in length while the controll caterpillars continued to increase in length (Fig. 2). The length of the caterpillars for both groups were similar (t_stat=0.26, p- value=0.81).  

Discussion:
The results revealed that the experimental data between the weight and length of the treatment group and the controll group was not a large enough difference to determine if Martin's IGR had any effect on the caterpillars. The hypothesis cannot be accepted as increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar did not impact the development of the caterpillar. One possible reason there is not a significent difference is due to the fact that the caterpillars only received Martin's IGR for a period of one week. In order to draw conclusions on the impact of the hormone on the caterpillars, more time might be needed to determine if there was an effect. Another possible explanation relates to the amount of Martin's IGR that was given to the treatment group over the course of the experiment. Only 0.3% of Martin's IGR was added to 10 grams of food which is a rather low dosage. If the dosage was increased, then a larger effect could have been seen in the treatment group. Riddiford and Beckage [1982] looked at the effects of methoprene, a juvenile hormone mimic similar to Martin's IGR, on the emergence and metamorphosis of the endoparsitic wasp, Apenteles congregates. They found that methoprene treatment inhibited wasp emergence in a dose-dependent manner, causing either a delay or total inhibition of emergence. This study confirms that an IGR mimic of juvenile hormone can impact the development and growth of insects. Furthermore, the description of a "total inhibition of emergence" suggests that a supernumerary nymph could be possible since the hormone disrupted the normal growth of the insect. Further studies are needed to determine if an insect growth regulator could in fact produce a supernumerary 6th instar insect.
