Title: How Do Higher Concentrations of E20 Affect the Growth of Manduca sexta? 

Abstract:
E20, or ecdysterone, is one of the three main hormones that dictates insect development in relation to moltings, or eclosions. E20 directly affects the timing of those eclosions. Manduca sexta are easily studied organisms due to their size and ease of care, and were chosen for this study. In this experiment, we measured the mean weight of a controll group of Manduca sexta against an experimental group that received supplemental E20 over a period of seven days. At the end of the week, the mean weights from both groups were taken and analyzed. We hypothesized that the experimental group receiving the E20 would have a slower growth rate than those receiving normal formula. The t_test ran against the data provided a p_value of .0130001, which was significent enough to accept our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Insect development and their transition from stage to stage (marked by eclosions, or molts) are heavily influenced by different hormones. Some of these hormones include JH (juvenile hormone) and E20 (ecdysterone), and they influence different aspects of development. While JH monitors the molt type of Manduca sexta and other insects, E20 afts the molt timing. E20 often works at a peak timing of development, prompting the organism to transition into another eclosion [Vandock, Drummond, Smith, Fioravanti : 2010]. The altering of these hormones could hypothetically alter the different molts of Manduca sexta. The purpose of this experiment was to see how increasing the presence of E20 would affect the growth of Manduca sexta over a week. We predicted that the Manduca sexta group receiving increased E20 in their diet would have a stunted group in comparison to the group receiving a standard diet. 


Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta larvae were separated into two groups of four organisms each: controll (fed a standard formula) and experimental (fed a formula supplemented with high levels of E20). Each larvae had half a container of habitat to occupy. The larvae were fed their respective formulas and weighed daily for a week. Per daily feeding, the controll group of Manduca sexta received 10 grams of formula with 7 drops of water ; the experimental group of larvae received 10 grams of formula with 7 drops of AZAMAX (E20 formula). At the end of the week, the caterpillars’ measurements were taken for a final time to be analyzed. One caterpillar from the controll group was eliminated from the data due to extreme outlier, and one caterpillar from the experimental group was eliminated from the date because it escaped its habitat. 


Results:
The average weight for the controll group of Manduca sexta (fed with a formula without E20)  was progressively much higher than the average weight for the experimental group of Manduca sexta (fed with a formula containing E20 to influence timing of molting). The end mean weight for the controll group was 9.52 grams as opposed to the end mean weight of 1.93 grams for the experimental group. A t_test was run on the means. The t- value was reported at 2.48884;  the p_value was reported at .013001, which was significent enough to accept our hypothesis that the increase of E20 to the Manduca sexta would negatively affect their growth. 


Discussion:
The p_value of .013001 was easily low enough to conclude that the presence of increased E20 in Manduca sexta affects the larval growth. This is potentially due to E20’s purpose of controllling the different molts/exclusions of larval development; an imbalance in this hormone could easily trigger irregular growth rates and measures. Although other hormones, such as PTTH (prothoracicotropic) are present in insect development, the significance in these findings of Manduca sexta are enough to conclude that a proper balance of E20 is vital for proper growth in Manduca sexta [Vandock, Mitchell, Fioravanti : 2012]. Future studies could test the effects of other hormones besides E20 such as PTTH or juvenile hormone (JH); altering the habitat, i.e. testing Manduca sexta growth against different temperatures would also be an interesting study to help us further understand the process of insect development, molting, and adulthood development.
