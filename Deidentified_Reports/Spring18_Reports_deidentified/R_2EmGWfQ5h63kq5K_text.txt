Title: Behavioral patterns of blue male Betta splendins towards red male Betta splendins in the presence of a red environment 

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins present agnostic behaviors towards other male Betta splendins in order to fight for a mate. Some fish will seem brighter than others, especially due to their surrounding environments, which would result in more aggressive behaviors. This experiment tests the hypothesis that fish that have less of a contrast in color to their relative environment will be seen as less of a threat, and therefore other fish will not exhibit behaviors as aggressive as one would see in an environment that contrasts from the color of the fish. Blue and red male Betta splendins were used, where the behaviors of the blue fish was observed in response to red fish in both clear water and water dyed red. A paired t_test was used to differentiate between the behavioral responses in clear water and red water, and was tested to see if there was a significent difference between the two. Results showed that there was no statistical difference between the behaviors of the fish when they saw a red male in a contrasting environment versus a similar colored environment. Therefore, it was concluded that there must be another factor that allows for aggressive behaviors to be exhibited between Betta splendins. 

Introduction:
Behavioral habits between individuals can be observed to determine a pattern in the way that species interact with members of the same species, and also with different species. The interactions between members of the same species is known as intraspecific behavior [Johnson: 2018]. Betta splendins exhibit unique agnostic behaviors towards one another in order to acquire a mate. Male Betta splendins are known for their aggressiveness towards each other, which usually results in fighting [Britannica: 2007]. However, these fish express other behaviors as a warning before fighting. They will alternate between displaying broadside movements (where the fish is lateral to its opponent) and facing movements (where the fish faces the opponent head-on) [Robertson: 1975]. Behaviors are specific to either broadside or facing movements, because there are no intermediate displays [Robertson: 1975]. Broadside movements can be characterized by flickering of the pelvic fin and tail beating, which refers to the quick movement of the pelvic or caudal fin. A prime behavior of facing movements is called the ‘red mane’. This is seen when spreads its opercula and displays a red membrane [Robertson: 1975]. A male Betta splenden will most likely exhibit these traits due to their agnostic tendencies towards one another.  	Previous experiments have shown correlation between pigmentation and brightness of color to attract different mates. On average, female Betta splendins are more likely to choose a red male over a blue male [Clotfelter: 2007]. This could cause blue male Betta splendins to see red males as a greater threat. Also, there could be a correlation as to why red males are chosen over blue males. The red males may seem brighter in contrast to clear water, which will also sometimes give off a bluish tint. Since red males contrast in the color of their environment more than blue males, a blue male that sees a red male in a red environment will display less aggressive behaviors because the fish no longer contrasts with its environment to look as brightly colored. This experiment plans to challenge this idea and see if there is a correlation relative to the contrast in color from the environment of the fish. 


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, different agnostic behaviors will be quantified by calculating the frequency of occurences of broadside and facing movements each minute for five minute intervals. This experiment uses Betta splendins in their respective tanks and uses a glass and removable opaque barrier to separate the fish. Specifically, red and blue male fish are used. The behaviors of the blue fish are observed in their reaction to red fish. Three behaviors are observed: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and presence of a red mane. Three blue fish were observed for five minutes each in clear water. The observing period started when the opaque barrier was removed between the red and blue fish. It is important that the glass barrier is not removed so that the fish cannot fight one another. The frequency of each behavior was recorded each minute during the five minute interval. After the fish had been observed in clear water, a drop of red dye was added to the water, that was similar in color to the red fish. The reactions of the blue fish in response to red fish was then measured again for the three fish for five minutes and results were recorded. A paired t_test was used for each behavior to see if there was a significent difference between the fish when in clear water versus when in red water.


Results:
The results showed that there was no significent difference between the blue fish’s reaction to a red fish in clear water in comparison to the same fish in red water. The pelvic fin flickering had a P-value of 0.68, the tail beating had a P-value of 0.06, and the red mane had a P-value of 0.78.


Discussion:
The results showed that on average, both broadside and facing behaviors had a higher rate of frequency per minute when the fish were in clear water than when they were in red water. However, the paired t_test for all three behaviors showed that there is no significent evidence to conclude that these behaviors were more present when the fish were in clear water. This was because all of the P-values were above 0.05 (pelvic fin flickering had a P-value of 0.68; tail beating had a P-value of 0.06; the red mane had a P-value of 0.78), which therefore means that the null hypothesis is accepted. Even though all values were above 0.05, the P-value for the frequency of tail beats per minute was very close to the 0.05 value. It would be beneficial to test more fish and their reaction to red Betta splendins in red water so that there would be an average across a larger group of fish. While this experiment focused on looking at the contrast in color relative to the surrounding environment of the fish, there seems to be more of a correlation relative to colors of the fish in general, disregarding their environment. Also, the scale of how bright or dull a specific fish is does not seem to matter as much as the actual color of the fish does [Grabowski: 1968]. This suggests that there must be other variables that contribute to these behaviors other than how bright a fish is in comparison to its surroundings.  The behavioral patterns between Betta splendins is of relevance because it shows what features of a specific fish make it more intimidating to another fish, which results in more agnostic behaviors. These tendencies are not only found in Betta splendins, but many other species where males must compete for females. Different factors contribute to more aggressive behaviors in various species, but similarities remain, such as females mating with the larger and brighter males [Auld: 2016].
