Title: Effects of Tide-Free and Gentle Detergent on Spinach and Chard Lead to Reduction of Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is significent as it produces a by-product (oxygen) that is fundamental for much of the life on Earth. In this study, photosynthetic reduction through household pollutants (specifically Tide-Free and Gentle) was the focus of study through Spinach and Chard. This experiment strove to determine whether or not Tide detergent would significently reduce photosynthetic activity in spinach and chard considering the detergent is consistently polluting the environment. In carrying out this experiment, a Hill reaction assay was used to treat chard and spinach chloroplast samples with 10% and 20% diluted detergent. Absorbance values were recorded at ten minute intervals over a total period of thirty minutes. Overall, all of the values generated from the experiment where statistically insignificent. However, at 10% diluted detergent, chard produced values closer to the critical values we sought out throughout this experiment. In refining this experiment to reach statistically significent values, we plan to measure the relative chloroplast density of each sample before proceeding through with the experiment. We plan to do this by examining each of the chloroplast sources under phase optics through the use of a hemocytometer.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. This process involves the green pigment chlorophyll which helps generate oxygen as a byproduct. Oxygen is essential for many organisms living on Earth; including the human race. However, advancements in technology have led to the production of various pollutants, which harm the environment in many ways, including the disruption of plant life, processes, and therefore photosynthesis. In a 2010 report, Jovanic carried out an experiment where he investigated the effects of laundry detergent (a common household washing product) on bean leaves [Jovanic, 2010]. After twenty-one days of treating (watering) bean leaves with a solution, which had been combined with laundry detergent, the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus in the dosed leaf plant was less than 45% when compared to the controll (leaves that were not treated with the water/detergent solution [Jovanic, 2010]. We planned to carry-out a similar experiment where we would measure the effects that laundry detergent has on photosynthesis. In order to conduct the experiment, we obtained two types of plant leaves which we used to obtain enriched chloroplasts. The two plants studied were derived from spinach (Spinacia Oleraceam) and chard (Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris). The chloroplasts were treated with “Tide-Free and Gentle” laundry detergent at a diluted 10% and 20% and then compared to a controll group (no detergent added). We used the Hill Reaction in order to determine the rate of photosynthesis carried out by the chloroplasts (we measured absorbance change).  We conducted the experiment with the following hypothesis in mind, if the plants are treated with the Tide laundry detergent, then they will experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Method:
Spinach and chard chloroplasts were isolated by centrifuging twice (200 x G, 4oC, 3 min and 1000 x G, 4oC, 10 min respectively). The enriched chloroplast sample was then used to prepare for the Hill reaction assay and treated with 10% and 20% diluted laundry detergent solutions while the controll group was treated without laundry detergent or chloroplasts from either species. The treatments containing laundry detergent were also prepared with 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130Mm DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 Mm) and phosphate (pH-6.5). After each treatment was prepared, they were placed in a spectrophotometer for measuring absorbance at 600 nm. The absorbance of each treatment was measured at an interval of 10 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. The absorbance values were converted to percent change with the formula-- v1- v0/v0 x 100 where v0 denotes original value and v1 denotes new value. Finally, a two-sample t_test was performed to analyze the extent to which photosynthesis was inhibited in each of the plant species after having been exposed to 10% and 20% diluted detergent by analyzing percent change in DCPIP absorbance. 


Results:
After running the assay, there was a decrease in photosynthetic activity from the treatment of chard and spinach at 10% diluted detergent. During the 30 minutes that the assay was conducted (10 minute intervals) there was a slight increase in absorbance (and therefore a reduction of photosynthetic activity throughout the spinach and chard chloroplasts that were mixed with 10% detergent. For example, the spinach chloroplasts mixed with 10% detergent saw an increase in absorbance by 6.5% from 10 to 20 minutes as shown in Figure 1. 
Although all the treatments showed no statistically significent data, the p values for chard were closer to the critical values (p_values— 0.23 (10 mins), 0.24 (20mins), 0.22 (30 mins) as opposed to spinach (0.87 (10 mins), 0.70 (20mins) 0.60 (30mins) as shown in Figure 1 for 10% treatment.


Discussion:
The collected data in this experiment does support our original hypothesis, which states that polluting the spinach and chard with Tide would decrease photosynthetic activity.  However, because our data is considered statistically insignificent, we cannot reject our null hypothesis. However, although insignificent, each experimental group at 10% detergent (spinach and chard) did produce data that supports the idea that the detergent did inhibit photosynthetic activity, which is aligned with Jovanic‘s work which demonstrates that bean plants were impacted by a decrease in photosynthetic activity after being treated with detergent polluted water [Jovanic, 2010]. Also, as expressed in the results section, chard produced much smaller p_values as opposed to spinach, which points towards this species as being the best candidate for proving that there is inhibition of photosynthesis in plants through the exposure to laundry detergent. After refining the method used in this experiment and rerunning the experiment, chard could produce values, which are statistically significent. The reasons as to why the values produced in this experiment are insignificent may have come about for a number of reasons. For one, there could have been procedural error in isolating the chloroplasts from the leaves, which were responsible for reflecting the effects of the detergent on photosynthesis. Measuring for relative chloroplast density of each sample by examining each of these under phase optics through the use of a hemocytometer could ensure that the effects of the detergent are accurately accounted for. Aside from this, it is also likely that when preparing the test tube solutions and assay, the apparatus used to measure the liquids were defective on account of air bubbles and could have therefore, lead to inaccurate measurements. This leads us to the limitations of the experiment as well. For example, the experiment only tested one type of detergent at 10% and 20%. Increasing the concentration of the detergent could have produced conditions more similar to those of the environment. Also, testing a single type (brand) of detergent is a great limitation to our experiment as there are thousands of detergent types that pollute the environment, which may affect photosynthetic processes differently considering they contain different components. Testing a greater variety of plants would also aid in expanding this experiment as different plants could be affected very differently by such a pollutant, which may not be reflected by the effects on spinach and chard. In proposing ideas for future studies, it might be beneficial to test the effects of other pollutants on photosynthetic activity. This could include testing for photosynthetic reduction in various plant species as a result of chloroform (a by-product produced by disinfectant chemicals). Such experiments could aid in determining how advancements in technology affect our environment.
