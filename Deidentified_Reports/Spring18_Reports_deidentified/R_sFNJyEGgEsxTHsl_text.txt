Title: The Effect of Lidocaine Injection on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Sodium channels are essential in the process of excitation-contraction coupling in muscles. Lidocaine, an anesthetic, serves as an inhibitor of these crucial channels. The hypothesis was that if Lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, it will inhibit the voltage-gated sodium channels in the tissue, preventing depolarization, action potential production, calcium release, and ultimately muscle contraction. A force transducer was used to apply stimulus to the gastrocnemus muscle and record myograms of the muscle’s response both prior to and post injection; the amplitude of the standard contraction responses of the muscle were then recorded. A paired t_test was performed using these averaged values. There is statistically significent evidence suggesting that the standard contraction amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens prior to injection of Lidocaine is greater than the standard contraction amplitude post injection of Lidocaine (p = 0.018593). The injection of Lidocaine decreased the muscle’s standard contraction significently due to the blockage of voltage-gated sodium ion channels in muscle tissue. 

Introduction:
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscle consists of hundreds to thousands of myofibers bound together by connective tissue to form muscles proper. Axons of motor neurons, which innervate these muscles, extend into a muscle and branch out to then innervate several individual myofibers at neuromuscular junctions. Through the process of excitation-contraction coupling, a nerve stimulates muscle contraction. To monitor what is happening at the macroscopic level of an entire muscle or nerve, a myogram is recorded by attaching a muscle to a force transducer [Johnson: 2018]. Both physical properties and chemical environments in an around a muscle affect its contractile properties. Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential in the generation and propagation of action potentials in tissues, and it is necessary that these channels function to initiate action potentials in order for muscle contraction to occur [Simkin: 2011]. If these sodium channels are blocked, depolarization will not occur; thus, no action potential will be produced. When an action potential reaches the axon terminal, the voltage-dependent calcium channels open and calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, triggering muscle contraction [Koch: 1990]. These studies both found that the blockage of the voltage-gated calcium channels in skeletal muscle cells reduced the muscle’s ability to contract; therefore, we were interested in whether or not blocking this signal earlier along the pathway by inhibiting the sodium channels would have a similar effect. Rania pipiens, the northern leopard frog, is typically 2-4 inches in length and is green or greenish-brown. This species possesses a gastrocnemus muscle, of which the sciatic nerve runs through, in each of its hind legs. Lidocaine, an anesthetic, is known to inhibit the sodium channels in muscles; therefore, the hypothesis is that if Lidocaine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, then the sodium channels will be inhibited, preventing depolarization, action potential production, calcium release, and ultimately muscle contraction. This will cause the standard muscle contraction amplitude to decrease in Rania pipiens after the injection of Lidocaine.

Materials and Method:
The Labscribe3 software by iWorx was first installed. Two Rania pipiens legs were obtained. Each Rania pipiens leg was then degloved, the sciatic nerve was exposed, and the gastrocnemus muscle was detached. The gastrocnemus muscle was suspended from a Force Transducer, using strings and pins to tie and hold it down, and two probes were then attached to the muscle. Two different trials were executed. The first muscle was stimulated with 2.0 volts prior to injection -- the amplitude of the muscle’s standard contraction on the myogram was then measured three times and the mean was calculated. Then, 1.0 Ml of 25 mM Lidocaine was injected and five minutes were waited before taking another three measurements of muscle contraction amplitude to calculate the mean amplitude of the standard muscle contraction post-injection. This process was repeated on the second gastrocnemus muscle, except 0.5 volts were used as stimulus.

Results:
On average, the standard muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens decreased significently after being injected with Lidocaine. The mean standard contraction amplitude of the first trial muscle, stimulated by 2.0 volts, was 0.221 +/- 0.0146 volts prior to the injection of Lidocaine and 0.089 +/- 0.0164 post injection of Lidocaine (Fig. 1). These are the averages and standard deviations using the three measurements of standard contraction amplitude prior to and after the injection of Lidocaine stimulated with 2.0 volts. The mean standard contraction amplitude of the second trial muscle, with a 0.5 volt stimulus, was 0.638 +/- 0.00624 prior to and post-injection of Lidocaine was 0.013 +/- 0.001 volts (Fig. 1). These are the averages and standard deviations using the three measurements of standard contraction amplitude prior to and after the injection of Lidocaine stimulated with 0.5 volts.  Overall, the mean  standard contraction amplitude of both of the trial muscles before injection was 0.4297 +/- 0.2284 and after injection was 0.051 +/- 0.0429 (Fig. 1). These averages and standard deviations were calculated using all six measurements of standard contraction amplitude prior to and after Lidocaine injection from both trials/legs. The p_value determined by the paired t_test was 0.018593, the t-value was 3.432099, and there were 5 degrees of freedom (Fig. 1). 

Discussion:
There is statistically significent evidence suggesting that the standard contraction amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle Rania pipiens prior to injection of Lidocaine is greater than the standard contraction amplitude post injection of Lidocaine; the null hypothesis that these results were due to normal chance was able to be rejected (p = 0.018593). The alternate hypothesis was supported, as the amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle’s standard contraction significently decreased after it was injected with Lidocaine. This is likely due to the fact that voltage-gated sodium channels, which are essential in triggering action potentials, are blocked. These channels must function properly in order for muscle contraction to occur because they initiate the process of depolarization, which leads to action potentials, the release of calcium ions, and ultimately, muscle contraction [Simkin: 2011], [Koch: 1990]. A similar study examined the effects of various volatile anesthetics on mammalian sodium channels [Herold: 2012]. The inhibition of the channels and their stabilization of the inactivated state of these channels displayed evidence of hyperpolarization causing the inactivation [Herold: 2012]. This sensitivity of sodium channels to clinically relevant anesthetics, similar to Lidocaine, was confirmed using various mammals [Herold: 2012]. The evidence displayed in this study relates similarly to the findings of the experiment executed. It is suggested that due to this evidence obtained in previous studies, the decreased contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens after Lidocaine injection was caused by the anesthetic blocking effect on the sodium channels in the tissues. This study indicates that presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels are inhibited by clinically used concentrations of anesthetics, such as Lidocaine. However, there is currently insufficient information regarding the presynaptic localization, function, and regulation of specific sodium channel subtypes. Further studies would be beneficial in identifying the roles of specific presynaptic sodium channel subtypes in mediating calcium release and its inhibition by sodium channel inhibitors such as Lidocaine and other volatile anesthetics.

Figure Legends: 
 Effect of Lidocaine injection on Rania pipiens gastrocnemus standard muscle contraction. Two Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles were obtained; one was stimulated at 2.0 volts and the other at 0.5 volts. Their standard muscle contraction amplitudes were each tested at these voltages prior to and after the injection of 0.1 Ml of 25 mM Lidocaine. Each bar is the mean standard contraction amplitude in volts, taken using the overall average of both legs/trials. Error bars are +/-1 standard deviation; standard deviation was calculated using all three values obtained from each of the two trials.
