Title: Insect Growth Regulation: The Effect of Azamax on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a pest plant that, while in the larva stage, causes plant damage and consequently damage to the economy [1]. Insect growth regulators (IGR) are believed to have an inhibiting effect on the growth of the larva by interfering with the hormone regulator ecdysone [1]. It is important to assess the true influence of IGR’s on Manduca sexta larva to prevent further plant and economic damage. We administered food with IGR treatment of Azamax and without IGR treatment over seven days to record the effects of the IGR on the growth of the larva. We hypothesized that the experimental group that was administered the treatment would gain less weight than the controll group that was not administered the treatment. We observed a significent growth difference in the two groups with the controll group averaging .74 grams of growth more per day. Thus, the IGR did have an inhibiting effect on the larvae and would be useful to reduce plant and economic damage. Our results showed some variance in growth among the larvae which highlights a need for a longer study to be performed.

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, are a common pest plant that defoliate plants which can often cause economic damage. The growth cycle of the Manduca sexta grows from an egg, through five instar stages, into a pupa, until it finally reaches adulthood [1]. The hornworm only causes damage when they are in the larvae stage. Observational research shows that the manduca sexta pupates around 19-23 days [1]. The hormone ecdysone normally signals the molting process to begin in the Manduca sexta. An insect growth regulator (IGR) would block this regulator and prevent molting. This study is interested in observing the effect of an insecticide, Azamax, that acts as an IGR to block the process of ecdysone. Azamax controlls target pests on contact or through ingestion, by way of repellence, anti-feedance, and interference with the molting process (Parry America Inc). We hypothesized that Azamax may inhibit growth of the larvae and this prevent further plant and economic damage. 

Materials and Method:
We obtained six manduca sexta in the fourth instar and housed them in round plastic containers with perforated lids. Each container housed two larvae and was divided in half using a taped index card to separate them. Each container held one controll larvae and one experimental larvae, for a total of three controll larvae and three experimental larvae. Each larva was fed 10 g of food every day for six days. The controll group was fed 10 g of food mixed with 4 drops of water from a transfer pipet. The larvae group was fed 10 g of food mixed with 4 drops of Azamax, with a concentration of 4 Ml in 100 Ml of water, from a separate transfer pipet. The final food mixture was placed directly inside the containers in a clump. The weight of the larvae and the amount of food consumed were recorded daily using a scale. After the food was allocated and the data was recorded, the larvae were placed in an incubator until the next change of food. For this data, we performed a 2-sample t_test because we tested the differences between two independent populations. 


Results:
The mean growth rate, measured in grams, of the controll group was significently greater than the mean of the experimental group (t_stat = 2.99, d.f. = 4, P = 0.04). All three of the controll larvae lost weight from the first day to the second day, and the third controll continued to lose weight 
until the fourth day. The first experimental larva lost weight from the first to the second day but gained weight after that. After this weight loss period, all of the larvae continued to gain weight. The average weight gain for the controll group was 1.18 grams per day and 8.26 grams per week. The average weight gain for the experimental group was 0.55 grams per day and 3.84 grams per week. Figure one shows the average growth per week for each group. Figure two shows the average growth per day for each group.


Discussion:
Since our p_value is less than .05, our results are significent. These results supported our hypothesis that the IGR would inhibit the growth of the Manduca sexta larvae. We expected that the IGR would affect each day’s mass because we were looking at the effects on the growth of the larvae. By way of indigestion, the Azamax successfully deterred the growth process. The controll group and the experimental group both grew at a different rate. Around day four, the growth difference becomes significently noticeable. There were no major errors in our experiment because the results were as expected. However, the third controll larva experienced weight loss through the third day. This weight loss is shown in figure two, where the line drops. There were no recorded errors in our experiment so this weight loss could be due to an adjustment in habitat or a change in feeding time. The third controll also gained less weight comparatively to the other controll larva. These observations could be due to cross contamination of the foods. In order to improve this study, the experiment should be more careful in terms of reusing utensils to mix the food for each group. Extreme caution would prevent the possibility of cross contamination among controll and experimental groups. Furthermore, this study could be altered by changing the amount of IGR in the food. Increasing the amount of IGR would allow future researchers to see if additional amounts of IGR are more effective in inhibiting growth or if this addition would result in death of the larva.
