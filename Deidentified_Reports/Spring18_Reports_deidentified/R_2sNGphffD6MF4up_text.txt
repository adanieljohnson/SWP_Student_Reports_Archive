Title: The Effect of 20E Blocker (Azamax) on the Growth and Pupation of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
	Chemical pesticide is harmful to the plant and human, so hormonal pesticide is being used more frequently. In this experiment, Manduca Sexta, a pest for plants, is being used as sample organism due to the short life cycle. Altogether 6 insects are being divided into controll and treatment group. The controll group were subjected with normal food and water while the treatment group is being subjected to the diluted 20E blocker from a commercial pesticide. Daily data of weight, length and color change were being recorded to compare with each other. Since 20E is a growth hormone and signal hormone for pupation, the prediction is that the treatment group will have smaller size and no pupation compare to the controll group. The data collected are analyzed with the two sample t_test to show if there is significent difference between the two group, the hypothesis is supported as controll group is significently larger then the treatment group but none of the group show any sign of pupation due to the short time span. Future research should extend the observation period as well as investigate on how 20E blocker effects human and plants in order for safe use of this pesticide.


Introduction:
	20E is a steroid hormone secreted by prothoracic glands, during insect development, 20 E regulates timing of the molting which turn larva into pupa (Johnson AD 2018). After the 5th larvae stage, a small rise in 20E signals the commitment pulse which starts the pupation of the insect (Johnson AD 2018). Therefor, 20E is crucial for the maturation of insects and lots of commercial pesticide use 20E blocker as the lack of 20E will leads to insect death in early stage of development (Johnson AD 2018).  
	Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworm, has two properties which make it our model organism. First, it is a pest of plants in the family of Solanaceae (del Campo and Renwick 1999), so the experiment wants to investigate to what extend does 20E blocker function as a pesticide and inhibit the growth/pupation of Manduca Sexta; second, Manduca Sexta has a short life cycle of 39 to 48 days and will reach 5th larva stage around 20days which allows us to observe any significent changes within a short range of time.
	This experiment is going to study the effect of 20E blocker on Manduca Sexta growth and pupation. 20E serve as a growth hormone before the 5th larva and signaling commitment pulse after the 5th larva, the inhibition in production of 20E hormone by 20E blocker should inhibit both the growth and pupation of the insects. The growth can be measured base on weight and length while the pupation can be measured using color change as pupation turns the insect from green to brown. 


Materials and Method:
	The experiment used a comparison model to test the hypothesis that 20E blocker would inhibit both growth and pupation. Altogether 6 insects, roughly around the same time (4th larva instar) were being used and divided equally into two groups of 3. One group is the controllled group which was being fed 10g food per day from the “Great Lake Manduca” and 50 μl of water; the other group is the treatment group which is being fed the same diet except for 50 μl of 20E blocker from 1: 12.50 diluted Azamax instead of water. Both groups were kept in transparent plastic containers with air holes on the lid and a separation to create two compartment in one container in order to safe space in the light incubators. Two of the insects from the same group were being put together while the rest, one from each group were put in the third container. In order to have the same environment for all of the insects, all of the containers were put in the same light incubator at 27 degrees to maintain the humidity, light and temperature the same.
	The initial weight and length for every insect were recorded before they were put into their compartment, and everyday for 7 days, one of the group member would exchange the old food and waster for new food while recording the weight and length and any observations on the color as well as any differences worth noting down.


Results:
	In the first three days, insects from both group has similar growth in weight and length, the color remain light green as the beginning. However, after the third day, the weight and length of controllled group starts to increase exponentially while the treatment group seize to growth (Fig.1), at the end of the 7 days, the weight for controll group is 9.767g, almost 5 times of the weight, 2.487g, of the treatment group; the same trend of growth applies to length to but the increase isn’t as significent a difference as the weight (Fig.2). At the end of the experiment, the Weight change for controll group is 8.8 with standard deviation of 11% while the weight change for treatment group is 1.3 with a standard deviation of 60% (Fig.3). For length, the controll group increase for 4.4 cm with a standard deviation of 14% while the treatment group has an increase of 1.4cm with a standard deviation of 36% (Fig.4).
        The color change for both group are invisible, all of the insects remain light bright green as the beginning of the experiment, none of the insects shows color change, but the spike of the controllled group become redder, the stripes become more defined and the controll group insects generally looks more lively compare to that of the treatment group. The controll group also eat most of its food daily while the treatment group eat a little.
        Because we obtained datas from two groups, we used the two sample t_test to see if the results are statistically different to each other. For weight, the mean of controll group is significatly different from the mean of the treatment group (t_stat = 9.940, d.f. = 4, P = 0.0006). For length, the mean of controll group is very different from the mean of the treatment group (t_stat = 5.461, d.f. = 4, P = 0.0055).


Discussion:
	The result of the experiment supports the hypothesis, 20E blocker will inhibit both growht and pupation, partly. The first part of hypothesis which was tested on the weight and length of the insects is supported as the treatment group is significently smaller,accroding to the statistical test, compare to the controll group. However, the second part of the hypothesis that 20E blocker will inhibit pupation is nor supported or rejected because none of the insect from either group shows any sign of color change. When we receive the insects, they were already in the 4th larva, so accrodin to the life cycle of Manduca Sexta, the pupation should occur in at most 7 days. If we keep observing the changes, we can draw conclusions on whether the hypothesis of 20E blocker inhibit pupation is supported or not. The 20E blocker blocks the 20E hormone, a growth hormone for insect in 4th larva so the size of the treatment group remain small compare to that of the controll group; when the sizes are being limited, the food consumption also decreases. So as mentioned in introduction, 20E blocker is being used as a pesticide and it is highly effective by limiting the size of insect. Notice that the dosage used in the experiment is non-lethal as we want to observe the result, at higher concentration, it is certain that the insect will die because of the lack of 20E. This result support the finding that 20E is the growth hormone in early larva stage (Sehnal F., Maroy P., Mala J 1981) but it didn't support any finding related to the pupation of insect because of the lack in time frame. 
	During the experiment, in the container which contains both the treatment and controllled group insect, the two insect were found to be in the same compartment at day 3. Back then, they aren’t distinguishable based on the size so the upper one is being put back into the empty compartment. The weight for the crossed over controll group is 8.66 and 1.67 for treatment group, which are one gram smaller then the mean sugeesting they are smaller then the two other insect in the same group which have similar initial weight. So there is an error which worth attention.
	20E blocker is an effective pesticide which can be used in pest controll, by inhibiting the release of growth hormone 20E, the insects can be killed off. But there is no research so far on how this hormonal pesticide can effect the plant or even people close to the sprayed area, so further research is required for safety application of the pesticide such as Azamax.
