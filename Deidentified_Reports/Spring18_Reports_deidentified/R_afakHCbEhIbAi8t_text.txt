Title: Changes in Resource Allocation Due to Light

Abstract:
The allocation of energy and resources in plants for the purpose of growth changes depending on the availability of resources in the plants environment. One such resource is light. A plant provided with poor light would allocate more resources towards stem growth and a plant provided with high energy light would allocate more resources towards root growth. Since plants are able to draw more energy from blue light than white light, a plant grown in white light would have a lower root to shoot ratio. In order to test this we grew two sets of vigna radiata one under blue light and one under white light and then measured the mass of the plants. Using these measurements we calculated the root to shoot ratio. However, when analyzing our results it became clear that our hypothesis was not supported, because there was no significent change in growth patterns. 


Introduction:
Under different conditions plants will change the ways they allocate resources to better access the resources available to them. For instance plants that are exposed to high levels of nitrogen will grow less roots and will place more energy into leaf growth. However, if a plant is exposed to low levels of nitrogen it will grow more roots and place less energy into leaf growth [Farrior, 2013]. Other conditions that change the allocation of resources in plants is exposure to water and exposure to sunlight. Limited sunlight is frequently an obstacle to the growth of plants due to competition from other plants [Craine, 2013]. A plant’s ability to perform photosynthesis changes in different wavelengths of light; the most energy can be absorbed through blue and violet light and the least through green light. Therefore it is safe to assume the wavelength of light will affect how a plant allocates the resources at its disposal. We decided to grow two groups of vigna radiata, or mung beans, one under blue light and one under white light to test this. vigna radiata was chosen due to its larger size which made it easier to measure. We expected that the plants grown under white light would allocate more resources to leaf and stem growth and would thus have a lower root to shoot ratio than those grown under blue light. 

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis we prepared six trays of mung beans to be grown in loose vermiculite treated with miracle grow. Three of the trays were to be grown under a tent of blue plastic and three were to be grown under a tent of clear plastic. The blue plastic converted all light that passed through it to a blue wavelength and the clear plastic left the white light as it was. After growing the plants for two weeks we dug up nine, randoMly selected plants from each tray. We separated the nine plants into three groups of three plants each and massed each group. We then removed the roots, cutting the plant just above the first lateral root to grow off of the taproot. We then massed the now rootless groups. In order to find the mass of the roots we simply subtracted the shoot mass from the total mass. This allowed us to calculate the ratio of root mass to shoot mass. 

Results:
The plants grown under the blue plastic tent grew slightly larger than the plants grown under the clear plastic. However, the difference in mass is incredibly negligible. The average mass of the plants grown under blue light was 2.51 grams and the average mass of the plants grown under white light was 2.50 grams (graph 1). The root to shoot ratio was found to be higher for the plants grown under clear plastic than the plants grown under blue plastic. The root to shoot ratio of the plants grown in blue light averaged to be 0.39 and the root to shoot ratio of the plants grown under white light averaged to be 0.47 (graph 2). However, the t test show that there is not enough difference for the results to be significent. The P value for the two sets of data was calculated to be 0.3407 meaning the results are not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
Although at first look it appeared that the results suggest the inverse of our hypothesis the t test reveals that the results were not significent. This instead implies that the experiment supported the null hypothesis that the color of light has no effect on resource allocation in plants. However, this result is not supported by other research on the topic [Craine, 2013] [Farrior, 2013]. Other tests should be conducted in order to determine if these results came about through some error. The experiment could be conducted using a longer growth period or with another plant. Another hypothesis that could be tested is that the plant was incapable of altering it's growth pattern for the increased energy of the blue light but would be capable of altering it's growth pattern for decreased energy provided by green light.
