Title: No effect of colored water on aggression in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
The impact of a different color environment on aggressive display in Betta splendins was analyzed in this experiment. It was hypothesized that a blue Betta splendins would exhibit less aggression towards a red Betta splendins in red colored water compared to clear water. Three different blue Bettas were exposed to a red Betta in both clear water and red colored water for five minutes during each trial. The following aggressive displays were counted: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and red mane. A paired t_test was used to compare the results. There was no statistically significent difference between the different color environments. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins are common aquarium fish that are known for the intraspecific aggressive behaviors they display. These behaviors include broadside movements such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing as well as facing movements such as displaying a red mane [Johnson: 2018]. Dominance is important to the Betta splendins because of the need to protect their nests and territories in the wild [Todd, et. al: 2008]. This experiment was interested in how visual perception of color impacts aggression in Betta fish. Betta’s have good eyesight, displayed by their ability to recognize an opponent and exhibit aggressive behaviors. Color is one of the many visual cues that any animal faces in the natural environment, and may impact how an animal perceives a situation or the response it chooses. Having the ability to see color can help an animal with tasks such as finding food or recognizing an opponent. Betta fish in particular rely on color when displaying aggressive behaviors. Studies have found that male Betta Splendins will respond the least when the opponent is of similar color. They respond the most when the coloration is unlike its own [Thompson: 1965] We hypothesized that if placed in red water, a blue Betta would exhibit less aggression towards a red Betta based on the colored water impairing its ability to accurately perceive the presence and different color of the other male.

Materials and Method:
      In order to test our hypothesis, we needed to run two different trials with the same blue Betta splendins fish. In the first trial, three blue Betta fish were each exposed in individual trials to a red Betta fish in clear water for 5 minutes. A tank with dividers separating the two fish was used, so the Bettas were not in actual contact with each other, but could see their opponent through a piece of glass. We counted the number of times the blue Bettas displayed the following aggressive behaviors- pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and red mane. After 5 minutes, the partition was replaced so the fish could no longer see each other. 
      After the first trial with each blue Betta, a few drops of red food coloring were added to the water of both the red and blue Betta. The fish were given time to acclimate to the new environment before the second test was conducted. The fish were exposed to each other again for 5 minutes, and the same aggressive displays were counted. A paired t_test, comparing the number of times the aggressive behavior was shown in the clear water vs. the red water was utilized for each blue Betta, analyzed using a significance level of .05. 


Results:
In general the number of times each behavior was displayed was similar between the different trials. 
     Figure 1 shows the results of pelvic fin flickering display in the fish between the two trials. Running a paired t_test with these results gives a t-value of .74 and a p_value of .54. Therefore, there is not a statistical difference between the two trials. 
     Figure 2 provides the results for the average number of tail beats in each trial. A paired t_test gives a t-value of 3.87 and a p_value of .06. Again, these results do not prove to be statistically significent based on the alpha level of .05. 
     Figure 3 gives the average results of red manes displayed by the blue betta fish between the two trials. A paired t_test of these results gives a t-value of .57 and a p_value of .63, which is not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
      We would expect that coloration in the water may make it difficult for Betta splendins to perceive the threat of another male, the same color of the water, and thus lead to a decrease in aggressive displays. While the number of aggressive displays between each trial decreased in some cases, the results were not statistically significent for any of the behaviors. 
	Other studies have been done on visual perception in Betta splendins. Bando examined this through exposing the fish to various stimulus patterns. Models of the side view of a Betta splendins were presented to the fish. Aggressive responses were strong when there was a fine distribution of brightness and color, however they became weaker as the distribution became more homogeneous. These results indicate that distribution of brightness and color play an important role in the visual recognition of Betta splendins. [Bando: 1991] This disagrees with our results, as we would expect the aggressive displays to decrease significently if the Betta could not accurately perceive of its opponent. However, this may be explained by the fact that chemical communication can play an important role in the behavior of animals and demonstration of aggressive behavior. A study conducted by Todd, et al. revealed that chemical stimuli allowed for recognition of another individual [Todd, et al.: 1967]. This chemical communication could continue between the Bettas in our experiment despite the color manipulation of the water. Male Betta splendins can secrete testosterone when they experience an encounter with another male fish [Forsatkar, et. al: 2013]. Therefore, it is likely that a secretion of testosterone by the red Betta allowed the blue Betta to fully perceive the presence of an opponent. This would explain why the aggressive display in the blue Betta did not significently decrease. 
        A study conducted by Irawan and Afiati, however, provides results that agree with ours. This study examined aggressive responses in Betta splendins in various color environments. Red and black B. splendins were exposed to mirror images in different color environments. Frequencies in frontal and lateral display and frequency and duration of gill cover erection were not significent. [Bambang and Afiati: 2006] These results agree with the results of our study that there was not a significent decrease in aggressive behaviors between the two color environments. 
       Since our study was conducted on fish that had been used in a variety of previous studies, it would be beneficial to complete this experiment again. Using Betta splendins that had not been previously experimented on would most likely provide results that are more accurate. Additionally, it would be advantageous to complete the trials on more than three fish.
