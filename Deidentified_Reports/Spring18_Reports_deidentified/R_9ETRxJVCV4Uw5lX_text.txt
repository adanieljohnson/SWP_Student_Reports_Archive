Title: Change in Mass in Manduca sexta Caterpillars When Given Synthetic Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
Hormones are chemicals that the body creates to regulate function, growth, and development. Synthetic hormones can be created to mimic the effects of a hormone. Juvenile hormone controlls the stage development of insects. In this experiment, the effect of synthetic juvenile hormone on growth, through weight, is tested on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Our prediction was that the caterpillars with juvenile hormone in their food would increase in weight more than the caterpillars given normal food. Using food mixed with synthetic juvenile hormone and food mixed with water, the caterpillars weights were recorded for a week. From the collected data, the caterpillars in both conditions showed a similar growth in weight. This shows that with the introduction of a small amount of juvenile hormone in a short time period, Manduca will grow about the same amount as normal Manduca.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworms, are insects that go through a hormone controllled, holometabolous life cycle. A holometabolous life cycle is one that has four main stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. In addition to the four stages, there are 5 growth stages called instar during the larvae stage. This cycle is systematic, meaning that it normally takes 39-48 days to go through the entire cycle (egg to adult). Eggs hatch to become larvae, and larvae go through the five instars in order to grow and reach a commitment pulse. After the commitment pulse (the release of ecdysterone and decrease of juvenile hormone), the larvae turn into pupa, or the metamorphosis stage, and comes out of it as an adult. Another detail to notice is that during the instar stages, developmentally, the caterpillars look the same, but are continuously molting into larger forms. Once the caterpillar starts to go through the pupa stage (then adult), the insect will look completely different [Johnson: 2018]. 
In order to go through developmental changes, the caterpillars use the hormones juvenile hormone, ecdysterone, and PTTH to controll the process [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile hormone controlls the type of the molt. When there is juvenile hormone present during the final instar stage, it inhibits the secretion of PTTH, causing the larvae to continue being a larva, or mature larvae [Nijhout: 1974]. Mature larvae are abnormally large larvae that has continued to grow and not transform into an adult. Specifically, when juvenile hormone is in high levels the caterpillar stays in larvae form and only when it goes down does the caterpillar start to go through pupa and adult stages [Fain: 1975].
Synthetic juvenile hormone can mimic the effects of juvenile hormone, causing larvae to stop developing into adult and stay as larvae [Speilman: 1966]. Specifically, by manipulating this hormone, the Manduca caterpillar cannot go through developmental changes, but only growth changes [Johnson: 2018]. Precor (1: 1250) is a synthetic juvenile hormone that can manipulate the effects of the juvenile hormone on the type of molting that occurs. To understand the effects of this synthetic hormone on the Manduca’s development, a measurement of mass can help to show the growth changes that occur when given the hormone. With this information about juvenile hormone, we predicted that Manduca sexta caterpillars would increase in weight when given synthetic growth hormone compared to caterpillars that receive no synthetic JH hormone. 

Materials and Method:
To test how growth of the Manduca sexta is affected when introducing a synthetic juvenile hormone, four plastic containers with ventilation holes in the lids, were set up with index card dividers, in order to provide similar habitats to eight caterpillars (Figures 2 & 3). In one container, two caterpillars of the same test group were place between a divider (two containers for four controll caterpillars and two containers for four treatment caterpillars). Before putting the caterpillars into the containers, each caterpillar was individually weighed, for an initial mass (grams). 
	To make the food source for the caterpillars, 80 grams of food were separated into 10 grams for each caterpillar. The controll caterpillars had ten drops of distilled water stirred into their food, before placing the food into the containers. The treatment caterpillars had ten drops of Precor (1: 1250), a synthetic juvenile hormone, stirred into their food before placing the food into the containers. Each caterpillar container was labelled with a group name, and each caterpillar was individually label (Control 1-4, Treatment 1-4). The caterpillars were then placed side by side in a 23°C incubator. Every day for one week, the caterpillars were weighed, the containers were cleaned and new food was placed into the containers. After collecting the final weight, the difference between the initial weight and the final weight were found and a two-sample t_test was performed on the data.

Results:
After recording the weight of the caterpillars for over a week and calculating the difference in weight from the beginning of the experiment and the final measurement, there was no significent difference found in weight values. When caterpillars were given 10 drops of Precor (1: 1250), a synthetic juvenile hormone, the caterpillars grew about the same amount as the controll group that was given no juvenile hormone. The average amount of growth in weight (g) for the juvenile hormone treatment group was 8.23±1.46 (Figure 1). The average amount of growth in weight (g) for the controll group was 8.36±1.90 (Figure 1). The first controll caterpillar did not grow and actually shrank in weight, so this data point was not included in the analysis of the change in weight in the caterpillars (Picture 4). After completing a two sample t_test, the average weight change of the caterpillars treated with synthetic juvenile hormone was not statistically significent from the average weight change of the caterpillars with normal food (t_stat=0.097, d.f.=5, P=0.93).

Discussion:
After looking at the results from the growth differences in weight between caterpillars fed juvenile hormone or fed regular food, we can say that our results do not support the hypothesis that caterpillars fed synthetic juvenile hormone will increase in size more than caterpillars fed no juvenile hormone. This is concluded through a two-sample t_test by looking at the calculated p_value (P=0.93).  Even though there were physical changes in the caterpillars, there was no difference in weight gain (Figures 4 and 5). When introduced to the juvenile hormone, Manduca sexta caterpillars stop going through the stages of development [Nijhout: 1974]. Accordingly, larvae still go through molting, just develop into another instar stage of larva [Johnson: 2018]. The result of this experiment showed that when given a small amount of juvenile hormone for a short period of time, a caterpillar grows to be about the same size as a normal caterpillar that is close to turning to pupa. If this is true, then larger (mature) adult forms could be produced by introducing a small amount of juvenile hormone into the caterpillar’s diet to grow more before the commitment pulse. 
	There was a possible source of error in our experiment. This error would be that the food source might not have been mixed together fully. This could cause the Manduca sexta caterpillars receiving drops of juvenile hormone to not evenly get the same amount of hormone in every bite they eat. Some could eat all the juvenile hormone or none of the juvenile hormone depending on where they eat from. To conduct the same experiment again, I would suggest a few changes to the procedure. The first change is that there would be more trials(caterpillars) to get a larger sample of results to compare. The second change is that there would be multiple treatment groups getting different amounts of juvenile hormone, to see if smaller amounts or larger amounts than what was given changes the effect of synthetic juvenile hormone on the Manduca sexta weight. The third change is that the food source should be mixed more thoroughly, in order to make the caterpillars get the same amount of juvenile hormone every time they eat.
	Juvenile hormone helps to inhibit insects from growing into the next stage of their life cycle, specifically into their adult form. This hormone can be synthetically made and distributed to keep insects that are pests in their adult form in larvae form, eventually killing them [Dhadiall: 1998]. As shown in the experiment, small amounts of juvenile hormone do not prevent growth of the insects. Only exposing insects to juvenile hormone for a short amount of time will prevent stage development while exposed, but create a larger adult if exposure stops [Johnson: 2018]. To use this hormone as an effective pesticide, in the future, a larger amount of juvenile hormone will be needed in longer exposure times, in order to have the effect of a pesticide on insects that are pests in their adult form.
