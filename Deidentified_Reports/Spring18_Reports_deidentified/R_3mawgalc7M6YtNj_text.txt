Title: The Effects of Precor on the weight of Manduca sexta (Tobacco Hornworms)

Abstract:
Precor is a chemical commonly used to protect animals from fleas. It uses and insect growth regulator (IGR) that acts like the JH hormone which is needed by the Manduca sexta to determine the type of molt it is supposed to go through. By adding 5 drops of Precor to a preweighed amount of food we tested to see if the there was significently more weight gain in those caterpillars than caterpillars that were given food that was treated with 5 drops of water. Results showed that there was not a significent enough difference between the weights of the two types of groups for there to be a correlation between the addition of Precor and weight gained by the Tobacco hornworm. Though the hypothesis was rejected there is a possibility that the concentration of Precor was too low in the diet of the Manduca sexta to show the proper results.

Introduction:
	The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm are a type of insect that starts life as a caterpillar before pupating into a moth. In order to pupate the caterpillar requires the involvement of two hormones, Ecdysterone (20E) which regulates the timing of the molting for the caterpillar and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which regulates the type of molt the larvae go through (Johnson, 2018). In this experiment we used the chemical Precor a common flea medication which contains the Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) methoprene [1] that is known to mimic the effects of JH. As previously stated the JH is needed for the larvae of the Manduca sexta to determine which type of molt needs to occur, if there is too much JH or too little JH it can prevent pupation and kill the caterpillar. In our experiment we tested how the addition of Precor to the caterpillar's diet effected the overall weight of the caterpillar. We hypothesized that the addition of Precor to the diet of the Manduca sexta would show an increase on the weight of the insect. The significance of this experiment was to test to see if Precor which contains the IGR methoprene to see if we could stop the larvae from pupating.

Materials and Method:
We gathered 8 caterpillars and separated them into two groups, a controll group which was given no Precor and a treatment group that received five drops of 4.2% Precor. We then weighed each caterpillar before placing it in a labeled container that held two caterpillars separated by a divider. Each caterpillar was then given 10g of food, if the caterpillar was in the controll group it received food that had been treated with 5 drops of water, and if the caterpillar was in the treatment group it received food that had been treated with 5 drops of Precor. We then weighed the caterpillars for everyday for the next week, except for the day after the experiment was set up, we forgot to collect data for that day.  We then calculated the significance of our results using a two-sample t_test.

Results:
The results from the conducted experiment are summarized in Figure 1., the figure shows the average change in weight of the controll and treatment groups of caterpillars with each group's standard deviation. We also performed a two-sample t test on the data collected which equaled 0.5755. We did notice a few trends as we measured the weight of the caterpillars being weighed, the treatment group on average weighed more than the controll group, with the treatment worm G weighing consistently heavier than the other worms. We also noticed that while both groups increased in weight the controll group increased in smaller amounts than the treatment group.

Discussion:
 Our results did support the null hypothesis, by running the two-sample t_test we were able to show that there was not a significent difference between the treatment and controll groups. The Manduca sexta given the treatment of five drops of 4.2% Precor a chemical which includes the IGR methoprene, that prevents molting in the larvae (Johnson, 2018). The results of the experiment show that the alternate hypothesis is rejected meaning there was no statistical difference in weight gain of the Manduca sexta that ingested Precor and those in the controll group that only had water added to their food.The reason the that the caterpillars that ate the Precor treated food were were theorized to be heavier than those that didn't was because Precor contains the IGR methoprene which mimics the effects of JH. Due to the increased amount of JH in the caterpillar the larvae would have not known which molt to go into and could eventually die from the effects of Precor. Though the concentration used did not show us the results we were looking for higher concentrations have the potential to show that there is a statistical difference that is significent for weight gain.
