Title: How Does Inhibiting Ecdysterone Influence Manduca sexta Development?

Abstract:
 In our experiment, we used Azagard (a chemical that inhibits insect production of their growth hormone: ecdysterone) on several Tobacco hornworms, or Manduca sexta, caterpillars and measured their changes in mass, length, and color. We did so to find out the effects of an improper balance of hormones on Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that the caterpillars would not be able to continue with their life cycles. This hypothesis was proven to be correct. The introduction of Azagard to Manduca sexta will prevent them from growing into adult moths.


Introduction:
This lab will focus on hormones and their interaction with the body, specifically the influence of JH and Ecdysterone on the development cycle of Tobacco hornworms, or Manduca sexta. Our group decided to test how using a chemical known to block the production of ecdysterone and how it affects Manduca sexta development through instar stages into pupal and adult forms. Research has shown that introduction of ecdysterone at a late stage has caused growth into the next pupal stage [Weeks: 1986]. Therefore, we believe that the introduction of an ecdysterone blocker will prevent the specimen from receiving the signal to move to its next stage of life, thus inhibiting Manduca sexta development.


Materials and Method:
We first created two groups: a controll group and an experimental group. We began by measuring the mass and length of each caterpillar, though we will be using mass as our variable for finding our t_statistic. We also took note of the color, and presence or absence of pupation. We placed 2 caterpillars each into 4 plastic containers that were partitioned into individual habitats. For our controll group, we mixed 10 drops of water into 10g of caterpillar food and put it in the container with the caterpillar. For the experimental group, we did the same process but used Azagard (an ecdysterone blocker) instead of water. We would come each day to empty and refill the food, as well as to record our data.

Discussion:
The main trend in the data is that the caterpillars got gradually smaller. This supported our hypothesis because the caterpillars that were given a treatment also did not pupate, and stayed caterpillars throughout the experiment, but the controll caterpillars, while getting smaller, also went into their cocoon stages. Our experiment, in conjunction with other scientific studies from the past [Weeks: 1986], leads me to believe that for Manduca sexta to survive to a point of reproduction, it must have a naturally produced level of ecdysterone.
