Title: Limited availability of food in the environments increased the occurrence of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendens.

Abstract:
This study investigates the effect of food availability on aggression in male Betta splendens. The fish display specific aggressive behaviors as a form of social communication between members of their own species to compete for resources. We hypothesized that if Betta splendens are placed in an environment with low and then high food availability, then the fish will demonstrate more aggressive behaviors when food availability is low. In this study the independent variable was the availability of food. Betta splendens were placed in a tank with just a glass partition between them and given first no food and then a pinch of food on both sides. The number of times the fish touched the glass, and aggressive behavior, in 5 minute time spans were recorded in both environments. The results did not support our hypothesis. A one tailed paired t-test determined that the fish displayed significantly more aggressive behaviors in the environment with no food, which was opposite of what we expected. This is likely because when food was added, both fish were satisfied and had to drive to compete.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behaviors. Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are known to exhibit agnostic or aggressive behaviors in the presence of other males. At rest, Betta splendens are dull in color and their fins beat slowly and calmly. However, when put in an environment with another male, the fish are excited. They flare their gills, beat their fins rapidly, and even change color to more intense hues of blue and red. These behaviors are intraspecific because they occur between members of the same species. The broadside and facing movements that Betta splendens demonstrate are methods of social communication and asserting dominance. A previous study illustrated that aggressive behaviors among male Betta splendens increased in the presence of a single female, as the two male fish attempted to compete for her [Doutrelant et al, 2001]. In this experiment, the effect of the availability of another resource, food, on aggressive behaviors was studied. Food was either left out of the tank or a pinch was added to both sides of the tank. We quantified aggression by counting the number of times the two fish approached and touched the glass partition separating them in a five minute span of time. We made our hypothesis based on an article on Betta splendens that found that communities of the fish create hierarchies, with those at the top receiving the most resources. Aggression is one maker of this hierarchy [Haller et al, 1988]. We believed that when an essential resource is presented, the fish will demonstrate increased aggression to compete for it. Additionally, the study showed that Betta splendens have very noticeable aggressive behaviors, making aggression easy to quantify. This is why Betta splendens were chosen as the model organism. We hypothesized that if Betta splendens are placed in an environment with low and then high food availability, then the fish will demonstrate more aggressive behaviors when food availability is low.


Materials and Methods:
A large tank was filled with distilled water. A clear piece of plastic was placed in slots on the walls of the tank, creating two separate chambers in the tank. Two male Betta splendens were chosen for the experiment. One was placed in each of the two chambers of the tank. A timer was set for five minutes and the fish were observed. The number of times each fish approached the divider and touched the glass was recorded. The numbers for each fish were added together to get the total number of times this particular aggressive behavior occurred in five minutes. This exact procedure was repeated two more times, placing a dark piece of glass to separate the fish in between trials to prevent habituation. A pinch of food was then added to each chamber of the tank. The procedure was then repeated three more times. Averages for the number of aggressive behaviors in environments with and without food available were recorded. A one tailed paired t-test was run to analyze the significance of the difference [Johnson:2018].

Results:
The fish with no food available to them had an average of 8.33+/-2.52 aggressive behaviors, times a fish touched the glass partition, per five minutes. The fish with food available had an average of 1+/-1 aggressive behaviors per five minutes. These values are depicted in Figure 1, which shows that the results for each varied greatly. The one tailed paired t-test between the average aggressive behaviors per five minutes for the fish with and without food had a t statistic of 3.61 and a p-value of 0.034. The difference was statistically significant.


Discussion:
The results of this study did not support our hypothesis. We hypothesized that if Betta splendens were placed in adjacent tanks separated by just a glass partition, then the number of times they tap the glass, a sign of aggression, will be higher in the presence of food than with no food. The hypothesis that we made was due to our understanding of aggressive and agnostic behaviors in males. In a previous experiment, we saw that in the presence of a single female, two Betta splendens exhibit more aggressive behaviors as they compete for the limited “resource”. This lead us to assume that the fish would behave similarly if they had food present to compete over. Our study did find significant results; they were just not the results that we expected. We found that Betta splendens demonstrated significantly more glass touches, an aggressive behavior, per five minutes when they were in an environment with low food availability compared to the number in an environment with high food availability. This is likely because when food supply was high, the fish did not feel the need to compete. Both males had adequate resources. However, when food supply was low, the fish were concerned about the limited resource and viewed the other as a threat. This is what prompted them to display increased aggression. A similar study conducted on Betta splendens found a high correlation between aggression and hunger, so their results also showed higher aggression when food supply was low [Hogan et al, 1980]. Our study could have been improved by further manipulating the Betta splendens hunger levels prior to the experiment. At the start of the experiment we simply chose two random male fish, with no knowledge of their previous environment or how recently they had been fed. If the fish had been feed right before we came into lab, they would not be hungry and would have less motivation to compete for food and display aggression in the low food availability environment. To control for this, the study should be conducted again, ensuring that the fish do not receive any food in the 24 hours before the experiment begins. Additionally, the experiment could be improved by collecting data from multiple sets of male fish, rather than just two individuals, like the Haller study did [Haller et al, 1988]. There is a chance that the two fish chosen have an unusual predisposition to a certain level of aggression. Some fish are more likely to display aggression than others. Studying a greater number of fish would help to control for this.
