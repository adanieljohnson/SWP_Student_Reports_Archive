Title: Precor Causes a decrease in weight of manduca sexta caterpillars 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effect of Juvenile Hormone, JH, on manduca sexta caterpillars. JH is a naturally occurring hormone that regulates the type of molt during the caterpillars’ development. Eight caterpillars were monitored in this experiment; four were given the controll diet and the other four were given Precor having the hormone JH in their diet. Data was collected through daily weightings of each caterpillar. Our hypothesis predicted that the 4 M. sextas larvae that were given Precor (containing JH), the independent variable, would gain weight, the dependent variable, at a faster rate than the controll group. The results contradict the hypothesis because the caterpillars that were given the diet with JH weighed significently less than the controll group at the end of the eight days. The controll caterpillars began to grow on the fourth day; whereas, the caterpillars with added JH in their diet did not begin substantial development until day 6. Furthermore, after the caterpillars began to grow, the controll group grew at a faster rate than the JH group. In conclusion, adding Precor (JH) to the diet of caterpillars in the larvae stage delays their growth and their rate of growth.

Introduction:
The manduca sexta caterpillar is part of the Sphingidae family. They have a holometabolous lifecycle with four main stages: the egg, larvae, pupa and adult. The eggs are small, spherical, and are either colored or translucent. The larvae are vermiform, (worm-like), having clear segments. The pupa is enclosed by the final larval cuticle or by a cocoon. Finally, the adult has wings and reproductive organs. (Johnson : 2018) While some insects look similar to their adult form as a baby, the M. sexta looks very different in each stage of life. Juvenile Hormone, JH, naturally occurs in the caterpillar regulating the type of molt during development. These hormones are long chained organic molecules produced by the corpus allata; a pair of glands located on either side of the foregut. (Johnson : 2018). This lab focused on JH and the effects it had on the M. sexta. By adding additional JH to half of the caterpillars’ food, the effect of JH will be determined. One similar experiment studied hormones being topically added to insects instead of the insects ingesting the hormones. Topical application of insect growth regulators, (JH being one of them), prevented spodoptera litura from their differentiation into pupae, resulting in a short-term mortality. (Sundaramurthy : 1976). In his experiment, the JH hormone topically applied to the insect prevented the insect from developing into its next stage of life. Thus, assuming the caterpillar does not change state, our hypothesis is the 4 m. sextas larvae that were given Precor (containing JH), the independent variable, would gain weight, the dependent variable, at a faster rate than the controll group.


Materials and Method:
Gather 4 plastic containers with 4 notecards. Put a notecard in each container so that the container is divided in two halves. Label two of the containers for the controll group, (the caterpillars not receiving JH hormone) and the other two containers for the Precor test group. In each half of the container, put 10 grams of the food in each container. In the two controll containers, put 10 drops of water onto the food. In the two test containers put 10 drops of the 1: 1250 Precor mixture. Now weigh and record 8 M. sexta caterpillars. Put one caterpillar in each half container. Weigh the caterpillars daily for the next eight days and give the controll 10 more drops of water and the tests 10 more drops of Precor. If the caterpillars run out of food, give them 10 more grams. For a picture of the setup, see figure 1. 


Results:
After eight days, the M. sexta caterpillars that were given the Precor weighed substantially less than the caterpillars that ate the regular food. For the first three days, neither the controll group nor the Precor group showed measurable growth. On day 4, the controll group weighed more than twice their previous day’s weight and continued to add approximately 2 grams per day.  Conversely, the test group did not start substantial growth until day 6; three days after the controll group.  Furthermore, the rate of growth was about half of the rate of growth of the controll group and the total growth of the test group was approximately 1/3rd the total growth of the controll group. The collected data was then analyzed. The statistical data is a two-sample t_test. As shown in figure 2 below, the first sample is the controll group, and the second is the test group. The average weight at the end of the trial for the controll group was 11.785 g  ± 0.7 g compared to the test group which was 4.438 ±  0.05 g.


Discussion:
These results did not support the hypothesis because instead of faster growth, the test M. sexta grew less and at a lesser rate than the controll group. Upon further reflection, the results may be a logical result of the timing of the natural production of JH. JH is a juvenile hormone that is only produced when the caterpillars are young. As caterpillars mature, their natural production of JH decreases, allowing them to gain weight and grow much larger. By giving the caterpillars the Precor that included JH, the natural development of the caterpillars may have been tricked into remaining in a younger phase longer; consequently, their growth was slower than the controll group. In another experiment of tobacco hookworms, the effect of JH was also studied. In Sundaramurthy’s study of the tobacco hookworm, “administration of JH analogues to caterpillars prevented their transformation into pupae” (Sundaramurthy : 1976) This is significent because similar results happened with our experiment. 
There are a few sources of error that could lead to small differences in results. The first systematic error is the accuracy of the scale. The scale may have been slightly off due to calibration or its precision skewing the results when weighing the M. sexta. Another source of systematic error is not feeding the caterpillars on a regular schedule. Instead, we fed them when they ran out of food, not every night nor every other night consistently. However, every night, more drops of water or JH was added to the already existing food, but giving the caterpillars fresh food may have caused them to eat more which would cause a different weight. If this lab were to be repeated, I would put each caterpillar in their own container. This is because two caterpillars in our experiment from the test group began to eat the index card separating them from each other. This created an unexpected variable because this was not supposed to happen. However, because the two caterpillars that shared this container had a great variance in weight, it was easy to tell which caterpillar was which. By putting each caterpillar in their own container, it eliminates the possibility of each M. sextas from getting mixed up with each other.
