Title: The Effects of Methoprene on the Growth Stages of the Manduca sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
Abstract:
In this experiment we looked at how the process of Juvenile Hormone and 20E affects the Manduca sexta caterpillars. To do this, we utilized the chemical compound Methoprene. Methoprene is a compound knowing to act like a mirror of JH when introduced inside the body. It mimics juvenile hormones affects on the cells of the insects. We believe that by adding Methoprene into the food source of a selected group of caterpillars we can effectively keep them in their instar stages while having them grow abnormally large. We tested this by using two groups of four Manduca sexta. One group was the control and the other was the test group. Other than food their environments were kept the same through incubation. We found that statistically the mean average weight between the control group and the test group did not have a great significance. However, most organisms from the control group grew larger than the testing group. From this we concluded that our null hypothesis was rejected by the data. The methoprene keeps the insects in adolescent stages but does not make them just grow larger in these stages. 



Introduction:
Introduction:
In this lab we are studying the affects of hormones on the Manduca sexta. More commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm this insect has around a fifty-day life span. During this time, it will evolve from the egg stage up through instar stages, then complete its cycle by molting into an adult moth. This experiment will be focusing on two chemical compounds, Juvenile Hormone and Methoprene. Juvenile hormone “has primary roles in the regulation of metamorphosis and reproduction” [Bern, 2012]. JH is responsible for keeping the Manduca sexta in its adolescent form. Methoprene is a chemical compound that mimics the affects of Juvenile hormone. Both compounds work by allowing the 20E to initiate molting but keeping the body’s natural system from starting the metamorphosis. Since methoprene preforms as a mirror to the juvenile hormone, would it be possible to keep the tobacco hornworm in the instar stages, having them grow bigger, without letting them become full adult moths? To complete our experiment, we will alter the diet of the caterpillars by adding methoprene into their food source. By doing this we believe that we will be able to make the Manduca sexta grow abnormally large while keeping it from adulthood. The Manduca sexta was the perfect organism to preform this experiment with. In the research world of insects, the tobacco hornworm is known as the lab rat of insect endocrinology. It allowed us to begin to look at and understand how JH directs 20E action. Firstly, the juvenile hormone controls the rate at which the animal molts. It’s life cycle is also long enough for us to be able to observe any noticeable changes in the caterpillar once the experiment starts. The independent variable would be that of the methoprene. By adding methoprene into the food source we expect to see a change in the dependent variable. This would be a change in growth or weight of the Manduca sexta due to the JH analogue methoprene being introduced into the animal’s system. 


Materials and Methods:
Methods:
-	Pick 8 Manduca sexta and divide them into two groups.
-	Place each group into separate containers. (2 per container. 4 Containers)
-	Feed each group of caterpillars a separate diet. Four eat regular food and the other four eat food treated with methoprene.
-	Keep all caterpillars inside of the incubator.
-	Record data and results everyday for one week. 
This experiment was carried out utilizing the insect Manduca sexta. This insect was collected and distributed to us by the staff of our Wake Forest Bio Lab. During our experiment we maintained the insects by keeping them in the controlled environment of an incubator. As for food the control organisms were feed with regular caterpillar food. The test specimens were given the same food mixture but with 10% concentration of methoprene mixed in. We compared the test group to the control group to measure differences, also a T-test was used to track results. 


Results:
From looking at the data collected methoprene does have some type of effect on the growth cycle of the Manduca Sexta. In each the control group and the treatment group there was one caterpillar that did not develop in size as quickly as the others. It is also critical to note that one caterpillar ended the experiment smaller than it started. This caterpillar was the labeled as the second organism in the treatment group. The trend from this specimen was slightly peculiar. It shows a gradual climb in body weight that lead to a consistent declination of body weight throughout the rest of the experiment. Then trend from test organism one was also one to take note of. It showed a small decay in weight during the first half of the experiment, only to have a huge turn around at the end. Overall, we noted a difference between the weights of the treated caterpillars and our control group. By the end of the experiment the control group had an average weight of 2.0404g while the treatment group had an average weight of 1.766g showing that on average the treatment group was smaller. Even so, the T-test ran with the data shows that there is not statistically a significance between the mean of the control group compared to the treated group (t-stat = 1.004, df = 62, P = 0.31882).



Discussion:
Discussion:
The hypothesis we set out to test was proven incorrect. We could not make the caterpillars grow abnormally large while staying adolescent. On the other hand, we found that methoprene does have an influence on the insects. Firstly, the average weight of the control group was 2.0404 grams while the test group’s average weight was 1.766. It is also important to note that one caterpillar in the treatment section ended smaller than it started. Thinking biologically, the reason for this could be just because of the methoprene. Being that methoprene acts as a mirror to the Juvenile Hormone it would make sense for the tested caterpillars to grow slower. The methroprene helps to keep the caterpillar in the instar stages, it does not help it to gain weight. By doing this we merely just kept the Manduca sexta younger than normal. Also mistakes in the experimental design and plan may have caused some variance. Firstly, we used index cards to separate spaces for each caterpillar. This was because each caterpillar had a set amount of food distributed to them. It was noted that some caterpillars found their way to the other sides of the containers, and many times some food sources were being eaten faster than what they should have. We also didn’t add any extra food for them. This may have caused some of our caterpillars to lack nutrients for a period. This would explain the drop-in weight on the last day for most of the organisms.  Even though our hypothesis was proven incorrect some good discoveries did come from this experiment. Since the average weight of the treated caterpillars was lower than those of the control group we can say that methoprene effectively keeps the insects smaller and adolescent longer. If translated to the wild they would be more likely to die or be eaten before fully developing. This means methoprene can be used in places that have extremely high moth populations to thin the numbers.
