Title: The effect of common household water pollutant on photosynthesis activity on spinach and chard

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is used every day by plants, protists, and bacteria and can be greatly affected by common household pollutants. Photosynthesis, a process in which organisms consume light energy and synthesize chemical energy through different steps, can be affected by many outside factors, such as laundry detergent. By using different dilutions, 10% and 20% percent of Tide Free and Gentle on spinach and chard, we were able to isolate the chloroplast and measure the change of absorbance of each treatment in 10-minute intervals over a 30 minute period. This change was then used to measure the percent change in the photosynthesis rate. We hypothesized that the higher the dilutions of laundry detergent in spinach and chard, they lower the photosynthetic rate will be. The chloroplast with no laundry detergent would then have the highest photosynthetic rate. Our results showed there was no significant difference between the four treatments, therefore we accepted our null hypothesize. This statistically insignificant difference could have happened because the time was too low for the laundry detergent to effect the chloroplast and/or the dilutions of the laundry detergent were not high enough to change the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a very complex process with many mechanisms and factors involved that are constantly influencing photosynthetic rate. A common household pollutant that has been shown to influence photosynthesis is laundry detergent [Azizullah, Richter, PeterHader: 2014]. Washing machines are connected with pipes to sewage for the discharge of dirty water with high concentration of detergent. The water is then released into local lakes, rivers, and groundwater where the plants intake this highly concentrated detergent polluted water. This has been shown to inhibit growth because, after 1 to 5 days, metabolic activity in plants have ceased [Jovanic, Bojovic, Panic, Radenkovic, and Despotovic: 2010].   By isolating chloroplast in both Spinacia oleracea (spinach) and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris (chard) we were able to measure the effects of 10% and 20% dilutions of Tide Free and Gentle laundry detergent on photosynthesis. Spinach and chard were used in the experiment because both these organism contains collections of chlorophyll, which helps plants absorb the energy from light.  We hypothesized that both the spinach and chard would have the highest absorbance and thus the lowest photosynthetic activity at the highest dilution of laundry detergent. We predicted this outcome because it has been shown that with the increasing concentration of detergents, there have been large disturbances to the ATP synthesis. The detergent has been shown to block ATP synthesis, therefore depleting the ATP abundance in the cell, and thus changing the outcome of photosynthesis [Aizdaicher and Markina: 2005]. Since ATP synthesis has a very important role in photosynthesis, the depletion of the ATP will slow down the light-dependent reaction. With a slower rate of the light-dependent reaction, there will, in turn, be a slower rate of glucose synthesized. We hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesis will decrease and reduce the products of photosynthesis.

Materials and Methods:
This study was performed by finding the chloroplast density of the spinach and the chard leaves, independently. The chloroplast culture of the spinach and chard was obtained by putting B-pellet into the RT-7 centrifuge twice, first for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm and then for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. The following chloroplast was combined in 23 test tubes, following the preparation guidelines in Table 1. There were three test tubes used for each different preparation and 2 blanks that allowed for two separate controls. The laundry detergent, Tide Free and Gentle, was diluted to 1/10 laundry detergent, 9/10 diluted H20 for 10% concentration and the 20% concentration was diluted to 2/10 laundry detergent, 8/10 diluted H20 for 20%. The test tubes were then transferred into 23 cuvettes, to measure the absorbance by using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance was read at 600nm every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. The cuvettes were placed at room temperature with normal light in between each reading. After all of the data was collected, the equation percent absorbance change=(absorbance at time 0-absorbance at time N)/(absorbance at time 0) was used to measure percent change in absorbance after each time interval. In order to determine if the data had a significant difference, a two sampled t-test was used. The independent variable was the dilutions of laundry detergent and the dependent variable was chloroplast in both spinach and chard.

Results:
The results from the following chard experiment showed that having chloroplast with no detergent had the largest percent change, meaning it had the highest rate of photosynthesis.  The two-tailed t-test that was performed concluded that there is no significant difference between the 10% detergent and non-detergent of the chard (t-stat:1.42, df: 4, p:0.23). Similar, there is no significant difference between the 20% detergent and non-detergent of the chard (t-stat:1.07, df: 4, p:0.35). Likewise, due to the high p-value, the difference between 10% detergent and non-detergent of the spinach can be concluded as statistically insignificant (t-stat:0.39, df: 4, p:0.72). The difference between 20% detergent and non-detergent of the spinach can also be concluded as statistically insignificant (t-stat:0.40, df: 4, p:0.73). Regarding this data, it is to be concluded that the four treatments (10% and 20% detergent and non-detergent) had no statistical difference, also shown in Figure 1 and 2. 

Discussion:
Due to our statistically insignificant results, we accept our null hypothesis that laundry detergent will have no change on the rate of photosynthesis. A reason that the photosynthetic rate did not change could be that there was not enough time to change the effect of the chloroplast. In one experiment, the plants were grown with laundry detergent for 21 days while we only showed the effect of 30 minutes [Jovanic, Bojovic, Panic, Radenkovic, and Despotovic: 2010]. Another experiment measured the effect of 24 hours on motile cells, which shows that we probably did not have a significant difference because of the timing [Aizdaicher and Markina: 2005].  Another reason that the percent change was not significant could be the dilutions we used for each test. 10% and 20% may not have been the strongest dilutions, and therefore they had a small effect on the photosynthetic process. Other scientists have used a diluted laundry detergent of various amounts, the highest being 1000ml of detergent [Azizullah, Richter, PeterHader: 2014].  Some potential error that could have an effect on the results is not recording the relative density of chloroplast. This could have led to less density of chloroplast in both spinach and chard, affecting the outcome of the experiment, inducing less of a change in the data.  Due to these facts, a follow-up experiment could test if more dilutions of laundry detergent had an effect on chloroplast with a longer span of time. The more highly concentrated and the longer the laundry detergent has to affect the experiment could lead to a higher change in the rate of photosynthesis, leading to better results. Overall, understanding the effect of common household environmental pollutants, such as laundry detergent, can help us reduce the effect of slowing down photosynthesis. This study also helps us understand the whole photosynthesis process and helps one understand where they should grow plants, how their plants can be healthy, and when the plants can be grown. Due to the significant importance of agriculture in our country, this study can help improve the system and save money for the agricultural industry.
