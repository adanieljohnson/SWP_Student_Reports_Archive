Title: Martin’s IGR’s Hindering of Manduca sexta Development

Abstract:
n/a

Introduction:
There are two main hormones that controll insect development: ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH is produced by the corpus allata, which is a pair of glands on both sides of the foregut. The primary function of ecdysterone (20E) is to regulate the timing of the molting. During molting, 20E tends to spike as JH decreases. During development, JH is used to regulate the type of molt [Johnson: 2018].The absence of JH during and after the commitment pulse is indicative of larva developing into a pupa. 

	In Case Study 1, we learned about Insect Growth Regulators that are used as an alternative to pesticides. IGRs can “interfere with or over-activate” processes that the hormones are uncharge of regulating [Johnson:2016]. During development, ecdysteroids and JH help regulate the metamorphosis process. JH levels tend to stay high in early development, up until the 4th larval instar phase, when JH decreases and 20E levels jump [Johnson: 2018]. Finally, when the larva approaches the pupa phase, around the commitment pulse, when there is a large increase in 20E and a decrease JH, almost to minuscule levelsApplying this knowledge, I hypothesize that adding an IGR that mimics JH to food, such as Martin’s, during the 4th larval instar phase will prevent commitment pulse, thus reducing growth and preventing the Manduca sexta from transitioning into a pupa. The dependent variables in this experiment are the length and mass of the Manduca sexta, and the independent variable is adding Martin’s IGR to the food.   	The main ingredient of Martin’s IGR is pyridine, which mimics the actions of  JH [fleascience]. The Manduca sexta is a perfect organism for this experiment, as the time it takes to grow from 4th instar larva to a pupa is around nine days, which works perfectly within the time we have for this lab [Johnson: 2018]. 


Materials and Method:
We will have two groups: a controll group and an experimental group, each with 4 caterpillars. Starting at the 4th larval instar, each caterpillar in the controll group will be fed 10 grams of food (Great Lakes Manduca [GLM]) diet. with 6 drops of distilled water per day, and every caterpillar in the experimental group will be fed 10 grams of feed with 6 drops of Martin’s IGR reagent. We will keep the caterpillars in containers with air holes poked into the lids. We will keep them at a constant temperature, and with a light cycle that is 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. Our variables will include observable data ouches length, mass, percent of food eaten, and structural development in the Manduca sexta. The statistical test we will use to interpretive data will be a two-tailed T-test, comparing the lengths and masses of the controll group vs. the experimental group. 


Results:
Figure 1, the Effect of Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta Average Length depicts the effect of the Martin’s IGR treatment on the average length of the Manduca sexta. The controll (blue bar) group was fed only GLM diet with distilled water, and the treatment group (red bar) was fed the GLM with Martin’s IGR added. The controll group’s average length was slightly greater than that of the treatment group, being 5.287 centimeters for the controll and 5.185 centimeters for the treatment group. Yet this difference is not substantial and does not suggest that the strong relationship between the difference of the lengths is due to the treatment; according to the two-sample t_test, the p_value was 0.771157. This suggests that there is only a 22.89% chance that the difference between the two sample sets is because of the treatments, which is not a significent chance. Another important figure to note from the t_test is the standard deviation. For the controll group, the standard deviation was 0.536 from the mean, and for the experimental group it was .262. 

	Figure 2 depicts the effect of Martin’s IGR on the average mass of the Manduca sexta. Just like Figure 1, the blue bar represents the average mass for the controll group, and the red bar represents the average mass of the treatment group. The difference in values is more prevalent here than in the average length group: 4.09 grams for the controll and 3.583 grams for the treatment group. This difference is enforced by the two-sample t_test, whose p_value was 0.488461, which tells us that there is a 51.15% chance that the difference in average mass for the sample groups was due to the treatment, which is much more promising than the chance for the average length group, yet still does not pass the significance threshold of 0.05. 


Discussion:
I do not believe that my hypothesis was proven correct. I hypothesized that in giving the Manduca sextas Martin’s IGR in their 4th larval instar phase would reduce growth compared to the controll group. Yet as the statistical tests make clear, the difference in length and mass is not caused by the treatments. Neither of the p_values (0.771157 and 0.488461) for the t_tests were less than 0.05, the significance level for this test, which means that the difference in length and mass that I observed between the controll and treatment group cannot be attributed to the addition of Martin’s IGR to the food in the treatment group. A study that supports this evaluation is by 
H. FREDERIK NIJHOUT and CARROLL M. WILLIAMS, titled “CONTROL OF MOULTING AND METAMORPHOSIS IN THE TOBACCO HORNWORM, MANDUCA SEXTA (L.): CESSA TION OF JUVENILE HORMONE SECRETION AS A TRIGGER
FOR PUPATION”. In this study, they study how JH changes the secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and how that affects development. PTTH is a hormone that affects the prothoracic glands, which release edcysteroids to promote molting. In essence, they discover that there is a mechanism in the insect that senses when JH has disappeared from its system, and signals to the brain to release PTTH, which leads to molting. [Nijhout: 1974]. And a most discovery of this group is that in the failure of this mechanism (i.e. an abnormal and persistent prevalence of Juvenile Hormone) can lead to a “developmental standstill” in the Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1974]. Another reason for the data that contradicted my hypothesis is the measurement of the length of the caterpillars. Due to their active nature and manner of moving, the length of the caterpillars could change drastically, when they were stretched out, or when they were contracted. The fault in this is that the measurements were probably inconsistent, as in someone may have measured when they were contracted, and another would measure during the stretched phase. To take this experiment to the next step, I would do two things. Firstly, I would eliminate the measurement of length as a determinant of development, and only measure mass. Secondly, I would extend the timeframe of the study to see if the Manduca sextas fed the IGR would not actually pupate.
