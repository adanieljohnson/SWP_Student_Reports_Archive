Title: Effects of Acetylcholine Inhibitor on Leg of Frog, Rania pipien

Abstract:
Similar to the endocrine system, the neuromuscular system works to communicate and stimulate certain areas of the body, but more specifically by using many neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is responsible for muscle contraction, which causes the release of calcium ions which activate muscle contraction. In this experiment, 0.1 Ml of acetylcholine inhibitors (2% sevin solution) were injected into the gastrocnemus muscle in order to analyze the effects of the strength of muscle contraction and the minimum threshold needed to stimulate muscle contraction in the presence and absence of 2% sevin solution. There was a total of three frog legs skinned and used, and without the presence of 2% sevin solution, they were considered the controll. The strength of muscle contraction and the minimum threshold of contraction were found in these legs and this same process was repeated but with the acetylcholine inhibitors injected into these three legs. The presence of acetylcholine inhibitors did indicate statistical significance in the strength of muscle contraction using the Paired T-test (t_stat = 3.018, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0235), but did not in the minimum threshold of contraction (t_stat = 1.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.423).

Introduction:
The endocrine and nervous (neuromuscular) systems work in similar ways, in the fact that they both function to aid the movement and controll of the body in response to certain stimuli. Despite this, they are also very distinct in their own way and functions. The neuromuscular system responds very quickly to a certain stimuli, only taking a few milliseconds to do so, whereas the endocrine system can take anywhere from a couple seconds to days in order to respond to a certain stimulus. Also, the endocrine system deals with sending signals over a long distance, whereas the nervous system mainly works to send signals to more local target cells. The neuromuscular system is specific to animals because fungi and plants do not have a similar system of rapid intercellular communication [Johnson 2016]. Within the neuromuscular systems of animals are skeletal muscles (both vertebrates and invertebrates), which are made of thousands of myofiber cells. These skeletal cells are innervated by motor neurons, creating neuromuscular junctions “connecting” the motor neurons with the skeletal muscle [Johnson 2016]. The motor neurons are responsible for receiving the action potential (AP), or signal/stimulus, and transmitting this signal to the skeletal muscle through the release of neurotransmitters. The best-known neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction and muscle movement is acetylcholine. Acetylcholine (Ach) is produced in nerve terminals from acetyl coenzyme A and choline, which is catalyzed by a certain enzyme (the name of this enzyme is not critical) [Purves: 2001]. Through the release of neurotransmitters from the motor neuron, it will ultimately create an AP in the skeletal muscle, thus releasing calcium and causing a muscle contraction (contractile mechanism) [Johnson 2016]. Once ACh is released from the presynaptic terminal, a hydolic enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is responsible for the reuptake of the neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft. Therefore, based upon this idea, one may find it interesting to speculate and research what would happen if this neurotransmitter were to be inhibited. It has been acknowledged that certain chemicals, such as organophosphates, can be extremely deadly due to the fact they inhbit acetylcholinesterase, which leads to a buildup of Ach in the synaptic cleft and thus neuromuscular paralysis [Purves: 2001]. Similar to this notion, a case study was performed by Lynn Wecker and Wolf-D. Dettbarn. Both worked with Paraoxon, which is an “organophosphorus cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitor,” or better known as an acetylcholine inhibitor. In their case study, they determined that the presence of Paraoxon in rats produces a “myopathy in skeletal muscle,” which is a disease within muscle tissue. The presence of Paraoxon ultimately broke down certain fiber structures within parts of the rat, ultimately debilitating the animal significently and led to necrosis and phagocytosis, which is the death of cells in an organ or muscle [Wecker: 1976]. However, within a 24-hour period after the Paraoxon was applied to the rat, there was significent recovery of enzyme activity. Likewise, in our experiment, we hope to see similar results, yet we will not cause necrosis and phagocytosis of cells within our organism. The sole focus of our experiment, similar to the case study of Wecker and Dettbarn, will be the inhibition of muscle activity using an acetylcholine inhibitor. In this experiment, the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors on the neuromuscular system of the leg of the Rania pipien (frog) will be analyzed and thus further analysis will include the strength of muscle contraction in the presence and without the presence of the inhibitors. The organism’s gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve will be isolated and will be stimulated by an electrical signal, again, at times in the presence or absence of acetylcholine inhibitors. The electrical signal will act as an AP and will be created using a SMT-100 or SMT-220 striated muscle transducer and which also records the strength of contraction within the gastrocnemus muscle. In our experiment, we hope to see that when an electrical signal is applied to the frog’s leg in the presence of acetylcholine inhibitor, the gastrocnemus muscle will not contract as strongly and thus be able to determine the effects of differing stimulus strengths, inhibitor concentrations, and the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors. The Rania pipien is an ideal organism to work with due to their small size, little cost, and the ease separating the skin from the muscle and the muscle from the sciatic nerve. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, as a group of four students, we received three legs of the Rania pipien and were responsible for dissecting these legs. On a dissection pan, we used forceps and fingers to gently grab the skin at the top of the leg and pull it down toward the foot. With the leg on the pan, we moistened the legs with Frog Ringer’s solution. Next, we used a dissecting probe and our fingers to separate the inner thigh muscles from the white sciatic nerve. Following this, scissors were used to separate one end of the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg by cutting the Achilles tendon. Afterwards, the whole leg was laid down on the pan while the gastrocnemus muscle had three strings tied around it varying heights. Two of the strings were attached to mid-section and lower section of the muscle, which were then attached to two probes that sent the electrical signal to the muscle. The other string was tied around the Achilles tendon and was attached to the muscle transducer so that when the muscle contracted, the amount of force could be recorded. The end of the set-up had the gastrocnemus muscle standing perpendicular to the leg and pan. This first set-up was considered to be the controlls; they did not have any outside chemicals, hormones, or inhibitors added to them. Therefore, for each leg, our group found the minimum controll threshold and the associated controll contraction. Next, the three legs were injected with a prescribed amount (0.1 Ml) of 2% sevin solution (acetylcholine inhibitor), using a syringe and pointing the needle down at a 45-degree angle into the muscle. These were the same original three legs considered to be the controll group, but because they were injected with 2% sevin solution, they then became our treatment/experimental group. As we did with the controll group, we determined the minimum treatment threshold and the associated treatment contraction of these three frog legs when acetylcholine inhibitors were added. To apply the acetylcholine inhibitors to the gastrocnemus muscle, we used a syringe to inject the solution into the muscle at a 45-degree angle. Throughout these series of muscle contraction experiments of these two groups, the controll and experimental groups, the data on the computer was produced on a myogram in order to analyze the effects of acetylcholine inhibitors on contractions. We will also use a Paired T-test to analyze our data.

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the minimum threshold and the strength of contraction by each leg was that the strength of contraction decreased in the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors, but the minimum threshold of contraction did not, and it increased for the most part. As can be seen in Figure 1, there is little, if any, difference between the controll and treatment minimum threshold.  . The thresholds for two of the legs remained at the same value, 0.05 and 0.1. When there was a change in threshold, it occurred in Leg 2, which initially had a threshold of 0.0375 and then a value of 0.042. The Paired T-test we ran for the minimum threshold of contraction gave us a p_value of 0.423 (t_stat = 1.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.423). The mean of the controll does not hold any significance over that of the experimental group for the minimum threshold of contraction because the p_value is significently larger than 0.05 (t_stat = 1.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.423). On average, the strength of contraction for each did decrease. The average difference between the controll and treatment for the strength of contraction in each leg was -0.0221. The Paired T-test we ran for the strength of contraction gave us a p_value of 0.0235 (t_stat = 3.018, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0235). The mean of the controll does hold significance over that of the experimental group for the strength of contraction because the p_value is lower than 0.05 (t_stat = 3.018, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0235).

Discussion:
As a group, we expected the threshold to increase in the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors because acetylcholine would be unable to bind to receptors, limiting the contraction. On the other hand, as expected and seen in Figure 1, when the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with acetylcholine inhibitors, the strength of the contraction decreased because less of the neurotransmitter could bind to a receptor and activate a muscle contraction. Based upon on our data, the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors did in fact limit the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle, however we cannot be certain. The reason why the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors is significent is because for all three legs, the strength of contraction did decrease and as shown in Figure one, the data was statistically significent because the p_value was less than 0.05 (t_stat = 3.018, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0235). Despite this, the reason why we cannot reach the certain conclusion that the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors did in fact cause cessation of a muscle contraction is because the p_value for the minimum threshold of contraction was greater than 0.05 (t_stat = 1.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.423), meaning that the data was not significently significent. Overall, the minimum threshold did not really change between the controll and treatment groups but the strength of contraction between each group did. The average difference between the controll group and the treatment group for the strength of contraction was -0.0221, meaning all of the strength of contraction values did decrease in the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors. It is generally known that the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors leads to a lack of muscle contraction. The enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, is responsible for terminating the impulse transmission through the hydrolysis of acetylcholine. The presence of acetylcholine inhibitors, such as 2% sevin, should inactivate the enzyme and which should lead to the neurotransmitter building up, hyperstimulating nicotinic and muscarinic receptors [Čolović: 2013]. The inactivation of the enzyme and the buildup of the neurotransmitter will lead to a disruption of neurotransmission, and thus a cessation of muscle contraction. In contrast, within our own lab, this was not clearly seen in terms of the minimum threshold values. This may have been to a multitude of factors. One factor may have been that when the frog legs were prepared and sitting on the pan after being skinned, they did not receive the appropriate amount of Frog Ringer Solution. The Frog Ringer Solution is responsible for providing each frog leg with a sufficient amount of ATP in order to maintain muscle contraction and it is important not to add too much of the solution to the Frog’s leg because this could result in negative effects when recording data. When Frog Ringer Solution is added, it causes an increase in calcium flux during activity and a calcium fraction is released, which has a further effect on mechanical activity. In other cases, it has been found that certain solutions have lower than normal levels of calcium, thus negatively affecting muscle contraction, which could have been another possibility for error [Curtis: 1963]. In our experiment, there may have been too much Frog Ringer Solution added to each frog leg and as a result, skewed the data and prevented any increase in the threshold values. A supplemental amount of this solution could have outweighed the effects of the acetylcholine inhibitors. Another possible factor could have been that there was leftover Frog Ringer Solution left on the pan and that it was not wiped clean, which could have potentially affected the next controll leg, causing minimal or no increase in the threshold. The Frog Ringer Solution contains calcium ions, which play a crucial role in the coupling of events within the skeletal muscle. Another factor may have been that not enough 2% sevin solution was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog. The very first leg that we worked with did not receive enough solution from the injection because there was no initial difference between that of the controll and that of the treatment in the strength of contraction. Because of this, our group had to adjust and inject more solution into the muscle than what was originally prescribed. Many of these possible factors could have been reason for a lack of difference between the treatment and controll minimum thresholds. Based on our results for the minimum thresholds, we cannot reject our null hypothesis. Our experiment did not run exactly parallel as that of rats injected with Paraoxon, in that the presence of acetylcholine inhibitors did not increase the minimum thresholds. Therefore, part of our hypothesis was not supported by our data. In order to improve our data if we were to do this experiment again, we should be careful to wipe the pan of Frog Ringer Solution and other liquids after each use of a leg and apply a proper amount of Frog Ringer Solution to each leg.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Minimum Threshold and Strength of Contraction for three legs of Rania pipien in the presence and absence of acetylcholine inhibitor. The controll minimum threshold for each leg is represented by a blue bar, whereas the treatment minimum threshold for each leg is represented by an orange bar. Since the controll minimum thresholds and the treatment minimum thresholds produced certain values, there are no error bars. The Paired T-test we ran for the minimum threshold for contraction for the controll and treatment groups gave us a p_value of 0.423 (t_stat = 1.0, d.f. = 2, P = 0.423).  The controll contraction for each leg is represented by a grey bar, whereas the treatment contraction for each leg is represented by a yellow bar. Since the controll and treatment contractions are compared between three legs with multiple trials, there are standard deviation error bars. The Paired T-test we ran for the strength of contraction for the controll and treatment groups gave us a p_value of 0.0235 (t_stat = 3.018, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0235).
