Title: How Precor Affects the Growth of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This study’s main objective is to detect if Precor affects the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. As an IGR, Precor, specifically the methoprene in Precor, keeps the insect from growing through the metamorphosis stages to stop infestations. The alternate hypothesis is that if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor in their food, then their weight will differ from those not exposed to Precor. The treatment group consisting of four caterpillars were given ten grams food with no Precor while the control group consisting of four caterpillars was given ten grams of food with five drops of Precor. Each caterpillar was weighed every day and then the average of each day for the control and treatment groups was recorded. There was no statistical significance between the control group and the treatment group, so the alternate hypothesis was rejected. However, there was a mistake in the process of the experiment in which the caterpillars were never given fresh food, so they began to starve. Therefore, the effect of Precor on the caterpillars could not be analyzed properly and the experiment would need to be done properly by giving the caterpillars fresh food every day. 

Introduction:
Precor is an IGR, an Insect Growth Regulator. Precor is used to prevent the insect from reaching its adult stages by targeting its larval stage, as is the purpose of an IGR (Csondes, 2004). The main ingredient of Precor is methoprene (Csondes, 2004). Methoprene is the chemical that halts the growth of the insect before it reaches its adult stage (Csondes, 2004). The insects would not be killed by Precor because it is not toxic to insects (Csondes, 2004). Precor works at its best when it is sprayed prior to the infestation of pests (Cilek, 1987). This IGR is used in indoor environments to specifically prevent flea infestations (Cilek, 1987). However, in this experiment Precor will be used in attempt to see its effect on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Our objective is to find out if the amount of Precor solution mixed in with the food of the caterpillars will affect the growth and subsequently the size of the caterpillars. Will the amount of Precor solution mixed in with the food affect the weight of the caterpillars? The dependent variable is the amount of Precor solution mixed into the food and the independent variable is the weight of the caterpillars. The Biological Null hypothesis for this experiment is if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor in their food, then their weight will not be affected. The Biological Alternate Hypothesis is if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor, then their weight will differ from those not exposed to Precor in their food. The Statistical Null hypothesis is that there is no statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to Precor in their food will be affected. The Statistical Alternate hypothesis is that there is statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to Precor in their food will differ from the weight of those not exposed to Precor. 

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by separating eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups of four. One group of caterpillars will be the control group and the other group will be a treatment group. There will be two caterpillars in each container with a perforated top. The two caterpillars will be separated by an index card. The treatment group will be separated in the same way. Each caterpillar in the control group will receive ten grams of food with five drops of distilled water and no Precor mixed in by using a pipet. The treatment group will also receive ten grams of food but their food will be mixed with five drops of Precor by using a pipet. The four containers will then be placed into an incubator. Every day for seven days at 1:00 pm the caterpillars will be weighed by using a weigh boat and a scale. Each weight will be recorded. At the end of the experiment, the weights of the control group on each day will be averaged as well as the weights of the treatment group. The data will be analyzed using the two tailed t-test. The results of the two tailed t-test will determine the affectedness of Precor as an IGR.



Results:
In Day 1 through Day 6, there was a steady increase in the average weight of the caterpillars for both the control and treatment groups. However, on Day 7 the average weight for both the treatment group and the control group decreased from Day 6. On all of the Days except for Day 3 and Day 4, the average weight of the control group was higher than the average weight of the treatment group. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.034, df = 12, P = 0.973). Because there was no statistical significance, the alternate hypothesis was rejected while the null hypothesis was accepted. 

Discussion:
The experiment contained a source of error that affected the results as a whole. Every day the caterpillars were weighed the food was not refreshed. So, the caterpillars were slowly running out of food. Towards the end of the seven days there was no food left, so it is impossible to see if Precor affected the caterpillars or not. If we refreshed the food every day with giving the control group regular food and giving the treatment group the food with Precor, we would be able to see if the Precor changed their weight or not compared to the control group. Instead, the weight of the caterpillars decreased on day seven because they were starved and completely ran out of food. In order to genuinely test the hypothesis, we would have needed to give the caterpillars fresh food every day. The next step is to modify the experiment and repeat it by making fresh food every day with and without Precor for the treatment and control groups. It is difficult to analyze the data to talk more about the effect of IGR’s and the Juvenile Hormone in general due to the starvation of the caterpillars and the mistake in our procedure.
