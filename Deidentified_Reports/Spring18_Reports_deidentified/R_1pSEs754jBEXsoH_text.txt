Title: the effects of vision of intraspecific behaviors of Betta Splendins 

Abstract:
Betta fish are known for their aggression. Aggression that has only amplified after years of human cultivation. Previous studies have shown the bettas ability for increased agression under specific environmental conditions. However; there is little in terms of how the betta vision effects its aggression. To observe this trait we tested bettas' aggresssion in two environments,one clear one muddy, and saw that the bettas ability to carry out aggressive behavior is effected by vision 

Introduction:
When put together, Bettas will perform a series of increasingly aggressive displays beginning with flickering of the pelvic fin followed by tail beating and tail flashing( Manuel). These interactions reach peak aggression when a protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane called the "red mane” extends from the fishes opercula in a facing display. This is the fish at max aggression and is quickly followed by an altercation. These behaviors happen in strong burst in properly controllled environments such as aquariums; however, this quickly changes when the fish is placed in an environment with fluctuating or abnormal conditions. For instance, Betta placed in a warmer than usual environment were seen to have a general  increase in activity even those including aggression(Forsatkar). Bettas have also shown to be somewhat indiscriminate to the other Betts that aggression is shown to, be it a robotic fish that triggers increase aggression(Romano et al.) or aggression shown to a mirror image of the fish(Arnott et al.). What these results show is that better behavior can be influenced by environmental factors; however, one aspect missing is the sensory ability of the fish and how that effects the fishes aggression. In this experiment, we will be looking at how fish perform in clear water and opaque water to answer the question if betta aggression levels are affected by the visibility in its environment. It is expected that as visibility goes down, aggression will follow. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment we will be looking at three Betta Splendins individuals, two males and one female. They will first be put in a tank that is operated by opaque barriers so they will not be able to see each other. We are first examining how the fish would operate in the translucent water first. To do this we will remove a barrier separating two fish and examine the amount of aggressive behavior exhibited by each fish in a five minute interval. Aggression here will be quantified by a point system where one point is awarded to pelvic fin beating, two points for spreading of the gill covers and tail beating, and three points for the red mane and tail flashing.   After five minutes, the fish will be separated again and allowed to rest for five minutes before the test is run again with the third fish. After all the fish are given a chance to interact, they will be moved to a tank with muddy water where the same process will be repeated. After the tests, the data will be analyzed using a paired t_test in order to see the change of the same group under two different test scenarios. 



Results:
The results of the T-test showed a huge difference in mean values and any other related values as the amount of aggression seen under both condition were vastly different(t_stat=1.58, d.f.=9, P=1.47)


Discussion:
The results seem to support the hypothesis that the visibility in the tank directly effects the amount of aggression that the better will exhibit, this is only supported by the statistically significent figure shown between the total score of the Bettas before and after the treatment was administered. This would seem to suggest that the aggression behavior performed by the better is highly visual, which reflects the finding found when the beta was put up next to its reflection. This is interesting as the muddy environment more closely reflects its natural habitat.
