Title: The effect of increased aggression with the presence of structure on male Betta splendins agnostic behaviors 

Abstract:
Competition is a common theme in animal survival because resources are often limited. All animals have certain behaviors that they demonstrate when they threaten competitors. Betta splendins display agnostic behaviors towards one another by spreading their fins and attacking. The purpose of this experiment was to study how male Betta fish react to one another with the presence of structure. Such a structure would include a piece of hollowed out driftwood, providing a place for the fish to hide from competitors. We hypothesized that the presence of structure would cause the male Betta fish to be more aggressive towards one another because they will strive to controll the structure and gain a shelter. The results indicated that there was no significent difference between the agnostic behavior with no shelter and the agnostic behavior with shelter. Therefore it cannot be concluded that the presence of structure affects agnostic behaviors of male Betta fish by making them more aggressive. This newly found knowledge will be helpful in allowing scientists to better understand the competitive behaviors of Betta splendins as well as other species of fish.

Introduction:
Aggression is one of the key aspects of a fish's behavior because it allows the fish to assert dominance over other fish of the same species, and enables the fish to have a better chance of survival in the cases of accessing optimal habitat.  Aggression is defined as including the manifestations of aggression and submissiveness by individuals in conflict situations and is a universal form of behavior found in animals of different species [Kudryavtesa, N.: 1998]. Male Betta fish use these behaviors to impress females and controll territory. In this experiment, we will examine how the presence of shelter affects males' agnostic behaviors toward one another.
	The proposed question is whether male Betta fish become more aggressive toward each other in the presence of shelter, keeping in mind the costs and benefits of aggression. A display of aggression costs the individual energy and may put him in danger of getting injured in a fight. The benefits are that the individual will win females and habitat space. The results will help scientists better understand how species react to shelter and will give a better understanding of how important it is to species to have a shelter available to them when there are competitors around. We hypothesized that when there is structure present, the male Bettas will become more aggressive in order to controll the shelter for their own interests. 


Materials and Method:
The experiment was conducted by placing two male Betta fish in a tank with a glass divider between them. Their behavior was observed for five minutes, recording how long they were aggressive for with a stopwatch. The determining factors for aggression were fin flaring, gill flaring, broadside movements, and facial movements, along with tail flapping. The fish then rested for five minutes by putting an opaque divider in between them. After this rest period, the opaque divider was removed, and the glass divider was inserted. Then two structures were put in, one with each Betta, and the fish's aggression was timed using the same standards. The two Bettas were swapped for two new males, and the process was repeated. Then the Bettas were changed once more, and the process was repeated one more time. The data collection was the timed aggression out of five minutes. The time of aggression was divided by the total time of five minutes and the average was taken of the three trials with shelter and without shelter. Finally, a paired t test was run with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
The graph of the average aggression times is seen below (Figure 1). The trend shows that there is more aggression in male Betta fish's behavior when there is a shelter present compared to there being no shelter present (Figure 1). The mean and standard deviation for aggression time ratio in the presence with no shelter was 0.418+/-0.40. The mean and standard deviation for aggression ratio with shelter was 0.458+/-0.35. The paired t test results were p=0.691, d.f.=5, t=0.422. The results were not significently different at the 0.05 alpha level.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support the hypothesis. However, other studies have shown that male Siamese fighting fish alter their behavior based on both external cues, the sex of the audience, and internal cues, reproductive state and resource possession [Dziewecynski, Teresa: 2005]. 
	A biological explanation for why the data were not significently different is that the Betta fish were in a continuously stressful environment, despite having the brief rest time, and this stress caused them to be afraid and act abnormally, resulting in a flaw in the data results. The progression of appearance of symptoms under intensifying stress levels may be interrupted temporarily as homeostasis and homeorhetic mechanisms intercede. Inability to cope leads to further dysfunctions [Rapport, D.: 1985]. Another biological explanation is that one of the Bettas was an outlier and did not show even the slightest aggression in the presence of another male Betta, which is very odd for this species. This outlier Betta may have caused the average aggression ratio to decrease drastically. Upon removing the outlier and running the paired t test, the results were still not significently different with p =0.71, d.f.=4, t=0.38. Therefore, the outlier did not play as significent of a role as anticipated. In conclusion, this and other experiments will help provide scientists with new information on competition and animal behavior that will help them better understand how organisms respond to their environment to survive.
