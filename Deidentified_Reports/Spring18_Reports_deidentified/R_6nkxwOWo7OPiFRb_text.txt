Title: The Comparison of Weight of Manduca sexta After Increased Juvenile Hormone Consumption 

Abstract:
	The Manduca sexta is a species of moth that undergoes a holometabolous life cycle. This life cycle is regulated by two dominant hormones: Ecdysterone, regulating the timing of the molting process and Juvenile Hormone, regulating the type of molting that takes place. The objective of the experiment was to observe the weight of M. sexta over a period of seven days. Our hypothesis was the increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will cause the weight of the M. sexta to increase. In this experiment, Juvenile Hormone was manipulated to stimulate an abnormal increase of the hormone by incorporating 10 drops Precor (Methoprene) at 1: 1250 concentration into the 10g diet of the treatment group and only 10 drops of water into the 10g diet of the controll group. The caterpillars were weighed and fed 10g of food every day for seven days. A two-sample t_test displayed that the results were statistically insignificent (t_stat=0.316, d.f.=6, P=0.763). This information determines that there is an unlikely probability that the observed value, weight, is a significent effect of increased juvenile hormone. 

Introduction:
Hormonal function is essential to the process of homeostasis and the maintenance of life cycles within an organism. The Manduca sexta, also referred to the Tobacco Hornworm, is an example of an insect that uses hormones to guide development. The M. sexta, like all moths, develops through a holometabolous life cycle consisting of four major life stages: the embryonic stage, the larval stage, the pupal stage and adulthood [Sanes: 1976]. Natural development through hormones, paired with clear life stages, makes the M. sexta a common insect of study. The four stages of the holometabolous life cycle are regulated by Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH), the three main hormones found in insects [Johnson: 2018]. However, 20E and JH are the dominant hormones used in the progression of the “five larval instars, separated by molts” that determine the timing of the molt and the type of molt that occurs [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile Hormone production is significently reduced after the fourth larval instar, indicating to the insect that the next instar will entail development into adulthood. Juvenile Hormone can be manipulated to stimulate or inhibit abnormal amounts of production after the fourth instar to regulate the insect’s development based on natural environmental conditions, like temperature [Wyatt: 1996]. Juvenile Hormone can be artificially produced for experimentation to study the effects of the hormone on the life cycle of M. sexta. Therefore, raising the research question “Does the overproduction of Juvenile Hormone during the life cycle create significent weight gain of the insect that ingests it?” An independent variable of the amount of Juvenile Hormone placed in the insect’s food can be studied for its effects on the dependent variable, the weight gain of the M. sexta. We predict that the increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will cause the weight of the M. sexta to increase.  

Materials and Method:
The experiment was conducted with eight M. sexta caterpillars chosen before passing through the Commitment Pulse, each weighing between .95g and 1.60g. The Commitment Pulse is a small burst of 20E before the 5th larval instar that indicates to the insect that it is the correct size and has “enough stored nutrients” for pupation into adulthood to occur [Johnson: 2018]. The M. sexta were then divided into four pairs. Each pair was placed into a transparent feeding container, separated by a barrier to ensure food was not shared amongst the insects (Fig. 1). A perforated lid was secured on the container to enclose the insects. Each group received one of two diets, the controll diet (consumed by four caterpillars) of the treatment diet (consumed by four caterpillars). Those in the controll diet received 10g of M. sexta food made as directed by the manufacturer with 10 drops of water. Those in the treatment diet received 10g of M. sexta with 10 drops of Precor (Methoprene) at 1: 1250 concentration to stimulate the effects of Juvenile Hormone. The M. sexta were kept in the same incubator at 23⁰C. The M. sexta were weighed each day for seven days and the measurement was recorded. Every day, 10g of food, according to their assigned diet, was added to the food left from the previous day. On the seventh day, the final weight measurement was recorded. A two-tailed t_test was performed on the data to test significance between the controll group, that consumed normal food; and the treatment group, that consumed food with Juvenile Hormone mixed in.   

Results:
The M. sexta caterpillars shared similar values of total growth from the initial values to the final values of weight observed (Fig. 2). However, numerical data suggests that the controll group found slightly higher amounts of growth, despite an outlier in the treatment group. The mean of the final weight of the controll group was 10.55g while the mean of the final weight of the treatment group was 10.89g (Fig. 3). The treatment group appeared to be lighter in color on the seventh day of observation and data collection. This group appeared to have a layer of skin covering them while the controll groups showed more vibrancy in color. The treatment group also produced more fecal matter than the controll group. A two-sample t_test was conducted to compare the controll group to the treatment group. The results were statistically insignificent in this experiment (t_stat=0.316, d.f.=6, P=0.763). Meaning that the probability of weight being a significent factor in the difference between the controll group and the treatment group is low.  

Discussion:
The two-tailed t_test performed on the data suggests that the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different from the treatment group (t_stat=0.316, d.f.=6, P=0.763). This indicates that the experiment’s hypothesis was not supported. The data collected of the initial weight of the M. sexta to the final weight collected on the seventh day depicts growth that is limited in variety (Fig. 4). However, the statistical null hypothesis of the experiment was supported: the increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will not cause the weight of the M. sexta to increase. Juvenile Hormone is necessary for the life cycle process to occur in insects. Because Juvenile Hormone is responsible for the type of molt that the M. sexta is signaled to have, it was hypothesized in this experiment that the M. sexta would gain weight because its molt would continue to create a larger body, trying to transition to the next stage, however failing due to the hormone imbalance [Johnson: 2018]. The findings that weight is not significently affected by the overproduction of Juvenile Hormone during metamorphosis is supported by recent and ongoing research about the effects of Juvenile Hormone on the life cycle process of insects.
	A study on Juvenile Hormone was conducted by Riddiford in 2010 on Drosophila melanogaster, also referred to as the fruit fly [Nijhout: 1974]. Because M. sexta and D. melanogaster have similar holometabolous life cycle, the results can be relayed to understand that processes that take place within the insects. The study found that those lacking Juvenile Hormone at a younger stage have abnormally small puparia [Nijhout: 1974]. However, when the D. melanogaster were introduced to Juvenile Hormone in their final instar, the attained normal weight [Nijhout: 1974]. This study found that Juvenile Hormone does not focus on the weight of the insect to continue the molts. Rather, it is critical for establishing growth rate to ensure that the insect remains proportional with working body parts to prevent malnutrition until the hormones have received information from a stimulus that it is possible to enter the 5th instar towards adulthood. In another study conducted by Cymborowski in 1982 once more suggests that weight gain is not a significent factor in the production of Juvenile Hormone for the life cycles of insects. In this study, the M. sexta in the experiment were starved for a total of five days beginning “…after ecdysis to the 5th instar” [Cymborowski: 1982]. Beginning on the fourth day, there was an increase in the amount of Juvenile Hormone present in the life cycle. In turn, causing a reduced and slowed growth process of the M. sexta [Cymborowski: 1982]. The increased amount of Juvenile Hormone on the fifth day, in which metamorphosis takes place, was prevented because it inhibited the ability of PTTH and ecdysterone to flourish in the system. Once more suggesting that Juvenile Hormone is critical to the regulation of proportionate growth rather than the regulation of the overall size of the insect, for example, weight. 
	Error was present in the experiment based on construction of the feeding containers. There were several instances in which one M. sexta breeched the barrier and entered the side of the other in that container. This behavior was demonstrated in treatment number 3 crawling into the cage of treatment number 4, controll number one entering the side of controll number 2, and controll number 3 entering the side of number four twice. Each time this occurrence was noticed, minor structural repairs were performed. In this situation, the controll group and the experiment group were not compromised because they were eating the same type of food. However, it is uncertain if one caterpillar received more food than the other by actively feeding on the wrong side. Though only placed together for a short time, this finding could have caused the M. sexta to gain weight evenly and had a slight skew on the results. For this reason, it would be appropriate to obtain another sample of M. sexta to have a basis to compare. 
	In summation, the holometabolous life cycle demonstrated in the M. sexta caterpillar is an important process that provides information on the effects of hormones in controllling bodily processes and development. Though the hypothesis of the experiment was disproved by the two-sample t_test, it suggests that the Juvenile Hormone has many significent effects on the insect including the type of molt it undergoes, the size of the insect when it molts and regulation of steady growth throughout the process. With an increasing global population size, mass farming is a necessity to provide goods to the public. However, pesticides that allow larger crop yields could cause significent damage to the surrounding ecosystems. Therefore, the study of the hormones within insects and how they are affected by environmental stimuli is important in the search for products that are both safe for the environment and that can provide significent agricultural benefits.

Figure 1. This figure depicts a methodological preparation of the enclosure of the M. sexta throughout the experiment. A pair of M. sexta caterpillars should be placed in a clear container for light to enter and visual observation to occur. A barrier should be in place so that no contact is made between the pair of M. sexta caterpillars. This barrier will ensure that the correct amount of food is consumed by the caterpillar and one will not eat from the other’s food. Only pairs from the controll group and pairs from the treatment group should be placed in the same container to ensure that the controll group is not accidentally exposed to the food of the treatment group. 

Figure 2. This bar graph depicts the comparison between the initial weight and the final weight of the controll and treatment groups. The initial weight (white bars)  and the final weight (black bars) show little visual difference between the treatment and controll groups. Four caterpillars were placed in each group. The controll group received manufactured M. sextafood with ten drops of water for seven days. The treatment group received manufactured M. sexta food with ten drops of artificial Juvenile Hormone. The weights were determined by weighing the M. sexta on a balanced scale. Each bar is their overall growth.

Figure 3. This bar graph depicts the comparison between the mean of the initial weight (white bars) of the controll group and the mean of the initial weight of the experimental group. The graph also depicts the mean of the final weight (black bars) of the controll group in comparison to the mean of the final weight experimental group. The weights were determined by weighing the M. sexta on a balanced scale. Each bar is their overall growth.

Figure 4. This figure demonstrates the similarities in the overall growth of the experimental M. sexta caterpillars over seven days. The line graph on the left depicts the growth of Control 1, Control 2, Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. The line graph on the right depicts the growth of Control 3, Control 4, Experiment 3 and Experiment 4. Though the groupings demonstrate significent similarities, their groupings have no statistical or numerical reasoning. Rather, they are divided into groups for comparison purposes only and to portray the data clearly. The weights were determined by weighing the M. sexta on a balanced scale. Each bar is their overall growth.
