Title: Lanthanum Chloride decreases the minimum contraction threshold of a gastrocnemius muscle in a Rana pipiens 

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine how lanthanum chloride would affect the minimum threshold of a muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens frog. Knowing that lanthanum chloride usually acts as a calcium channel blocker and that the presence calcium ions were needed for skeletal muscle contraction, we hypothesized that that if we block the calcium channels with 1mM of Lanthanum Chloride, then it will require a larger stimulus to produce a muscle contraction and the minimum threshold value will increase. However, this hypothesis didn’t account for the potential effects that this specific concentration of the Lanthanum Chloride might have on the calcium channels and our evidence that we collected did not support our hypothesis. We collected evidence by comparing the amplitudes of the muscle contraction at the minimum threshold values before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride and did this on three different Rana pipiens legs (P-value = 0.048). The results that we found concluded that average minimum contraction threshold decreased after the injection of the Lanthanum Chloride. 


Introduction:
In this lab, we will be studying the muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle in a Rana pipiens frog. The gastrocnemius muscle is a skeletal muscle found on the back portion of the lower leg. Like frogs, human too have this muscle so by studying the reactions of this muscle is a Rana pipiens, we get a sense of how our own muscle contractions would react to different stimuli. Skeletal muscle contraction begins when action potentials arrives at the neuromuscular junction and the depolarization of the neuron causes acetylcholine to be released from the presynaptic nerve terminal and bind to its receptor, thus causing the post-synaptic membrane to generate an action potential that travels down the t-tubules. When the action potential travels down a t-tubule, the DHP receptor protein is activated and calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium ions diffuse into the sarcoplasm, they bind to troponin and this binding causes a conformation change that allows troponin to push tropomyosin out of the way, exposing the actin-myosin binding site. Myosin heads bind to actin at the binding site and when they do so the heads bend. This bend in the myosin heads exerts a small force that pulls the actin filaments in. The actin filaments slide in, causing the sarcomere to shorten and the muscle to contract. In this experiment, we will specifically we looking at the effect that blocking the calcium channels, by injecting 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, has on the threshold of the muscle contraction. In a study done on newborn chicks, Lanthanum Chloride was found to inhibit the calcium binding to the brain synaptosomal membrane [Basu: 1982], leading us to believe that Lanthanum Chloride might have similar effect on the binding of calcium in skeletal muscles and block the calcium ions from binding to troponin. If the calcium can’t bind to troponin, troponin can’t move tropomyosin out of the way of the actin-myosin binding site, and then no cross bridges can be formed and a contraction will not occur. With this knowledge of the role of calcium in muscle contraction, we hypothesize that if we block the calcium channels with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, then it will require a larger stimulus to produce a muscle contraction and the minimum threshold value will increase.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment designed to test how Lanthanum Chloride will affect the minimum threshold of a muscle contraction, we obtained 3 frog legs from the same Rana pipiens frog. The first step was to gently separate the gastrocnemius muscle and a portion of the Achilles tendon from the rest of the leg. We then positioned the muscle in a vertical 90-degree angle to expose the sciatic nerve. Once the sciatic nerve was exposed, we laid the nerve across two metal wires that were attached to the end of a positive and negative probes. The probes were attached to a high voltage stimulator and this stimulator was connected to a program on our computers called LabScribe that picked up and recorded the stimuli. We first found the minimum threshold of the frog leg before any chemical was injected; this value is used as our control variable. To do this, we adjusted the amplitude of the stimulus until we saw a twitch in the frog muscle and a myogram appeared on our screen. We recorded lowest stimulus that we saw a twitch occur as our minimum threshold. Once found this minimum threshold as our baseline, we used a syringe to inject 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle. Once the chemical was injected, we waited 8 minutes for the chemical to spread throughout the muscle before applying another stimulus. We then repeated the process of finding a minimum threshold, this time of a muscle that had been injected with Lanthanum Chloride. The entire process was performed on 3 separate legs. We used the average of each threshold (before and after injection) to conduct a paired t-test that compared the minimum threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle contraction of a Rana pipiers frog before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride.


Results:
After running a paired T-Test, we found that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean minimum contraction threshold before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride (t-stat = 4.378, df = 2, P = 0.0484). As shown in Figure 1, the average minimum contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle before the injection of Lanthanum chloride was 0.134 +/- 0.053 volts. This means that before the injection, the lowest possible stimulus that the muscle will contract at is a stimulus to the sciatic nerve of 0.134 volts. On the other hand, the average minimum contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of Lanthanum chloride was 0.0707 +/- 0.078 volts. The average difference of the threshold before and after the injection is .0629 +/- 0.0248. The results show that the average minimum contraction threshold decreased after the injection of the Lanthanum Chloride, meaning that a smaller stimulus was needed to create a contraction.  One thing to be warry of in our results is that the standard deviation of the “after injection” data group is larger than the mean itself. This means that the variation in the data points is greater than the mean, thus why we see the standard error bar go past zero in Figure1. 


Discussion:
Our experiment results do not support our hypothesis that that if we block the calcium channels with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, then the minimum threshold will increase. When we injected the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens frog with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, the average minimum threshold decreased and this decrease proved to be statistically significant. One possible reason for the decrease in minimum threshold may be due to the concentration of Lanthanum Chloride that me used (1 µM). A study published in BioMetals Scientific Journal in 2000, looked at the effect that Lanthanum Chloride had on the plasma membrane activities of rice seedling roots. In this experiment, the activity of Calcium ATPase was increased in the presence of 60 µM of Lanthanum Chloride but Calcium ATPase activity decreased dramatically when 80 µM of Lanthanum chloride were present, proving that when Lanthanum Chloride concentration is above a certain level, it has reverse effects [Zheng: 2000]. In muscle contraction, Calcium ATpase sequesters Ca2+ into the Sarcoplasmic reticulum which induces and maintains muscle relaxation. For this reason, we can see why if Calcium ATPase activity is increased by lower concentration of Lanthanum Chloride, then the muscle more likely to stay in a relaxed state and it will take a larger stimulus to induce muscle contraction. On the reverse side, if higher concentrations of Lanthanum Chloride are present, then calcium ATPase will be less active, the muscle will not need as much stimulus to create a contraction, and the minimum threshold of the muscle contraction will be lower. It is possible that this is what happened in our experiment. Even though 1 µM does not seem like a high concentration, it is possible that in relation to the skeletal muscle cells in a Rana pipiens frog, this is a high concentration and the high concentration of Lanthanum Chloride had a reverse effect on muscle contraction than we had expected. This experiment was not considered when we started our experiment and made our hypothesis. We thought that the calcium channels in skeletal muscles would be effected in a similar way as they were in the baby chicks experiment in which Lanthanum Chloride was found to inhibit the calcium binding to the brain synaptosomal membrane [Basu: 1982].  To test of this explanation to our findings is correct, we would need to run the experiment again with lower concentrations of lanthanum chloride and see if this change caused the minimum threshold of muscle contraction to be higher.
