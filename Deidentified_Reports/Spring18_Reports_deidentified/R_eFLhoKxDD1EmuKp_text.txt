Title: Inhibiting Ecdysterone in Manduca Sexta Caterpillars Prevents Growth

Abstract:
This study focused on Manduca sexta caterpillars by testing an inhibiting drug, Azaguard, on the caterpillars. Azaguard inhibits ecdysterone, which signals to the caterpillar when to molt [Johnson:2018]. This study hypothesized that Azaguard prevents growth of developing M. sexta caterpillars. The results of our experiments supported our hypothesis, with a p-value of 3.92E-5, which is below 0.05. The treatment group of caterpillars received Azaguard in their daily food supply, while the control group continued to feed on a normal diet. This experiment took place over an eight-day period. Inhibiting the ecdysterone, results in the caterpillar to receive no signal to grow in size in preparation of molting and metamorphosis, which is why we saw results that supported the hypothesis that inhibition of ecdysterone prevents weight gain in M. sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
	The Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is a holometabolous insect, meaning that it undergoes four stages of life: egg, larva, pupa, and adult [Johnson:2018].  The M. sexta molts and goes through metamorphosis, to develop to the next life stage. The goal of this study is to determine the effects of ecdysterone on the M. sexta caterpillar during its development. M. sexta is a helpful organism to study because it is easy to manage. In addition, because it is a holometabolous insect, it goes through metamorphosis and various life stages, we can test how the presence or inhibition of certain hormones affect the development of the M. sexta caterpillars in developing to the next life stage, which in this case is an adult. Ecdysterone is an insect hormone, also known as 20E, that is secreted by the prothoracic glands, and regulates the timing of molting in developing insects [Dreier:1987]. In this study, we used Azaguard, an ecdysterone inhibitor that contains Azadirachtinm, in the food of one group of some developing M. sexta caterpillars to test the effects of ecdysterone and what occurs when it is inhibited, as opposed to when the organism is left to develop naturally, as was the case in the control group of this experiment. It was hypothesized that blocking ecdysterone prevents weight gain in developing M. sexta caterpillars. This was the hypothesis that we came to a consensus on, with the knowledge that ecdysterone is responsible for signaling the insect to molt. When ecdysterone is inhibited, in this case by Azaguard, the insect will likely receive no hormonal signal, or a very weak signal, to molt. Therefore, the insects of the treatment group are likely to not grow as much or gain weight in comparison to the control group, because the caterpillars in the treatment group have no molt or metamorphosis to adulthood to prepare for, which is why our hypothesis states that the inhibition of ecdysterone will prevent weight gain, the dependent variable, in M. sexta caterpillars. 


Materials and Methods:
To complete this experiment, we collected eight M. sexta caterpillars, before they had reached the commitment pulse, so they were not about to molt. These eight caterpillars were split into two groups of four: a control group and a treatment group. The eight caterpillars were weighed before any treatment and then placed in identical plastic containers, with two caterpillars per container, separated by a notecard. The four control group caterpillars received 10 grams of food, with 10 drops of D1 water. The four treatment group caterpillars also received 10 grams of food, but their food contained 10 drops of 1:1250 Azaguard solution, the ecdysterone inhibitor. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator under identical conditions. To prevent food from drying up and to get sufficient data, caterpillars were given new food according to their treatment plan every day, and were also weighed daily. After seven days, the caterpillars were weighed for one final time, and the data was recorded. After the experiment, we constructed a line graph of the different weights for each caterpillar over the course of the eight-day period. We also performed a 2-sample t-test on the average weight gain for the control group versus the treatment group, in order to either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.


Results:
From looking only at the raw data, it appears that after weighing the caterpillars for the final time, the caterpillars in the control group were much heavier than the caterpillars in the treatment group, as predicted. Control group caterpillars weighed from 10.02 g to 11.67 g, gaining an average of 9.77 g, while treatment group caterpillars weighed from 1.71 g to 4.02 g, gaining an average 3.26 g. In addition to this apparent difference in weight gain between the two groups, caterpillars from the control group had a noticeable tougher exterior, while the caterpillars from the treatment group had a much softer exterior. As seen in Figure 1, the two groups of caterpillars were initially similar weights, and ranged from 1.00 g to 1.36 g. However, after the eight-day treatment period, the graph shows that the caterpillars receiving no treatment and followed a regular diet gained more weight than the caterpillars who received Azaguard, the ecdysterone inhibitor, in their daily diet. The results of two-sample t-test, from the data in Figure 1, yielded a p-value of 3.92E-5, and is below the critical value 0.05, meaning that the p-value is significant.
   

Discussion:
The results of this experiment were significant, so we reject our null hypothesis that inhibiting ecdysterone has no effect on M. sexta weight gain, and support our alternative hypothesis, concluding that the presence of Azaguard, inhibiting ecdysterone, does prevent weight gain in developing M. sexta caterpillars. Azaguard is known to be an inhibitor of ecdysterone, a hormone responsible for the timing of molting in insects [Dreier:1987]. In our experiment, caterpillars in the treatment group consumed Azaguard as part of their diet, and it prevented weight gain, as opposed to the caterpillars who received no treatment. This is because the caterpillars who received no treatment underwent their lifecycle as normal; brain hormone was released by the brain and signaled the prothoracic gland to release ecdysterone, which then signaled to the caterpillar that it was time to molt [Johnson:2018]. In preparation for molting, these caterpillars gained significant weight, and were much tougher on the exterior, as they began to grow a cuticle which they would shed after molting and possibly undergoing metamorphosis. However, when Azaguard inhibited ecdysterone, the treatment M. sexta caterpillars did not receive the signal to molt, and were not able to undergo their life cycle as normal. As a result, these treatment group caterpillars gained very little weight, and did not begin to develop a cuticle. Another experiment tested the effects of Azadirachtinm, the concentrated and active ingredient in Azaguard, against pests of the tree, the Azadirachta indica, that produces it. This study found that Azadirachtinm often resulted in mortality of the insects after periods, growth reduction, and delayed and abnormal molts. This previously tested experiment supports the conclusion of this experiment Azaguard prevents the growth of M. sexta caterpillars [Mordue:2000]. This is relevant because Azaguard is a commonly used insecticide on M. sexta caterpillars, who are pests, and stunting their growth and preventing them from molting to then become adults decreases the likelihood of the caterpillars reproducing and having offspring that will continue the pest problem [Afzal:2008]. In future experiments, it would be effective to test various concentrations of Azaguard, to see how different levels of the inhibitor may affect the growth of the caterpillar. This would also aid in showing the most effective concentration for an insecticide to battle M. sexta pests. This study did support the hypothesis of the experiment, and gave evidence that Azaguard inhibits ecdysterone in M. Sexta caterpillars, preventing their growth.

With this data, we performed a t-test, which yield a p-value of 3.92E-5, which is significant.
