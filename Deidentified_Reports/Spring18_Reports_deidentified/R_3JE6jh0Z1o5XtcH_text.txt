Title: Effect of increased CO2 on photosynthetic activity in enriched kale chloroplasts

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to test the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the photosynthetic activity of enriched kale chloroplasts. We hypothesized that there would be an increase in photosynthetic activity with above normal concentrations of CO2 and that photosynthetic activity would eventually plateau and then proceed to decline over time. The independent variable for this study was CO2 derived from seltzer water, and the dependent variable was the level of absorbance of the chloroplast solutions. Three groups were prepared, one controll group with no additional CO2, one experimental group with a partially increased CO2 concentration, and another experimental group with a higher increased CO2 concentration. A two-tailed t_test yielded the p_value of 0.3950 when comparing the % change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the controll group against the partially increased CO2 concentration group, and a p_value of 0.2270 when comparing the % change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the controll group against the highest increased CO2 concentration group. These values did not support our hypothesis that increased levels of CO2 increase photosynthetic activity. A graph of the % change in absorbance comparing the three groups over 30 minutes supported our additional hypothes

Introduction:
This study examined the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the photosynthetic activity of kale chloroplasts. The study of the effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis is extremely relevant due to the increasing atmospheric pressure experienced throughout the globe. The Nation Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) website shows a dramatic increase of global atmospheric CO2 over the past 60 years, leading the current level of just over 400 ppm (“NASA,” 2017). The effects of increased CO2 on photosynthesis has been studied extensively, with more focus being put on plants that utilize C3 carbon fixation, one of the three metabolic pathways for carbon assimilation. Most studies conclude that increasing CO2 levels increases photosynthetic activity in C3 plants, stating that “…short-term increases in CO2 supply at [CO2] below 600 µmol mol-1 tend to increase leaf CO2 assimilation” (Nowak, Ellsworth, & Smith, 2003). This conclusion is logically supported by the changes that would occur with increased CO2 into light-independent reactions during photosynthesis. In C3 plants, carbon fixation occurs during the Calvin Cycle, which follows the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis. For this study, it is only important to focus on the first step of the Calvin Cycle. The first step occurs with the diffusion of CO2 into the stroma. Once in the stroma, the CO2 is acted upon by the enzyme Rubisco, which takes 6 CO2 molecules and facilitates their addition to 6 ribulose 1,5-biphosphate. The product of this reaction is 2 molecules of phosphoglycerate. In this process, CO2 is acting as a substrate, with Rubisco as the enzyme needed to form the phosphoglycerate. Increasing the concentration of the substrate in any enzymatic reaction increases the rate of reaction, suggesting that increased CO2 levels will increase the rate of photosynthetic activity in the kale leaves being used (cite bio textbook) However, “photosynthetic capacity is often reduced after long-term exposure to elevated CO2, and this decrease in capacity can be explained by an “imbalance in the supply and demand of carbohydrates” (ARP, 1991). The plant would cease to photosynthesize at such rates due to an excess supply of carbohydrates and no demand to match it. Additionally, there is a maximum rate of reaction for any enzymatic reaction because all the enzymes eventually become saturated. Knowing this, there must be a point at which elevated levels of CO2 stop increasing photosynthetic rate. In this experiment, the concentration of CO2 is the independent variable, and the absorbance, which corresponds directly to photosynthetic activity, is the dependent variable. We hypothesize that increasing the concentration of CO2 in enriched kale chloroplasts will increase the rate of photosynthesis when compared to a controll group. Additionally, this increase in rate of photosynthesis will eventually plateau and then decline over time. 

Materials and Method:
Six kale leaves were purchased from a local grocery store and deveined before being ground with a cold mortar, pestle, and two 10Ml additions of grinding buffer. Once a paste, the kale solution was strained through three cheese-cloths, before being added to a chilled 150Ml beaker. Next, 50 Ml of the strained kale leaf solution was moved to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A,” and centrifuged at 1200 rpm and 4°C for three minutes. The liquid contents of “A” were transferred to another 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B” avoiding the inclusion of any debris found in “A”. Centrifuge tube “B” was then centrifuged at 2800 rpm at 4°C for ten minutes, and the liquid component of “B” transferred into a chilled 50 Ml tube labeled “C”. This concluded the preparation of the enriched kale chloroplasts.
The first step in the assay was to label ten test tubes, beginning with a “blank” tube, and then labeling the remaining tubes #1-9. The contents of each tube can be found in the tables and figures section. The addition of CO2 to the two experimental groups was accomplished by making two separate dilutions of the pH 5 reaction Hill reaction buffer. For the partially increased CO2 group, 10 Ml of seltzer water was added to 20 Ml of 1X Hill reaction buffer. For the highest concentrated CO2 group, 20 Ml pf seltzer water was added to 20 Ml of the 2X Hill reaction buffer. Tubes #1-3 functioned as the controll group, tubes #4-6 as the partially increased CO2 experimental group, and tubes #7-9 as the highest increased CO2 experimental group. After the last step of adding 100 µl of the liquid from centrifuge tube “C” to tubes #1-9, we mixed the contents of each tube and moved a 1 Ml from each tube to ten micro-tubes. We blanked the spectrometer at 600 nm using the micro-tube containing the “blank,” then proceeding to measure the absorbance for the following nine micro-tubes at 600 nm. This initial measurement represented absorbance at time zero. After this measurement, the ten micro-tubes were placed under direct light, and their respective absorbances were measured again at ten minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. 
All the absorbance data was collected in Microsoft Excel and the percent change (% change) between time zero and times 10, 20, and 30 were calculated respectively using the following equation. For analysis, we began by using a two-sample t_tests to compare the % change of the controll group and the partially increased CO2 group after 30 minutes. Next, we used another two-sample t_test to compare the % change of the controll group and the highest increased CO2¬ group after 30 minutes. The last analysis used a two-sample t_test to compare the % change of the partially increased CO2 group and the highest increased CO2 group after 30 minutes. To visualize the data graphically, we used Microsoft Excel to graph the % change in absorbance for the controll group, the partially increased CO2 group, and the highest increased CO2 group, respectively.


Results:
The graph comparing the average % changes for the three groups of data had a noticeable trend. The average % change in absorbance increased from time zero to time 20 minutes for the controll group, the partially increased CO2 group, and the highest increased CO2 group. The average % change in absorbance then decreased from time 20 minutes to time 30 minutes for all three groups. The controll group had the highest average % change in absorbance from time zero to time 30 minutes (31.93%). The partially increased CO2 group had the second highest average % change in absorbance from time zero to time 30 minutes (25.93%), while the highest increased CO2 group had the lowest average % change in absorbance of all three groups (15.91%). 
The average % change in absorbance (which directly corresponds to an increase in photosynthetic activity) at 30 minutes was 31.93% for the controll group and 25.93% for the partially increased CO2 group. The two-sample t_test comparing the controll group and the partially increased CO2 group yielded a p_value of 0.3950, denying statistical significance. The average % change in absorbance at 30 minutes for the highest increased CO2 group was 15.9%, and the two-sample t_test comparing the controll group and the highest increased CO2 group yielded a p_value of 0.2270, denying statistical significance. The two-sample t_test comparing the average % change in absorbance at 30 minutes of the partially increased CO2 group with the highest increased CO2 group yielded a p_value of 0.3540, denying statistical significance. 


Discussion:
Following the analysis of the study’s data, it is clear that the first part of the hypothesis was not supported and that in this experiment, increased CO2 levels did not increase photosynthetic activity in enriched kale chloroplasts. However, the second part of hypothesis was supported by the data because all three groups experienced an increase in photosynthetic activity for the first 20 minutes followed by a decline in photosynthetic activity from 20 minutes to 30 minutes. 
Due to the overwhelming sources that support an increase in photosynthetic activity with an increase in CO2 concentration, it is likely that there was something about our experimental method that caused our two experimental groups to have less photosynthetic activity despite being exposed to increased levels of CO2. Because reduction of NADPH+ is difficult to measure, this experiment used DCPIP as the replacement electron acceptor. One possible reason for error is that CO2 has some effect on the reduction of DCPIP that it doesn’t have on NADPH+, which would affect the absorbance and thus the photosynthetic activity of the kale chloroplasts. However, a study by West and Hill in 1967 stated that “…with DCPIP, the addition of bicarbonate to illuminated chloroplast systems depleted of CO2 gave very rapid increases in the rates of reduction” (West, Hill, 1967). Although we used pure CO2 gas from the seltzer water, bicarbonate is a form in which CO2 is available so it is reasonable to suggest that the error in this experiment was not due to CO2’s effect on DCPIP. A study measuring the effects of enriched CO2 levels on the photosynthesis of cotton plants found that the CO2 caused a decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Delucia, Sasek, & Strain, 1985). It is possible that the higher concentration of CO2 that we introduced to the kale chloroplasts decreased the concentration of chloroplasts resulting in less photosynthetic activity in the two experimental groups. 
Despite these two considerations of error, it is most likely that the method of introducing CO2 into our chloroplast solution was flawed. By using seltzer water, it is reasonable to assume that the concentration of CO2 in the seltzer water was not enough to have an effect on the level of photosynthetic activity. If this study were to be repeated, it would be vital to find an alternate method of increasing the concentration of CO2. Because the experiment used seltzer water, it was impossible to measure the actual increase of CO2 that was introduced to the chloroplasts. The only way to measure the amount of CO2 in each experimental group was to compare the volume of seltzer water added to the Hill reaction buffer, which still gives no indication of the actual concentration of CO2 in the chloroplast solutions. 
Given the flawed method of this experiment, no conclusion can be drawn that supports a decrease in photosynthetic activity with an increased CO2 concentration. The current belief that increased CO2 concentrations results in increased photosynthetic activity, supported by multiple studies like those mentioned in the introduction, holds true.
