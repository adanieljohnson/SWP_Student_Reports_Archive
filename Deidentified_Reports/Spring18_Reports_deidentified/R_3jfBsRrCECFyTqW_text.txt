Title: Introducing food reduces aggressive behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Animals display aggressive behavior when they sense a threat. However, the display of aggression requires an investment of time and energy from an individual. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether food has an effect on the display of aggressive behavior by an animal. The animal used for this experiment was the betta splendens. The betta fish was chosen due to the aggressive behavior they display in the presence of another betta fish. The hypothesis of the study was that the betta fish would display aggressive behavior for a lesser amount of time with the introduction of food. This was tested by placing two betta fish in a container with a glass separation. Data was collected by observing the amount of time aggressive behavior was shown by the betta fish in the absence and presence of food. The result of the study was that the hypothesis was not supported. Aggression requires too great of an investment when compared to obtaining food.  

Introduction:
Animals display agnostic, or aggressive, behavior when they sense a threat. The type of behavior they exhibit has varying levels. The type of agnostic behavior exhibited corresponded to the level of aggression the fish are showing. [Lynn, 2007] The specie under study in this experiment was the Betta splendens. The betta fish were selected for this study due the aggressive behavior they display in the presence of other betta fish. The behavior displayed with the betta fish is classified as intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behavior has type of movements which can be further classified by the physiological changes the betta display.  Responses to threat can decrease due to habituation. Habituation is the reduction of a response to a constant stimulus. In a research conducted by Monmouth College, betta fish saw a reduction in response to another fish due to prolonged exposure. [Meliska, 1976] Displaying aggression also has energy tradeoffs. Animals which overly display aggression do not survive for a long period of time. The benefit of being overaggressive does not overcome the physical energy cost or time investment required. [Anon, 2006] Eating food is how the betta fish obtain their energy. This contributes to the growth of the fish. Previous studies support betta fish obtain food rather than engaging in aggressive behaviors. [Bols, 1979] Food was the stimulus chosen in this study due to the decision the betta would have to make. The betta has to choose between allocating its time towards eating food which would obtain energy or display aggression which had no benefit. In this experiment we will be testing the effect of food on the aggressive behavior of the betta fish. I predicted that if we introduced food to the betta fish, the amount of time the betta show aggressive behavior will decrease because the fish will allocate their time towards gaining energy by eating food rather than displaying aggressive behavior. Therefore, the amount of time the fish show aggression will decrease.     

Materials and Methods:
The experiment consisted of two male Betta fish. The two fish were placed in a container. The container contained a partition which physically separated the fish along which a white sheet of glass which did not allow the fish to see each other. The white glass was removed to allow the fish to see each other. The fish were exposed to each other for 5 minutes. The amount of time each fish showed aggression to one another was recorded in seconds. Aggressive behaviors were determined to be pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, erection of pectoral fins, and spreading of gill covers. After 5 minutes the white glass sheet was added back, and the fish could not see each other. They were allowed a period of rest for 5 minutes. This process was repeated two more times. The data collected from this trial served as the control group. Next, food was added as the same as the white sheet of glass was removed. The same process of recording the amount of time each fish showed aggression. The fish were exposed to each other for 5 minutes. A period of 5 minutes rest was then allowed. The process of adding for and removing the white sheets was repeated two more times. The data was analyzed by conducting a one tailed T-test. The alpha level of the statistical test was 0.05. 

Results:
The trend observed in the seconds aggression shown in respect to the introduction of food was decreased when comparing the experimental groups to the control groups. The average amount of aggression shown in red fish without food was 29   16.5 seconds.  The average amount of aggression shown in the red fish with food was 5.6   8.9 seconds. In the blue fish, the average amount of aggression show without food was 41.3   24.2 seconds while without food it decreased to 2.6   2.3 seconds. The results of the statistical test between the treatment and control yielded no significant difference (Red fish: t=1.58, df=2, p=0.25/ Blue fish: t=2,93, df=2, p=0.10). The p-values of 0.25 and 0.10 for the red and blue fish respectively were above the alpha level of 0.05. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected and the statistical tests conducted, our hypothesis was not supported. The average amount of aggression shown in the two groups of betta fish decreased. This portion of the data support our hypothesis. However, when a statistical test was conducted, the data were statistically indifferent. Therefore, our hypothesis in the end is not supported. We expected to see a decrease in the aggression shown. The reasoning for the aggression to decrease was that the betta would rather spend its time gathering energy through eating food rather than expending energy displaying aggressive behavior. A research conducted by the University of Toronto similar to this experiment yield the same conclusion. The betta fish under study chose to eat food rather than show aggression. [Bols, 1979] 
Another explanation of why the fish decreased aggressive behavior could be due to habituation. Due to repeated exposure over many days between betta fish without any psychological reinforcement, habituation may have occurred. [Clayton, 1968] The results from the study help in the understanding of when a betta will display aggression. Based on the results from this study and prior studies, in the presence of food betta fish will not display aggression. Aggression requires too great of an investment of both time and energy which therefore does not outweigh the benefit of obtaining food. The study can help in the analysis of the life history of betta fish. Based on the result of this experiment, it could be hypothesized that growth and maintenance through food is a high priority for betta fish.
