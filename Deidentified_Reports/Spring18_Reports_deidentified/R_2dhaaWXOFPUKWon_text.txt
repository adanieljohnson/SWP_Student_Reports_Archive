Title:  The Effect of Caffeine on the Contractile Rate of Frog Legs

Abstract:
When calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds with other proteins to begin muscle contraction. When calcium is reuptaken, muscle contraction seizes.  For this reason, calcium is an important aspect of organisms’ contractile mechanisms. Caffeine is a drug that blocks the reuptake of calcium therefore produced uncontrolllable contractions. This phenomenon was tested through 3 frog legs and injected each with 0.01 Ml of caffeine, firing a stimulus, then analyzing the myogram to see caffeine’s effect on the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. 


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to direct stimuli within milliseconds of stimulation. It does so through skeletal muscles that have hundreds of complex myofibers, which are them composed of myofilaments like actin and myosin. The skeletal muscles have functional groups called motor units that work innervate myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. Nerve impulse at these junctions allow for the release of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine or ACh, which then binds to receptor of the muscle fiber and opens the sodium gates through depolarization [Johnson: 2018]. Next, an action potential allows for the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This Ca2+ then binds to troponin, which moves tropomyosin out of the way and exposes the myosin heads to begin the muscle contraction. Ca2+ is key to the contractile mechanism of vertebrae’s. Contractions are seized when Ca2+ is reuptaken into the sarcoplasmic reticulum to be recycled. Thus, teetering with the release or blockage of Ca2+ would affect the contractile rate of twitches. One drug in particular that blocks the reuptake of Ca2+ is Caffeine. Because Ca2+ cannot be reuptaken, contractions will not end normally, but instead when the organism has reached tetanus, or a period of max tension. Tetanus can be seen through graphs of twitches called myograms. Specific to this experiment, injections of caffeine into the isolated gastrocnemus muscle will allow for uncontrollled contractions because the caffeine would block Ca2+ from being reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The rate of uncontrollled contractions will be evaluated by measuring the amplitude of the twitches during the contractile period of the myograms. 


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were obtained for both the controll, before the injection of caffeine, and the treatment group, after the injection of caffeine. The gastrocnemus muscle was exposed on each leg by pulling away the skin. After a string was tied around the top of the muscle, it was isolated from the first hanger attached to device measuring the myograms. The rest of the frog leg was pinned down with pins and pin probes were attached to the gastrocnemus muscle, making sure they were not intertwining or touching. Different amplitude stimuli were fired from the computer program until the threshold was found. After the threshold, 3 mygorams were ran on that amplitude. The response displayed on the myogram was recorded. For the other two controll frog legs, the same process was followed, finding the threshold and recording 3 mygorams at that amplitude that produced the lowest response. For the treatment group, after each of the controll myograms had been taken, 0.1 Ml of caffeine was injected into the middle of the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg using a syringe. The amplitudes were set to the same values used for the treatment group, keeping in mind the threshold. The response was again recorded for the treatment group.

Discussion:
According to the figures and graphs displayed above, the treatment frog legs consistently produced a stronger response than the controll group. The mean of the treatment group was significently larger than the controll group (t_stat=10.66, d.f.=2, P=.009). The response in this experiment was how high the amplitude of the contraction was when analyzing the myogram. A higher amplitude indicates that the contractions were sped up over time; therefore, tetany, or a state of max tension was reached faster until fatigue happened and the tetany began to drop off. Referring back to results of the t_test, the data of the experiment can be deemed statistically significent due to the extremely low p_value. Therefore, caffeine does cause higher amplitudes of myograms, or uncontrollled contractions.  However, the controversy lies in whether or not the reasoning for the uncontrollled reactions was accurate or not. According to other published studies, when caffeine is injected into the frog leg, it promotes the release of Ca2+ which in turn will enhance the contractile rate, or increase the amplitude of the twitch [Kumar, Tomar, Rao: 2015]. On the contrary, another experiment’s results were conclusive with the hypothesis of this experiment that the blockage of reuptake of Ca2+ allows for uncontrollled contractions, specifically, a prolongation of the activation state [A. Weber, R Herz: 1968]. There are conflicting conclusions on how caffeine indefinitely increases the contractile rate within the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog leg.

Graph1 displays the response of the treatment and the controll group under the threshold of 0.5 V for frog leg one. The treatment had a significently larger response to the threshold than the controll group did. 
Graph 2 displays the response of the treatment and the controll group under the threshold of 0.8 V for frog leg two. Again, the treatment had a significently larger response to the threshold than the controll group did, even more so than frog leg one. 
Graph 3 displays the response of the treatment and the controll group under the threshold of 0.6 V for frog leg three. The third treatment frog leg had about the same response as the second treatment frog leg. Both were larger than the controll frog legs’ responses.
