Title: The Effect of Positive and Negative Charges on Physarum polycephalum Movement

Abstract:
The objective of this lab is to determine how signaling pathways allow cells to respond to their environment. The hypothesis of the experiment is, if the Physarum are put in a well of the agarose gel in the gel electrophoresis tank, then it will be repelled by the negative charge and respond by moving towards the positive end. The organism used in this experiment is Physarum polycephalum. The method for determining the direction and distance that the Physarum traveled is by setting up a gel electrophoresis tank. The voltage was set at 23 volts. The data collected from the experiment is the direction and the distance that the Physarum traveled. This data is compared to the data of the phototactic control. After the conclusion of the experiment, it appeared that the Physarum traveled towards the negative end of the agarose gel which was contrary to what was predicted. Though there was a consistent growth trend towards the negative charge, the results of the experiment suggest that there is no significant movement towards the positive or negative charges with respect to Physarum polycephalum mobility.


Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to both their internal environment and the external environment. The model organism for this experiment is the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The reason that this is our model organism is because we can view and discover a multitude of cellular level processes without the use of a microscope. Physarum is different from other multicellular organisms as it does not use a nervous system or hormones to detect and react to the environment. Each response is directed by an intracellular signal transduction pathway. This intracellular signal transduction pathway generally goes through three steps. The first step being that an external or internal stimulus activates a protein. The next step is that the activated molecule causes either the formation or the release of a second messenger. The final step is that the second messenger binds with an effector for the purpose of creating a change in behavior, or in our case, a response [Johnson: 2018]. We are measuring the distance and directionality that the slime molds undergo. For this experiment, gel electrophoresis is used. Gel electrophoresis is usually used for the purposes of separating mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their molecular sizes. They are pushed through the small pores of the agarose gel by the electrical field generated from the positive and negative ends [Cleveland: 1976]. The hypothesis of the experiment is, if the Physarum are put in a well of the agarose gel in the gel electrophoresis tank, then it will be repelled by the negative charge and respond by moving towards the positive end [McMaster: 1977]. The independent variables of this study are the positive charge and the negative charge. The dependent variables of the study are the direction and the distance that the Physarum grow.


Materials and Methods:
The first step in the procedure is to grow a healthy Physarum culture. Next, set up a gel electrophoresis tank [Smithies: 1959]. Dip a spatula into ethanol and then light the end of it with an open flame. Following this step, make sure the spatula is cool enough to cut 3 1 x 1 cm2 equidistant squares straight down the middle in the agarose gel. Remove these blocks with flame sterilized forceps and dispose of them in a proper waste container. Return both the spatula and forceps to the ethanol. After a Physarum culture has been grown, there should be 3 1 x 1 cm2 equidistant squares cut from this culture plate. These squares should be cut with a spatula that has been dipped in ethanol and then lit with an open flame. Once the spatula cools off, then the blocks can be cut [Johnson: 2018]. Forceps are to be flame sterilized as well in order to remove the Physarum squares from the culture. Place these Physarum blocks in the wells created of the agarose gel. Evenly distribute oatmeal flakes on the agarose gel. Make sure to have six flakes for each Physarum block. Three should be going in the direction of the positive charge, and the other three should be going in the direction of the negative charge. The oatmeal flakes should be equidistant from each other, between 2-3 cm apart. The flakes of oatmeal also account for the confounding variable of the Physarum moving towards a food source. Fill each side well of the gel electrophoresis setup with IX SB buffer. Keep in mind that the buffer should not be overlaying the agarose gel because this may affect the Physarum activity with respect to it moving towards a positive or negative charge. Set the apparatus to a voltage of 23 V. This is the lowest possible voltage setting so that the Physarum is not overwhelmed with the charge. Let the Physarum sit in the gel electrophoresis tank for 24 hours. The setup of the gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 1. Once the experiment comes to completion, the distances and the directionality of the Physarum are recorded. From these values, an average is calculated in order to analyze and use it for the results. The values calculated from the experiment are compared to the values of a phototactic control. The phototactic control data was from a previous experiment performed in which the Physarum was in a well of a Petri dish that was kept in a dark cabinet. This allowed the Physarum to grow naturally towards a food source without an outside factor having an effect on the movement. The statistical test used is an ANOVA test. 


Results:
The distances of the Physarum movement were measured and the average distance traveled was calculated. The results of the experiment are displayed in Figure 2. In Figure 2, the error bars overlap meaning that the data is not significant. The values of the raw data were taken and used in an ANOVA test. A Tukey-Kramer test was performed in addition to the ANOVA test. The result from the ANOVA test gave a p-value of 0.609 which tells us that the data is not significant because the p-value is greater than 0.05. The mean of the gel electrophoresis trials is 12.3 mm while the mean of the phototactic control trials is 15.7 mm. The standard deviation of the gel electrophoresis trials is 9.61 while the standard deviation of the phototactic control trials is 4.04.


Discussion:
To conclude, the hypothesis for the experiment was not supported, but the null hypothesis was supported by the data collected. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was conducted and the p-value was 0.609. With the p-value showing insignificance, this suggests that there was no significant movement towards the positive or negative ends of the gel electrophoresis tank. As there was a consistent growth trend towards the negative charge, inversely, there was no movement towards the positive charge. A Tukey-Kramer test was followed up which showed that there is significance in the individual datasets between the gel electrophoresis trials and the phototactic control trials. This significance shows that growth was not as it would have been naturally which could have been effected by an outside factor. An overlap in error bars also shows that the data was not significant. The results showed that there was movement towards the negative charge rather than the positive charge. The reason for this may be that the Physarum contains a positively charged portion to it [McMaster: 1977]. This would make sense as it moves towards the negative charge. This is due to the attraction between opposing forces. A source of error in the experiment was that there was an outlier in the gel electrophoresis data. This value was very low and had an impact on the average distance that the Physarum grew. If the outlier was dismissed from the data, the p-value would increase meaning that there would be more insignificance amongst all of the data points. This insignificance shows even more of a consistent growth towards the negative charge. An improvement to this study would be to increase the amount of time that the gel electrophoresis was left at a low voltage. The purpose for this would be to see if there is an increase in the movement of Physarum with the possibility of eliminating outliers by giving them more of a chance to grow. The reason that this experiment is important is because it delves into signal transduction pathways. The reason that these are important is because once a signal is received in a cell from an external source, it needs to be effectively transmitted in order to have an appropriate response in the cell. For further testing, it would be interesting to look at the relationship between increasing voltage and the speed of the Physarum movement.
