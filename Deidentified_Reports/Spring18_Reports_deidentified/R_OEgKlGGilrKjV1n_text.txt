Title: Colder water temperature decreases the amount of aggressiveness between male Betta splendens

Abstract:
In this lab, we wanted to see what factors impact a fish’s behavior.  We wanted to understand a small part of their behavior by watching their responses to certain conditions and stimuli.  We want to try to understand their world as they view and see it.  More specifically, what impacts a Betta fish’s aggressive behavior.  To do so, we used temperature change. We used Betta fish because they are very aggressive when in contact with another one of their species.  We hypothesized that the colder water would weaken the Betta fish and make them less aggressive.  We observed two male fish together in a room temperature tank and then transferred them to a tank with colder water.  We observed the fish separated, separated by just glass, and then combined.  Our data supported this hypothesis.  We found that the fish were significantly more aggressive in the warmer water.  A drastic temperature change can cause an immediate physical or behavioral change in Betta fish.  Sometimes, temperature change can even lead to thermal shock, which can prevent the fish from exhibiting its aggressive behaviors.  With this, we further understood their world as they saw it.


Introduction:
During this lab, we wanted to see if fish behavior can be impacted by temperature.  More specifically, we wanted to see if colder temperature impacted fish behavior.  In this lab, we used Betta fish (Betta splendens) as our test species.  We decided to use Betta fish because of their very visibly expressive aggressive behaviors.  The Betta fish became known for being extremely aggressive as a result of targeted breeding.  Betta fish have been bred to fight to death when in captivity.  Male Betta fish are very territorial when in their surroundings and if another male gets in the way, they fight [Baenninger: 1966].   Betta fish show their signs of aggression in several ways. When male Betta fish are at rest, they are a very dull grayish brown or green fish.  However, when they are presented with another male, they change their color to an intense dark blue or red.  In addition to changing color, they flicker their pelvic fin, tail beat, tail flash, spread their gills and show a red mane.  After several minutes of exhibiting these behaviors, the males come together in a head-on assault.  In doing so, they interlock their jaws.  When in the presence of one of their species, they exhibit two main types of movements: Broadside and facing movements.  The reason that we want to test temperature change on these Bettas is because Betta fish are widely found in ponds, ditches, drains, and rice paddies.  Clearly, these environments are associated with different temperatures.  Betta fish are ectotherms, meaning that their body temperatures are associated with the temperature of the environment that they are in.  They thrive best in a temperature range of 75-86 degrees Fahrenheit.  A drastic temperature change can cause an immediate physical or behavioral change in the Betta.  They might swim erratically, float on one side, or appear distressed.  The immune system can also be weakened [De Bruin 1977].
	The hypothesis of this study was that when male Betta fish are moved to a colder environment, they will be less aggressive towards each other.  


Materials and Methods:
The very first thing that we did when we conducted this experiment was we picked out two random male Betta fish.  After doing so, we placed them in a tank of room temperature water with two compartments that was separated by a clear and solid barrier (meaning that they could not see each other.  Then, we observed the behavior of the two isolated males for 2 minutes (2 times though).  Then, we removed the solid barrier between the fish (still separated by glass) for 2 minutes.  We let the fish rest for 2 minutes with the barrier back in place and then observed them for another 2 minutes only separated by glass.  After letting them rest for an additional 2 minutes, we removed both of the barriers and observed their behavior for 2 minutes, let them rest and then observe them for another two minutes.  Then, we isolated the two fish from each other and moved them to a tank that had cold water in it.  Note, we let the water chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes before placing the fish in it.  The water was roughly 35 degrees Fahrenheit.  The cold-water tank was also separated by a clear and solid barrier.  Then, we observed the behavior of the two isolated males for 2 minutes (2 times though).  Then, we removed the solid barrier between the fish (still separated by glass) for 2 minutes.  We let the fish rest with the barrier back in place and then observed them for another 2 minutes only separated by glass.  After letting them rest, we removed both of the barriers and observed their behavior for 2 minutes, let them rest for 2 minutes and then observe them for another two minutes. 
When we were observing the Betta fish, we gave them a score from 1 to 3 every time they exhibited a behavior.   We gave them a 1 if their pelvic fin flickered or if their pectoral fin was erect.  We gave them a 2 if they beat their tail or spread their gill covers.  We gave them a 3 if they flashed their tail or showed a red mane. 


Results:
As shown in figure 1 for Betta fish that were placed in room temperature, the mean value for the number of times combined that the two fish showed some sort of aggressive behavior during the 6 tests was 11.25 (standard deviation= 5.9).  As shown in table 2 for the Betta fish that were placed in a colder temperature, then mean value for the number of times combined that the fished showed some sort of aggressive behavior during the 6 tests was 5.23 with a standard deviation of 4.19.  Using the T-test with the scores that we gave the fish, the degrees of freedom was 2, the t-value was 1.00, and the P-value was .42.


Discussion:
Discussion
	Our hypothesis of this experiment was that when male Betta fish are moved to a colder environment, they will be less aggressive towards each other.  Using the data from tables 1 and 2, our hypothesis was supported.  On average, the number of times the fish showed aggressive behavior in room temperature water was significantly higher than the number of times that the fish in the cold water did.  The fish in the room temperature water almost showed twice as much aggressive behavior.  Using the T-test, we cannot conclude that there was a significant difference between the behaviors of the fish in the two different temperatures because the P value was greater than .05.  There was, however, a significant observable difference between the two fish behaviors in the colder vs room temp water.  Therefore, we can use our data to imply that colder temperature reduces the amount of aggressiveness that male Betta fish show when presented in front of one another.  A drastic temperature change can cause an immediate physical or behavioral change in Betta fish.  Sometimes, temperature change can even lead to thermal shock, which can prevent the fish from exhibiting its aggressive behaviors [White 2004].  Since the fish was in likely to put in thermal shock, it was distracted. Another reason as to why the Betta fish were not as aggressive in the colder tank was because temperature change can also cause the fish to become stressed temporarily.  Had we let the fish stay in the colder water longer, it could have resulted in internal problems such as digestive issues.  Water temperature can also play a role in oxygen concentration.  Had we put the fish in warm water, rather than cold water, we probably would have had a different outcome.  Even though Bettas come to the surface to breathe, warm water holds less oxygen than cold water because water solubility decreases in warmer waters.  Some scientist have also suggested that many freshwater fish of similar nature, become inactive during the winter months due to drop in water temperature.  The results of this experiment can be applied in the real world in that freshwater fishing primarily occurs during the warmer months.  Thus, the water is warmer, which allows the fish to maintain their respiration and metabolism [White: 2004].  Had we had more time and tools, this experiment could have been adapted to show that as respiration rate decreases, so does the fish’s metabolism, which can impact its level of aggression.
