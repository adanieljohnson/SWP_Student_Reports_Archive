Title: Manduca sexta: Effects of JH on Development of Caterpillars

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effects of juvenile hormone on insect development. The experiment uses Manduca sexta caterpillars to test the hypothesis that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent or delay the caterpillars from becoming pupae. Hormones allows insects to become adults through the initiation of molting. Juvenile hormone works with ecdysterone to create a commitment pulse that triggers the process of molting. If juvenile hormone levels are increased the insect will not feel this pulse and will not molt. The experiment treats a group of caterpillars with Precor to demonstrate the effects of increased juvenile hormone in food over a period of 8 days. The study found that the increase in juvenile hormone led to a decrease in health in the treatment group. The treatment group grew less and was less active than the control group that was only treated with water. Therefore, the experiment is able to conclude that juvenile hormone delays the maturation of caterpillars by preventing them from being healthy caterpillars and inhibiting the triggering of molting through a commitment pulse.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of hormones on insect development. Hormones are important chemical components in both insects and mammals that stimulate specific cells or tissues. In humans, hormones play a necessary role in development that is marked by puberty. Puberty marks a human’s physical and chemical transition into adulthood similarly to how molting marks a transition into an adult in insects. Molting is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle and the old layer of skin is shed [Johnson: 2018]. This allows the insect to change size and morphology. Molting allows insects to progress from the larva to pupa and adults stages. This is noted in the holometabolous cycle which is demonstrated by the Manduca sexta, the insect of interest in this experiment [Johnson: 8]. These caterpillars are used as the model organism in this experiment because their hormone regulation has been studied extensively and it is simple to manipulate their hormone levels.			
Hormone activity regulation was first observed with the linden bug as published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. These bugs had low egghatch rates and didn’t mature into adults. It was discovered that the paper towels used in jars with the bugs contained juvabione, which is an insect growth regulator (IGR) compound [Tunaz: 2004]. This led to more research regarding IGR’s. “Most species will respond to IGR treatment by producing extra larval, nymphal, or pupal forms which may range from giant, but almost perfect forms, to a scale of intermediates between immature and adult forms. Perfect extra larvae or nymphs consume additional food and therefore increase damage, but the extra damage always has a limit” [Staal: 1975]. Any changes in hormones disrupt the normal regulation of development in insect species.
In the Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are two important hormones involved in development [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta have four stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. These stages are regulated by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. This experiment treats the caterpillars with an increased amount of juvenile hormone and evaluates their weight and appearance as a reflection of their development. Similarly to IGR’s, if there are increases or decreases in hormone levels, they should affect the normal development of the insects. Increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent or delay the caterpillars from becoming pupae.

Materials and Methods:
Obtain the following materials: 4 round plastic containers, 4 perforated lids, index cards, tape, food, 2 spoons, square container, balance, transfer pipets, water, and 1:1250 Precor. First, obtain 80 grams of food and mix it in a plastic container. Split the food into two separate containers with 40 grams in each container. Use the balance to determine the mass of the food in each container. In one container place 40 drops of water using a transfer pipet. In the other container place 40 drops of Precor using a separate pipet. Using one spoon, separate the 40 grams of food with water into two separate containers. In these two containers place an index card in the middle and tape it to the sides to divide the container in half. Once the container is split in half separate 10 grams into each half. Using a different spoon, separate the 40 grams of food with Precor into two separate containers and follow the same process. Label each 10 grams with the water treatment as Control 1, 2, 3, and 4. Label each 10 grams with the Precor treatment as Treatment 1, 2, 3, and 4. Obtain 8 caterpillars. Before placing the caterpillar into one of the 8 groups weigh the caterpillar using the balance and record the mass in grams. Take notes on the caterpillar’s physical appearance. Additionally, take a picture of each caterpillar and note which labeled half it is going to be placed into.
	Repeat the same process of providing the caterpillar with new food every day for seven additional days. Each day clean out the container. Make sure to obtain the mass of the caterpillar, its physical appearance, and take a picture each day and record the data. A two-sample t-test will be used in this experiment to compare the data between the control group and treatment group.

Results:
In general, it was seen that the control group overall grew more over the 8 days compared to the treatment group. The control group, on average, consistently grew more each specific day compared to the treatment group as seen in Figure 5. The control group maintained a healthier appearance compared to the caterpillars treated with JH as seen in Table 1. The control caterpillars were green and active up until about day 6. On the other hand, the caterpillars treated with JH started moving less on day 3 and most stopped moving by day 4. Therefore, in addition to appearance the control caterpillars were also active for longer compared to the treatment group. The mean of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.673532, df = 6, P = 0.036851).

Discussion:
The data supports the hypothesis which states that increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta will prevent or delay the caterpillars from becoming pupae. The control groups were healthier throughout the experiment while the treatment group started to become sick on the third day and would not have reached pupation because they would have eventually died. This difference in health is because of the added presence of juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt and is a necessary part of insect development. However, when the amounts of juvenile hormone are increased, they prevent the insect from “feeling” the  commitment pulse [Johnson 2018]. The commitment pulse is when the amount of juvenile hormone increases and is surpassed by a peak in ecdysteroid, which is another insect hormone involved in hormone regulation necessary for molting [Johnson 2018]. The commitment pulse triggers molting and if it is not felt by the insect then it will not begin the molting process [Johnson 2018]. Therefore, since there is no commitment pulse present, the insect will not progress through the instars and will not pupate. 
	These result findings were similar to the study on the effects of flosslower on manduca caterpillars in Case Study 2. This study found that when caterpillars were treated with more floss-flower leaves they became less healthy and died at high enough levels. This is because the leaves mimicked juvenile hormone. In the same way the Precor prevented the insects from feeling the commitment pulse in this experiment, the leaves acted the same way in this case study. The caterpillars eventually died with enough leaves and did not become healthy adults.
	The next logical step in this experiment is to test the caterpillars for a longer period of time. Although this experiment was able to objectively measure the healthiness of the caterpillars, it was not able to see the control caterpillars through to pupation. If the experiment was able to compare the control group and treatment group through pupation in some caterpillars then it would be able to conclude that the juvenile hormone prevent the caterpillars from reaching pupation. This step is important because it will be able to demonstrate the importance of hormones in insect growth and development. Altered levels of hormones can be disastrous and even fatal for insects whether they deal with development or any other aspect of insect health.
