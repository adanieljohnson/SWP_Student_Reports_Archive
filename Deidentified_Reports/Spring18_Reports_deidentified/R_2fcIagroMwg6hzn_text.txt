Title: Manduca sexta and the suppression of 20-hydroxyecdysone 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to investigate the effects of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) inhibition in the development of Manduca sexta. Insect molting and metamorphosis are controllled by ecdysteroids like 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) along with juvenile. During the molt and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta, there are a series of cellular events must switch from one state to another before the overt changes can be seen. Researchers hypothesized that by blocking the expression of the 20E hormone the caterpillars would be significently smaller and would not enter the molting stage of metamorphosis. The experiment was conducted by using eight caterpillars and separating the caterpillars into two groups of four; one group was the experimental that would receive the 20E inhibition treatment, while the other was the controll group that would not receive treatment and would be used to compare the results of the experimental group. It was found through a paired t_test and a p_value, which values were 6.430049 and 0.003008, that the data is significently different because our p_values was less than 0.05, which indicates a significent difference. Thus, the hypothesis, that the experimental group would be smaller and molt early, was supported by our data and observations.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, a type of moth, is a model organism that is often used to study the nervous system. These caterpillars develop in four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult moth; and development, molting and metamorphosis, are controllled by several hormones in the endocrine system but the most important are the juvenile hormone (JH) and the steroid ecdysone and its active metabolite 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) [3]. 20E regulates larval molts, pupation, and metamorphosis. The primary sources of 20E in larvae are the fat bodies and other minor tissues, these tissues convert cholesterol into the mature forms of the hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Usually these tissues are lost in the adult except fat body, which is retained as a sheath of lipid tissue surrounding the brain and organs of the abdomen [1]. This study focused on the function of 20E and its effect on molting. We hypothesized that the blockage of 20E, which regulates molting, by AzaMax, a natural insecticide placed in the food of the experimental group [2], will cause the caterpillars to not molt; therefore, the caterpillars will be undernourished and not survive into adulthood. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment required that we created housing units for the caterpillars and we did that by dividing the round containers by folding each end of an index card about 1 cm, taping the index card to the inside of the container, adding food and the caterpillars, and finally labeling each unit properly according to: group name, caterpillar ID, treatment or controll, lab section. Once we finished creating the housing unite we then had to establish a feeding protocol for the caterpillars. We first measured 10 g of food for each caterpillar that we used for the controll group we weighed 10 g of food for each of the controll caterpillars, weighed and recorded each caterpillar, and placed them in a new container (30-40 g), with a transfer pipet we added 7 drops of distilled water for every 10 g of food. For the experimental we weighed 10 g of food for each of the experimental caterpillars and placed them in a new container (30-40 g), with a transfer pipet we added 7 of AzaMax for every 10 g of food. We weighed and recorded the data and then we placed the four containers in the incubator and for the next six consecutive days that is how we feed and measured the caterpillars.

Results:
The results showed the expected trend in the data and support our hypothesis. According to Table 1, the average weight of the controll caterpillars was 8.4 g while the experimental group weighed 0.83g. Table 1 also shows the results of the t-value and p_value which were 6.430049 ± 1.9 standard deviation and 0.003008 ± 0.72 standard deviation. Though we only saw a small of amount of molting on the first two days of the study, it was later explained to us by a TA that much of the molting could have happened while we were not in the lab. Graph 1 represents average weights for the controll and experimental groups along with the error bars that represent the standard deviation to describe the degree of uncertainty in our data. 

Discussion:
This investigation supported our hypothesis that the experimental group would be smaller and molt early. We deem our experiment significent through a paired t_test and a p_value, which values were 6.430049 and 0.003008, that the data is significently different because our p_values was less than 0.05, which indicates a significent difference. Over the course of the experiment we could visibly see the difference between the controll and experimental groups because the controlls were so much larger in size. Even though we could not see anything molting, and we assumed it had happened over night in the incubator away from sight. Also, we had to discard controll 2 and experimental 4 because they were outliers that were distorting our data. Twice during the study controll 1 would cross the index card divider and take the food from controll 2, that is why controll two was so malnourished compared to the other controll caterpillars. Also, we decided to discard experimental 4 because on day five experimental 4 had escaped from its housing unit and so we had to discard that data since there was no end results. In the end we used only six caterpillars, but our results were still significent, as stated earlier, from the p_value of 0.003008 ± 0.72 standard deviation. Also, when trying to replicate it would be beneficial to increase the amount of manduca sexta in the experiment to obtain more accurate results. Based on the results of this study we concluded that the impediment of 20E is quite detrimental to the health of the manduca sexta because it causes the caterpillar to become undernourished to not make it to adulthood [4]. 20-Hydroxyecdysone is an important steroid hormone that controlls pupal development, molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction in many arthropods, for this reason many researchers have taken an interest in using 20E in gene therapy. They believe that by adding or removing 20E from the animal's diet then new genes can be introduces and that could make an impact on how diseases are treated [5].
