Title: The effect a calcium channel blocker has on twitch threshold and muscle contraction

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride, would influence skeletal muscle contractions in the Rania pipiens. Calcium plays a vital role in the initiation of a contraction given that it allows myosin to bind to actin by binding to troponin on the actin filament. Once calcium binds to troponin, another protein called tropomyosin, changes conformation and exposes the binding site for myosin. Myosin binds to actin and pulls on it so that the entire sarcomere shortens which leads to a muscle contraction. Based on this premise, a decrease in calcium within the muscle cell should cause a decrease in the ability for a muscle to contract. Because of this, it was hypothesized that the twitch threshold, the minimum voltage needed to generate a contraction, would increase once the calcium channel blocker was administered since more stimulation would be needed to initiate a response. The results of the experiment, however, did not support this as there was no significent difference in twitch threshold before or after injection. It was concluded that this could be a result of lanthanum chloride having other effects on the muscle cell such as increasing the amount of the calcium isotope Ca45 by preventing its uptake.


Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is vital for the support and movement of the body. The contraction and elongation of these muscles occur through a complex process which involves the changing in the overlap between the actin and myosin filaments which are located inside the sarcomere of a muscle cell. A single contraction, or a twitch, occurs as a result of the stimulation of motor neurons which transfer information from the spinal cord to the muscles via action potentials traveling down efferent nerves. Once an action potential has reached the axon terminal before the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine, an excitatory neurotransmitter, crosses the synapse and binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. This, in turn, leads to the depolarization of the muscle cell which triggers the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Circulating calcium binds to troponin on the actin filament and allows another protein, tropomyosin, to change configuration and expose myosin binding sites on the actin filament. Once this occurs, myosin binds to actin and pulls on it so that the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts [Copper: 1970]. 
 For this experiment, the relationship between muscle contractions and the introduction of the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride, will be analyzed using the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens or northern leopard frog. The northern leopard frog was selected for this experiment due to the fact that its hindlimb leg muscles, including the gastrocnemus muscle, consist primarily of powerful type 1 muscle fibers [James:2007]. This means that the amplitude of contraction will be more easily detected. In addition, the gastrocnemus muscle was selected since the sciatic nerve, which will be stimulated in this experiment, innervates it [Wali: 1990].  Other research, however, utilizes other organisms such as mice. This includes a study by Romey in 1988 which found that the introduction of the calcium channel blocker, 4-dihydropyridine, in mice made muscle contraction impossible given that calcium is required for the binding of myosin to actin [Romey: 1988]. Despite using a different kind of compound as a blocker in this experiment, it is likely that the prevention of calcium being released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum will decrease the ability of a muscle to contract. Twitch threshold, or the minimum voltage necessary to generate a muscle contraction, will be measured. Hence, it is hypothesized the twitch threshold will increase once the calcium channel blocker is administered since more stimulation will be needed to initiate a response.


Materials and Method:
In order to study the effects a calcium channel blocker would have on muscle contractions, three legs from different northern leopard frogs were used. To begin, the first frog leg was degloved and the gastrocnemus muscle was detached from the bone around the achilles tendon. By tying a string around the gastrocnemus, the muscle was suspended (figure 1). Following this, the sciatic nerve was exposed so that it could be stimulated using two stimulation probes which relayed information to a myogram which visually recorded the muscle twitches. Initially, the myogram was set to have a pulse amplitude of 0V, a pulse width of 5 ms, a frequency of 1 Hz and the number of pulses administered was set to one. The sciatic nerve was stimulated first at this pulse amplitude and the twitch amplitude was recorded. The pulse amplitude was then gradually increased in intervals of 0.01V until a muscle contraction was generated. The voltage at which the first contraction occur was recorded as the twitch threshold. Once the twitch threshold was determined in the frog leg without the calcium channel blocker, 0.1 Ml of 1mM lanthanum chloride, or the calcium channel blocker, was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. The frog leg was then allowed to rest for ten minutes so that the blocker would have adequate time to work. Following this, the same procedure was repeated in which the pulse amplitude, beginning at 0V, was increased by 0.01V until twitch threshold was reached. This procedure was then repeated in its entirety for the second and third frog leg. The twitch threshold before the calcium channel blocker was administered was labeled as the controll group while the twitch threshold after was known as the treatment group. Once all data was collected a paired t_test was used to determine if there was a significent difference in twitch threshold when comparing it before and after the calcium channel blocker was injected.


Results:
The results of the experiment showed that on average the twitch threshold in the controll group, or before calcium channel blocker injection, was 0.15 ± 0.08 V while the twitch threshold in the experimental group was on average 0.15 ± 0.12 V. As can be seen in figure 2, the twitch threshold in relation to these two groups was nearly identical. A paired t_test further supported this premise by determining that there was no significent difference between the twitch threshold before and after the injection of the calcium channel blocker (t_stat=0.06, d.f.=3, p=0.95).


Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support what was hypothesized in that there was no significent difference between the controll and treatment group when it came to average twitch threshold. This means that the calcium channel blocker did not significently influence muscle contraction in the frog leg. While this seems counterintuitive given the importance calcium plays in muscle contractions, there is a possible explanation which involves an examination of the nature of the calcium channel blocker chemical. Lanthanum chloride while blocking Ca2+ channels, has actually been shown to increase the amount of the isotope Ca45 in smooth muscle by preventing its uptake [Weiss: 1969]. According to this study, the high concentration of Ca45 within the muscle can act in a similar way as a large influx of Ca2+. Because of this, lanthanum chloride can actually promote muscle contractions despite blocking the release of Ca2+. While this study focused on smooth muscles, Ca45 can also be found in skeletal muscle making this a plausible explanation for the results in which a lack of Ca2+ did not seem to influence contractions [Cosmos: 1962]. Based on this premise, Ca2+, while vitally important for skeletal muscle contraction, is not the only form of calcium by which this mechanism can occur. It is also important to note that other research which showed that calcium channel blockers decrease the ability of a muscle to contract use a different chemical such as 4-dihydropyridine to generate the results [Romey: 1988]. Hence, the outcomes may not be generalizable to this study.  In addition, the standard deviation in this experiment was relatively high in both conditions which demonstrates that the data was widely spread around the mean and likely not very reliable. In order to increase reliability and generalizability when conducting further research, a larger sample size of more than three frog legs should be used and stimulated. This is because a larger sample size could increase the significance of the results. Furthermore, the administration of the chemical, 1 alpha 25-Dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25D(3)), along with the lanthanum chloride could help decrease the effect lanthanum has of Ca45 reuptake. This is because studies have shown that 1,25D(3) increases the rate of intracellular Ca45 uptake [Toffolon: 1975]. The hypothesis that there was no significent difference in muscle contractions even after lanthanum chloride was injected due to a decrease Ca45 uptake would be validated by doing this. In addition, further research could be conducted using the large variety of different kinds of calcium channel blockers not containing lanthanum.  While the results of the study may not be valuable in exhibiting the importance of Ca2+ in skeletal muscle contractions, it does demonstrate how certain ions such as Ca45 also play a role in the complex process. Understanding the biological mechanisms which underlie muscle contraction is vitally important given that every living organism relies on these processes to function and survive. Because of this, further research into different chemicals which can either promote or inhibit muscle contraction is crucial for advancements in both general biological knowledge and medicine.
