Title: The Addition of Juvenile Hormone to a Manduca sexta Caterpillar Doesn’t have an Effect on Weight

Abstract:
Insects rely on hormone-based signaling, much like humans, to control behaviors, growth, development, and reproduction. The Tobacco Hornworm, classified as Manduca sexta, depends on three main hormones: the prothoracicotropic hormone, ecdysone, and the juvenile hormones. When juvenile hormone is in normal amounts, ecdysone promotes larva to larva molts. When the juvenile hormone is absent, ecdysone promotes immediate adulthood. This experiment tested the effect of additional juvenile hormone on the weight of caterpillars compared to control caterpillars that didn’t receive additional JH. The hypothesis suggested that additional juvenile hormone would disrupt the normal Manduca sexta lifecycle and cause the caterpillars exposed to additional JH to weigh less than those not subjected to the hormone. The experiment was comprised of four treatments and four control caterpillars which were all subjected to identical environmental conditions. The treatment caterpillars ate food that contained precor, a JH mimic, while the controls ate food containing distilled water. At the conclusion of the experiment, a two-variable-t-test revealed that JH had no effect on the weight of the caterpillars.

Introduction:
Hormones help humans function the way they do. They control development, moods, reproduction, etc. Without hormones, we wouldn’t be able to grow or survive. The same can be said for insects. Hormone-based signaling allow insects to control development, growth, behaviors, and other important physiological processes. Three main hormones regulate the molting and maturation processes in insects: the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysone, and the juvenile hormone. PTTH and ecdysone work conjunctly to regulate molting in insects. Molting is the shedding of the exoskeleton which allows insects to keep growing [Johnson: 2018]. Molts are separated by instars which are a series of growth stages in an insect that occur before an insect is ready to pupate and become an adult. Ecdysone is secreted by the prothoracic glands, which are located in the back of the head, when PTTH is released throughout the body. Ecdysone controls mainly the timing of molting [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysone works together with juvenile hormones to control growth, metamorphosis, and molting. Juvenile hormones are produced by the corpus allata and are responsible for the type of molt. When there is a sufficient amount of juvenile hormone in the insect, the ecdysone promotes larva to larva molts which are necessary for the proper growth of an insect. When JH amounts are low, ecdysone promotes pupation and adulthood [Johnson: 2018]. The insect can’t pupate and become an adult unless JH is not present in the insect [Johnson: 2018]. This was proven in an experiment where removing the corpus allata (secretes JH) from the Manduca sexta’s head causes immediate metamorphosis, or growth into an adult [Kiguchi: 1978].  Because of these facts, insect growth regulators have come about. Some of these inhibitors mimic the juvenile hormone and when these inhibitors are ingested by insects, they can prevent the insect from pupating and becoming an adult [Johnson: 2018]. This is beneficial for treating insects that become pests in adulthood. In this experiment, we want to see if adding a juvenile hormone mimic to the diets of Manduca sexta caterpillars (Tobacco Hornworms) will affect their weight over time, compared to caterpillars with a normal diet. Manduca sexta caterpillars are a good model organism for this experiment because they molt every 2-3 days and have a shorter lifespan. They are easy to keep track of over time in a laboratory setting. We hypothesize that adding additional JH to the Manduca sexta caterpillars diet will stunt its growth, and the caterpillars who aren’t subjected to the JH mimic will grow bigger and have greater weight than those who were treated.

Materials and Methods:
In this laboratory investigation, eight pre-weighed caterpillars were tested. Four were used as controls (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four made up the treatment group (T1, T2, T3, T4). To test the hypothesis, we needed a clear independent and dependent variable. The independent variable was that each caterpillar in the treatment group was fed ten grams of food each day that contained approximately 10 drops of 1:1250 precor solution, the juvenile hormone mimic. The dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillars after seven days. Each caterpillar in the control group was fed the same 10 grams of food, but the food contained 10 drops of distilled water. Throughout the duration of the experiment, every variable was held constant among all caterpillars except what was added to the food. Two caterpillars were placed in one plastic container separated by an index card. The caterpillars in the container were of the same experimental group, treatment or control. There was a total of four containers. They were all placed in the same incubator which had a temperature of 25 C. Each container also experienced 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. The food was changed every day, and each caterpillar received a fresh 10 grams of food that was treated according to the experimental group the caterpillar was in.The caterpillars were weighed each day of the experiment so a line graph could be made to visualize the difference in weight between the treatment and control group. A two-sample t-test was administered to compare the means from the control and treatment group, and to see if the data was statistically significant. 

Results:
Throughout the experiment, the caterpillars in the control group grew at a steady, similar rate. In fact, on day 6, C1, C3, and C4 weighed the exact same (Figure 1). At the end of 7 days, the control caterpillars had similar weight values. The four treatment caterpillars did not grow at a steady rate resulting in drastically different weights at the end of the experiment. Day 3 is where the first true separation in weights of the treatment and control groups can be seen (Figure 1). In regard to the treatment caterpillars, T1 and T4 showed a similar weight trend over the seven days. T3 showed a trend in growth that was very similar to the control caterpillars. At the end of seven days, T3 weighed more that C2 and C3 (Figure 1). Another observation was that C1, C3, T2, and T3 all lost weight one day into the experiment. The only one to continue this trend every day of the experiment was T2. T2 was the only caterpillar that showed discoloration at the end of the experiment. While the other seven caterpillars were a bright greenish color , T2 was a brown-yellow color. It was also noted that T2 ate noticeably less food than the other caterpillars. The two-sample-t-test that was performed showed that the mean of the control group was not statistically different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 2.316, df = 6, P = 0.073).

Discussion:
The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effects of additional juvenile hormone on the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars compared to the weight of caterpillars that received no additional juvenile hormone. It is predicted that caterpillars receiving additional JH (precor) in their diets will weigh less than those who were not treated. This was predicted because when natural JH is in the insect body, they can’t possibly mature into adults [Johnson: 2018]. We believe that the caterpillars who aren’t treated with additional JH will eventually have no JH in the body and will be able to develop into an adult. Those treated with JH will never not have JH in the body (because of the treatment) and will molt towards adulthood at a much slower rate and will weigh less than controls after seven days. Our hypothesis was rejected because the results of the statistical two-variable-t-test showed that the P-value was high. A P-value this high indicates that the means of the experimental and control group were not statistically different and the hypothesis was rejected, and JH had no effect in the experiment. This was different from the results of a different experiment. In this experiment, removal of the corpus allata (secretes JH) at the last molting stage caused the larva to begin metamorphosis a day earlier than Manduca sexta caterpillars who did not have the corpus allata removed [Kiguchi:1978]. This shows that the caterpillars with JH still in the body develop slower than those with no JH left (after removal of corpus allata). In our experiment, even though the control group, on average, had greater mass than the treatment group at the end of the experiment, the means of both groups were not statistically different enough for the hypothesis to be supported.  We believe that T3, the Manduca sexta caterpillar that weighed more than both C2 and C3 was the reason our P-value was as high as it was. T3 did not progress the way we thought it would. It was fed the food with the precor (juvenile hormone mimic) and according to our hypothesis, it was supposed to weigh less than the controls who were not treated with JH. We believe that T3 is the reason our hypothesis was not statistically supported. In regard to coloration, we believe that T2 was the brownish-yellow color because the JH addition was too much for the organism to handle, and it was slowly dying. We believe that our hypothesis was not statistically supported because the population size was too small. We believe if more caterpillars were in the control and treatment group, the hypothesis could have been supported by the t-test. This is because after playing with the t-test template, we found that changing only one weight value in the treatment decreased the p-value by a significant amount. For further experimentation, it might be better to apply the precor (JH) directly to the skin or mouth of the caterpillar so it could be absorbed. When applying it to the food, the effects of the JH on the growth of the caterpillar is determined by how much of the food the caterpillar eats.
