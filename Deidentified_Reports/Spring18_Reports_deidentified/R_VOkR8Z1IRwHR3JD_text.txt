Title: Murky Water Decreases Aggressive Facing Behaviors in male Betta splendins

Abstract:
	The murkiness of water affects the behaviors of Betta splendins. There are three aggressive facing movements that betta fish exhibit—erecting pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and showing “mane.” In this experiment, we observed and rated on a scale system the aggressive behaviors of male betta fish when encountered with another male betta fish. The biological question we addressed was: does water murkiness affect a fish’s aggressive behaviors towards other male fish? We hypothesized that in murky water, a male betta fish will display less aggressive behaviors. We used a 1 tailed 2 sample T-test to test our hypothesis, and our results were statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.039. The betta fish in murky water averaged to be more aggressive, supporting our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
	Betta fish behave differently in murky water and clear water. Murky water is their natural environment, and they are less likely to see clearly. Therefore, if a fish is less likely to see another fish, particularly a male fish, in the same enclosure, it is less likely to demonstrate aggressive behavior. 
	Facing movements, an expression of aggressive behavior in betta fish, include facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading gill covers, and showing “mane.” 
	Our biological question is: will murky water affect facing behaviors of the male betta fish? Our hypothesis is that murky water will decrease aggressive facing behaviors. It is important to study animal behavior because it shows us how animals evolve over time in response to their environment. 
	Paul M. Bronstein found in his study titled “Predictors of dominance in male Betta splendins” that when observing aggressive behaviors of male betta fish, it is ideal to use distilled clear tap water and avoid colors on the bottom of the aquarium tank. He found that bettas exhibit their most aggressive behaviors when the water has no chemicals or color tints. His study allows us to conclude that bettas in murky water are less likely to behave aggressively towards one another (Bronstein: 1985). 
	Similarly, Blakeslee, McRobert, Brown, and Clotfelter studied the effects of coloration of nearby fish on the aggressive behaviors of bettas. They concluded that betta fish behavior is affected by the coloration of other fish present in the small tank (Blakeslee et al: 1973). Therefore, betta fish behavior is impacted when they can’t see as clearly, applying to our argument about murky water. 


Materials and Method:
	For this experiment, we had a small aquarium with three fish in it, separated by both opaque and clear dividers. First, we ran our experiment with clear water. We removed the opaque divider, leaving the clear in place, and observed the aggressive behaviors of the fish for five minutes. We then let them rest for five minutes. Next, we repeated the procedure, but compared fish B and fish C. Following a five minute break, we repeated the procedure for fish A and C after switching fish B and fish C’s compartments. 
	After recording our observations, we poured potting soil into the aquarium and mixed it with the water to create murkiness. We repeated the procedure above and recorded our observations. 
	To quantify the aggressive behavior of the betta fish, we used a points system. After counting how many times each fish exhibited a facing movement, we ranked it on a scale from one to three—erecting its pectoral fins receiving a score of 1, spreading its gill covers scoring 2, and protruding the branchiostegal membrane scoring 3. We multiplied the scores with the number of times the facing movements were exhibited and added numbers up to quantify an overall rating of aggressive behavior. 


Results:
	In the clear water with the clear divider in place and the opaque divider removed, fish A and fish B both received scores of 70 and 57, respectively. Fish A erected its pectoral fin once, spread its gill covers 15 times, and showed its mane 13 times. Fish B didn’t erect its pectoral fin, but spread its gill covers 9 times, and showed its mane 13 times. 
	When we compared fish B and fish C in the clear water, B received a score of 71, while C received a score of 34. B erected its pectoral fin 3 times, spread its gill covers 13 times, and showed its mane 14 times. C didn’t erect its pectoral fins, but spread its gill covers 8 times, and showed its mane 6 times. 
	Fish A and fish C earned scores of 68 and 41, respectively. Fish A erected its pectoral fin twice, spread its gill covers 9 times, and showed its mane 16 times. C didn’t erect its pectoral fins, but spread its gill covers 19 times, and showed its mane once. 
	The fish had different ways of exhibiting aggressive behaviors. While fish A frequently showed its mane, fish C showed aggressiveness primarily by spreading its gill covers. Still, each fish’s aggressiveness score was high in each trial. 
	In the murky water, it took fish A and fish B about one minute to even notice each other, and after a few seconds, they began to lose interest in each other. Fish A erected its pectoral fin once, spread its gill covers once, and showed its mane 15 times. Fish B erected its pectoral fin once, spread its gill covers five times, and didn’t show its mane. Overall, fish A received an aggressiveness score of 48, while fish B’s score was 11. 
	When we compared fish B and C, we found that fish C lost interest in fish B quickly—within one minute of noticing him. Fish B had an aggressiveness score of 67, and fish C had a score of 18. Fish B erected its pectoral fin once, spread its gill covers 9 times, and showed its mane 16 times. Fish C didn’t erect its pectoral fin or show its mane, but spread its gill covers 9 times. 
	Fish A and fish C received scores of 23 and 14. Fish A didn’t erect its pectoral fins, but spread its gill covers 4 times, and showed its mane 5 times. Fish C didn’t erect its pectoral fins and didn’t show its mane, but spread its gill covers 7 times.  
	As seen in Figure 1, the average aggressiveness score of the fish in clear water was 56.83, and the average in murky water was 30.17. The standard deviation in clear water was 15.94, and 22.37 in murky water. Our results were statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.039. 


Discussion:
	The results of the experiment agreed with our hypothesis and were statistically significent. We predicted that the betta fish in the murky water would be less aggressive, and our predictions were correct. Because they couldn’t see as far, they lost interest soon after recognizing the other fish, so while they still displayed aggressive behaviors, the behavior didn’t last as long, making the aggressiveness score average among the fish in the murky water lower than the scores of the fish in the clear water. 
	A source of error could be that the fish’s behaviors were affected throughout the experiment because of familiarity with the other fish. If we had spaced out the trials more, it is possible that we could have obtained more accurate results. Dzieweczyński and Perazio showed in their study titled “I know you: familiarity with an audience influences male-male interactions in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendins” that familiarity with other bettas could influence a fish’s behavior. They claimed that bettas showed signs of familiarity with other fish they encountered for up to four hours. Their gill flaring and tail beating behaviors were affected, and the familiarity effect almost always lasted at least 4 hours (Dzieweczyński et al: 2012). Therefore, throughout the trials, it is possible that the bettas were becoming familiar with one another and their aggressive behaviors were impacted. 
	It is important to observe the behaviors of animals to understand how they have evolved over time. The aggressive behaviors of betta fish, in particular, are important to study to see how they have evolved throughout a history of domestication. It reveals the human impact on the evolution of the species.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Effect of murky water vs clear water on aggressive behaviors of Betta splendins. Aggressive behaviors of three male betta fish were observed and quantified on a scale from 1 to 3, then multiplied by the number of times they occurred. Aggressive behavior data was grouped by water type. The bars represent the average aggressiveness score of the fish in the clear water and the fish in the murky water. Error bars are ± 15.94 s.d. For the clear water group and ± 22.37 for the murky water group.
