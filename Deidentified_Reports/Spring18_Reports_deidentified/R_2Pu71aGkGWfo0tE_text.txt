Title:  Impact of Tetraethylammonium chloride on Relaxation time and twitch duration of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the introduction of Tetraethylammonium chloride, a potassium channel blocker, will cause an effect on the relaxation time and twitch duration of the muscles of the Rania pipiens frog leg. It was hypothesized that larger relaxation periods and a larger twitch durations would occur when the potassium channel blocker was administered. Electrical impulses are fired into 3 frog legs and twitch duration and relaxation period for 3 myograms are recorded and interpreted before and after the potassium channel blocker is inserted. After data collection was complete, the data indicated that muscles inserted with the potassium channel blocker had larger relaxation periods and larger twitch durations. It can be concluded that our results did support the hypotheses.


Introduction:
The Rania pipiens , also known as the Northern Leopard Frog, is a great animal to observe neuromuscular interaction and muscle contraction in [Rogers: 2012]. When nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, they promote the release of acetylcholine (ACh). Acetylcholine proceeds to bind to receptors on muscle fibers which prompt the opening of the sodium channel. The entrance of sodium causes depolarization in the cell. The opening of sodium channels causes the generation of action potentials which in turn prompts the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium allows for the activation of contractile mechanism which shortens muscle (contraction) [Johnson: 2018]. Potassium also plays a large role in muscle contraction. If potassium channels are blocked, muscles will have increasingly difficult time relaxing because repolarization cannot occur. 

The present study attempts to determine the effects of Tetraethylammonium chloride, a potassium channel blocker on the relaxation period and twitch duration on the muscles of 3  Rania pipiens frog legs. We hypothesize that a muscle that is inserted with the potassium channel blocker will have a larger relaxation period and a larger twitch duration because potassium is blocked what will cause problems and even stop repolarization in the muscle.


Materials and Method:
3 Rania pipiens frog legs were skinned and cut at the Achilles tendon, exposing the gastrocnemus muscle. The muscle is suspended to a force transducing machine connected to iworx. For each leg, 2 electrodes are placed in the sciatic nerve. Computer software settings were set to .5 Hz, 5 pulses, and 0.8 v. We fired electrical impulses resulting in myograms. Twitch duration and relaxation periods are recorded for three myograms. .1 Ml of Tetraethylammonium chloride was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and a 2-minute time gap is observed before proceeding.  Electrical impulses are fired and twitch duration and relaxation period for 3 myograms are recorded. This process was repeated for the other two frog legs.

Results:
In figure one, the data collected shows that there is a large difference between the  average twitch durations for the controll group and the experimental. In addition, figure 2 also shows that there is a large difference between the average relaxation time between the controll group and the experimental group. Table one shows the extremely large difference between the average twitch durations for both groups. Table two also shows the extremely large difference between the average relaxation times in both groups. The paired t_test provided p_values of 0.009599 (twitch duration) and 0.010885 (Relaxation time). These values indicate that the data attained is statistically significance.



Discussion:
After all the observations and statistical calculations have concluded, it can be determined that the results attained affirm the original hypothesis. In addition, the hypothesis was statistically supported. 

One likely source of error regards the administration of the potassium channel blocker. If the syringe is not handled properly or placed in the proper place, the full amount of  Tetraethylammonium chloride may not enter the muscle, rendering it useless and providing inaccurate myogram readings. If this experiment were to be repeated again, I would double the amount of time I would record data in addition to adding two more frog legs to the experiment. This way, we can have more data to compare our results with. 

Even if the hypothesis is supported, this experiment is a great way to portray relationships the brain, nervous system, and muscles. It also allows for a deeper understanding of some of the basic properties of the neuromuscular controll
