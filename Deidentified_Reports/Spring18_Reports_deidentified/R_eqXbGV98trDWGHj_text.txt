Title: Phenotypic Variation in Root-to-Shoot Ratios of Buckwheat Plants

Abstract:
This experiment examines the root-to-shoot ratios of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), a semi-succulent plant. My hypothesis that plants grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil was not supported. Buckwheat was planted in six pots: two with sand, two with soil, and two with a 50/50 mixture of sand and soil. After two weeks, root: shoot ratios were determined for length and weight. The results show a pattern where sand and mixed pots generate buckwheat with heavier roots. If a plant expends more energy on longer, or heavier roots, they may not have enough energy left to have more leaves for capturing sunlight for photosynthesis. Plants that are grown in sand and the mix of soil and sand allocated longer roots to reach the water that sank to the bottom of the pots. This experiment applies to the broader context of sea level rise and erosion. Plants in coastal areas grow long roots into the sand in order to hold dunes together. By studying root-to-shoot ratios of different species of plants, we can determine which plants are suitable to preserve beaches and coastal areas.   

Introduction:
In order to survive, plants need an array of nutrients; namely, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. A plant's environment often determines its access to these nutrients in addition to water and sunlight. Plants often allocate certain resources in response to environmental variation to enhance their fitness. Resource allocation is an example of a trade-off because plants cannot put energy toward growths to allocate all resources at once. Because plants have a certain degree of plasticity, they can differ in how they allocate among their leaves, roots, and stems. One example of phenotypic allocation is plants extending their roots to increase the root-to-shoot ratios when water is scarce or nutrients are low. When plants grow in sand, for example, they often need to allocate resources in order to adapt to the disadvantages of sand, including the inability to retain water and nutrients due to its porous nature. (Disraeli: 1984)  Phenotypic allocation is important to study because it can determine the plasticity of a species in an environment which may become crucial due to climate change. Climate, which has changed globally, controlls the abundance and temporal distribution of erosive agents, as well as the type, density and distribution of vegetation that protects the Earth's surface from erosion. (Peizhen et al.: 2001) Climate change is perpetuating food scarcity around the world and in the future, people my need to find new and innovative ways to produce food in the evolving climate. This experiment applies to sea level rise and erosion due to climate change. Plants in coastal areas grow long roots into the sand in order to hold dunes together. By studying root-to-shoot ratios of different species of plants, we can determine which plants are suitable to preserve beaches and coastal areas. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is an advantageous plant to use for this experiment because it has plasticity in allocation, it grows quickly, and it is easy to determine where the shoot ends and the roots begin which is important for determining R:S ratios. My hypothesis is that buckwheat grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil. 

Materials and Method:
First, we collected six pots and filled two with only sand, two with soil, and two with a 50/50 mixture of sand and soil. Next, we watered each pot thoroughly and poured an even amount of miracle grow over each pot. Then, we evenly planted a hand.f.ul of buckwheat seeds in each pot. For the next two weeks, we watered the plants each day. In order to be consistent with watering, we watered the plants around noon each day. After the two-week period, we emptied the pots one by one into a warm water bath to separate the individual buckwheat plants. We gently pulled the roots apart and lay the individual plants on a paper towel to dry. We measured the roots and shoots of three plants from each category for weight in grams. Then, we measured the roots and shoots of three plants from each category for length in centimeters. Afterwards, we calculated the R:S ratios for each plant. Finally, we ran an ANOVA test on the values of the R:S ratio for root lengths and the R:S ratio for shoot lengths for plants grown in sand, soil, and a 50/50 mixture. Then, we ran a Tukey-Kramer test to test for significance. 

Results:
 Figure 1. shows the weight ratios for root-to-shoot in grams for three groups: controll (soil), mixed (50% sand 50% soil), and sand. The mean for the controll (n=3) is 0.097 ± 0.041. The mean for the mixed (n=3) is 0.302 ± 0.075. The mean for the sand (n=3) is 0.310 ±  0.079. The difference between the controll and mixed is significent, and the difference between the controll and sand is significent (p= 0.014). However, the difference between the mixed and the sand was not significent (p=0.88). Figure 2. shows the length ratios for root-to-shoot in centimeters for three groups: controll (soil), mixed (50% sand 50% soil), and sand. The mean for the controll (n=3) is 0.844 ± 0.301. The mean for mixed (n=3) is 0.880 ±  0.383. The mean for sand (n=3) is 0.846 ± 0.171. Upon visual observation, the buckwheat in all six pots looked similar with many green sprouts with long, thin stems as pictured in figure 3. There were no noticeable differences between plants in the six pots. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that plants grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil was not supported. Instead, the results have a pattern that shows the sand and mixed pots generating buckwheat plants with heavier roots than shoots. Although the roots were heavier they were not necessarily longer in comparison to the shoots. The biological reasoning for this could be because the shoots have leaves. With phenotypic allocation, plants do not want to expend too much energy on unnecessary structures. If a plant must expend more energy on longer, or heavier roots, they may not have enough energy left to have more leaves for capturing sunlight for photosynthesis. The weight of the leaves would have more of an impact on the calculations than the weight of the roots since the leaves are large in comparison to the rest of the plant, however they do not necessarily add height. The plants with longer roots were planted in the sand and mixed pots. They had fewer leaves and therefore the root: shoot ratios were higher for the plants with longer roots. The water sank to the bottom of the pots with sand and mixed and therefore plants had to expend more energy to reach the resources they needed with the roots. The reason that there was no significent difference between the mixed and the sand but there was a significent difference between the mixed and the soil could have been because the mixed with the soil had did not enough soil to keep the water from trickling down to the very bottom of the pot. The soil particles are very fine, however, the sand particles are very large and they may have created enough open spaces for water to continue to fall to the bottom of the pots. 
	As climates across the world are changing, seawater levels are rising. Sea level rise poses threats to all aquatic plant community types in the vicinity of the oceans, and changes in weather patterns and salinity will affect many. (Short, et al.: 2016) Many sand beaches are eroding due to sea level rise and plants are placed in sand in order to keep dunes intact and to keep beaches from washing away. These plants grow long roots into the sand in order to hold dunes together. They are able to grow these long roots because the water sinks deep into the sand and the plants must allocate in order acquire the nutrients. By studying root-to-shoot ratios of different species of plants, we can determine which plants are suitable to preserve beaches and coastal areas.
