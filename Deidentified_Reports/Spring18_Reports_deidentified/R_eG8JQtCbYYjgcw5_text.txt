Title: The effect of an ecdysterone inhibitor on Manducta Sexta larvae weight gain

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if the introduction of an ecdysterone (20E) inhibitor would decrease the rate of weight gain and prevent molting in Manducta sexta before the commitment pulse. 20E is a steroid hormone implicated in regulating the timing at which a caterpillar molts. In addition to 20E levels increasing before a molt, the weight of the larvae also increases since caterpillars have been shown to need to surpass a threshold weight before this can occur. For this experiment, eight M. sexta caterpillars were placed in an experimental group where they received food infused with the inhibitor or placed in a control group where food was mixed with only water. In addition, the initial weight of each caterpillar was taken before they were placed in an incubator for seven days. During these days new food was provided every 24 hours and observations were made. Following the seven-day trial, each caterpillar was reweighed. It was hypothesized that caterpillars in the experimental group would on average have gained less weight than those in the control group. It was also theorized that caterpillars exposed to the inhibitor would be less likely to molt.  The results of the experiment did not support this hypothesis, however, as there was no significant difference 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta or tobacco hornworm is a holometabolous insect. This means that it goes through 4 major life stages, including egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. The transition from each of these life stages requires molting which occurs when the insect's skin cells create a new out layer and the old one is shed. This process allows the hornworm to develop, grow, and change in morphology. Hormones in insects regulate this development through the triggering of physiological change during molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence into adulthood (Johnson:2018). Hormones are secreted by different glands and cells and circulate in the bloodstream where they are carried towards specific organs with which they initiate a response or interact (Zimmerman:2016). The steroid hormone ecdysterone (20E) is particularly vital for insect development and is produced by the prothoracic glands. Generally, this hormone regulates the timing at which molting occurs.  
For this experiment, the relationship between weight gain, metamorphic molting, and 20E will be analyzed. A spike of 20E leads to something known as the commitment pulse which is produced when the hornworm is ready to molt. In addition, a study by Suzuki et al. states that M. sexta larvae must reach a threshold weight and surpass it before it can molt (Suzuki et al.:2013). Based on this premise, it is hypothesized that the introduction of a 20E inhibitor, Azagard, in the M. sexta will prevent molting and lead to a decrease in the rate of weight gain since the caterpillar will not be preparing for metamorphosis.


Materials and Methods:
In order to study the effects a 20E inhibitor would have on insect development, eight M. sexta caterpillars who had not yet passed the commitment pulse were used. These caterpillars were separated into two groups of four and then randomly allocated to either the control group or the experimental group. The caterpillars were then weighed in grams to determine their initial weight before the experiment began (figure 2). Following this, two caterpillars from the same group were placed in a container together separated by an index card. This arrangement can be seen in figure 3. For the control group, ten grams of food was mixed with ten drops of water and placed within each division. In the experimental group, however, the food was mixed with the inhibitor Azagard. Each caterpillar also received ten grams of food treated with ten drops of the inhibitor. Both groups were then placed in an incubator set at 23°C. The experiment lasted seven days and caterpillars were refed every day with the same mixture described above. In addition, observations were made daily to record behavioral changes as well as determine if the caterpillars were molting. After the seven day trial, the caterpillars were weighed again and their final weights were recorded. The average change in weight within both groups was determined and then compared using a two-sample t-test.  

Results:
The results of the experiment showed that on average, caterpillars in the control group gained 0.43 ± 3.42 grams within the seven day period while caterpillars in the experimental group lost 0.43 ± 1.65 grams (figure 1). Two out of the four caterpillars in the control group molted while none in the experimental group did. In addition, one of the caterpillars in the experimental group died within five days of the experiment. It was observed that caterpillars in the control group were more active and moved more than those in the experimental group. Despite this, a two-sample t-test determined that there was no significant difference between the experimental group and control group in relation to average weight change (t-stat= 0.45, df=6, p=0.67) This can also be seen in figure 1. 


Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support what was hypothesized in that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental group when it came to average weight change. In addition, there was a very high standard deviation for the weight change average in both the experimental and control group which demonstrates that the data is more widely spread around the mean and hence likely less reliable. However, caterpillars in the control group were shown to be more likely to successfully molt. This may hint to the conclusion that a 20E inhibitor while effective at preventing molting, does not influence weight loss as hypothesized. Other research supports the premise that the timing of molting and the successful initiation of molting is directly related to the presence or increase of 20E (Riddiford et al.:1978, 2003)(Andres et al.:1993). A study by Nijhout in 1975 further states that during the interval before metamorphosis, the period where 20E increases, the larvae must reach a critical weight in order to develop further (Nijhout:1975). However, it is unclear whether ecdysterone actually promotes this weight gain in preparation for molting and the results of this experiment suggest that there is no connection.    
When conducting further research several different experimental flaws should be accounted for. Primarily, the containers separating the caterpillars were not very effective and larvae in the control group and the experimental group chewed or broke through the barrier as shown in figure 4. This may have influenced the results of the study given that there was no real way to differentiate which caterpillar was which and hence how much the caterpillar weighed initially. Therefore, the change in weight between initial weighing and final weighing might not have been entirely accurate. Another experimental flaw was that only eight M. sexta hornworms were used and this is a very small sample size. Because of this, it would be unlikely that any meaningful or significant trends could be identified or generalized to the larger M. sexta population. It is also important to note that with eight caterpillars the general trend, despite statistical insignificance, did exhibit that on average caterpillars in the experimental group lost weight while those in the experimental group gained weight. A larger sample size would be extremely beneficial for follow up research as it could increase the significance of the results.
 Despite these flaws, the results of this study may be valuable in determining what biological mechanisms influencing molting may or may not occur as a result of insufficient 20E levels in M. sexta. While studies have shown and 20E levels effect when a molt occurs, the results of this study do not support the premise that insufficient amounts of the hormone decrease weight gain and limit molting in this way. Studying animals in relation to hormone regulation can help determine how biological mechanisms influence normal development. In addition, understanding that certain developmental stages occur as a result of specific hormones can greatly benefit future research.
