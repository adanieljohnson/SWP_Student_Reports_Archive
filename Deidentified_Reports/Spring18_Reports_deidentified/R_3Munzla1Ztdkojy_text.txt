Title: Limited availability of food in the environments increased the occurrence of aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendins.

Abstract:
This study investigates the effect of food availability on aggression in male Betta splendins. This is indicative of allocation of energy expenditure in different environments. The fish display aggressive behaviors as a form of social communication within their own species to compete for resources. We hypothesized that if Betta splendins are placed in an environment with low and then high food availability, then the fish will demonstrate more aggressive behaviors when food availability is low. In this study the independent variable was the availability of food. Betta splendins were placed in a tank with just a glass partition between them and given first no food and then a pinch of food on both sides. The number of times the fish touched the glass in five minutes was recorded in both environments. The results did not support our hypothesis. A one tailed paired t_test determined that the fish displayed significently more aggressive behaviors in the environment with no food, which was opposite of what we expected. This is likely because when food was added, both fish were satisfied. They had no need to compete, so they could allocate their energy to more beneficial tasks, rather than aggression.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behaviors. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are known to exhibit agnostic or aggressive behaviors in the presence of other males. This intraspecific aggression is essential for them to obtain vital resources, which are available in limited quantities. These limited resources must be competed for, so aggression is a worthwhile place to invest their energy.  At rest, Betta splendins are dull in color and their fins beat slowly and calMly. However, when put in an environment with another male, the fish are excited. A previous study illustrated that aggressive behaviors among male Betta splendins increased in the presence of a single female, as the two male fish attempted to compete for her [Doutrelant et al, 2001]. The Betta spelendens in this study were choosing to expend energy towards aggression in an attempt to win over the limited resource, the single female fish. Therefore, aggression works as a maker of hierarchy, with the most aggressive fish at the top of the ladder with first pick of limited resources [Haller et al, 1988]. We believed that when an essential resource is presented, the fish will demonstrate increased aggression to compete for it.  Additionally, the study showed that Betta splendins have very noticeable aggressive behaviors, making aggression easy to quantify. This is why Betta splendins were chosen as the model organism. In this experiment, the effect of the availability of another resource, food, on aggressive behaviors was studied. We made our hypothesis based on an article on Betta splendins that found that communities of the fish create hierarchies, with those at the top receiving the most resources. We hypothesized that if Betta splendins were placed in adjacent tanks separated by just a glass partition, then the number of times they tap the glass, a sign of aggression, will be higher in the presence of food than with no food.


Materials and Method:
A large tank was filled with distilled water. A clear piece of plastic was placed in slots on the walls of the tank, creating two separate chambers in the tank. Two male Betta splendins were chosen for the experiment. One was placed in each of the two chambers of the tank. A timer was set for five minutes and the fish were observed. The number of times each fish approached the divider and touched the glass was recorded. The numbers for each fish were added together to get the total number of times this particular aggressive behavior occurred in five minutes. This exact procedure was repeated two more times, placing a dark piece of glass to separate the fish in between trials to prevent habituation. A pinch of food was then added to each chamber of the tank. The procedure was then repeated three more times. Averages for the number of aggressive behaviors in environments with and without food available were recorded. A one tailed paired t_test as run to analyze the significance of the difference at the alpha level 0.05 [Johnson:2018]. 


Results:
The fish with no food available to them had an average of 8.33+/-2.52 aggressive behaviors, times a fish touched the glass partition, per five minutes. The fish with food available had an average of 1+/-1 aggressive behaviors per five minutes. These values are depicted in Figure 1, which shows that the results for each varied greatly. The one tailed paired t_test between the average aggressive behaviors per five minutes for the fish with and without food showed that the difference was statistically significent (t= 3.61, d.f.= 2, p= 0.034). 


Discussion:
The results of this study did not support our hypothesis. We hypothesized that if Betta splendins were placed in adjacent tanks separated by just a glass partition, then the number of times they tap the glass, a sign of aggression, will be higher in the presence of food than with no food. The hypothesis that we made was due to our understanding of aggressive and agnostic behaviors in males. In a previous experiment, we saw that in the presence of a single female, two Betta splendins exhibit more aggressive behaviors as they compete for the limited “resource”. This lead us to assume that the fish would behave similarly if they had food present to compete over. Our study did find significent results; they were just not the results that we expected. We found that Betta splendins demonstrated significently more glass touches, an aggressive behavior, per five minutes when they were in an environment with low food availability compared to the number in an environment with high food availability. This is likely because when food supply was high, the fish did not feel the need to compete. Both males had adequate resources. However, when food supply was low, the fish were concerned about the limited resource and viewed the other as a threat. This is what prompted them to display increased aggression. A similar study conducted on Betta splendins found a high correlation between aggression and hunger, so their results also showed higher aggression when food supply was low [Hogan: 1980]. Our study could have been improved by further manipulating the Betta splendins hunger levels prior to the experiment. At the start of the experiment we simply chose two random male fish, with no knowledge of their previous environment or how recently they had been fed. If the fish had been feed right before we came into lab, they would not be hungry and would have less motivation to compete for food and display aggression in the low food availability environment. To controll for this, the study should be conducted again, ensuring that the fish do not receive any food in the 24 hours before the experiment begins. Additionally, the experiment could be improved by collecting data from multiple sets of male fish, rather than just two individuals, like the Haller study did [Haller: 1988]. There is a chance that the two fish chosen have an unusual predisposition to a certain level of aggression. Some fish are more likely to display aggression than others. Studying a greater number of fish would help to controll for this. This study is important because it displays the way that competition leads to energy investment of animals. When resources are limited and there is competition, it is necessary for organisms to invest energy towards aggression so they can obtain the resources they need. When there is excess of resources, this aggression is unnecessary and the individuals choose to invest their energy more wisely.

Figure Legends: Figure 1: The average and standard deviation of the number of glass touches, an aggressive behavior. By Betta splendins in environments with and without food were significently different. Error bars showed a standard deviation of 2.52 for the no food environment and 1 for the environment with food added. A one-tailed paired t_test was statistically significent (t= 3.61,  p= 0.034).
