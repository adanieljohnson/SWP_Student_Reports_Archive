Title: Effect of Murky Water on the Aggressive Behaviors of Betta Splendins 

Abstract:
When in the presence of other male and female members of their species, betta fish exhibit agnostic intraspecific behavior.  Common facing movements include facing an opponent with erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membrane (Johnson, 2018).  In increasing order of aggression, there are three specific facing movements that we will be counting.   The fish were physically separated but were able to see each other through a clear glass separation.   Our one-tailed, two sample t_test for the aggressive behavior scores in clear and murky water showed a significent difference between the groups (t_stat = 2.38, d.f. = 10, p = 0.039).  My hypothesis was supported based on the data and the results from the t_test.  There was in fact a significent smaller difference between the aggressive points accumulated with fish in murky water versus clear water.


Introduction:
Ethnology is defined as the scientific study of animal behavior incorporating natural history, laboratory method and insights from ecology, genetics and evolutionary biology.  Bettas Splendins (Siamese Fighting Fish), commonly referred to as betta fish, are indigenous to Thailand where they live in ponds, ditches, rice paddies and other sluggish or murky waters.  When in the presence of other male and female members of their species, betta fish exhibit agnostic intraspecific behavior.  Males compete for space through the use of aggressive behavior and are able to coordinate their fighting activities by means of visual signals (Bronstein, 1981). Domesticated male Betta splendins, exhibit highly variable social behavior (Bronstien, 1985). Betta fish exhibit two main types of behavior: broad side movements and facing movements.  Common broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing.  Common facing movements include facing an opponent with erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membrane (Johnson, 2018).  When the water becomes murky, I expect betta fish to exhibit less aggressive behaviors compared to when the fish is not exposed to murky waters.  This experiment is important to the scientific field because it can help us better understand the behavior of Betta fish in their natural habitat of murky water.  

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we focused on betta fish facing movements.  In increasing order of aggression, there are three specific facing movements that we will be counting.  The least aggressive movement, pectoral fins erect, was given a value of one point.  The second aggressive behavior, which was spreading gill covers, was assigned a value of two points.  The most aggressive behavior, protruding the branchiostegal membrane, was assigned a point value of three points.  We used three male betta fish given letter designations A, B and C.  These fish were physically separated but were able to see each other through a clear glass separation.  We first carried out the interactions between fish A and fish B for five minutes counting how many times each facing movement occurred then multiplying by the assigned point value to give an overall score.  We then carried out the same process for fish B and fish C and then for fish A and fish C.  Between each trial five minutes of rest occurred in which none of the fish could see each other through the glass separation.  We repeated the whole process again but this time adding potting soiling to the water in order to make the water murky so the fish weren’t able to easily identify the presence of another fish.  We carried out a one-tailed, two sample t_test in order to statistically interpret the data.

Results:
The mean and standard deviation of the aggressive point values for the clear water was 56.8 +/- 15.94.  The mean and standard deviation of the aggressive point values for the murky water was 30.2 +/-22.4.  As seen through figure 1, the aggressive behavior average points for the clear water treatment was greater than that of the murky water.  However, both of the two treatments both have quite a large standard deviation (15.9 for clear, 22.3 for murky) which can point to the wide range of individual data points.  One specific observation that is noteworthy is that for the murky water, the fish did not acknowledge the presence of the other fish immediately due to the soil in the water.  In addition, the fish also seemed to lose interest in showing aggressive behaviors in the murky water as there were parts of the five-minute period that the fish swam away from the glass partition.  Our one-tailed, two sample t_test for the aggressive behavior scores in clear and murky water showed a significent difference between the groups (t_stat = 2.38, d.f. = 10, p = 0.039).

Discussion:
As seen through the results presented in the results section, the t_test showed a significent difference in aggressive behaviors for betta fish in murky and clear water.  My hypothesis was that in murky water caused by soil, betta fish would accumulate less aggressive behavior points than betta fish in clear water.  My hypothesis was supported based on the data and the results from the t_test.  There was in fact a significent smaller difference between the aggressive points accumulated with fish in murky water versus clear water.  Biologically, these results can be explained by Bronstein’s point that a pair of male Bettas confront each other, it appears that the most persistent attacker eventually be- comes dominant and causes its opponent to retreat (Bronstein, 1985).  This can explain as to why the fish in the murky water began to lose interest in one another and would then display less aggressive behaviors towards each other.  Bronstein also notes that animals which are most quickly to attack visual images of intraspecific species are also the fish that will most persist in their aggressive behavior (Bronstein 1985).  This can help explain as to why the fish exhibited the most frequency and intensity (protruding the branchiostegal membrane) during the first few seconds of initially locating the other fish on the other side of the glass partition.  There were no particular errors that occurred in this experiment however one error that could have occurred was not allowing the betta fish enough time to rest between each trial by not visually separating the fish using an opaque divider.  Lack of rest time would lead to habituation and less aggressive behaviors would be observed which would lead to lower numbers on the aggressive point scales.  As far as the bigger picture and future implications for this experiment, one item of note is that this experiment can help us better understand agnostic behavior prevalence and frequency in betta fish.  This experiment can also translate to betta fish in their natural habitat in murky ditches and rivers throughout southeast Asia.  Because betta fish live in murky water, we attempted to reproduce this condition by adding potting soil so that we could attempt to understand betta fish behavior in their natural habitat.  However, one important distinction that must be made from my previous point was that the betta fish that we used in this experiment were acquired from a pet store rather than betta fish taken from streams and rivers from Thailand.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Aggressive Behavior points of male betta fish in clear water versus murky water showed that more points were accumulated for clear water than for murky water.  Six trials were carried out for each treatment and the mean for murky and clear water was 56.9 and 30.1 points respectively with standard deviations of 15.9 and 22.4 respectively.
