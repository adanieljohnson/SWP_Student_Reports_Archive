Title: Calcium blocker affects the twitch threshold in the Rania Pipiens by inhibiting the reuptake of calcium

Abstract:
The Rania Pipien, a type of frog, is an amphibian that can be found in parts of Canada and the United States. This species has a simplistic muscular structure that allows one to examine . An experiment was established in order to test the hypothesis that a calcium blocker (lanthanum chloride) would increase the twitch threshold in the gastrocneiumus muscle of a leg in the  Rania Pipiens. Four legs were given pulses through stimuli and then injected with lanthanum chloride.  After te results and measurements were collected in the same day, my group noticed there was a greater difficulty of achieving threshold with calcium blockers being injected into the gastrocnemus muscle.


Introduction:
The Rania Pipiens, commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, are a type of amphibian which has a muscular system much similar to that of the human body. The skeletal muscle found in these vertebrae contain thousands of myofibers, which are cylindrical fused aggregates of cells [Johnson: 2018]. Each myofiber is bound by connective tissue in order to form functional group, which are the skeletal muscles proper [Johnson:2018]. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the spinal cord [Johnson: 2018]. The axons of the motor neurons then go into the muscle then spread out to innervate other individual myofibers, or neuromuscular junctions.
	Action potentials  arrive at the neuromuscular junction triggering the release of acetylcholine from the presyanaptic nerve terminal. The acetylcholine then binds to an acetylcholine receptor on the membrane of a muscle fiber, which then opens sodium Na+ channels that produce an action potential. The action potential spreads throughout the whole fiber, goes into the T Tubule which triggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Released calcium diffuses in sarcoplasm, and activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. A study performed by C.P. Bianchi reaffirms the effect calcium has on the contraction of the muscle with his experiment of  the effect of caffeine on radiocalcium movement in frog Sartorius [ Bianchi: 1961]. Caffeine works as a calcium blocker which then makes the skeletal muscle of the frog leg constantly contract.
	With the previously stated information, my hypothesis is that by using the calcium blocker [ 1mM lanthanum chloride], the twitch threshold of the frog leg will increase.


Materials and Method:
My group received four frog legs from the Rania Pipiens. First we removed and disposed of the skin from the leg. Next we pulled and exposed the sciatic nerve , then pulled the Sartorius and gastrocnemus muscle from the frog leg and attached it with string to tie onto a contraption at a 90 degree level. After the muscle has been tied, we then attached the sciatic nerve to a stimulator which was connected to the Iworx electrophysiological record, look at Figures 1 and 2 in order to get a better visual representation on how the experiment was set up.
	Each frog leg was then shocked at different amplitudes in order to find the threshold for muscle contraction. After threshold was reached, we then injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 1mM lanthanum chloride and waited approximately 10 minutes before stimulating the sciatic nerve with pulses again.


Results:
The results of the various twitch thresholds reached from the legs of the Rania Pipiens before and after injection can be located in Figure 3. The average difference between the controll and experimental group is -.01V with N=4 with the degrees of freedom being 3. The t-value is at .180095 with the p_value being at .868556.

Discussion:
The following results do not support my hypothesis regarding that calcium channel blockers will decrease the twitch threshold of the frog leg. The p_value is at .868556, which means I fail to reject my null hypothesis and I can not accept my alternative hypothesis.
	The explanation for the error, or for such a high p value can be due to the fact when stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle in the frog leg before injecting it with the lanthanum chloride could lead to less efficient contractions and skewed data. Another experiment performed by George B Weiss on the site action of lanthanum in frog Sartorius muscle produced similar results when injecting the Sartorius muscle with lanthanum. It did not significently change the total calcium, sodium, or potassium contents. Failure of the lanthanum to inhibit the Sartorius muscles increased residual Ca45 space or contractures [Weiss: 1970]
