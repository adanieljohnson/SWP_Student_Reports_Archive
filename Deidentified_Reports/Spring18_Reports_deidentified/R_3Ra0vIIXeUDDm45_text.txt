Title: The addition of phosphorus to the soil of Vigna radiata had no effect on the plants’ root:shoot ratio

Abstract:
This study investigates the effect of phosphorus on Vigna radiata root:shoot ratio. This ratio compares the size of roots, which absorb nutrients, to the size of shoots. When plants have adequate resources they have energy for excess shoot growth and the roots require less surface area to absorb enough nutrients. However, when resources are limited the plant’s structure and processes compensate, a process known as phenotypic plasticity. We hypothesized that if Vigna radiata were placed in soil containing added phosphorus, then the plants would experience a lower root:shoot ratio compared to the controll group, plants planted in soil without added phosphorus. In this study the independent variable was addition or lack of addition of phosphorus to the soil. Mung bean plants were placed in one of these two environments for two weeks and then their root:shoot ratios were calculated, the dependent variable. The results of our study did not support our hypothesis. A two-sample t_test determined that the difference between the root:shoot ratios of the groups were not statistically significent. This could be because the amount of phosphorus added and the amount of time the plants were left to grow were not large enough to cause significent change.


Introduction:
Ecological communities are made up of and affected by many different features, both biotic and abiotic. These factors are essential for any individual organism in the community to properly and effectively function. These include things as obvious an animal feeding on a nearby plant in order to obtain nutrients, or as invisible as a plant receiving adequate sunlight for survival. Appropriate exposure to resources allows a plant to grow. When essential factors are limited, however, a plant’s structure and processes compensate for the deficiency. This ability to change the allocation of resources based on environment is known as phenotypic plasticity. One specific way that plants change their phenotype in response to their environment is root:shoot ratio. The root:shoot ratio of a plant is a measure of the size of the plants root in comparison to the above ground part of the plant including the stems and leaves. A plant with adequate access to resources such as nutrients in the soil is able to support exceptional growth. As a result, the magnitude of the shoot will increase and, relative to the size of the roots, the root:shoot ratio will get smaller. However, a plant faced with limited resources must work harder to obtain the necessary resources. One way they do this is by changing their structure, roots may grow larger so more surface area is available to absorb nutrients from the environment. Additionally, the plant with nutrient deficiency will have resource limited cell functioning. It is forced to allocate its energy towards collecting energy rather than towards excess growth of its stem and leaves. As a result of this increase in root magnitude and decrease in shoot magnitude, the root:shoot ratio decreases[Johnson:2018]. In a study conducted on corn and velvetleaf, plants placed in environments with increased Nitrogen availability experienced decreased root shoot ratios [Bonifas et al.: 2005]. In this experiment the phenotypic plasticity of Vigna radiata, or mung beans, were investigated. Specifically, the effect of phosphorus exposure was studied by placing some plants in phosphorus containing soil and others in soil with no phosphorus. Phosphorus is part of the nucleic acid structure in plants, an important component in regulating protein synthesis. This plays a role in cell division and, therefore, growth of plants. This study was based on the Cakmak et al article which reported that phosphorus deficient mung bean plants had larger roots relative to their shoots, while mung bean plants in the presence of plentiful phosphorus had larger shoots relative to their roots [Cakmek et al: 1994]. Additionally, the article showed that mung bean plants are sensitive to phosphorus, which is why we chose Vigna radiata as our model organism and phosphorus exposure as the independent variable. We hypothesized that if Vigna radiata were placed in soil containing added phosphorus, then the plants would experience a lower root:shoot ratio compared to the controll group, plants planted in soil without phosphorus.


Materials and Method:
Six planters were created by filling the containers with fertilized vermiculite. In three of the containers, solid phosphorus was added and mixed into the soil. These three planters were the experimental group and labeled as such. The other three without phosphorus were labeled as the controll. In the soil of each container, twenty Mung Bean seeds were planted in holes and covered with soil. Plants were left in a greenhouse for two weeks and watered daily. After two weeks the plants were collected and from each five individual mung bean plants were removed from the soil and washed. The five plants were weighed together. Roots were then removed from the shoots and weighed separately. The mass root:shoot ratio was calculated by dividing the mass of the roots by the mass of the shoots. The maximum root length and shoot length from each group was measured and the length root:shoot ratio was calculated by dividing the root length by the shoot length. Averages for the mass root:shoot ratio of the controll plants and the experimental group were calculated and a two sample t_test was run to analyze the significance of the difference. Averages for the length root:shoot ratio of the controll plants and the experimental group were calculated and a two sample t_test was run to analyze the significance of the difference at the alpha level 0.05.


Results:
The controll group, Mung bean plants in soil with no added phosphorus, had an average length root:shoot ratio of 0.9431 +/- 0.2505. The experimental group, Mung bean plants in soil with added phosphorus, had an average length root:shoot ratio of 1.010 +/- 0.170. These values are depicted in Figure 1, which shows that the values for the two groups are very similar. The two sample t_test between the average length root:shoot ratio of the controll and the experimental had a t statistic of 0.3324 and a p_value of 0.7562. The difference was not statistically significent. The controll group had an average mass root:shoot ratio of 0.7171 +/- 0.0557. The experimental group had an average mass root:shoot ratio of 0.892 +/- 0.210. These values are depicted in Figure 2, which shows that the values for the two groups are very similar. The paired t_test between the average length root:shoot ratio of the controll and the experimental had a t statistic of 1.069 and a p_value of 0.397. The difference was not statistically significent.


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support our hypothesis. We hypothesized that if Vigna radiata were placed in soil containing added phosphorus, then the plants would experience a lower root:shoot ratio compared to the controll group, plants planted in soil without phosphorus. For both length and mass, the root:shoot ratios were not statistically different. This conclusion can be made because both p_values, 0.752 and 0.397, were greater than the alpha level 0.05. The similarity between the values of both groups can be visualized in Figures 1 and 2. The hypothesis that we made was due to our understanding of phenotypic plasticity and its effect on root:shoot ratio as well as previous studies on the effect of nutrient levels on root:shoot ratios. A study conducted on Lolium perenne L. and Trifolium repens L plants found that exposure to phosphorus causes a significent decrease in the mass root:shoot ratio as plants that easily obtain nutrients have excess resources to allocate towards stem and leaf growth [Davidson: 1969)].This echoes the results found in the Cakmak et al article, which found significance effect of phosphorus on root:shoot ratios of mung bean plants [Cakmek et al: 1994]. The fact that so many other studies support our hypothesis suggests that our results may have been due to flawed experimental design. When adding the phosphorus to the experimental group containers, only a small amount was added. The soil that the mung bean seeds were planted in was fertilized vermiculite, which already contains nutrients. Phosphorus may be a nutrient that the soil already contained, so the added phosphorus may not have been enough to cause a significent difference in root:shoot ratio. In the Cakmek study, significent difference was only found among extreme levels of phosphorus, suggesting that our plants’ phosphorus levels were too similar to cause a significance in root:shoot ratio difference [Cakmek et al: 1994]. To fix this problem, the controll group should be planted in soil that contains absolutely no phosphorus. In addition, multiple experimental groups should be used to subject mung beans to a wider and higher range of phosphorus levels. Another part of our experimental design that may have negatively impacted our results was the amount of time that our plants were left to grow. The mung bean plants were all left for two weeks and allowed to grow in accordance with their environment. However, two weeks may not have been enough time for the plants to respond to either their excess of phosphorus or phosphorus deficiency and alter themselves phenotypically. If left for a longer period of time, the controll plants may have extended their roots more to effectively make up for their lack of phosphorus, and experimental plants may have grown their shoots more drastically as a result of their adequate nutrition. The study on corn and velvetleaf plants was conducted over a far more extended period of time, indicating that a greater period of time than the two weeks we allowed is necessary for significent difference in root:shoot ratio [Bonifas et al.: 2005]. Replicating the experiment with these procedural changes may allow us to gather data that supports our hypothesis and is significently significent. This study’s finding are important because they show that the amount of a nutrient impacts a plant’s root:shoot ratio due to phenotypical plasticity, not simply the presence or absence of the nutrient.
