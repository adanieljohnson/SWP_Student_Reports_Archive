Title: Effect of Lidocaine on the Threshold Voltage of Frog Nerve Muscle

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on the effect of lidocaine in the frog gastrocnemus muscle. It was hypothesized that the frog leg injected with lidocaine would have a threshold voltage that occurred at a higher amplitude. The independent variable was whether the frog leg was injected with lidocaine or not. The dependent variable was the amplitude of when a muscle contraction occurred. In order to conduct this experiment, obtain three frog legs and connect them to a force transducer. Collect data on the amplitude before and after injection of lidocaine into the muscle. The p_value is 0.0014365, which shows that the controll group and experimental group are statistically significent. The results showed that the experimental group had a much larger amplitude than the controll group. This is true because the lidocaine causes the blocking of sodium channels, which stops action potentials, the release of calcium, and muscle contractions. Therefore, it makes sense that the frog legs with lidocaine present would have much higher amplitudes than those without lidocaine since it would take much more force to cause a contraction. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, one will test the effect of lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the threshold voltage of the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog leg. To test this, one will be looking at the somatic neuromuscular system. The neuromuscular junction is the point at which axons of motor neurons branch out into several individual myofibers [Johnson:2016]. At the neuromuscular junction, nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine, which binds to a receptor on the muscle fiber membrane causing the opening of sodium channels [Johnson:2016]. The opening of sodium channels generates an action potential, which stimulates the release of calcium and the contraction of the muscle fiber [Johnson:2016]. In this experiment, the question being asked is “Will lidocaine affect the threshold voltage of the gastrocnemus in a frog leg?” Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker that places the muscle in a stable, non-conducting state and develops inactivation rapidly [Chen:2000]. Thus, lidocaine should create fewer muscle contractions in the frog leg. If the frog leg is injected with lidocaine, then the threshold voltage will occur at a higher amplitude.


Materials and Method:
First, three frog legs were obtained. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated by cutting it from the Achilles tendon. The gastrocnemus muscle was then connected to the force transducer at a ninety-degree angle using string. Next, the sciatic nerve was isolated and had two wires placed underneath it. These wires will record the threshold voltage of the nerve and muscle. Before injection, data on the frog muscle’s threshold was taken. Then, 0.2 Ml of lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. After waiting five minutes, data was recorded on the thresholds with lidocaine present. A two sample one tail test was performed to determine if the controll group and experimental group were statistically significent.

Results:
The general trends in the data show that the experimental group had a higher amplitude than the controll group. The figure represents the average of the three trials for both the controll and experimental group. The controll group had a low amplitude to cause a twitch, while the amplitude for the experimental group had to be increased in order to cause a twitch. After the statistical test was run, the degrees of freedom were 16 and the p_value was 0.0014365. Therefore, the controll group and experimental group are statistically significent.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment do support the hypothesis. The results showed that the experimental group had a higher amplitude than the controll group. Thus, the lidocaine caused the sodium channels to not open causing the action potentials to not occur. This occurred from a biological standpoint because the lidocaine blocked the opening of the sodium channels. Without the opening of the sodium channels, the action potentials cannot occur; therefore, calcium cannot be released and cause the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. The results support this biological explanation because the lidocaine induced frog legs needed a much higher amplitude to cause a contraction. Since the p_value of 0.0014365 is less than the alpha 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis. There is evidence that the controll group and experimental group are statistically significent. The results from this experiment support previously published studies on this specific topic. Previous studies found that lidocaine causes periods of inactivation and non-conducting states in muscle [Chen:2000]. This experiment supports this finding because it took a larger amplitude to produce a muscle contraction than it does without the presence of lidocaine. The next logical step for this experiment is to replicate it. Replicating this experiment will ensure that the data collected now is accurate and precise. Overall, lidocaine blocks sodium channels causing the amplitude for muscle contraction in frog legs to increase.
