Title: The Impact of Neomycin on the IP3 Pathway

Abstract:
Signal Transduction plays a crucial role in the growth and movement of organisms in response to their environments. The purpose of this study was to use cytoplasmic streaming method to study the patterns of oscillation or movements of the strands of our model organism, P. polycephalum plasmodium. Our hypothesis was that the oscillation period in the presence of neomycin would be shorter. In order to properly analyze this data, our strands, coated in water, were given 100 microliters of diluted neomycin then three timed trials were taken at 1 minute, 11 minutes and 21 minutes of being exposed to neomycin. During these trials, to measure the oscillation times, timed trials began after the strand’s first change in direction and ended after the second change in direction. After these trials, it was reasonable to conclude that the oscillation periods of the strands became shorter. This can be seen through our decreased or “faster” times across the three trials. This supported our hypothesis and thus leads us to conclude that the mobility of the model cell or the length of the oscillation periods is impacted by the presence of neomycin. The enzyme, Phospholipase C, plays a key role in signal transduction in the PLC pathway and in the oscillation of P. polycephalum plasmodium.

Introduction:
Signal Transduction is a widely complex system that utilizes an extensive amount of different pathways in order to trigger cellular responses that regulate gene expression. In the inositol triphosphate signal transduction pathway, first messengers are most often hormones or ligands that stimulate the continuation of the signal along the chemical pathway (Kramer, 21). These messengers help to bring the signals to the second messengers, which in the IP3 pathway are calcium and diacylglyercol. In this case, these second messengers serve as a means of activation for a cascade of reactions within the cell. These reactions propel the activation of protein kinases, which leads to gene expression (Keltner, 60). There are a wide variety of different factors that can affect gene expression through the inhibition of a signal transduction pathway, such as the IP3 pathway.
There are a wide variety of different factors that can affect gene expression through the inhibition of first and second messengers. The blockage of the signal transduction enzyme, phospholipase C, causes a variation in the auto-oscillatory function of the P. polycephalum plasmodium (Matveeva, 255). Our model that we are using in order to study these factors are Physarum polycephalum plasmodium cells, which are multicellular organisms. These Physarum polycephalum plasmodiums are ideal for this study of signal transduction due to the fact that they allow us to properly analyze the auto-oscillatory state of motility (Matveeva, 758). Additionally, the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is an ideal model organism due to the fact its oscillatory movement mirrors many tissue cells (Matveeva, 758). The one of the major pathways that has an effect on this Physarum polycephalum plasmodium model are the ion channel coupled pathways, which specifically involves the coupling of phospholipase C and inositol triphosphate (Matveeva, 255). The ion channel coupled pathway facilitates the production of PLC through the use of two second messengers, calcium ions and diacylglycerol (Matveeva, 255).  Neomycin is one of these inhibitors that could have an extensive impact on the functionality of the PLC pathway. It serves as a substrate inhibitor for the PLC protein causing different alterations to the cellular responses through its binding to other proteins (Matveeva, 758). Based on the information above, it is reasonable to assume that the presence of neomycin plays an inhibitory role in the PLC pathway overall.  
Generally, we are aiming to analyze and interpret the specific ion-channel coupled pathways of the phospholipase C and the possible inhibition of this pathway that occurs as a result of the presence of concentrated neomycin. In order to properly analyze this, we utilized a process known as cytoplasmic streaming, which shows the in-phase oscillations of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium (Smith, 171). The presence of the calcium ion used cytoplasmic streaming, which is a second messenger in the IP3 pathways, plays a large role in the oscillation patterns of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium (Smith, 171). Our hypothesis was, that as a result of the presence of neomycin, the distance of the oscillation period becomes smaller, thus causing a decrease in the amount of time in oscillation. Based on the above information, we predicted that over time after the addition of the Neomycin, the time of oscillation of each of the strands would decrease due to the shorter distances traveled by the strand seen in the cytoplasmic streaming.

Materials and Method:
The model of Physarum polycephalum plasmodium stock plates were used in order to test the inhibition of neomycin on the PLC pathway. These stock plates were cultured 5 days prior to the experiment at 37 degree celsius using oatmeal and water agar solution. The process that was used in order to test this idea was cytoplasm streaming. Firstly, three-timed trials were taken by looking at each of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium plates under the microscope after it was injected with 100 microliters of distilled water. The strand was injected with distilled water in order to help us determine whether or not the strand would still function with the addition of liquid on top of it. In order to measure this distilled water trial, a phase microscope must be properly focused. Once the proper strand was located, the movement of the strand was timed by choosing a particular strand and analyzing the direction of the strand’s movement. When the specific strand changed direction initially the time trial began, then when it changed direction again was when the time trial ceased. After these trials with distilled water were taken, the diluted neomycin solution was made using the original 1 micrograms/Ml of neomycin. The concentrated neomycin was diluted into 5 Ml of distilled water to make 143 micrograms/Ml. This 1:6 dilution was used to help elevate the effect of the neomycin due to the fact that it is a more concentrated solution. Then, 100 microliters of the diluted neomycin solution was added to form a bubble on top of the strand. After the neomycin was added to the top of the strand, it was necessary to wait 1 minute. Then, the movement of the strand that was coated in the neomycin was measured using the same timing procedure as the previous trials. Once the initial neomycin trials were taken, measurements using the same process as the previous trials, were taken at a ten-minute and twenty-one minute time intervals. Then, a statistical test was used to analyze the data collected above was a two-sample paired t_test for means. In this test, the data from each of the three plates (1 min neomycin, 11 min neomycin, 21 min neomycin) was compared to the data from the three time trials with just water. 

Results:
Initially, the treatment with DI water caused the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium to oscillate at 61.69 ± 7.92. One minute after the addition of neomycin the oscillations were 63.60 ±18.05. Then, eleven minutes after the addition of neomycin the oscillations were, on average, 50.29 ± 18.65. Finally, 21-minutes following the addition of neomycin, the oscillations were, on average, 44.40 ± 12.39. When compared to water to the 1 minute neomycin yielded the results t(2)= 2.92, p = .83. For the comparison of water to the 11- minute neomycin, were not significently different (t(2)= 2.92, p =.26). Finally, 21 minutes after strands treated with neomycin they oscillated at a faster frequency compared to strands treated only with water (t(2) = 2.92, p = .026). 

Discussion:
The overall results of our cytoplasmic streaming support our hypothesis due to the fact that the length of the oscillation period of the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium decreased due to the presence of the neomycin. Based on the results, it is possible to conclude that after 21 minutes of neomycin exposure the oscillation periods of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium were most likely shorter. We observed while performing our experiment that the movement of the strand would increase then when it was about to change direction it would slow down extensively. This decrease in time seen in the graph above is likely due to the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium across a smaller distance. A particular study that emphasizes these points analyzes the oscillations period of the P. polycephalum plasmodium. This study displayed the relationship between the binding of neomycin and the effects that it causes to the PLC pathway (Matveeva, 758). In this experiment, the neomycin caused a variety of different contractile oscillations for approximately 30 minutes (Matveeva, 758). Although our study tested similar fundamental ideas, we possessed varied results numerically due to the fact that our more rapid oscillations were not due to the increase in speed of the P. polycephalum plasmodium, but actually due to the fact that the overall the decrease in the distance of the oscillation period (Matveeva, 759). In other words, the shorter the oscillation period, the more rapid the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium seemed. The oscillation time periods were shorter, which ultimately lead to the seemingly trend of increasing speed across the timed trials (Matveeva, 759). Possible sources of error that could have caused skew in our data could be found in the variation of light across the three different microscopes that were used. One phase microscope, in particular, made it increasingly difficult to completely view the strands and as a result timing each change in direction could have been affected negatively. Additionally, it is almost impossible to view that the movement of the strands are in fact increasing due to the fact that it is simply based on the perspective of the timer or the viewer of the strand. The only way a scientist can properly determine and observe the movement of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is by recording it to see the oscillating of the P. polycephalum plasmodium using a better microscope with a camera attached. In the future, it would be reasonable to perform this same experiment over a longer amount of time so that the oscillations between the varied phases can be viewed more explicitly. Additionally, another possible variation that could be made to this experiment would be to alter the amount of calcium ions or any other second messenger of the PLC pathway through the addition of other inhibitors. This would likely have an extensive effect on the oscillatory movement of the strand and would enable the deeper study of the inhibition and functionality of this specific signaling pathway. Additionally, the variations on the amount of calcium ion could affect the functionality of the cytoplasmic streaming method in addition to the pathway. This specific alteration could further our understanding of both cytoplasmic streaming and the IP3 pathway. Overall, this lab shows the mobility of the Physarum polycephalum plasmodium is inhibited by the presence of neomycin. This inhibition comes as a direct result of the decrease in length of the contraction phase in the oscillation periods.
