Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Photosynthetic Rate of Spinach

Abstract:
The object of the experiment is to accurately determine the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of a saline solution. The hypothesis of the experiment is if there is saline present in the solution, then the higher the saline concentration is, the lower the rate of photosynthesis. The organism used for this experiment is spinach. The method used for determining the rate of photosynthesis is to measure the percent change in absorbance for chloroplasts exposed to varying saline concentrations. Absorbances are measured using a spectrophotometer that is blanked after every trial reading at 600 nm. This experiment is done by making an enriched chloroplast preparation from spinach leaves through the use of a centrifuge. Then the Hill reaction buffer is used along with differing concentrations of saline in order to determine if it effects the rate of photosynthesis. The data collected is the absorbance of the samples taken over the course of thirty minutes at ten minute intervals. After the experiment concluded, it appeared that the absorbance of the samples exposed to the saline conditions in fact, slightly increased contrary to what was predicted. The results of the experiment suggest that there is no significent effect on photosynthetic rate as saline concentration is increased.


Introduction:
Plants capture energy from sunlight and convert it to chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. This process takes place in the chloroplast of a plant cell. The chloroplast is an organelle that is found in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. The capture of energy takes place on the thylakoid membrane of the thylakoid sacs in the chloroplast. This portion is called chlorophyll which is responsible for the pigment of the plant. In Photosystem II, the chlorophyll absorb energy from sunlight which excites electrons. These excited electrons then leave carrier molecules and trigger a chemical reaction that cleaves water. The process of water cleaving produces oxygen and hydrogen as byproducts and then generates a proton gradient which pumps protons from the stroma, which is the fluid in the chloroplast, to the thylakoid space. The proton gradient triggers ATP synthase. The electrons move from Photosystem II to Photosystem I by way of carriers and special complexes where light enters again exciting the electron and NADP is reduced to NADPH [Zheng: 2008]. The ATP and NADPH produced react with carbon dioxide to produce glucose. Photosynthesis is important for glucose production in the plants and the oxygen production for animals to breathe. If a salt concentration is present in the chloroplast solution, then the water that is inside of the chloroplast will escape because the solution is hypertonic. The water will travel across the membrane in order to balance the concentration of salt on the outside of the chloroplast with the salt inside of the cell [Chaves: 2009]. This process is called osmosis. DCPIP is a blue dye that acts like electron acceptor. Once it has been reduced by ascorbic acid, the dye is no longer blue but colorless. The reason that we use DCPIP is because it allows the reducing agents in chloroplasts to be detected. Since we expect the chloroplasts to undergo light-dependent reactions, reducing agents will be released which interact with the DCPIP making it colorless. The reason that we use spinach as our model organism is because it is rich in chloroplasts. Initially, 50 mM and 100 mM concentrations were used because there was a study that found that salt does have an effect on photosynthetic rates, and these were the concentrations that were used [Critchley: 1984]. The hypothesis of the experiment is if there is saline present in the solution, then the higher the saline concentration is, the lower the rate of photosynthesis. The independent variable of the study is the concentration of saline concentration while the dependent variable of the study was the absorbance.


Materials and Method:
The first step in the procedure is to create a “pellet” of chloroplasts after centrifuging. The purpose of wanting to create a pellet is because it is a concentrated form of chloroplasts in order to make a suspended solution that is rich in chloroplasts. This is done by taking four medium sized spinach leaves, adding 10 Ml of grinding buffer, and grinding them with a mortar and pestle. Another 10 Ml of grinding buffer is added to make the grinding easier once the bulk of it is done. After grinding, the solution is then poured into a beaker. A three layered cheesecloth is used to filter out the solid part of the mixture. This solution is then put into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at four degrees Celsius for three minutes at 200 x G. The supernatant from this is put into another centrifuge tube and spun in the centrifuge at four degrees Celsius for ten minutes at 1000 x G. The next step in the experiment is to prepare a chloroplast solution. The supernatant from the second centrifuge step is disposed. The “pellet” that is at the bottom of this centrifuge is suspended with an additional 20 Ml of the grinding buffer. The “pellet” solution is added to a centrifuge tube and put on ice. The next step of the lab calls for the preparation of solutions. Test tubes are labeled 0-12. A negative controll in this experiment is a solution prepared with no chloroplasts and a 0 mM salt concentration. The negative controll is the first test tube made which is a blank containing 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of Hill reaction buffer. Test tubes 1-3 and 4-6 are filled with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Test tubes 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 all contain 100 µL of enriched chloroplasts. Test tubes 7-9 and 10-12 are filled with 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM of DCPIP, 2 Ml of Hill reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of their respective concentrated saline solution. Test tubes 7-9 contain 50 mM saline solution, and test tubes 10-12 contain 100 mM saline solution [Johnson: 2018]. The positive controll in this experiment is the solution prepared with chloroplasts and a 0% salt concentration. Additional negative controlls include solutions prepared with chloroplasts and a 0 mM, 50 mM, and 100mM salt concentration. Each mixture is transferred to a cuvette in order to read the absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer is blanked at 600 nm. An initial reading is taken of each of the mixtures. The cuvettes are placed under a lamp for a total of thirty minutes and readings are taken at ten minute intervals. After the readings are taken and the values are recorded, the percent change of absorbance is calculated for all of the mixtures over all of the times. From these values, an average is calculated in order to analyze and use it for the results. The statistical test used is an ANOVA test. 


Results:
Saline mixtures with differing concentrations were made in order to compare the photosynthetic rates in each of the samples. The results of the experiment are displayed in the Figure 1. In Figure 1, the error bars overlap meaning that the data is not significent. The values of the average percent change of absorbance in varying concentrations from the raw data was taken and used in an ANOVA test. A Tukey-Kramer test was performed in addition to the ANOVA test. The result from the ANOVA test gave a p_value of 0.584 which tells us that the data is not significent since the p_value is greater than 0.05. The mean values for the no chloroplast solution, 0 mM salt solution plus chloroplasts, 50 mM salt solution plus chloroplasts, and 100 mM salt solution plus chloroplasts are 1.16, 1.60, 2.20, and 2.87 respectively. The standard deviation values are 0.39, 1.13, 1.93, and 2.79 respectively. 


Discussion:
To conclude, the hypothesis was not supported, but the null hypothesis was supported by the data collected. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was conducted and the p_value was 0.584. A Tukey-Kramer test was followed up which showed no significance in the data. An overlap in error bars also shows that the data was not significent. After the experiment was carried out, it appeared that the absorbance of the samples exposed to the saline conditions in fact, slightly increased contrary to what was predicted. The reason for this maybe was because the chloroplasts did not have enough time to experience salt stress within the timeframe of the experiment. Salt stress is dependent on the species of plant one is working with, and it can vary in terms of the conditions the experiment is subject to [Chaves: 2009]. The spinach chloroplasts that we worked with may have just been tolerant of the concentration of sodium present in the solution. Another explanation for this may be that thirty minutes was not enough time to observe a significent change in photosynthetic rates. An improvement to this study would be to increase exposure either by mimicking the environmental conditions in a lab setting or simply increasing the time of exposure. The reason that this experiment is important is because photosynthesis is an important process in the world. It is imperative that the process is understood and see how a factor such as saline concentration can influence it because photosynthesis is vital to life and without it organisms may not be able to survive. For further testing, it would be interesting to see if this experiment could be reworked by either increasing the sodium concentration or by increasing the time of exposure to these conditions before reading the absorbance.
