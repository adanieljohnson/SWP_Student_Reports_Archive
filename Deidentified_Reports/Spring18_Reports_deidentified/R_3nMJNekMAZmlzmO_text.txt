Title: Mycorrhizal fungi decrease root:shoot ratio of the Raphanus Specie

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the resource allocation of a plant. Plants focus on different parts of their systems depending on the resources available. Mycorrhizal fungi are known to have a symbiotic relationship with plants and is beneficial to both organisms. The goal of the experiment was to determine the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on the Raphanus specie. The hypothesis of the experiment was that the root: shoot ratio would decrease for plants which were treated with mycorrhizal fungi. The plant used in the study was the Raphanus specie. Two groups of soil were used in the study, one treated with mycorrhizal while the other was not. The plants were allowed to grow for 2 weeks before they were analyzed. The effect of the mycorrhizal fungi was determined through analyzing the root: shoot ratio in respect of weight and length. The result of the study was that the hypothesis was partially supported.   

Introduction:
Plants require resources in order to sustain their life. However, the amount of resources they acquire is not unlimited. Each plant has a finite amount of resource it can obtain. Factors which affect the amount of resource a plant obtains range from amount of water in the soil, sunlight the plants receive, and nutrient composition of the soil. [Craine, 2012] The resource which is limited depends on the environment the plant is in. Therefore, a plant must optimize their use of the resources they acquire. This can lead to plants focusing on spending its energy it obtains on one part of their systems more than the other. The two systems in a plant are the root and shoot system. The root system is composed of roots which serve as the primary means of absorption of nutrient and water from the soil. They stabilize the plant to the ground. The shoot system is composed of stems and leaves. Stems are the backbone of a plant and support the plant as a whole. Leaves are the photosynthetic organ of the plant. The main purpose of the leaves is to perform photosynthesis and regulate the water content of the plant. To better understand how a plant develops and uses its resources, a root: shoot ratio helps quantify this. Root: shoot ratios are indicative of plant response to it environment, more specifically to the growing conditions.  A root: shoot ratio can be taken in respect to a plant's mass or length. An example of a plant changing its resource allocation is when a plant is placed in a drought condition. A plant may expend its energy more towards the growth of its root to help extract more water from the soil. [Johnson, 2016] In this experiment, the effect of Mycorrhizal fungi upon the Raphanus specie, more commonly known as the radish plant, root: shoot ratio was tested. Mycorrhizal fungi are a part of the fungus kingdom. Mycorrhizae and plants form what is called a mutualistic symbiotic relationship. In this relationship both organisms have a benefit from each other. Mycorrhizae benefit from the relationship as the plant allows the fungi a habitat to inhabit and survive in a secure setting. [Gordon, 2018] The mycorrhizae can increase the surface area of roots anywhere from 100 to 1000 times which has a great impact as to how efficiently the plant can extract nutrients from the soil. [Mycorrhizal Applications, 2018] The fungi help greatly in the acquisition of immobile nutrient. Some examples of immobile nutrients which mycorrhizae help extract are phosphorus iron, and nitrogen. [Bolan, 1991] The fungi also help in the absorption of water from soil. According to a study by the University of Hohenheim, mycorrhizal plant absorb water around twice as high as a plant which does not have mycorrhizal roots. [Kothari, 1990] The goal of the experiment was to determine what effect the mycorrhizal fungi have on the resource allocation of the Raphanus specie. The relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and the radish plants was analyzed through the root: shoot ratio. I predicted that if we introduce mycorrhizal fungi to Raphanus specie, then the plant will see a decrease its root: shoot ratio because the fungi will help the plant extract nutrients from the soil more efficiently. Therefore, the plant will allocate its resources towards growing it shoots rather than the roots leading to a lower root: shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
	The experiment consisted of two groups radish plants whose soil was manipulated. The experiment started off with soaking a handful of radish seed in a 100 mL beaker with approximately 85 mL of water for 30 minutes. In the meantime, the containers which would house the plants were prepared. Six containers of soil were prepared. To all the containers, vermiculite (soil) was added 3/4 of the way up. Water was added to all the containers to allow for the soil to saturate. To three of the containers, about a teaspoon of mycorrhizal fungi was added. The mycorrhizae were then mixed into the soil to allow for even distribution. The containers with the mycorrhizae was labeled the experimental group while the containers which did not contain the mycorrhizae was labeled the control group. Next, 50 mL of Miracle Gro was added to all of the containers. In each container, approximately 7-10 holes were made. After the seeds had soaked in the water for 30 minutes, in each of the holes around 5-9 seeds of the radish plant were added. Once the seeds were added, more soil was applied to cover the seeds. The containers were then transferred to a greenhouse where they would stay for the next two weeks. Over the two weeks the plants were watered at least every other day, if not every day. Each container was watered until water would start to flow out of the container. Once the two weeks were up, the plants were then analyzed. 10 plants from each container were extracted and their mass was taken. Once the mass was recorded, the roots and shoots of the plants were separated. This was done by cutting the plants where they changed color at the root/shoot junction. The roots of the plants were weighed and recorded. The mass of the shoots was determined by subtracting the total mass of the plants by the root mass. Next the max root length from the ten plants from each container was taken. The same was done for the max shoot length. The max lengths were recorded. The root: shoot (R: S) ratio was determined for both weight and length. The data was then analyzed through a one-tailed unpaired t-test. The alpha level of the statistical test was 0.05.  

Results:
The trend observed in the root: shoot ratio in respect to length was that the ratio decreased when comparing the experimental to the control group. The average root: shoot ratio in the control group was 1.93   0.15. The average root: shoot ratio in the experimental group decreased to 1.42   0.02. The result of the statistical test when conducted for the root: shoot ratio of the length was that the data were significantly different. The p-value of the test was 0.004 which was lower than the alpha level. The trend observed in the root: shoot ratio in respect to weight was that the ratio increased when comparing the experimental to control group. The average root: shoot ratio in the control group was 0.27   0.01. The average root: shoot ratio in the experimental group increased to 0.29   0.04. The result of the statistical test when conducted for the root: shoot ratio of the weight was that the data were not significantly different. The p-value of the test was 0.460 which was higher than the alpha level. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected and the statistical tests conducted, our hypothesis was supported partly. The root: shoot ratio for length decreased for plants which were treated with mycorrhizal fungi. The average root: soot ratio was 1.93 in the control group while in the experimental group is was 1.41 (Figure 1). A statistical test was conducted, and the test concluded that the data were significantly different. This portion of the data supported our hypothesis. The root: shoot ratio for weight increased in the experiment group and did not support our hypothesis. The average root: shoot ratio was 0.269 in the control group while in the experimental group it increased to 0.288 (Figure 2). However, when the statistical test was conducted, the data was determined to not be significantly different. Overall our hypothesis was partly supported. We expected to see the root: shoot ratio for both length and weight to decrease when comparing the experimental group to the control. However only the ratio for length decreased while the ratio for weight increased. The ratio data for the weight was also statistically insignificant. Therefore, our hypothesis was only supported to an extent. The reasoning for the root: shoot ratio decreasing in terms of length from the control to experimental group can be explained by the more efficient extraction of nutrients from the soil due to the addition of mycorrhizal in the experimental group. The more efficient intake of nutrients would lead to the plant allocating its towards the shoots rather than its roots. [Weaver, 1929] However, in the case of the control group, the plants would have a harder time gaining nutrients than the plants treated with the fungi. This would lead to the plants allocating more resources towards roots which would cause the root: shoot ratio to increase. Even though the root: shoot ratio data for the weight of the plants did not support our hypothesis and were not significantly different, one reason why the ratio increased from the control to the experimental group maybe possible that due to the mycorrhizal being added. Since the mycorrhizal was attaching to the plants root, it could possibly have cause more mass to be added to the roots of the experimental group. A research conducted by West Virginia University stated that mycorrhizal strongly affected the biomass of a plant when compared to plants which did not have a mycorrhizal colonization. [OLESNIEWICZ, 1999] The results of this experiment help understand the function of mycorrhizal fungi and how they affect a plant. The fungi help plants extract nutrients more efficiently which allows the plant to allocate its resources to other needs.
