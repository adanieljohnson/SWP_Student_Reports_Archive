Title: How charge affects the movement patterns of [Physarum polycephalum]

Abstract:
Organisms typically communicate through cell signaling. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold which is a group of nuclei massed within a single plasma membrane. The mass, also known as a plasmodium, behaves as a giant cell. The experiment used gel electrophoresis to measure the effect of charge on Physarum Polycephalum movement. Our hypothesis is that  Physarum polycephalum will be more likely to move towards positively charged regions than negative charged regions. In our experiment, we used Physarum polycephalum as our test organism to test its reactions to negatively or positively charged regions in a gel electrophoresis tank. We analyzed our results with a χ2 test. Our observed Physarum movement in the gel electrophoresis was all in the negatively charged region. One of our replicas would be considered an outlier as it lies outside three standard deviations of the mean. Our results from our t-test which compared the movement of Physarum in control conditions to the gel electrophoresis movement were found to not be significant after performing our experiment  (p=0.609). 

Introduction:
Organisms typically communicate through cell signaling. Organisms have a variety of signals they use to communicate within their bodies whether it be hormones, a nervous system, or receptors through the cell body. Physarum polycephalum uses an intracellular signal transduction pathway to control and coordinate its responses to the environment [Johnson: 2018]. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold which is a group of nuclei massed within a single plasma membrane. The mass, also known as a plasmodium, behaves as a giant cell. Consequently, due to this nature, it makes Physarum polycephalum a unique and good organism to better understand cell signaling.  Physarum polycephalum will often move through cytoplasmic streaming, which tests the surrounding environment, and moving towards favorable conditions, such as a food, and moving away from unfavorable conditions such as sunlight. In previous experiments, it was observed that Physarum polycephalum had distinct movement patterns in relation to amino acids that had either positive or negative charges [Lepow 1938].This experiment from Lepow shows that charges on environmental stimuli affect the movement of Physarum, therefore our experiment plans to look at the effect of positively and negatively charged regions and its effect on the mobility of Physarum polycephalum. The positive charge should affect the movement of the Physarum. Our hypothesis is that Physarum polycephalum will be more likely to move towards positively charged regions than negative charged regions. 

Materials and Methods:
In our experiment, we used Physarum polycephalum as our test organism to test its reactions to negatively or positively charged regions in a gel electrophoresis tank. In the experiment, three 1 x 1 cm cubes of the Physarum culture were placed in the center of water agar, with sterilized tools between each individual placemement, within the gel electrophoresis. Three pieces of oatmeal were equally spaced 2-3 cm away going towards the positively charged region and the negatively charged region [Figure 2].  Buffer solution was added to the wells on each side of the gel electrophoresis allowing the current to travel through the agar. The gel electrophoresis was turned on and the voltage was set at 23 volts. After 24 hours, the gel electrophoresis was observed for any movement of the Physarum cultures and was recorded. We analyzed our results with a chi squared test to address the relationship between our observed data and the expected data and analyzed the movement in a controlled setting to the movement in our gel electrophoresis using a two-sample one-tailed t-test.

Results:
Our Physarum movement in the Gel Electrophoresis was all towards the negatively charged region. One of our replicas would be considered an outlier as it lies outside three standard deviations of the mean.  Due to the low number of replicas performed, the outlier was kept to not skew our data any further. T-test: [gel electrophoresis (12.3 ± 9.61)], [control plate (15.7 ±4.04), [P-value (0.609)] [Figure 1]. The χ2 test found a p-value of 0.042. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our results; they were found to not be significant after performing our experiment. Our p-value from the t-test was found to be 0.609. Overall, the insignificance shows that Physarum polycephalum cultures within the gel electrophoresis tank favored movement towards the negatively charged region compared to the positively charged region. The p-value from the χ2 test was 0.042. However, when comparing the movements between the phototactic control , or movement due to light exposure, and the experimental charged gel electrophoresis, there was significance between the distances that were recorded in the movement of the Physarum culture which may have been caused by the outlier within the group. When looking at Physarum polycephalum, the entire mass of the cell will be subject to electrical changes regardless of their size. Specifically, any addition of an attractant or repellant, will be found heavily concentrated within the agar of the gel electrophoresis. Additionally, in an experiment by Whiting, Costello, and Adamatzky; they found that positive charge should have a positive effect on oscillations and movement, while negative charged regions should depict a negative effect on oscillations and movement [Whiting 2014]. Given the information from this literature and the notion that our experiment was newly created, the hypothesis that we created could have been further refined, it was too broad and focused on the wrong aspects of literature that looked at Physarum in gel electrophoresis. Similarly, our experiment did not have a strong way to measure movement in a controlled environment in gel electrophoresis, which might have been easier to recreate by utilizing literature in the design of the experiment.
