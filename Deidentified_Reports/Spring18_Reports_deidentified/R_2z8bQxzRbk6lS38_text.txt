Title: Physarum polyscephelum’s Chemotaxis when Subjected to Dibutrylyl-cAMP and Curcumin

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to analyze the effects of Dibutrylyl cAMP, a Protein Kinase A activator, and Curcumin, a Protein Kinase A inhibitor, on the distance migrated during chemotaxis in Physarum polyscephelum. It was hypothesized that when we exposed Physarum to Dibutrylyl cAMP, there will be a significant increase in the distance migrated during chemotaxis. We tested this by recording the distance traveled when exposing Physarum to a 2% water agar plate which was soaked in an Dibutrylyl cAMP solution. Our results support this hypothesis because it was a significant increase in the distance migrated when compared to the control. For the curcumin portion of the experiment, we hypothesized that when Physarum is exposed to curcumin, the distance migrated during chemotaxis will be significantly less than the control. After subjecting Physarum to a 2% water agar plate soaked with a curcumin solution, we concluded that there was no significant decrease in the distance migrated between the control and the test plates. These results did not support our hypothesis which theorized a reduced distance migrated during chemotaxis. We can improve on our experiment by using a larger sample size, and letting the Physarum migrate for a longer period of time. This would result in definite and more a

Introduction:
In order for organisms to survive in continuously changing environment, organisms have to consistently respond to stimuli in their environment and change their behavior in response to these stimuli. An example of this is when Physarum polyscephelum, (Physarum) detects chemicals that are released by their food, they respond by performing chemotaxis and migrate towards the food [Ueda 1975]. In our experiment, we are determining if Physarum would increase or decrease its rate of chemotaxis and migrate more or less when exposed to a Protein Kinase A (PKA) activator and inhibitor. In a separate experiment, a study was conducted using Dibutrylyl-cAMP, and it was determined that it acted as an activator for PKA, increasing its rate of gene regulation and changes in gene expressions [Derlacz, 1998]. We hypothesized that if Physarum polyscephelum was subjected to Dibutrylyl-cAMP, then the Physarum will travel a greater distance towards the food as compared to the control. However in a separate lab, it studied the effects of Curcumin on PKA and they determined that it activated as a non-competitive inhibitor for cAMP, which inhibited the gene regulation and expression [Reddy, 1994]. We can infer from this experiment and hypothesize that if Physarum polyscephelum is subjected to Curcumin, then the Physarum would migrate a smaller distance when compared to the control. We use Physarum for this experiment because the proteins used for motility are almost identical to the proteins, actin and myosin, used for cellular movement in eukaryotes [Hüttermann 1974]. Furthermore, Physarum response very evidently when exposed to different stimuli. This allows us to clearly observe the effects of the Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor, and record its response. We used Dibutrylyl cAMP and Curcumin as test compounds because they are respected PKA activators and inhibitors. Furthermore, they are easily water soluble, allowing them to dissolve first into the water solution and then into the 2% water agar plate. 


Materials and Methods:
The Physarum stock was prepared prior to our experiment in a growth medium. A total number of 3 plates for control, and 6 plates for treatment (3 dibutrylyl cAMP and 3 for Curcumin) were used for this experiment. The Control and treatment groups were prepared according to the guideline in Figure 1. 5 mL of diluted test compound, dibutrylyl cAMP and Curcumin, was treated in each plates for the treatment group soaked for 10 minutes and drained. Once the blocks for food and Physarum stocks were added, we wrapped all 9 agar plates with tin foil to inhibit phototaxis and placed in the incubator for 24 hours. After this amount of time, we recorded the distance traveled and the direction of the movement, and conducted two sample t-test to test significance. If the t-test results in a p value less than 0.05, then we will know that our data was significantly different.


Results:
After conducting a two sample t-test, we determined that the data from the Dibutrylyl cAMP was significantly different than the control (t-stat= 2.86, df=4 p=0.046). Our data showed that Dibutrylyl cAMP had the greatest distance migrated, with an average distance of 36.33 mm. This is seen in Figure 2. We also observed an increase in the average distance migrated for both the Dibutrylyl cAMP and the Curcumin conditions when compared to the control. After conducting a two sample t-test, we can determine that the data from the curcumin condition was not significantly different than the control (t-stat=1.91 df=4 p value= 0.129). However, curcumin had a large increase in the distance of migration compared to the control but not significantly different. It migrated 30.67 mm which is seen in Figure 2. 


Discussion:
The purpose in our experiment was to determine if Physarum’s chemotaxis was effected when subjected to a Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor. We hypothesized that when the Physarum was subjected to an environment with Dibutrylyl cAMP, an activator, then the xsample t-test and determined that there was a significant different between the Dibutrylyl cAMP condition and the control (t-stat=2.86, df=4, P-Value=0.046). In another experiment that also exposed Physarum to Dibutrylyl cAMP, it was determined that Protein Kinase A is crucial for the signaling for gene regulation, which leads to alteration of the actin cytoskeleton and creating movement [O’Connor 2001]. This explains our data, because dibutrylyl cAMP acts as an activator for PKA and a continuously activated PKA leads to continual alteration of the actin filaments that drive cellular movement. This increased movement of the actin filaments allow the Physarum cells to push farther towards the food, which would increase the distance migrated. We also hypothesized that the distance of chemotaxis would have decreased when the Physarum was exposed to the curcumin when compared to the control. However, our data showed an increase in the distance migrated by the Physarum exposed to the Curcumin condition. After conduction a two sampled t-test, we concluded that there was no significant difference between the distance migrated for the Curcumin condition compared to the control (t-stat=1.91, df=4, P-Value=0.129). This data did not support our hypothesis. However, there is another experiment that shows that when Physarum is exposed to Curcumin, the cell undergoes apoptosis. This is caused by the inability of Protein Kinase A, due to the inhibitory properties of curcumin, to regulate gene expression properly in response to the environment [Rajan, 2014]. We experienced flaws throughout the experiment which impacted our results. One flaw we experienced was transferring equal concentrations of the solutions. We used a glass pipette and mixed thoroughly, but there could have been an agar plate that was soaked with a higher concentration of the inhibitor or activator solution. This would have created an unprecise set of data. Another flaw that we suspect was that some of the 2% water agar plates were made incorrectly. We suspect this because only one out of the 3 control groups had any type of migration. Furthermore, in the experiment next to us, they experienced a large number of their plates not having any migration. In future experiments, we would consider using more 2% agar plates, to ensure that more of the controls/experimental plates migrated. This would result in a more accurate data set. This experiment is important because we understand that Physarum responses to stimuli similarly to human cells. So in this experiment we infer if our human cells are exposed to Dibutrylyl cAMP, then we know the Protein Kinase A will increase gene expression and increase a cellular response like movement quicker and for a longer period of time. In another lab, it was determined that human fibroblasts experienced an increase in gene regulation and expression for a period of time, until the cell started to desensitize the PKA expressions [Freedman 1995].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 depicts the guidelines we followed when creating the Experimental plates and the control. 

Figure 2 depicts the average distance the Physarum migrated in millimeters when exposed to the three different plate conditions. After conducting a two sample t-test for Dibutrylyl cAMP, we can conclude that it did significantly increased the distance of migration (t-stat=2.86, df=4, P-Value=0.046). After conducting two sample t-test for Curcumin, we can conclude that it did not significantly decrease the distance of migration (t-stat=1.91, df=4, P-Value=0.129). The error bars are determined by the standard deviation for each sample, for the Control it was 16.17 mm, Dibutrylyl cAMP was 2.52 mm, and the Curcumin was 10.67 mm.
