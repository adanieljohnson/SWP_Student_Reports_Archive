Title: Scale color does not effect the frequency of broadside and facing agnostic movements between Red and Blue Betta slendens

Abstract:
This experiment set out to demonstrate the effects of scale color on inherent agnostic behavior in Betta slendens, or Siamese Fighting Fish. Male Siamese Fighting Fish, also known as Betta fish, are territorial animals that defend their territories using a number of aggressive displays. The hypothesis was that there would not be a significent difference in agnostic behavior between blue and red Betta fish. By observing and recording a series of broadside and facing movements, the aggressive behavior of two Betta fish separated by a glass partition was recorded. The experiment was conducted by completing four, five minute trials with two red fish and four, five minute trials with two blue Betta fish. The results of the study supported the hypothesis because there was no significent difference in the frequencies of broadside or facing movements between the red and blue Betta fish. A confounding factor in this experiment was the effect of habituation on Betta fish. For further experiments, I would conduct this experiment using fish that had not been introduced to other male Betta fish. It is important to observe animal behavior in order to determine evolutionary histories and fitness. 


Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish, or Betta slendens, are found in nature and domesticated in aquariums. Betta fish have very specific forms of interspecific and intraspecific behaviors that can be observed (Clayton; 1967). This experiment investigated the intraspecific behaviors that occur between animals of the same species. Betta fish come in various different colors, including red, blue, orange, and rainbow. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether blue Betta fish are inherently more likely to display agnostic behavior than red Betta fish. I predicted that there would not be a significent difference in instinctual aggressive behavior between the red and blue Betta fish. This is because agnostic behavior most likely evolved independently of color (Lynn; 2007). Agonistic behavior can be observed and measured by counting facing and broadside movements. The aggressive behaviors include broadside displays in which the dorsal and caudal fins are extended and tail beating and flickering, and facing displays in which the gill covers and branchiostegal membranes protrude as well as pectoral fin extension (Glesener; 2001). These displays are meant to make the fish look larger and therefore, more intimidating (Kuhn; 1970). It is important to conduct observational studies of animal behavior to determine how behaviors influence fitness and how certain behaviors may have evolved over time. 


Materials and Method:
Two red fish were collected from the small tanks and placed in the divided aquarium with the opaque and clear dividers in between the fish. The fish were then able to adapt to the new environment for 5 minutes before the opaque divider was removed. Once removed, the frequency of facing and broadside movements of each of the fish was recorded for five minutes. In addition, the duration time it took for the first actions to take place was recorded. After five minutes the opaque partition was returned and the two red fish were switched out with two new red fish to avoid habituation. This process was repeated a total of four times with 8 different red fish. However, this process was difficult because there were other groups in the lab that were also using red fish, so many were habituated already. After completing the red fish trials, this process was repeated with the blue Betta fish. For each trial, there was an attempt to keep the size and color of fish consistent between the two fish in the tank. The data was analyzed using a significance level of 0.05 for a two-tailed two sample t_test to determine if there was a significent difference between both broadside and facing movements in red and blue Betta fish.


Results:
The results demonstrate that there was not a difference in the average frequency of facing or broadside behaviors between red a blue Betta fish. In general, the blue fish had a greater average number of broadside and facing movements over the four, five minute trials (Figure 1 and 2). However, the sample size is so small and the standard deviation was so large that the difference would not be significent. During the red fish trials, 4 out of the 8 fish that were used were completely inactive. For the blue fish, 2 out of the 8 fish used were inactive. These inactive fish were excluded from the data set because they had become habituated. Using a significance level of 0.05, the mean number of facing movements for red fish was not significently difference from the mean number of facing movements for blue fish (t_stat = 0.627, d.f. = 8, P = 0.548). In addition, the average frequency of broadside movements for red fish was not significently different from the number of broadside behaviors in the blue fish (t_stat = 0.254, d.f. = 8, P = 0.806). 


Discussion:
This experiment supported the hypothesis that there would not be a difference in aggressive behavior between red and blue Betta fish. The results demonstrate that the difference in color of the Siamese fighting fish in this experiment had no major effect on frequency of agnostic behaviors. The results could have been a result of the short duration of the study, or the fact that the fish we were using had become habituated to their environment and the other male fish. Habituation is a learning mechanism that functions to decrease the amount of energy and attention focused on certain stimuli (Clayton; 1967). After prolonged exposure to the visual presence of another male Betta fish, the Betta fish that is being observed will display less agnostic behaviors (Peeke; 1970). Further experiments would need to be conducted to determine whether the presence of two different colored Betta fish in the same tank would increase the frequency of agnostic behaviors. It is important to conduct observational studies on species in order to demonstrate how certain behaviors evolved or impact an individuals’ fitness.
