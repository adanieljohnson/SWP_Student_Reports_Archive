Title: The Effect of Soil Copper Concentrations on Energy Allocation in Mung Beans (Vigna radiata).

Abstract:
Allocation is how plants change phenotype to account for resource availability. This experiment investigates how mung beans (Vigna radiata) allocate in environments with different copper concentrations. It was hypothesized that the copper-treated mung beans would have increased allocation to the root system compared to the controll. Statistical analysis revealed that the root to shoot ratios of the copper-treated and controll mung beans were not significently different. This indicates that concentrations of copper at or below .25M do not affect energy allocation in mung beans.

Introduction:
Plants can change phenotype based availability of sunlight, water, nutrients, competition, and other factors. These changes in phenotype are meant to increase a plant’s fitness in the environment. For example, a plant with exposure to shade and sun will grow more leaves on the sunny side than the shady side. This is called resource allocation. Allocation is often measured in ratios, as the same amount of energy and resources are being used, simply in different locations. Therefore, in the previous example, we could calculate the ratio of sunny-side leaves to shady-side leaves to measure how a plant is allocating its resources.
	This experiment aimed to measure the effect of copper availability on mung beans (Vigna radiata) resource allocation. Prior research shows increased nutrient levels in the soil to drive more nutrient allocation to roots [Müllera, 2000]. However, this research also indicates increases in stem and leaf biomass, although less profound [Müllera, 2000]. 
	Specifically, copper is involved in the activation of chlorophyll cleaving enzymes, and therefore a necessary micronutrient. Copper has also been shown to be toxic in amounts too far above what is optimal for the plant by sequestering in the roots and retarding root growth [Cook, 1998], [O’Sullivan, 1997]. It is hypothesized that the root to shoot (R:S) ratio will increase because the mung beans will allocate more resources to the roots due to the increased copper nutrient content.

Materials and Method:
Six pots were filled with limited-nutrient soil and saturated with water. Fifty mung bean seeds were planted 0.5 inches under the surface. These plants were then placed in a sunny greenhouse, and watered daily for 14 days. Three of the plants were labeled “copper treatment” and were given 50Ml of .25µM copper solution daily in addition to the water. Data was collected by measuring the lengths and masses of the roots and shoots. These were used to calculate a root to shoot ratio.  Mung beans (Vigna radiata) were used because they have complex root systems and grow quickly.


Results:
The “root mass to shoot mass” and the “root length to shoot length” ratios were calculated for each plant. When the mass ratios were compared, no visible trend was observed. As shown in figure 1.1, The average mass ratio of the controll group was 1.09. As shown in figure 1.2, the average mass ratio of the copper treated group was 1.53. A t_test was run comparing the mass ratio distributions of the controll and copper groups, and the p_value was 0.24. 

When the length ratios were compared, it seemed that the controll plant R:S ratios were generally lower than the cooper R:S ratios. As shown in figure 2.1, the average length R:S ratio for the copper treated mung beans was 1.33. As shown in figure 2.2, the average length R:S ratio for the untreated mung beans was 1.10. A t_test was run comparing the length ratio distributions of the controll and copper groups, and the p_value was 0.51.

As shown in figure 3.2, the average total mass of the untreated mung beans was 4.1g. As shown in figure 3.1, the average total mass of the copper treated mung beans was 2.99g. A one tailed t_test resulted in a p_value of .11. The total length of the copper treated mung beans was 30.26cm. The total length of the untreated mung beans was 28cm. A one tailed t_test resulted in a p_value of .45.

It was also noted that the copper treated mung beans shoot’s seemed to be less stiff than the stems of their untreated counterparts. Additionally, the untreated beans had purple coloring near the base of their roots, however, this coloring was lightened or disappeared completely in the copper treated mung beans.


Discussion:
This data does not support the hypothesis that the copper increased the root to shoot ratio of the mung beans. The p_values of the t_tests comparing the R:S ratios of the treated and controll groups were both greater than .05, and therefore not statistically significent. This could be a result of several scenarios. 
The first is that the copper concentration could have been below optimal for the mung beans, and therefore did not cause any extra resource allocation to the root system. Another scenario is that, as seen in Müllera, 2000, the nutrients increased shoot growth as well as root growth because of increased photosynthesis due to copper’s role in photosynthesis. The average total length of the controll mung beans was 28cm, and the average total length of the copper treated group was 30cm. A t_test of the lengths of the plants showed the copper treated mung beans to not be statistically significently longer than the controll mung beans. This seems to indicate that the copper did not increase total growth in the mung beans, thus rejecting the second theory. In fact, the total masses indicate that the copper decreased total growth. The average mass of the controll mung beans was 4.11g, while the average mass of the copper-treated mung beans was 2.99g. A t_test between these distributions had a p_value of .11, which is much closer to being statistically significent. This decrease of total growth could be due to the third scenario. As outlined in Müllera, 2000, the copper could have slowed root growth, but not enough to be statistically significent. This copper concentration did not cause more energy to be allocated to the roots or shoots.
