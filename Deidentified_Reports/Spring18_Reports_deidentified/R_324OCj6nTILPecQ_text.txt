Title: Effect of Martin's IGR on Growth of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This study's main objective is to determine the effects of Martin's IGR on the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Martin is an IGR that mimics the effects of Juvenile Hormone, which is a naturally occurring hormone that prevents the caterpillar from maturing through metamorphosis. This controlls the reproduction of the caterpillars. Our hypothesis was that, if the Manduca sexta were exposed to Martin in their food, they would grow more and be relatively bigger than those caterpillars that had not been exposed to Martin. The controll group and experimental group were given 10 grams of food without Martin and food with Martin, respectively. Each caterpillar was weighed daily. After a two tailed type 2 T-Test it was supported that the controll food promoted more growth than the food supplemented with Martin.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, has a lifespan between 30-50 days [Written, 1996]. During development, Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating the physiology of these insects; for example, JH regulates metamorphosis by preventing the Manduca Sexta from maturing to a pupa then transitioning from the larval stage to the adult stage [Norigea, 2014]. JH regulates the reproductive cycle, growth, and overall development of the Manduca Sexta. The study regarding the amount of JH in these caterpillars addresses the specific pathways characteristics JH regulates during growth and development from larval stage 1 to 5, and then from pupa to adult. The effects of JH can be seen through different JH modulators. The hypothesis was that a small amount of JH mimic will make the caterpillars bigger in relation to those eating the controll food without Martin's IGR throughout the molting process. 

Materials and Method:
To conduct our experiment, we first selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars from the Bio 114 lab that weigh between 0.75 and 1.75 g. Four caterpillars were randoMly chosen to be in the experimental group, and the other four were placed in the controll. There was a controll caterpillar with the controll food on one side of the container and an experimental caterpillar with the experimental food on the other side; they were separated by an index card. The controll group was given 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet daily-recommended by the manufacturer and with 4 drops of DI water. The experimental group was given 10g of GLM diet daily, supplemented with 4 drops of Martin. After the initial preparation, we kept all of our caterpillars in the same incubator, after properly labeling their containers with the group name and ID number. We weighted the caterpillars at approximately the same time each day (+/- 1 hr.) and recorded their weights for a week. The data will be analyzed using a two-tailed T-test, which will determine the effects of Martin as an IGR. 

Results:
There was a consistent, steady increase in weights through the week [Figure 1]. Although the average weight of the experimental caterpillars was originally slightly higher than the controll caterpillars, the controll caterpillars were ultimately more massive than the experimental caterpillars. They were also higher every other day.  The P-value ended up being  0.06537363 in a 2 tailed type 2 t test  The P-value of ..07 means that there is significent difference in growth between the controll group and the experimental group. 

Discussion:
The experiment supported the hypothesis.. The p_value is higher than the alpha of .05, but it is so close that it can be considered being less than .05 the same due to user error or to some technical problem., there is proof that the Martin's IGR did affect the growth of the caterpillars relative to the controll. This result was supported by another study, which states that insects exposed to JH-activating IGRs decreased overall development, and also hurt the ability to molt to the final instar [Vogel, 1979]. Furthermore,  since we continuously fed the caterpillars the right amount of food and the right type of food and kept them in the incubator, there was no obvious error in this experiment that would have significently impacted the results. We weighed them at around the same time every day (+/- 1 hr.), which means that the weights were comparable. A future experiment could be done that has a larger sample size, allowing for the statistics to be better. Once the results are established with 8 drops, the drops can be lowered or increased as seen fit and the perfect amount of drops can be found through future testing. This experiment shows how sensitive the endocrine system is, and how it should not be tampered with in any way due to its fragility.
