Title: The Effect of AZA Guard on the Development of Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment performed was to examine how the presence of 20E Ecdysterone blockers impacted the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. The two predominant hormones of the insect that are involved in maturation are the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. It was hypothesized that the presence of 20E Ecdysterone blockers in the growth of the insect would result in a significently decreased weight compared to the weight of caterpillars growing without the blockers. Eight caterpillars were split into two groups of four, one controll and one experimental group, and were fed the same food except the treatment was given seven drops of the blockers in their food and the controll group was given seven drops of water. For eight days total, the caterpillars were weighed each day and observations regarding appearance and movement were noted. A statistical two-sample t_test was performed to determine the chance that the resulting values were by chance, and resulted in a p_value of 6.41 x 10-6. The hypothesis was supported at the end of the experiment as a result of the biological manipulation of the hormones and its effect in the development of the Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
Hormones are an essential component of growth and maturation in organisms, with puberty acting as an example in humans. A popular case studying hormones involves Pyrrhocons apertus L., colloquially known as linden bug (Tunaz:2004). Juvabione, an insect growth regulator or hormone found in the paper towels on which the bugs lived, was found to have caused low egg hatch rates and improper maturation into adult form in the linden bug population being studied. The presence of Juvabione inhibited growth of the linden bugs into their adult stage. In the study performed in class, the subject was the Manduca Sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. The average life cycle is approximately 39-48 days, composed of four major life stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. In between each instar larva stage, which are the stages of progression during the larvae stage, beginning at the 1st instar, there are 2-3 days of development, excepting the 4 days between the 4th instar and 5th instar larva, and the 5 days after the 5th instar to pupation. The two main hormones responsible for growth and maturation in the Manduca Sexta are the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone, responsible for regulating the form of molt of the insect, is present in all larvae stages of the insect and disappears after pupation. Ecdysterone is the secondary hormone, responsible for maintaining timing of molting, and is present throughout the entire development of the insect. The study performed tested how the presence of 20 E (Ecdysterone) blockers could impact the weight of Manduca Sexta caterpillars over a given period of time. The hypothesis of the experiment was that there would be a significent decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars with the presence of the 20E blockers as opposed to without them. 

Materials and Method:
In order to conduct this experiment, two groups of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars were needed- one controll group that was fed normally, and one experimental group that was given the 20E blockers. The controll group was composed of four caterpillars and the experimental group was composed of four caterpillars. To begin the experiment, four round, plastic containers with perforated lids were labeled with the group name, caterpillar ID, whether the group was controll or treatment, and the lab section. An index card was taped in an S-shape in each cup, creating a divide between the two sides of the interior. To prepare the food for all groups, 80 grams of food was weighed in a square container and stirred. Ten grams of the stirred food was weighed for each caterpillar in the controll group and seven drops of deionized water was stirred into each of the controll caterpillar's ten grams of food, and then was placed in a blob in each respective controll section of the containers. The same process was repeated for the treatment group, with seven drops of the 20E blocker "AZA Guard" (with a dilution of 1 part AZA Guard to 1250 parts of deionized water) instead of deionized water. Each of the eight caterpillars were weighed and given an ID number before being placed in their respective locations. Every day for seven days after the first day, each caterpillar was weighed, and given food if the supply diminished by over half. Observations regarding appearance and movement were noted each day. Statistical tests that will be performed to test the hypothesis include the 2-sample t_test. This test was needed to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the average ending weight of the controll group versus the average ending weight of the treatment group.  

Results:
The main results of the experiment fell under two categories: growth and appearance. Throughout the experiment, there was some weight gain from the experimental group but little overall weight gain. As seen in Figure 1 and Table 1, the average weight of the caterpillars in the controll group was greater than the average weight of the caterpillars in the experimental group throughout the entire experiment, each day. As seen in Table 1, as the experiment progressed, the standard deviation for the experimental and controll group increased, excepting a decrease on the last day for the controll group. In terms of appearance, the caterpillars in the experimental group maintained a relatively consist appearance; the caterpillars stayed the original turquoise color throughout and developed small spots on the side as well as black chevrons on the back. The controll group experienced greater changes; they maintained the turquoise color but experienced swelling of legs, and body as well as the spots on the side and the black chevrons on the back. The statistical two-sample t_test that was performed displayed results that the values and data collected had a very low chance of happening by chance. The degrees of freedom in the test was six. The p_value obtained for the two-sample test was 6.41 x 10-6, existing far below the threshold value of 0.05.  

Discussion:
In accordance with the resulting data, it can be inferred that the use of the 20E Ecdysterone blockers resulted in significently lower weights for all caterpillars in the experimental group than the weights observed in the controll group. The results of the experiment reflected similar effects as the effects seen in the linden bug trial, in which the presence of a hormone, specifically Juvabione which mimicked the effects of Juvenile Hormone, stunted the growth and maturation of the linden bugs because it interfered with the hormone pattern in the life cycle of the bug (Tunaz:2004). In the case of the Manduca Sexta, the 20E Ecdysterone blockers acted as inhibitors to the essential hormone Ecdysterone, and produced similar effects as the linden bug case study through blocking the secondary hormone needed for maturation as opposed to supplying extra hormones that mimicked or were Juvenile Hormone supplements. The results of our experiment occurred due to the disruption of the hormonal timing during the lifecycle of the Manduca Sexta. As a 4th instar larva, levels of Ecdysterone spike heavily allowing for maturation into a 5th instar larva, which is the last stage before the commitment pulse of Ecdysterone signaling the progression into pupation. In the controll group at the end of the observational period, the caterpillars had reached the 5th instar larva stage due to the normal workings of their hormones. However, the experimental group did not experience the presence of the Ecdysterone during their existence as a 4th instar larva and thus could not develop into a 5th instar larva due to the presence of Juvenile Hormone and a lack of Ecdysterone, which would have allowed for maturation into the next stage. Subsequently, the lack of Ecdysterone prevented maturation beyond the larval eclosion, thus maintaining the caterpillar's development at the stage of the 4th instar larva with minimal weight gain, as seen in Figure 1. Our biological alternate hypothesis was thus supported (and the null hypothesis was not) as it was predicted that the presence of the Ecdysterone blockers would inhibit growth in the experimental group in significent proportion compared to the controll group. Statistically speaking, the two-sample t_test supported the statistical alternate hypothesis and did not support the statistical null hypothesis. The low p_value derived from the test determined that there was far below a five percent chance that our data occurred purely from chance, resting at 6.41 x 10-6. This low number further supported the alternate hypothesis as it marked that there was an extremely low probability that the data occurred by chance. The biological manipulation of hormones, and thus the growth and development cycle of the Manduca Sexta, due to the presence of the 20E Ecdysterone blockers resulted in significently lower weights of the experimental group caterpillars compared with the weights of the controll group.

Figure 1. Average Weight of Control Group and Treatment Group Caterpillars by Day. Blue bars represent average weight of the controll group, and orange bars represent average weight of the experimental group. Throughout the duration of the experiment, the average weight of the caterpillars in the controll group was larger than the average weight of the caterpillars in the experimental group. Weight was measured in grams, and was performed by using a balance and weigh boat to hold the caterpillars. The error bars are representative of the standard deviation per day, per treatment or controll group. These results had a low probability of occurring by chance, as evidenced by the two-sample t_test's p_value of 6.41 x 10-6.
