Title: Comparing the Photosynthetic Activities of a Sun Plant and a Shade Plant 

Abstract:
Plants capture and store energy from the sun through redox reactions of photosynthesis. In the light dependent reactions, photons absorb light from the sun and are used to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH and energy in the form of ATP, which are necessary products to create glucose. We wanted to know if photosynthetic rates were decreased in plants that don't grow in the sun. Our hypothesis was that the spinach plant would have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern plant. To test our hypothesis, we ground up spinach and fern leaves into a paste and centrifuged the pastes until we obtained a pellet that consisted of the maximum number of chloroplasts in each sample. We then ran a Hill assay to determine the photosynthetic rates of the fern and spinach plants. We found our percent change for the spinach plant to be significantly higher than the fern plant, supporting our hypothesis that the sun plant will have a higher photosynthetic activity than the shade plant. It is possible that photosynthetic activity is higher in sun plants because they have evolved to have a higher photosynthetic captivity, whereas shade plants have a lower photosynthetic captivity. Overall, its important to understand that sun plants have a higher photosynthetic activity than shade plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use sunlight to synthesize energy in the form of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The summary chemical equation is given by:

6 CO2 + 12 H2O ---------------&gt;  C6H12O6 +  6 H2O +  6 O2

Photosynthesis is broken up into three stages. The first two stages consist of the light dependent reactions and the last stage consists of the light independent reactions. The light dependent reactions were the focus of this experiment. In the first stage of the light dependent reactions, photons absorb light from the sun. These excited photons then generate reducing power in the form of NADPH, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. In the second stage of the light dependent reactions, a proton gradient is generated to drive ATP synthesis [Johnson: 2016]. The light dependent reactions function by generating NADPH and ATP, which are necessary products to generate glucose for the light independent reactions of photosynthesis.  

	Photosynthesis involves redox reactions in the electron transport chain, proton pumps that create a proton gradient to synthesize ATP, and carrier molecules, NADP+ and NADPH, to transfer high energy electrons used in the light independent reactions. The light dependent reactions consist of two systems, Photosystem II (PSII) and Photosystem I (PSI), which both are found in the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplast. In PSII, energy is absorbed from a photon of light. The energy is transferred to P680, a pair of chlorophyll molecules called the “special pair”, which enters an excited, high energy state. This high energy electron is then passed to an acceptor molecule, plastiquinone [Alberts: 2013]. The excited electrons are restored by the oxidation of water to produce O2 and H+ ions. The protons produced from oxidation of water are then pumped across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient. Then, reduced plastiquinone transfers its electrons to cytochrome b6f and then to plastocyanin. As the electron moves alone the electron transport chain, energy is released to pump more protons across the thylakoid membrane. The protons generated from water splitting and the transfer across the electron transport chain forms the proton gradient necessary to generate ATP. At this time, plastosyanin carries the electrons to PSI, which are excited by incoming photons of light. The excited electrons travel through PSI to NADP+ to produce NADPH, which will travel to the light independent reaction pathway to create glucose. The proton gradient generated creates an electrochemical gradient that runs through an ATP synthase complex. After the electrons move down their electrical and diffusion gradient, ATP is synthesized [Johnson: 2016].

In our experiment, we wanted to know if photosynthetic rates were decreased in plants that do not grow in the sun. Thus, we focused on the light dependent reactions because they can only occur when light is present. Energy from light excites electrons in PSII and PSI so they can travel through the electron transport chain. The light independent reactions do not involve excitation of electrons by light. We decided to compare the photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea), a plant grown in the sun, and fern leaves, a plant grown in the shade. To measure photosynthetic activity, we needed to measure the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts. We did this by using a Hill reaction with an alternate electron accepter, DCPIP, that chloroplasts pass electrons to. When oxidized, DCPIP is dark blue and absorbs light, but when reduced, DCPIP is colorless [Johnson: 2016]. Thus, the reducing agent NADPH produced by the chloroplasts can be detected. Throughout the process of the reaction, the higher photosynthetic activity can be determined by the solution that is colorless. We chose to use the spinach plant because it has a high yield of chloroplasts, and we chose to use the fern plant because it was the most accessible plant grown in the shade. We hypothesized that the spinach leaf would have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern leaf.


Materials and Methods:
The two organisms used were fern leaves and spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea). The fern leaves were gathered from a shady area inside the biology building, so the exact name is not known.

Part one:

We placed two mortar and pestles, 2x150 mL beaker, and 6x50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. Three centrifuge tubes were used for the fern leaves and three tubes were used for the spinach leaves. We cut four fern leaves from a shady area and gathered four spinach leaves. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, we removed the large central veins from the fern and spinach leaves, threw the veins away, and tore up the fern and spinach leaves. We added the torn fern leaves to one cold, dry mortar and pestle, and the torn spinach leaves to the other. We then added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), and grinded the fern and spinach leaves until they were a thick paste. The fern leaves were not initially cut as much as the spinach leaves, so between grinding, we had to use scissors to cut the leafy-paste into pieces. The ideal ending point should contain no leaves. However, due to the dryness of the fern leaves and initially not cutting them very much, the ending slurry contained a few leaves in it. We then added an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer to the fern and spinach slurry and mixed it. Using three layers of cheesecloth, we strained the fern and spinach slurries into two separate chilled beakers. 200 ul of the filtered liquid slurries were then transferred into labeled microtubes, “Sample of A, Fern”, and, “Sample of A, Spinach” and stored on ice. The remaining slurries in the beakers were then transferred into separate chilled 50 mL centrifuge tubes, labeled “A Fern” and “A Spinach”, and were spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4oC. When using the centrifuge, it was important for us to balance it properly. Otherwise, severe damage could have been done to the machine. To balance the centrifuge correctly, a tube placed in a slot must have a balancing tube placed in the slot directly across from the center spindle. The balancing tube must contain water or another sample with equal weight or type [Johnson: 2016]. After centrifuging for 3 minutes, the supernatant was poured out of tubes “A Fern” and “A Spinach” and into 2 separate chilled 50 mL centrifuge tubes “B Fern” and “B Spinach”. It was important for us to pour the supernatant out quickly to ensure that no debris was accidentally transferred into the tubes. Tubes B Fern and B Spinach were then centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was then removed by each Sample B, and a sample of the fern pellet B and the spinach pellet B were placed in microtubes labeled “Sample of B Fern Pellet” and “Sample of B Spinach Pellet” and were stored on ice. They were gathered by adding 20 mL of grinding buffer to them, stirring with the transfer pipet, and pipetting them in the microtubes. We then took sample B pellet for the fern and chloroplast and compared the chloroplast density on hemocytometer under phase optics in a microscope to qualitatively determine the fraction. 

Part two:
 
When looking under the microscope, it was estimated that there were about 8 times as many chloroplasts in the spinach solution than the fern solution (Figure 2&3). Therefore, we placed 100 μl of the spinach chloroplasts and 700 μl of water in 3 test tubes to make the concentration more dilute to qualitatively equal the fern chloroplasts. We added 800 μl of the fern chloroplasts in 3 test tubes. Then we prepared 13 large test tubes with reaction mixes. One blank tube was made with 8mL water and 2mL reaction buffer, three test tubes without chloroplasts with 6mL water, 2mL 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), three tubes with spinach chloroplasts (diluted), 2mL 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and three test tubes of fern chloroplasts and the same amount of DCPIP and the reaction buffer. We then stirred the tubes and transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Using tube 0, we blanked the spectrophotometer and measured the absorbance of the samples for time zero at 600nm. The tubes were placed under a grow light for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the blanked the spectrophotometer, then read the absorbance of each sample again. We then placed the samples under the grow light for 10 more minutes, or 20 minutes total. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer and measured the absorbance of each sample. The samples were then placed under the grow light again for 10 minutes, or 30 minutes total. After 10 minutes the spectrophotometer was blanked, and the absorbance of each sample was read. 

Statistical Tests: 

For each absorbance read, we recorded it in excel against time. We calculated the “% Change” in absorbance at 10, 20, and 30 minutes using the following formula:

% change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%

A statistical t-test was then used in order to determine the significance of our results. 


Results:
The percent change at 30 minutes was highest for the spinach leaves at an average of 57.1%. This was followed by the fern leaves at an average of 11.6% and the control sample with no chloroplasts at an average of 0.3%. The mean of the spinach group and the fern group were statistically different (t-stat= 6.23, df= 4, P= 0.0034). Figure 1 shows the change in absorbance of the fern leaves, spinach leaves, and sample with no chloroplasts at time zero, after 10 minutes, after 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes. Figure 2 shows the average percent change over 30 minutes in the fern leaves, spinach leaves, and sample with no chloroplasts. The error bars represent the standard deviations. Table 1 shows the average absorbance data points for fern, spinach, and no chloroplasts shown in Figure 1 for time 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes.

Discussion:
We found our results to support our hypothesis that photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves will be higher than in fern leaves. The bigger percent change shown in Figure 2 for the spinach leave shows that more photosynthetic activity took place in the plant grown in the sun. The fern leaves had less photosynthetic activity, which was shown throughout the DCPIP Hill reaction because the color remained blue, while the spinach leaves changed to colorless. The color changed to colorless because DCPIP is colorless when it is reduced. Photosynthesis produced the reducing agent NADPH, which cause the blue color to leave. 

	It is possible that photosynthetic activity is higher in sun plants because they have a higher photosynthetic captivity, whereas shade plants have a lower photosynthetic captivity. Plants have evolved in order to absorb the maximum amount of light in order to survive. Thus, shade plants have evolved a lower photosynthetic captivity because they are faced with less light. When light hits the shade plant, it can only reach is maximum photosynthetic captivity, which is lower than the sun plant. Shade plants also have a higher leaf area ratio than sun plants. This can be explained by there being a less amount of sunlight available, so the leaves need to be bigger in order to take in as much sunlight as possible [Atwell: 1999]. In a previous study, it is shown that the capacity for photosynthetic electron transport is higher in sun plant than in shade plant chloroplasts. They found that, “the light saturated methylamine uncoupled rate of reduction of DCIP in the Hill reaction was less for shade species compared to sun species” [Boardman: 2018]. This study supports our results with the Hill reaction that the sun plant has a higher photosynthetic activity than the shade plant. This also shows that electron transport through the electron transport pathway is lower for shade plants. If less light is available, less photons will excite electrons, causing less electrons to pass through the electron transport chain. 

Though our hypothesis was supported by our experiment and previous studies, various sources of error have to be considered. First, the chloroplast volume of the spinach plant was higher than the chloroplast volume of the fern plant. Though we diluted the spinach plant, our estimate may have been too low, resulting in more chloroplasts for the spinach plant and a higher photosynthetic activity. Another source of error is that the fern leaves were very dry, and we did not cut them initially when grinding them with the mortar and pestle. Thus, it was difficult to grind all of the leaves into a liquid paste. This would result in less chloroplasts and less photosynthetic activity. In future areas of research, the effect that different types of light have on exciting electrons can be explored. In a previous study, an experiment that tested the photosynthetic response to different light intensities and water status of two Nothofagus species was conducted. They found that as light intensity decreased, photosynthetic activity of the two species decreased as well [Peri: 2009]. This can be useful for our experiment because for both the fern plant and the spinach plant, we used a bright white light. However, white light may excite spinach, but not fern. Thus, if different types of light were used on the fern plant, it is possible that different photosynthetic rates can be determined. Another future area of research can be done on if plants can adapt to low light in a short period of time. This can be useful for the economical use of available light while growing and harvesting important crops that grow in the shade. If certain crops can adapt to less light, less money can be spent on finding sunny areas or purchasing light sources. Overall, it is important to understand the mechanism of photosynthesis and how photosynthetic rates are different for sun and shade plants.
