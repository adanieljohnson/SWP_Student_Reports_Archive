Title: The Effect of Potassium Ion Channel Blockers on Muscle Contraction in the Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system works through a serious of electronic and chemical signals that result in a muscle contraction. Potassium is one of the many ions that affects muscle contraction in the Rania pipiens frog. We hypothesized that if we blocked the influx of potassium ions then the contraction phase of the myogram will last for a longer period of time because the neuron cannot repolarize. The potassium blocker utilized was mixed with frog ringer to produce a 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl solution. 0.1 Ml of this solution was injected into the top of the gastrocnemus muscle and the base of the gastrocnemus muscle of three frogs. Based on the data collected the potassium blocker did not have an effect on the length of a muscle contraction. In the future we may alter this experiment by stimulating the muscle rather than the nerve. 

Introduction:
A muscle contraction can be monitored in many organisms. In this experiment we used a species of frog known as the Rania pipiens to monitor the latent, contraction, and relaxation periods of a muscle contraction. These frogs are ideal for the study of the neuromuscular system because their muscles are highly developed and specialized due to their unique styles of movement, which include bipedal hopping and swimming [Kamel, 1996]. 
The neuromuscular system works through a serious of electronic and chemical signals that result in a muscle contraction. In order for this to happen, neurons have to be depolarized to fire an action potential, which will trigger a cascade of events culminating in a contraction. A motor neuron is depolarized by the increasing permeability of the neuron to sodium cations. This is caused by the opening of voltage gate ion channels that are specific to sodium. The action potential will end when the neuron is repolarized once more. This happens when the neurons permeability to potassium channels increases, caused by the opening of voltage gated potassium channels. The rapid influx of the ion, coupled with decreased permeability to sodium ions, will return the neuron to its original resting potential [Waterman, 1961]. The longer it takes for the cell to repolarize, the longer the action potential and subsequent muscle contraction will last. The length of a muscle contraction can be monitored using a myogram, which also displays the latent and relaxation periods of a contraction. The latent period occurs in the short period of time between a stimulus and the contracting of the muscle. The relaxation phase occurs after the contraction phase has reached is maximum peak and the muscle begins to relax [Johnson, 2018]. 
Based on our knowledge of ion permeability in the process of a muscle contraction, we hypothesized that if we blocked the influx of potassium ions then the contraction phase of the myogram will last for a longer period of time because the neuron cannot repolarize. 


Materials and Method:
In order to perform this experiment, we used three frog legs. Each leg acted as its own controll and experimental group. We would first test muscle contractions before the application of the potassium blocker, and then we would test it again after injecting the blocker into the muscle using a syringe. To prepare the frog legs we first removed the skin before exposing the sciatic nerve above the knee joint. Then we separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the bone and used thread to hang it perpendicular to the sciatic nerve and bones. Two electrodes were placed under the nerve and then fired resulting in a muscle contraction. This was first done at a low amplitude to determine the threshold of the nerve. Then the procedure was repeated at an amplitude 0.5 V higher than the threshold. The electrodes were fired at this voltage three times and the resulting time of the contraction was recorded. 
This procedure was repeated on another two frogs. Because each frog leg had a varying level of sensitivity, this enabled us to minimize the effect of these differing sensitivities on the data. The potassium blocker utilized was mixed with frog ringer to produce a 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl solution. 0.1 Ml of this solution was injected into the top of the gastrocnemus muscle and the base of the gastrocnemus muscle.


Results:
The average of the controll group was not statistically significent in comparison to the experimental group (t_stat = 0.236, d.f. = 2, P = 0.85). The average length of the contraction for the controll group, which did not receive the potassium blocker, was 504 milliseconds. In comparison the average length of contraction for the experimental group exposed to the potassium blocker was 500 milliseconds (figure 1). In addition, for frog one the contraction time was longer in the controll frog than the experimental. However, in frog two the controll frog had a shorter contraction length than the experimental.  Based on the p_value the null hypothesis was confirmed because it did not represent a 95% confidence level, which would require a p_value of 0.05 or less. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected the potassium blocker did not have an effect on the length of a muscle contraction. In a similar experiment published in the Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology researchers found that changes in the potassium concentration do not affect tetanus, or continued muscle contraction without relaxation, in Rania pipiens. This is related to our experiment because both involve analyzing muscle contraction after the manipulation of potassium ion levels. However, in this experiment, researchers stimulated the muscle rather than the nerve. In addition, they did not measure the length of the first contraction, but rather looked at the amount of time and energy it took for muscles to contract continuously in tetanus. However, they tested the impact of potassium in the Sartorius muscle rather than the gastrocnemus [Renaud, 1992]. This does provide options for experimental modification in the future, as testing the length of the first muscle contraction may not be the most effective method of quantifying the effect of potassium channel blockers on muscle contractions in amphibians. 
In spite of this we did note slight changes in the myogram of experimental and controll group frogs. Experimental frogs generally had longer relaxation phases and took longer to repolarize. This could reflect the blocking of potassium ion channels hindering the repolarization of the motor neuron. In the future, changing the dependent variable to test the length of the relaxation period may produce more conclusive data. There are several possible explanations for why the application of a potassium blocker to the sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens did not have an effect on the length of the muscle contraction. It is possible that we needed to wait longer after applying the blocker in order for it to affect ion concentration in the motor neuron. However, this presents a challenge because the longer the muscle sits after the organism’s death, the less responsive it will be to electrode stimulation. Because potassium also plays a role in the synaptic cleft between the muscle and the neuron, stimulating electrodes in the muscle itself rather than the nerve could have a greater effect on muscle contraction. It is also possible that not enough potassium blocker was applied to have a significent effect of muscle contraction. 
This experimental data did not support our hypothesis that the application of a potassium channel blocker to the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens would lengthen the contraction period of a muscle contraction. Furthermore, the data was not conclusive. In the future we could also test the impact of sodium channel blockers on muscle contractions, as the influx of sodium ions triggers depolarization in neurons.
Data regarding the impact of ion manipulation on the neuromuscular system can have far-reaching impacts on medicine. For example, it could help explain the mechanisms behind naturally occurring toxins, such as snake venom, that affect the neuromuscular system. Additionally, a better understanding of ion interactions in muscle contractions can help scientists better understand neuromuscular disorders, such as Guillain-Barre Syndrome and allow them to produce more effective drug therapies.
