Title: Aggression of Betta splendins in the Presence of Shelter

Abstract:
Male Siamese fighting fish, or Betta splendins, have a wide range of intraspecific behaviors. Many of these behaviors are aggressive behaviors, or agnostic. Additionally, Shelter is of major importance to many animals in providing protection against both the physical environment and potential predators. My hypothesis is that betta fish will show less aggressive behavior towards each other in the presence of shelter. We used a point system to tally the aggression of betta splendins with and without shelter in their tanks with one point representing less aggressive behaviors and five points as the most aggressive. A paired-samples t_test was conducted to compare the aggression in betta fish with and without shelter (Figure 1). There was a significent difference in the aggression in betta fish without shelter  (M=18.33 ± 2.87) and the aggression of betta fish with shelter (M=2.67± 2.05) conditions; (N=3, d.f.= 2, t= 4.92, p=0.038.) Social hierarchies between the betta splendins were observed. It is possible that through evolution, aggressive betta splendins are selected for, therefore increasing competition for dominance and access to resources. 

Introduction:
An intraspecific behavior is any behavior that an organism performs for, or directs toward members of its own species. Many species of fishes are aggressive when placed in small aquaria. Aggression can negatively affect the welfare of those individuals toward whom it is directed. Animals may behave aggressively in order to defend resources such as food, shelter, mates, and offspring. The decision to defend depends on the distribution of resources and on ecological factors such as number of competitors, amount of available space, and amount of habitat complexity. [Old.f.ield, R.G.: 2011] By studying intraspecific behavior, we can gain a deeper understanding of how particular behaviors have evolved. Additionally, shelter is of major importance to many animals in providing a refuge from aggressive conspecifics. In interaction trials between conspecifics of different sizes and sexes and between geckos and predators, it was  found that lizards were unwilling to share shelters with conspecifics in all situations. Scientists observed aggressive behaviors such as chasing, biting, and head bobbing and noted that subordinate geckos were unwilling to enter a shelter occupied by a dominant individual even in the presence of a predator. Shelter can be utilized as a way to separate the dominate individuals in a species so that less energy is used in aggressive acts. [Allen E. et al.: 2014] My hypothesis is that betta fish will show less aggressive behavior towards each other in the presence of shelter. 

Materials and Method:
First, we started with three fish in one tank, each separated by an opaque and clear barrier. In order to measure aggression between the betta fish, we used a point system. We began assigning points to the behaviors only if the betta fish displayed the behavior for five or more consecutive seconds in order take into consideration not only the behavior itself, but also the duration of the behavior. If the behavior lasts for a longer amount of time, the fish is showing more aggression. We assigned one point each time a fish had erect pectoral fins or a pelvic fin flicker for more than five seconds, two points each time a fish showed tail beating or spread gills, and five points each time a fish showed its tail flashing or the red mane. More points were given to the more aggressive behaviors. Next, we observed fish one and two together, then one and three, and finally, two and three. We observed the fish for five minutes after removing the opaque and clear barriers; then we placed both barriers back and allowed the fish to have a five minute rest. One partner tallied points, while the other two were assigned a fish to watch during the interaction. In the end, we combined the points for the two fish during each interaction, so the total number of points was the total number of points seen for the interaction, not the individual fish. We used a paired t_test with two tails to measure the aggression of the same three fish and their interactions with each other before and after placing shelter in their tank. 

Results:
There was a significent difference in the aggression in betta fish without shelter  (M=18.33 ± 2.87) and the aggression of betta fish with shelter (M=2.67± 2.05) conditions; (N=3, d.f.= 2, t= 4.92, p=0.038.) Upon visual observation, the fish appeared much more aggressive when there was no shelter vs when we placed shelter in the tank. The fish that appeared to be dominant and more aggressive tended to hide in the shelter for most of the five minutes while the other fish swam against a wall or stayed at the furthest possible place in the tank from the dominant fish. The non-shelter data shows more accumulated points for aggressive acts. Most of these points were accumulated through the dominant fish which showed aggressive acts toward the non-dominant fish when there was no shelter, but stayed inside the shelter when it was present. When both fish were outside the shelter, the shelter worked as a barrier between them and they did not get near each other. However, when there was no barrier in the tank, the fish often came within close proximity of each other. Additionally, we observed that when both fish were of similar size, they tended to show less aggression.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that betta fish will show less aggressive behavior towards each other in the presence of shelter was supported (p=0.038). Evidence suggests that many species have "open" developmental programs that allow animals to mold their aggressive actions to best fit their environment. There is strong evidence that intraspecific behavior has been selected for. [Losey J: 2009] Betta splendins may have evolved these aggressive behaviors through natural selection in order to get the best shelter against other predators. 
Additionally, the establishment and reinforcement of dominance status is thought to provide an individual with increased access to preferred resources, such as food, mates, and shelter. Resources within an environment vary based on their availability, abundance, and specific characteristics of the resource. Animals can exhibit preferences for resources by increasing the intensity of competition for access to the resource. [Millidine K, et al,:2008] Upon observation, the betta fish that appeared more aggressive, also appeared to be dominant and inhabit the shelter first. It is likely that through evolution, aggressive betta splendins are selected for, therefore increasing competition for dominance and access to resources.
