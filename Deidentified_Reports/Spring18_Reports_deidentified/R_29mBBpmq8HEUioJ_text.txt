Title: The Inhibition of Ecdysterone in Manduca Caterpillars with Azamax

Abstract:
Every organism uses hormones to communicate internally to neighboring cells, or in the case of single cellular organisms, to other organisms themselves. In insects, the transition to adulthood is controllled by three hormones: JH, ecdysone, and PTTH. Only JH and ecdysone were examined. If the uptake of ecdysterone is inhibited, then the caterpillar will no longer molt or reach a pupil state. A two-sample t_test was used on the length, weight, and amount of food eaten. The p_values are 0.495, 0.064, 0.434. We see from the pupation of the treatment three, as well as the two sample t_test, that the azamax was not significent in the inhibition of ecdysterone.

Introduction:
Every organism uses hormones to communicate internally to neighboring cells, or in the case of single cellular organisms, to other organisms themselves. Hormones can incite small scale changes, such as the production of another hormone or the adjustment of the metabolism, but hormones can also cause organism wide changes. Puberty is an example of an organism wide change that occurs in humans and is an imbalance of hormones while the organism adjusts from childhood to adulthood. Some insects go through a similar change from childhood to adulthood, and these insects undergo a stage in the middle that is called a pupil state. This process as a whole is controllled by three hormones, but there is a focus on most experimentation on only two of them: The juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone. In a study done by Uygun and Tunaz, which was gotten from the laboratory manual, it was discovered that these hormones can be controllled artificially through the insects’ diet. Tunaz and Uygun used the Linden bug to experiment with and found that insect growth regulators (Dietary supplements or foods that naturally contained one of the insect growth hormones or an inhibitor) could be introduced to their systems through their diet (Tunaz: 2004). Both of these hormones are essential to an insect’s life cycle and part of Tunaz and Uygun’s research discovered this. If you alter them, then the organism will be unable to reach its full lifecycle. The Manduca sexta is an insect that uses both JH and ecdysterone, and will be the organism used in this experiment. The Manduca caterpillar is a bright green caterpillar that varies in size and turns from yellow to orange to red as it reaches the pupation stage. If the uptake of ecdysterone is inhibited, then the caterpillar will no longer molt or reach a pupil state.

Materials and Method:
8 caterpillars were obtained of an unknown age. Four of the caterpillars were designated as treatment and four were designated as controll. They were placed in four containers, two had controll groups and two had treatment. Both groups were fed 10 grams of caterpillar food a day. The controll group was given 6 drops of water in their food, and the treatment group was given 10 drops of azamax 1: 1250 a day. Azamax is a chemical known to include ecdysterone. The length, weight, and amount of food consumed were recorded every day, new food was placed into the containers, and the containers were cleaned out. A two-sample t_test was used to show the scientific significance.

Results:
The P value for the amount eaten was 0.433. For the Length and Weight respectively the p_values were 0.495 and 0.064
 Controls Three and treatment three were the only caterpillars to experience a color change or form a chrysalis throughout the experiment. For the rest of the caterpillars, the overall weight, length, and amount of food eaten decreased over time. The other caterpillars experienced little color change and stayed green. Towards the end of the experiment weight, length, and amount of food eaten all decreased-on average.


Discussion:
The point of the experiment was to see if an ecdysterone inhibitor would prevent a manduca caterpillar from reaching pupation, and the extent of the effects of the lack of ecdysterone in the caterpillar’s system would have on it. Experiments had been done in the past on the effects of JH on the caterpillars, so ecdysterone seemed like a new and unusual avenue to take. In theory, according figure 8 in the bio 114 laboratory manual, the inhibition of the ecdysterone would prevent the pupation of the caterpillars and even the molting and base instar changes. The blocking of ecdysterone would do this because the caterpillars need a certain amount of ecdysterone to begin their pupation phase and even prevent their molting. The commitment pulse is a jump of ecdysterone that happens when the JH levels drop in the caterpillar’s body and signal the transfer to the pupation state. 
The lack of the color change in controlls and treatments 1, 2, and 4 means that they did not initate the transference to the pupil stage. This does not mean, however, that they would not have reached the pupation phase. Until we saw their death, the experiment was still ongoing and we cannot truly use these as examples that the experiment was a success or a failure because the experiment was forgone before the demise of the test subjects. 
Two caterpillars pupated, and the ones that actually did pupate though can be used as examples of success or failure. The controll pupation was expected and did not allow us to see any new information, only that the experiment was going as according to plan. The treatment that pupated did show us that the azamax was potentially not preventing the pupation of the treatments. Azamax is a chemical that contains an ecdysterone inhibitor inside it, so in theory it should have aligned with the above outline of what should have happened if an ecdysterone inhibitor was introduced to the animal’s diet. We see from the pupation of the treatment three, as well as the two sample t_test, that the azamax was not significent in the inhibition of ecdysterone. 
The p_values that were obtained from the test are around 45%, 49%, and 6%. All of these are above the 5% significance level that is necessary to say that the treatment was a significent change to the organism and the experiment. The p_value allows us to conclude that azamax was not significent in the alteration of the caterpillars.  The information in figures one two and three allow us to see that the length, weight, and amount of food eaten by the caterpillars are not influenced by the ecdysterone.
There are a few reasons why a known ecdysteron inhibitor allowed the treatment three to reach pupation though. If the commmittment pulse had already been reached, the blocking ecdysterone might not have had an effect on the organism and allowed it to reach pupation anyway. Another reason could have been that not enough azamax was used, so the organism might have still been able to uptake ecdysterone. A third option comes from a study done by Gilbert states “Manduca sexta in the presence of azadirachtin [the active ingredient in AzaMax] and PTTH will produce and release normal levels of ecdysone" (Gilbert, 2010, p.193). If the manduca caterpillar were to release and uptake normal levels of ecdysone, then the caterpillar would still reach pupation and achieve a full life span. This could also have been a factor in why AzaMax did not show the projected results.
