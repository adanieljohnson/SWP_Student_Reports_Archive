Title: Changing Amounts of Light Has No Effect on the Root to Shoot Length Ratio of Pisum sativum

Abstract:
Sustainable farming practices have been advocated for within the United States in recent years in an effort to mitigate the spread of pollutants throughout the natural world, especially those found in plant fertilizer. However, if agriculturalists are expected to forego this form of crop nourishment, they must have a thorough understanding of the needs of the crops in order to ensure their own economic security. To test the impact of an abiotic factor on the growth of a plant, an experiment was performed in which Pisum sativum plants were grown in both shaded and light environments, then the average root to shoot length ratio was found. It was hypothesized that Pisum sativum plants treated with lower sunlight levels will have a lower average root-to-shoot length ratio than that of the Pisum sativum plants exposed to normal sunlight levels. When a paired t-test was performed on the results, the p-value was 0.224 with an alpha value of 0.05. Through this, it was determined that there was not a significant difference between the two treatments. 


Introduction:
A major industry within the U.S. economy is agriculture, the cultivation of different crops to be harvested for food. In different environments, there are varying amounts of resources available to different species of plants. The availability of nutrients, water, and sunlight may influence where plants tend to allocate their own resources for growth. Photosynthesis is a chemical process that requires carbon, water, and sunlight and generates sugar, used within the plant for growth, and oxygen. The plant requires adequate amounts of glucose to grow, and it requires sunlight to acquire it through the photosynthetic process. When sunlight is scarce, it limits the amount of glucose that is produced and, thus, limits plant growth. Through channeling its own resources to where scarce compounds are limiting chemical processes, a plant maximizes growth and surface area in this location and thus, maximizes the amount of the limiting resource it is able to obtain and make use of [Thornley: 1972]. The abiotic factor of the amount of sunlight can cause plants to prioritize resources to its shoots in order to obtain an adequate amount sunlight to carry out photosynthesis and obtain glucose for growth, as less photosynthesis is occurring in its leaves in shaded conditions [Ericcson: 1995]. The plant Pisum sativum was chosen as the sample organism due to its rapid speed of growth and the relatively low maintenance nature of the plant. It can be hypothesized that Pisum sativum plants treated with lower sunlight levels will have a lower average root-to-shoot length ratio than that of the Pisum sativum plants exposed to normal sunlight levels. 


Materials and Methods:
Around 100 seeds of the Pisum sativum plant were gathered. They were then soaked in a beaker with water. In 6 different planters, soil was added. Then the soaked seeds were divided up equally and buried into the soil of each planter. Half of the planters were placed in the greenhouse. A dark colored cloth was draped over a 3-pronged pole placed in the shaded half of the planters and this half was then placed in the greenhouse. Each treatment was watered every other day for three weeks. The plants were then removed and their max root length and max shoot length for each replicate of each treatment were measured. The root to shoot length ratio was then calculated using the maximum measurements of each replicate. The mean root to shoot length ratio for each treatment was then found. The standard deviation of the average root to shoot length ratio for each treatment was then calculated. A two sample t-test was used to analyze the means with an alpha value of 0.05. 


Results:
The average root to shoot length ratio was lower in the plants in the shaded treatment than it was in the plants in the dark treatment. The average root to shoot length ratio in the light treatment was 0.776 (Figure 1). The average root to shoot length ratio in the shade treatment was 0.637 (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the light treatment was 0.140, while the standard deviation for the light treatment was 0.094 (Figure 1). The p-value was 0.224 with an alpha value of 0.05. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that Pisum sativum plants treated with low sunlight levels would have lower average root to shoot length ratios than the average root to shoot length ratio of Pisum sativum plants treated with normal sunlight levels was not supported by the findings of the experiment, as there was not a significant difference between the treatment groups. The lack of a significant difference between the dark and light treatments implies that this abiotic factor has no impact upon the resource allocation of this species, or that the difference in the amount of light between the treatments was not extreme enough. Ericsson came to this conclusion as well in his 1995 study of Betula pendula plants, in which he found that moderate shading had no effect on allocation, and thus on root:shoot ratio, except in near darkness [Ericsson: 1995]. Greatly varying light levels to more extreme degrees than were exhibited in this experiment seems to be a promising area for future study, as the exact amount of light required to induce allocation differences within a plant species could be determined. A study of annual plants discussed root:shoot ratios in low light conditions, finding that in accordance to the optimal partitioning theory, allocation to leaves increased in drastic low light conditions [McConnaughay: 1999]. The optimal partitioning theory states that plants allocate resources in response to environmental factors to acquire nutrients in order to maximize plant growth rate [McConnaughay: 1999]. Although the data of the present experiment did not exhibit a significant difference between treatment groups, this theory explains the findings of this experiment. Even due to a moderate lack of light, the Pisum sativum plants studied allocated their resources to their leaves to maximize the products of photosynthesis, like glucose, in order to ultimately maximize overall growth. Despite the lack of a significant difference between treatments in this experiment, these biological principles lead one to hypothesize that more extreme shading differences between future treatment groups would cause a lower root:shoot ratio in shaded plants. This concept deepens our knowledge of the Pisum sativum species and of the behavior of plants in general, as when resources are limited plants allocate in order to maximize the intake of what is scarce. The industry of agriculture can make use of this knowledge, as understanding the challenges of a plant’s environment as well as their needs allows one to prevent abiotic stressors from harming the success of crops.

Figure 1: Graph displaying the average root to shoot length ratios for the light and dark treatments of the Pisum sativum plants. The sunlight treatment had an average Root to Shoot length ratio of 0.776 while the shade treatment had an average Root to Shoot length ratio of 0.637. The error bars represent the standard deviation, which was 0.140 for the light group and 0.094 for the shade group. The p-value was 0.224 with an alpha value of 0.05, and thus there was not a significant difference between the two treatments.
