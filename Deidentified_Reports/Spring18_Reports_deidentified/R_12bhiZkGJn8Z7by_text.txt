Title: Effects of Calcium Channel Activator on Rania pipens

Abstract:
Abstract: In our experiment we observed the effects of Calcium channel activator on the gastrocnemus of a frog leg. Calcium channel activator is expected to open calcium channels more frequently in the leg of the frog which we expect to elongate the contractile period because more action potentials will occur with more calcium channels activated. Carrying out this experiment we found a P value of 0.25 which we found was not significent to the overall results meaning that we had to reject our null hypothesis that If we inject 100 milimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator into the Rania Pipiens, then we will see prolonged contraction because calcium ions are responsible for prolonged action potentials. 


Introduction:
At the neuromuscular junction nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh then binds with its receptor in order to open the sodium gated channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads down the fiber and this stimulates the release of calcium. Calcium causes the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber itself. In a study done by the scientists wanted to test the effects of calcium on frog muscle contraction, they hypothesized and found that, if the activation process in frog ventricle were mediated exclusively by a transsarcolemmal influx of calcium, one might expect the contraction to reach a new steady state in the beat immediately following an increase in the calcium concentration of the Ringer's solution. (Plant, 1988) Similarly in our experiment we plan to test the effects of a calcium activator on the length of contraction time when a calcium activator is injected into the frog’s muscle. If we inject 100 millimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator into the Rania Pipiens, then we will see prolonged contraction because calcium ions are responsible for prolonged action potentials. 


Materials and Method:
We will use three frog legs all from different frogs. Each leg will be used for two trials starting with a controll trial in which we will tie the gastrocnemus of the frog leg perpendicular and connect the probes which will measure the contraction strength and length during the contraction. During the controll trial we will use the force transducer to find the contraction threshold of the legs. Then when all of these trials are complete we will inject 1 milliliter 100 millimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator and wait 60 seconds for the solution to set in. Then we will use the threshold found on the previous controll legs for the experimental legs and test the legs at their corresponding thresholds in order to see if the calcium activator will increase the length of time of the contraction significently. To test this, we will use a paired t_test.

Results:
As shown in figure one the experimental group on average had muscle contractions that lasted 291 milliseconds. The controll group had muscle contractions that lasted on average 355 milliseconds. The p_value found using the paired t_test was 0.013. The t-value found was 8.86 with 2 degrees of freedom. The standard deviations for the two groups are as follows. Experimental 291 ± 19, Control 355 ± 29. 

Discussion:
Overall, our P value 0.013 was significent and was able to support our hypothesis that If we inject 100 millimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator into the Rania Pipiens, then we will see prolonged contraction because calcium ions are responsible for prolonged action potentials. We are able to reject the null hypothesis and accept our alternative hypothesis. It can be seen in figure one the length of contraction time did expand on average by 20 milliseconds, it was significent enough to support our hypothesis. A similar study shows the effects that calcium gated channels have on muscle contraction which ties back with our original experiment. The CaV2 subfamily is primarily responsible for initiation of synaptic transmission at fast synapses. The CaV3 subfamily is important for repetitive firing of action potentials. (Catteral, 5) This reflects on the results of our experiment as well since calcium activator did in fact cause the release of more calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, but did not cause the contraction length to expand significently. This worked in a series of steps. As the Calcium channel activator was injected into the leg the serum stimulates the calcium channels and activates more of them than normally would have been activated. This directly affects the muscle because calcium is needed in the making of action potentials which signal muscle contraction. The action potentials would travel down the neurons more frequently due to the influx in calcium and the abundance on action potentials would cause more abundant contractile periods causing them to seem to lengthen which is what we hypothesized and then experienced in this experiment.
