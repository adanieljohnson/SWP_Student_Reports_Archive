Title: Effect of trifluoperazine on Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis movement towards glucose

Abstract:
Trifluoperazine is a drug commonly used to treat psychotic disorder and anxiety. It functions as a calmodulin antagonist. Calmodulin is an important protein targeted by calcium ions and is involved in actin-myosin interaction in muscle cells. In this experiment, Physarum Polycephalum is used to test the effect of trifluoperazine on their migration towards glucose, since they generate motive force through relaxation and contraction of actin filament. Antagonist (0.167mM) soaked in filter paper was set between the organism and glucose. The distance migrated is measured in straight route towards glucose. The experiment results show trifluoperazine has significantly negative effect on Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behaviour towards glucose. This experiment shows us possible side effect of using trifluoperazine as medication since the model organism, Physarum Polycephalum, shares many similarities in cell signalling pathway with human.

Introduction:
Both unicellular and multicellular organisms need to be responsive to their environment for living. Despite has a much simpler structure, unicellular organisms can detect environmental cue, for example light, temperature, pH and food sources. In multicellular organisms, not only the surrounding environment is detected, the body environment of the organism also influences cell activities greatly. A signal is sent out from cell to cell in order to cooperate their function and behaviors. Cell signalling not only serves important role on cell differentiation, growth, division and death, but also influences organisms' behaviour and physiology as a whole. Signal molecules are produced by signalling cells and transmitted to target cells. There are four methods of extracellular signalling: endocrine (hormones used, travelled through circulatory system), paracrine, synaptic and contact dependent. Receptors are proteins on or inside the cell that recognize specific type of signal molecules, only the cells with appropriate receptors can process the signal and trigger further responses. 
	Physarum Polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium organism, that it has multiple nucleus in one plasma membrane. The fact that all nucleus undergo mitosis simultaneously suggests communication/ signaling process between nucleus. Physarum Polycephalum is chosen since it is accessible, inexpensive to keep in lab and easy to observe. Physarum Polycephalum also shares a lot of similarity in cell signaling process with many multicellular organism, even more specifically, with human being. Base on previous study, Physarum Polycephalum achieve mobility by changing "organization of bundles of actin" [Ishikawa, 1991]. It shows different pattern of phototaxis and chemotaxis behavior. Experiments and previous studies, [Carlile, 1970] both indicate a positive chemotaxis of Physarum Polycephalum towards glucose. Physarum Polycephalum exhibits intelligent behaviors. "It changes its shape as it crawls over a plain agar gel and, if food is placed at two different points, it will put out pseudopodia that connect the two food sources. "[Nakagaki, 2001] and also from their study, the Physarum Polycephalum was able to solve a maze, despite they do not have nervous system. Scientists was still not sure about the underlying mechanism of Physarum Polycephalum's intelligent behavior. These features make Physarum Polycephalum a very interesting experimental organism to be tested.
	Different from multicellular organisms, Physarum Polycephalum does not have nerve system or endocrine system. It only transmits signal in paracrine and contact-dependent ways. GPCR is one of the most common type of cell surface receptors. There are three commonly seen trimeric G protein: Gs, Gq, Gi, each targeted at/influence different effector proteins differently. Receptor Tyrosine Kinase is another common type of cell surface receptor. Both of them can activate phospholipase C, which break down a phospholipid molecule from membrane and produce DAG and IP3. IP3 will trigger the release of Ca²⁺ ions from smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions are usually stored in sER or expelled out of the cell, since Ca²⁺ plays an important role in in intracellular signaling, it functions as secondary messenger that will activate proteins like Protein Kinase C and Calmodulin.
	In vertebrates, the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle is regulated through change in Ca²⁺ concentration and binding of Ca++ to calmodulin. It is believed that with the presence of Calcium ions, calmodulin bind to caldesmon (a calmodulin-binding protein). Binding of calmodulin prevents caldesmon from binding with actin. Caldesmon has a function of bundling actin filament, thus the presence of Ca++ lead to the relaxation, while without Ca++ present, calmodulin will not be able to bind caldesmon, thus enable caldesmon to bind with actin filament and organize them into bundles, smooth muscle contract. A protein, 210kDa, with similar function to caldesmon was purified [Ishikawa, 1991] from Physarum Polycephalum. In this experiment, Ca²⁺ and calmodulin bind to 210kDa, which results on actin filament disappear, which suggests relaxation; while Ca²⁺ level drops, bundle is visible. According to Ishigami's study in 1986, the disappearance and reappearance of actin bundle is related to the contraction and relaxation. The actin filament enables crawling of Physarum Polycephalum by repeating through contraction and relaxation cycle. 
	Trifluoperazine is an antipsychotic that is used to treat psychotic disorder and anxiety. It functions as an antagonist/inhibitor to calmodulin. It has been found in studies [Parajape,1990] to have an inhibitory effect on formation of germ tube. And according to calmodulin's function in Physarum Polycephalum migration, once calmodulin is inhibited, the relaxation and contraction cycle will be affected, since calmodulin will not be able to bind caldesmon, which will decrease or even stop Physarum Polycephalum migration.
	Based on the fact that Physarum Polycephalum shares numerous similarities with human cell signaling pathways, this experiment may indicate possible side effect of Trifluoperazine have on human muscle movement.
	In this experiment, the effect of Trifluoperazine on Physarum Polycephalum food chemotaxis behavior is tested. A major decrease in Physarum Polycephalum movement is expected based on current knowledge we have about model organism. The null hypothesis is Trifluoperazine does not have a significant negative effect towards Physarum Polycephalum's food chemotaxis behavior towards glucose. The independent variables of this experiment are the presence or absence of antagonist (Trifluoperazine), the dependent variable is distance travelled by Physarum Polycephalum. Other variables like temperature, light, humidity and pH level are all controlled.


Materials and Methods:
We used 6 100mm 2% agar water Petri dish, three replicates were tested for each group. Labeled the petri dish with starting times, assay groups and drew two 1cm × 1cm square at the bottom. Sterilize and cool the spatula and forceps every time before use to minimize contamination. Cut out two 1cm*1cm square from all 6 plates and removed it from the dish. Sterilized spatula was used to cut six 1cm × 1cm square slabs from glucose-agar plate. We used sterilized forceps insert the glucose-agar plate media into the 6 empty wells on the plates. Cut 6 pieces of Physarum Polycephalum culture with sterilized spatula at once, to minimize contamination.
 	Cardboard filter papers were cut into six pieces of the same size. For experimental group, we soaked three pieced of filter paper into the 0.167mM of Trifluoperazine used and placed the filter paper in the between the glucose agar and Physarum Polycephalum culture. For control group, we soaked filter paper with distilled water. Tapped the lid of the petri dishes, then wrapped the plates with foil. The plates are all putted into incubator with set temperature, humidity and with no light. Left the samples for 36 hours.
	Distance of migration was measure from the middle of Physarum Polycephalum culture square to the furthest position it had migrated to. The distance Physarum Polycephalum migrated towards glucose is measured in straight-line.
	T-test was carried out between the distance moved by Physarum Polycephalum culture in control and experimental group with a time period of 36hrs to examine if calmodulin antagonist has significant negative effect towards Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis movement towards glucose attractant.



Results:
None of the Physarum Polycephalum passed through the filter paper in experimental group. While one sample in control group did not pass the filter paper. The sample in control group that failed to pass the filter paper was suspected to be an outlier. A modified Thompson Tau test was used to test if sample 2 of control group is an outlier. For a sample size of 3, tau=1.1511, tau × standard deviation=1.826, which is smaller than δ = |1.50- 3.91|= 2.41.  This sample is an outlier. Reject the outlier.

	As shown in Figure 1, distance migrated (/cm) of control group is greater than that of experimental group. Control group average distance of migration =5.12 (with standard deviation= 0.805), while since all samples of experimental group has reached but failed passed through the filter paper, average distance migrated = 1.50 (standard deviation= 0).

	To test for significant negative effect of Trifluoperazine on by Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior (towards glucose), one tail unpaired t-test was used, since they are different experiment groups and we predicted the effect of Trifluoperazine to be strongly directional. From the t-test carried out, p=0.0231&lt;0.05. P value obtained shows a significant difference between distance migrated by the Physarum Polycephalum with and without the antagonist, Trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine decreased the distance migrated significantly.


Discussion:
In the experiment, we observed Physarum Polycephalum in all samples migrating towards glucose. In control group, the two samples that reaches glucose went around the filter paper: small gaps presented between the edge of the plate and the filter paper, as suggested in Nakagaki's maze experiment, the Physarum Polycephalum was able to find the small gap and went around. The model organisms in experimental group was also intending to go around the filter paper in the same manner, however, none of them succeed. This suggests that their behaviors were possibly inhibited by the presence of antagonist.
	The p-value obtained from one-tail unpaired t-test is smaller than 0.05, null hypothesis rejected. T-test supported the hypothesis: Trifluoperazine lead to significant decrease on Physarum Polycephalum's food chemotaxis behavior towards glucose. It also supports the result from figure 1, which shows a great difference between average distance migrated.
	The outlier rejected from the control group, where the Physarum Polycephalum was not able to pass the filter paper, may be caused by the setting of the experiment apparatus. The filter paper available is too thick than designed in the experiment. Although the two samples that successfully passed through that filter paper barrier shows that the reason why all of the Physarum Polycephalum in experimental group did not pass may still be the presence of antagonist, instead of physically stopped the movement of model organism, the extension of actin filament may still be inhibited chemically by the antagonist. However, the outlier of control group shows that there could be possibilities, the filter paper still has influenced Physarum Polycephalum migration physically.
	To improve this experiment, a Trifluoperazine agar plate would be made. Instead of using a filter paper, which may exert physical resistance to Physarum Polycephalum's movement, a long section (diameter of the plate, a long section of medium cut from one end to the other) of the Trifluoperazine-agar medium will be cut off and inserted in between the Physarum Polycephalum culture and glucose. Also, for further experiments, more replication should be carried out, a sample size of 3 on each assay is very limited. Especially when there is an outlier in the data group. By repeating the sample experiment with higher replicates may increase data reliability.
	In conclusion, Trifluoperazine has a significantly negative effect on Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior. Since Trifluoperazine inhibited model organism's migration by targeting at a highly conserved signalling pathway, Trifluoperazine should not be only influencing Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior, but all kinds of migration behavior of model organism in general.
