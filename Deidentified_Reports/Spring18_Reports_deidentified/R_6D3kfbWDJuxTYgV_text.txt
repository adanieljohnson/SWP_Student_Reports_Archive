Title: The negative and positive effects of mycorrhizal inoculant on Root:Shoot ratio in relation to length and mass, respectively, of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus.

Abstract:
Selective pressures cause organism to make certain trade-offs. The limitation of these resources in the environment impacts the growth pattern of plants, one example of this is resource allocation. The ratio of the biomass of the roots compared to the ratio of the biomass of the shoots, which are the stems and leaves of the plant, can be used as a measure of resource allocation called the R:S (root: shoot) ratio. Our hypothesis was that the R:S ratio of the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would be lower compared to the controll radish plants, since the inoculant would work symbiotically, thus causing resources to be allocated to the shoots. To test this, we planted and grew six different pots of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus radish plants, three of them treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant, the other three forming the controll group. We then measured their R:S ratio in relation to mass and length. Our experiment resulted in somewhat conflicted data, with the R:S ratio in relation to mass, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the controll group, 0.269 +/- 0.0128, is lower than that of the experimental group, 0.288 +/- 0.0378, (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.461) ...

Introduction:
However, R:S ratio in relation to length, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the controll group 1.933 +/- 0.149, is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.004).

Plants have differing patterns of phenotypic variation based on both biotic and abiotic factors. Most intra-specific and inter-specific plant interactions, which are biotic factors, are influenced by the plants ability to obtain essential nutrients. These include sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and soil nutrients. Roots serve as the primary absorptive organ for plants and also anchor the plant to the soil below the ground. Leaves are used mainly as a way to capture sunlight through the chloroplasts for photosynthesis. Stems are the supporting structure of the shoot, which are the above-ground parts of the plant. It is impossible for an organism to extract all the resources available in all conditions. Selective pressures cause organism to make certain trade-offs. The limitation of these resources in the environment considerably impacts the growth pattern of plants, one example of this is resource allocation. The ratio of the biomass of the roots compared to the ratio of the biomass of the shoots, which are the stems and leaves of the plant, can be used as a measure of resource allocation called the R:S (root: shoot) ratio. The length of the roots compared to that of the shoots can also be used to measure the resource allocation of the plant. Increased allocation of resources to the leaves because of plentiful soil nutrients allows the plant to better photosynthesize and grow. If soil water and nutrients in the soil are scarce resources will be allocated to the roots. Mycorrhizal inoculant, which are fungal filaments, form a symbiotic relationship with the plant roots to help them absorb water and nutrients in the soil. They do this by decreasing the distance from the roots to the soil that ion nutrients have to travel and increasing the surface area of the roots, which also facilitates better absorption [Bolan; 1991]. We chose Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus, or radish plants, as our model organism for this experiment because of their quick growth allows us to easily understand the effect of mycorrhizal fungi on their growth and how our results can have an impact on agriculture. In some cases, plants treated with mycorrhizal fungi absorbed twice as much water from the soil compared to plants grown without the fungi [Kothari: 1990]. We wanted to observe the effect of the mycorrhizal inoculant on R:S ratio in relation to mass and length of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus. Our hypothesis was that the R:S ratio of the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would be lower compared to the controll radish plants, since the inoculant would work symbiotically, thus causing resources to be allocated to the shoots.

Materials and Method:
We were assigned six empty plant pots and filled them halfway with vermiculite, making sure to put around the same amount for each one. 50 Ml of Miracle-Gro solution was added to every pot. Then, about six holes were made in the soil for each pot, where a hand.f.ul of radish plant seeds were placed in each one. After that, a teaspoon of mycorrhizal inoculant was put into the holes created in three of the plant pots, forming the experimental group, with the other three being the controll group. And then, another small layer of vermiculite was added over the inoculant of all the pots. The experimental and controll groups were both labelled and put into a tray that was placed inside the greenhouse. There, the plants were all watered at least every other day for two weeks, sometimes every day, depending on the availability of the lab group members. After the two-week period, one group of ten radish plants from a pot were harvested, with every group of ten radish plants counting as one replicate. Each replicate was weighed on a digital scale and the data recorded in a table. Then, the roots and shoots were separated by cutting the root-shoot junction. The roots and shoots of each replicate was then also weighed, and the data recorded in a table. Then, we measured the maximum shoot length and root length of the longest radish plant in each replicate and recorded the values in a table. The R:S ratio in regards to the mass, as well as the lengths, of each replicate was calculated and recorded in the same data table. The mean of the three replicates in each plant pot was calculated, with its standard deviation. This was then repeated for the remaining five plant pots, including the experimental group. A one-tailed unpaired t_test was run to measure the statistical difference between the R:S ratio of the masses and lengths of the controll and experimental groups. Our significance level, or alpha, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, and was set to 0.05.

Results:
When calculating the R:S ratio in relation to mass, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the controll group, 0.269 +/- 0.0128, is lower than that of the experimental group, 0.288 +/- 0.0378, (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.461), thus statistically insignificent (Figure 1). However, when calculating the R:S ratio in relation to length, the trend observed was that the R:S ratio of the controll group 1.933 +/- 0.149, is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.004), and thus statistically significent. While the R:S ratios in relation to length of all three replicates of the controll plants were higher than that of the experimental plants, one replicate of the experimental group had a R:S ratio, 0.246, that was lower than all of the R:S ratios of the controll group, which were 0.258, 0.266, 0.266 (Figure 2).

Discussion:
Our data on the R:S ratio of radish plants grown with mycorrhizal inoculant and those grown without it somewhat supported our hypothesis that the radish plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant would have a lower R:S ratio compared to the controll radish plants. The R:S ratio, in relation to mass, of the controll group averaged out to be 0.269 +/- 0.0128, compared to the 0.288 +/- 0.0378 of the experimental group (Figure 1), (T-value = 0.814, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.461). This data doesn’t support our hypothesis because a higher R:S ratio in the experimental group means that the biomass of the roots was higher than that of the of the shoots in the experimental group. However, the high p_value allows us to dismiss these results as insignificent. If we look at the mass data, the plants treated with the mycorrhizal inoculant had heavier roots on average (Figure 1). So, we can assume that they allocated their resources to their roots, instead of the shoots. Some studies have shown that the symbiotic relationship created by the mycorrhizal fungi contributed to an increase in the biomass of roots (Olesniewicz, 1998). However,  this relationship was supposed to help with better nutrient and water absorption in the soil. This means that resources could be allocated to the shoots to grow and better photosynthesize, instead of the roots. This trend, however, was observed when we look at the R:S ratio in relation to the length. The R:S ratio of the controll group 1.933 +/- 0.149 is higher than that of the experimental group, 1.417 +/- 0.0242, (T-value = 6.05, degree of freedom (d.f.) = 4, p_value = 0.004). These two sets of data may seem contradictory, but only the R:S ratio in relation to length was significent, p_value = 0.004, while R:S ratio in relation to mass was insignificent, p_value = 0.461.  More studies should be done to reach a better conclusion on the effect of mycorrhizal inoculant on plant growth. The inoculant added should have caused a negligible increase in the mass of the roots, meaning it wouldn’t have affected the R:S ratio in relation to mass. However, how negligible this increase in mass was is unknown, and could have caused an effect, since the roots already were fairly light. Future experiments could have more accurate and more precise measurements in the amount of mycorrhizal inoculant used for each plant and more scheduled watering time, which may have had an effect on the plant growth, along with soil conditions [Kim: 2017].
