Title: Impact of tetraethyl ammonium chloride blocker on the action potentials of the Rana pipiens leg

Abstract:
The Rana pipiens, also known as the northern leopard frog, is native to Canada and the United States. Our control group was injected with a frog Ringer’s solution. Our experimental group was injected with a potassium blocker called tetraethyl ammonium chloride. Our independent variable was the frog leg not treated with blocker. Our dependent variable was the number of twitches per leg. We used a paired t-test to find the statistically differences in our data. Our P-value was greater than 0.05; therefore, it was not significant. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis is if the Rana pipiens leg is treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. A trend we noticed was that the legs treated with the potassium blocker had three to five action potentials throughout the course of our experiment.

Introduction:
In frog legs, nerve impulses arriving at neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, which opens sodium channels that generate an action potential. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber which stimulates the release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. (Johnson, 2018) Pressure effects on the Ca2+ currents were studied in the Rana pipiens peripheral motor nerves. Pressure effects were stimulated by using ionic currents, Ca2+ currents, and K+ currents at the node and the axon terminal. The K+ current was reduced by withdrawing the recording electrode. (Aviner et al, 2013) Other experiments have been made by determining what other stimuli can generate action potentials in the Rana pipiens leg, such as laser stimulation with infrared heat. Laser-stimulated action potentials in the sciatic nerve of the Rana pipiens are made using two infrared lasers have be measured. (Jindra et al, 2010) Ionic currents in immature, ovulated Rana pipiens oocytes were studied using a voltage-clamp technique. The K+ current was only present in the youngest oocytes. The K+ current reversed the resting potential and produced an after hyperpolarization at the end of each action potential. (Schlichter, 1989) Our hypothesis is if the Rana pipiens leg is treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg.

Materials and Methods:
We examined the effects of the potassium blocker on the Rana pipiens leg. The potassium blocker we used is called tetraethyl ammonium chloride. We looked for twitches caused by action potentials. One leg is the control group injected with frog Ringer’s solution. One leg is the experimental group which is the leg injected 100 millimolar of with tetraethyl ammonium chloride. The statistical test we used is a pair t-test. We used amplitude to measure the action potentials of each leg as a control group and as a experimental group by using increments of voltage of 0.3 amps, 0.4 amps, 0.5 amps, 1 amps and 2 amps. We also measured the relaxation period of each action potential.

Results:
A trend in the intensity of the action potentials of the Rana pipiens leg that were blocked by the tetraethyl ammonium chloride blocker was that the intensity of the experimental group for leg one and leg three were higher than the intensity of the control group got leg one and leg three. This is inversely related to leg two in which the action potentials were less intense in the experimental group than in the control group. The length of relaxation periods in the Gastrocnemius muscle in the Rana pipiens leg controls the amount and the intensity of the action potentials per leg. The mean in regard to relaxation period of the control group was statistically different than the mean in regards to relaxation of the experimental group (t-stat=1.184, df=14, P-value=0.256). There is not a significant difference between the control and experimental groups for relaxation period because our calculated P-value is greater than 0.05.

Discussion:
There was no significant difference in the control groups and experimental groups because our P-values for amplitude were so high. The p-value was 0.256. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis which was if the Rana pipiens leg was treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. The legs treated with the potassium blocker had three to five action potentials throughout the course of our experiment. Experimental leg one and experimental leg three had five action potentials that we were able to measure. Experimental leg two had three action potentials that we were able to measure.  Another way to block potassium in Rana pipiens leg is to use pressure effects by stimulating potassium currents at the node and axon terminal (Aviner et al., 2013). This blocks potassium in the brain of the Rana pipiens which would block potassium directly in the Gastrocnemius muscle of the leg. I recommend that if the experiment was repeated to study more Rana pipiens legs to get more raw data to enhance our results.

Figure 1. The relaxation periods of the control groups and experimental groups of Rana pipiens legs. The control groups had longer relaxation periods than the experimental groups. Three adult legs were put in each group. The control group was soaked in frog Ringer’s solution. The experimental group was injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride, which is a potassium blocker.
