Title: The effect of structure on male Betta splendens agonistic behaviors 

Abstract:
Betta splendens display agonistic behaviors towards one another by spreading fins and attacking. The purpose of this experiment was to study how male Betta fish react to one another with the presence of structure. We hypothesized that the presence of structure would cause the male Betta fish to be more aggressive towards one another because they will want to control the structure. The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the agonistic behavior with no shelter and the agonistic behavior with shelter. Therefore it cannot be concluded that the presence of structure affects agonistic behaviors of male Betta fish by making them more aggressive. This newly found knowledge will be helpful in allowing scientists to better understand the behavior of Betta splendens as well as other species of fish.

Introduction:
Aggression is one of the key aspects of a fish's behavior because it allows the fish to assert dominance over other fish of the same species and enables the fish to have a better chance of survival in the cases of being able to eat and have shelter.  Aggression is defined as including the manifestations of aggression and submissiveness by individuals in conflict situations and is a universal form of behavior found in animals of different species [Kudryavtesa, N.: 1998]. Male Betta splendens are one of the most aggressive fish species alive and have an extraordinary way of displaying agonistic behaviors. Male Betta fish use these behaviors to impress females and control territory. In this experiment, we will examine how the presence of shelter affects males' agonistic behaviors toward one another.
	The proposed question is whether male Betta fish become more aggressive toward each other in the presence of shelter. We hypothesized that when there is structure present, the male Bettas will become more aggressive in order to control the shelter for their own interests. The results will help scientists better understand how species react to shelter and will give a better understanding of how important it is to species to have a shelter available to them when there are competitors around.


Materials and Methods:
 The experiment was conducted by placing two male Betta fish in a tank with a glass divider in between them so that they could not physically attack each other. Then their behavior was observed for five minutes, recording how long they were aggressive for with a stopwatch. The determining factors for aggression were fin flaring, gill flaring, broadside movements, and facial movements, along with tail flapping. Then the fish rested for five minutes, and this was achieved by putting an opaque piece as the divider so they could not see each other. After they rested for five minutes, the opaque divider was removed, and the glass divider was placed as a separation. Then two structures were put in, one with each Betta, and the fish's aggression was timed using the same standards as previously used. Then the two Bettas were swapped for two new males and the process was repeated with five minutes of no structure, five minutes of rest, and five minutes with structure. Then the Bettas were changed once more, and the process was repeated one more time. The data collection was the timed aggression out of five minutes. Then the time of aggression was divided by the total time of five minutes and the average was taken of the three trials with shelter and without shelter. Finally, a paired t test was run with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
The graph of the average aggression times is seen below (Figure 1). The trend shows that there is more aggression in male Betta fish's behavior when there is a shelter present compared to there being no shelter present (Figure 1, Table1). The mean and standard deviation for aggression time ratio in the presence with no shelter was 0.418+/-0.40. The mean and standard deviation for aggression ratio with shelter was 0.458+/-0.35. The paired t test results were p=0.691, df=5, t=0.422. 

Discussion:
We hypothesized that in the presence of structure, the male Betta fish's agonistic behaviors would increase in comparison to the males' aggression in the presence of no shelter. The reasoning was that the male Betta fish would fight to control the shelters so that one male would have control of the shelters, and the other male would have no control of shelters. This hypothesis was based on other similar studies, which showed statistically significant results. Male Siamese fighting fish alter their behavior based on both external cues, the sex of the audience, and internal cues, reproductive state and resource possession [Dziewecynski, Teresa: 2005]. The results to our experiment were not significantly different, however, not allowing us to conclude that male Betta fish agonistic behavior increases in the presence of structure. 
	Some biological explanations for why the data were not significantly different are that two of the Betta fish appeared to be ill with a lack of nutrition. One of the Bettas did not even become aggressive in the presence of another male Betta, which is very odd. Some other biological factors were that the Betta fish were in a continuously stressed environment which caused them to be afraid and act abnormally, resulting in a flaw in the data results. The progression of appearance of symptoms under intensifying stress levels may be interrupted temporarily as homeostasis and homeorhetic mechanisms intercede. Inability to cope leads to further dysfunctions [Rapport, D.: 1985]. The most significant effect was the outlier Betta that did not become aggressive, causing the average aggression ratio to decrease drastically. Also, our standard deviations were very large because of the inconsistencies of the Betta fish's different abnormal behaviors. In conclusion, this and other experiments will help provide scientists with new information that will help them better understand how organisms respond to their environment.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: Means and Standard Deviations of Aggression ratio. When a structure is present, male agonistic behavior ratio is increased in comparison to when there is no structure present.

Figure 1: Effect of structure on male Betta agonistic behavior. The ratio of aggression is slightly greater in the presence of structure in male Betta fish. The error bars represent the standard deviation, and they are so large because some of the Betta fish acted abnormally, causing a wide range of different results, which may have altered the data.
