Title: Photosynthetic Activity of Spinach in the Visible Light Spectrum

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is used by plants to harness light energy and ultimately form sugars. Within the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts is Photosystem II, which excites electrons using light - driving reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The Hills assay utilizes this reduction with DCPIP, a blue dye which turns colorless when reduced, allowing photosynthetic activity to be quantified. We sought to determine the ideal wavelength for spinach photosynthesis, and hypothesized that blue light would yield the most photosynthetic activity. The experiment tested 4 groups: negative control (dark), positive control (light), red wavelength and blue wavelength.  The results showed little to no % change in absorbance values, and, showed almost no statistical significance from the negative control. With the results showing a lack of photosynthetic activity in all groups, we concluded that the chloroplasts, if there were any, were dysfunctional. Upon further review, considering that the positive control was mostly unable to achieve statistical significance, we determined that errors must have been made in the chloroplast extraction procedure. Therefore, in future experiments, it is recommended that the method of extracting chloroplasts is revised and refined to prevent such results from occurring.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a crucial physiological processes used by plants to convert light energy into usable energy. The light dependent and independent reactions, housed within chloroplasts, ultimately create sugars from the splitting of water, harnessing of electron energy, and reduction of carbon dioxide.  For this experiment, we will only be looking at the role of Photosystem II in the light dependent reaction. Photosystem II is the primary mechanistic photoreceptor within chloroplasts, and is most relevant to our topic of study. Light excites electrons in the array of Photosystem II, and the special pair passes the electrons to electron carriers. The movement of electrons through the thylakoid membrane powers cytochrome b6f proton pumps, maintaining a H+ gradient [Alberts: 2015]. The specific purpose of the light dependent reaction is to form NADPH from NADP. The electron energy of NADPH drives the calvin cycle of the light independent reaction. The functional role of NADPH is important for this lab because the Hill reagent, 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), is used to measure the photosynthetic activity of the extracted chloroplasts [Stiban: 2015]. DCPIP is a dye with a high affinity for electrons. Originally blue, it turns colorless when it is reduced in the place of NADH+. Therefore, by measuring the absorbance of the DCPIP solution over time while exposed to light, we can predict corresponding photosynthetic activity.   Photosystem II contains the pigments chlorophyll A and B, which both have peak absorbances in blue light [Muneer: 2014][Lederer: 2007]. Spinach (Spinacia oleracea) is an ideal model organism for studying photosynthetic activity because of its accessibility. The purpose of our experiment was to determine if extracted chloroplasts from Spinach are most photosynthetically active at blue wavelengths. Muneer performed a very similar experiment testing for Photosynthetic activity with colored Light Emitting Diodes, and blue LEDs had the most significant result [Muneer: 2014]. We hypothesized that the chloroplasts would be most active under blue light, because the literature suggests that blue wavelengths yield the most absorbance and consequent activity.

Materials and Methods:
The specimen used in our experiment was store bought refrigerated spinach. We prepared the spinach for use by peeling 5 leaves from their respective stems, tearing them up, and grinding them in a mortar and pestle with approximately 20mL of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8). We extracted chloroplasts from the spinach leaves with a centrifuge. We added the raw spinach mixture to a centrifuge tube, and spun it at these settings:  200xG/3 minutes/4*C (RT-7 centrifuge). We then poured the supernatant into a second chilled tube, and centrifuged this tube at 1000xG/10min/4*C (RT-7 centrifuge). Discarding the supernatant, we added 20mL of the grinding buffer to this second tube and suspended the pellet. We performed an adapted Hill assay process to test for photosynthetic activity in our specimens. We had a blank solution with 8mL water and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5) to blank the Genesys spectrophotometer. The negative control (dark), positive control (white light), red experimental (red light), and blue experimental all had 6mL of water, 2mL of reaction buffer and 2mL of 130mM DCPIP. The negative control would remain in a dark cabinet for the duration of the experiment. The positive control was placed in a cabinet with a standard white LED bulb. The red and blue wavelength groups were also placed in cabinets with the standard white LED bulb, however, respective colored cellophane wrap was placed over the bulb. After blanking the spectrophotometer at 600nm (since DCPIP is blue), we recorded the initial absorbance readings for each group, and did so every 10 minutes for 50 minutes. After the 50 minute interval, continued  with the chloroplasts outside of the cabinets and in the light of the room to test for chloroplast viability. We converted the absorbance readings at each interval to percent change, allowing us to perform statistical tests on a specific value. The formula used for % change was (Abs (time x) - Abs (time 0))/(Abs time 0)*100. Using Excel, we performed a t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances was used to test for statistical significance. Our critical value was set at 0.05, and we tested for significance in %absorbance change from the negative control.

Results:
The % change and standard deviation for the negative control/dark group after 50 minutes were both low as expected (x=2.29%, sd=0.36). The white group at 30 minutes was the only group in the entire experiment that achieved statistical significance from the dark group. White was no longer statistically significant in the 40 and 50 minute intervals. Although the blue group had the greatest average % change, it is not statistically significant because its standard deviation was too large (sd=16.23). After removing each group from their cabinet and placing them in the light of the room, % change did not significantly increase.
We performed statistical tests, but the one at the 30 minute interval is the only one which yielded a significant p value. Using excel, we performed a t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Equal Variances (critical value=0.05) 
White: T(4)=(t Stat=5.397,p=0.00285) - significant  p&lt;0.05,
Red: T(4)=(t Stat=0.0566,p=0.479) - insignificant p&gt;0.05,
Blue: T(4)=(t Stat=0.880,p=0.214 - insignificant p &gt;0.05.


Discussion:
The data suggests that the harvested chloroplasts of spinach do not exhibit more photosynthetic activity in light than in the dark. If the chloroplasts had been functional, DCPIP would have been reduced at the thylakoid membrane, and turned colorless resulting in lower absorbance readings. This was not the case in our experiment, as evident by the insignificant results of the 50 minute and outside intervals. Therefore, based on these results we have to reject our hypothesis. Since the scientific community has amassed enough data to confirm light’s role in photosynthesis [Johnson: 2016] [Alberts: 2015], we can reasonably conclude that there was an error in our procedure that resulted in a lack of photosynthetic activity.   Our results do not concur with the findings of past experiments. Other experiments testing for similar purposes found statistical significance in at least the positive control [Vogelmann: 2002][Muneer: 2014][Lederer: 2007]. Considering that our experiment did not have statistical significance with the positive control, we can conclude that the error lies in either our extraction of chloroplasts, or light source. We used a suspended B pellet solution as our source of chloroplasts. Since we performed a baseline experiment with the same chloroplast extraction procedure and successful results, it is reasonable to assume that we made an error somewhere between grinding the leaves, centrifuging, and filtering. Other sources of error include the age and batch of spinach leaves used, the variance of chloroplast concentration by sample, and human errors. We saw evidence of varied chloroplast concentration in the blue group, within which were greatly differing percent changes (~0-~19%). Human errors were most evident in our chloroplast extraction. Upon the filtering of the ground spinach, we lost some solution into the ice bath due to the curvature of the pestle. We then had to dilute the solution with more grinding buffer to reach at least 20mL of solution. By doing so, we lost a large amount of usable chloroplasts, which could have contributed to the low photosynthetic activity. Human error could also have extended to the centrifuging process, for example, we could have entered the wrong settings, in the centrifuge, like temperature, cooking the chloroplasts and rendering the process useless.  In future experiments, it is recommended that this procedure be revisited and thoroughly vetted for mistakes and inconsistencies i.e. specifically ensuring the proper extraction and function of the chloroplasts used. The light source should also be altered. LED bulbs, like in Muneer’s experiment ought to be used to insure that an adequate light source reaches the chloroplast solutions [Muneer: 2014]. If our experiment is successful in future trials, we would further explore and expand upon the ideal conditions for spinach growth.  Additionally, we could alter other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and soil nitrogen composition [Smolders: 1993], grow different batches of spinach in said conditions, and measure their photosynthetic activity. The search for ideal growing conditions reaches beyond the mechanistic function of photosystem II, and other physiological processes should be studied as well. Aside from photosynthetic activity, we could test for overall viability, nutritional composition and physical growth. This could potentially be beneficial for the agricultural industry, increasing the quality and quantity of spinach crop. In conclusion, it is pointless to connect our experiment to the scientific community because the data is clearly an outlier as a whole. In the planning stages, we had hoped that this experiment would reinforce the findings in other experiments [Muneer: 2014][Lederer: 2007], which concluded that spinach growth is optimized in blue lighting. However, our experiment is clearly corrupted, and needs to be revisited and redesigned accordingly.
