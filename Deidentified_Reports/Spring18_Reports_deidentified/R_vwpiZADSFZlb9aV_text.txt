Title: Effects of Low pH on the Oxygen Consumption of Crayfish

Abstract:
Crayfish, also known as Parastacoidea, like many other organism utilize oxygen in the process of glycolysis. In our experiment, we hypothesized that a lower pH would decrease the metabolic rates of the crayfish. According to the results of our experiment, we had a trend that the treatment groups all had a lower metabolic rate than the control, in normal oxygenated water. 

Introduction:
In order for an organism to survive, they must utilize glucose and convert that into energy. To measure this, we evaluated the metabolic rate of an organism. The more energy that an organism must use, the higher the metabolic rate will be. In order to calculate this metabolic rate, we will measure the amount of oxygen consumed. (Johnson 2018) In our lab, we will establish that the oxygen consumption of the crayfish is directly related to the metabolic rate of said crayfish. We hypothesized that the crayfish in lower pH would have a lower metabolic rate than the regular control crayfish. This is because the acidic environment crayfish is under stress in a new environment as well as actively consuming more oxygen. The hemoglobin will more readily give up oxygen in a lower pH so oxygen consumption will decrease. 


Materials and Methods:
We first weighed each of our crayfish. Then, we placed one of our three crayfish into a room temperature , oxygenated environment; this acted as our control groups. Then we recorded the O2 every five minutes for twenty minutes. For our pH solution, we measured with a lower pH than the water; this acted as our treatment groups. Then we placed the same crayfish in the pH-diluted water and recorded the O2 every five minutes for twenty minutes. We then repeated this process with all three of our crayfish; first in control, then as a treatment. Finally, we calculated the metabolic rate of the control and the treatment organisms to compare the differences in O2 consumption. 

Results:
Our results showed that there was a decreased in metabolic rate when the crayfish were placed in lower pH environments. The trend of our results showed that the treatment groups had significantly decreased in their metabolic rates in comparison with the control.

Discussion:
In order to go through the Krebs cycle, organisms need phosphofructokinase, an enzyme, to make pyruvate. With a lower pH, the enzyme is inhibited and at a high pH, the enzyme is stimulated. In a lower pH, the enzyme phosofruckokinese that breaks down glucose to pyruvate is inhibited. This affects glycolysis and the metabolic rate, decreasing it. From the results we obtained, the treatment groups in Figure 1 had much lower metabolic rates than the control This shows that a decrease in pH will result in a decrease in metabolic rate.
