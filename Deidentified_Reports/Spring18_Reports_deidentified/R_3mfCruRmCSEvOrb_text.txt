Title: Increased Amounts of Juvenile Hormone Diminish Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators, which are insecticides that mimic the effects of different hormones in insects, are becoming very popular in the world of agriculture. In order to understand which hormones should be mimicked by insect growth regulators so that crops can be effectively protected, it is important to understand the effects that certain hormones have on insects. The growth and molting of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, are largely controlled by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In order to test the effects of juvenile hormone on growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars we seperated eight caterpillars into two groups, a control group and a treatment group. We gave the treatment group food with an excess of juvenile hormone and the control group food mixed with water. We recorded each caterpillar’s mass and length once a day for eight days in a row. We hypothesized that the average mass and length of the control group would be larger than the average mass and length of the treatment group. Our results showed a statistically significant difference between the masses and lengths of the two groups with the control group being larger than the treatment group, for both of our p values were below the alpha level of .05 (0.04631 and 0.006273).

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators, which are insecticides that mimic the effects of different hormones in insects, are becoming very popular in the world of agriculture. In order to understand which hormones should be mimicked by insect growth regulators so that crops can be effectively protected, it is important to understand the effects that certain hormones have on insects. The growth and molting of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, are largely controlled by juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In order to test the effects of juvenile hormone on growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars we seperated eight caterpillars into two groups, a control group and a treatment group. We gave the treatment group food with an excess of juvenile hormone and the control group food mixed with water. We recorded each caterpillar’s mass and length once a day for eight days in a row. We hypothesized that the average mass and length of the control group would be larger than the average mass and length of the treatment group. Our results showed a statistically significant difference between the masses and lengths of the two groups with the control group being larger than the treatment group, for both of our p values were below the alpha level of .05 (0.04631 and 0.006273). Since the treatment group received a surplus of juvenile hormone, we were able to conclude that juvenile hormone levels and growth have an inverse relationship.
Hormones, which are chemical messengers that are part of the endocrine system, are key to the physiological functions of many life forms. After receiving sensory input from one’s body, the brain processes the information and sends out hormones in order to tell the body how to respond. In insects, hormones have two effects; organizational and activational. Activational effects cause a change in function of something in the body, while organizational effects cause a change in how the body is arranged. Two hormones that are crucial to an insects life cycle are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. It is important to understand how these hormones affect insects, because chemicals known as insect growth regulators mimic these hormones and are used as insecticides. Insect growth regulators cause changing levels of these hormones in insects, which results in adverse health effects. According to Sharma, conventional insecticides are not nearly as effective as insect growth regulators due to the slowness of the insecticidal effects, insect resistance to the insecticides, and environmental concern [Sharma: 2016], so the continued development of insect growth regulators is extremely important to the future of agriculture. Since levels of juvenile hormone control the growth and life cycle of insects, juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists have become the best option for insect pest control [Sharma: 2016], because differing amounts of the hormone can greatly disrupt the lives of insects. For example, if a insect receives a surplus of juvenile hormone, it is possible that it will never undergo metamorphosis and die. Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is a holometabolous insect that has a life cycle of about 39-48 days. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone work together to control the growth and molting of Manduca sexta, so it is perfect to test in order to uncover information about the effects of these hormones on insects. More specifically, juvenile hormone, which is released by the corpus allatum, regulates growth and the type of molt that occurs. Ecdysterone, which is released by the prothoracic glands, controls the timing of molting of the insect. Differing levels of juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are presumed to have an effect on the growth and life cycle of Manduca sexta caterpillars. In order to understand how differing levels of juvenile hormone affect the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars, we decided to separate eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups of four, with each group consuming differing levels of juvenile hormone. The treatment group received additional juvenile hormone in its food, while the control group received no additional juvenile hormone. We hypothesize that there would be a significant difference in mass and length between the two groups of Manduca sexta caterpillars, with the control group having greater lengths and masses than the treatment group.


Materials and Methods:
In order to test how differing levels of juvenile hormone affect the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars we randomly divided eight caterpillars of similar masses and lengths into two groups of four. The first four were selected to be the treatment group, and the last four were selected to be the control group. Each caterpillar in the treatment group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of 1:1250 diluted Precor, which is an insect growth regulator that replicates juvenile hormone. Each caterpillar in the control group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of water. We isolated each caterpillar along with its food in the seperate halves of plastic containers. The caterpillars were stored in a refrigerator for the duration of the experiment. We recorded the mass and length of each caterpillar once a day for eight days. We then used a 2-sample t-test to determine the significance of our results.

Results:
The results of the t-tests for length and mass gave us p values of 0.0063 and 0.046 respectively. Since both P Values are below 0.05, the null hypotheses must be rejected resulting in a statistically significant difference in both length and mass between the treatment and control groups, with the control group being larger. We observed a trend that as amounts of juvenile hormone increased, the mass and length of the caterpillars. While there was a statistically significant difference in the mass of the two groups, the two heaviest caterpillars in the treatment group were slightly heavier than the lightest caterpillar in the control group. Also, caterpillars 1 and 2 had a mass that was much smaller than caterpillars 3 and 4, despite the fact that all four caterpillars were in the treatment group. Caterpillars 1-2 appeared to be barley moving by the end of the experiment, while the rest of the caterpillars appeared healthy (fairly plump, characteristically green, and moving without any trouble). On top of that, caterpillar 2 lost a minuscule amount of weight on the last day, and caterpillars 7 and 8 lost a larger chunk of weight. Despite this, on average the mass of control group caterpillars (3.63 grams with a standard deviation of 0.4241 grams) was much larger than that of the treatment group caterpillars (2.52 grams with a standard deviation of 0.7743 grams). Also, the average change in mass of the control group (2.36 grams with a standard deviation of 0.4166 grams) was much larger than that of the treatment group (1.35 grams with a standard deviation of 0.8848 grams). As previously stated, this led to a p value of 0.046. The difference between the lengths of the treatment and control groups was extremely statistically significant. The shortest control group caterpillar was longer than the longest treatment group caterpillar. The average length in centimeter for the control group (6.25 centimeters with a standard deviation of 0.3536 centimeters) was much longer than the average length for the treatment group (5.01 centimeters with a standard deviation of 0.4871 centimeters). The average change in length of the control group (1.94 centimeters with a standard deviation of 0.7588) was also greater than the average change in length of the treatment group (1.08 centimeters with a standard deviation of 0.3146 centimeters). As previously stated, this led to a p value of 0.0063.


Discussion:
Based on our results, we are able to conclude that the difference in mass and length between the control group (received no additional juvenile hormone) and the treatment group (received 5 drops of Precor each in food) of Manduca sexta caterpillars is statistically significant due to p values of 0.0063 and 0.046 for length and mass respectively. It is evident that level of juvenile hormone and size (length and mass) have an inverse relationship in Manduca sexta caterpillars.This is due to the fact that juvenile hormone, which is released by the corpus allata, limits the growth of insects and keeps them in the larval stage. If juvenile hormone levels are high at the time of molting, then the insect will molt into another instar. While juvenile hormone levels are high, a relatively small percentage of an insect's growth occurs. According to Frederik Nijhout, only about 10% of a Manduca sexta’s body mass is from the first four instar periods, while growth during the last instar period accounts for about 90% of final body mass [Nijhout: 2013]. This is due to the fact that during the first four instar periods juvenile hormone levels remain high, but they begin to taper off towards the end of the fourth instar period. Once juvenile hormone levels decrease, most of the caterpillar’s growth occurs. After this occurs, a small spike in ecdysterone, which is a hormone released by the prothoracic glands, known as the commitment pulse occurs. The commitment pulse lets the insect know that it has enough body mass to undergo metamorphosis and become an adult. If juvenile hormone levels always remain high, than the insect will never grow to the extent that it otherwise would have. Also, although the commitment pulse would still occur, the high levels of juvenile hormone in combination with the commitment pulse would prevent the insect from ever pupating. Since the treatment group was given additional juvenile hormone, it makes sense that the average mass and length of the group were smaller than the average mass and length of the control group. The surplus juvenile hormone made it so that the treatment group was not able to grow to the extent that it otherwise would have. Since juvenile hormone levels were higher than normal, the caterpillars would have not grown to the size that allowed them to undergo metamorphosis quickly enough. Similar experiments have resulted in the same results. For example, in an experiment conducted by Christen Mirth in which the effects of juvenile hormone on growth of insects such as Drosophila and Manduca sexta, the results showed that juvenile hormone does infact regulate growth rates. It was found that in regards to Manduca sexta specifically JH acts to regulate the growth of the imaginal discs [Mirth: 2014]. As a result, when exposed to increasing levels of juvenile hormone, the insect experiences less growth in a given period of time than an insect that is not exposed to increasing levels of juvenile hormone. According to Mirth, insects that are exposed to more juvenile hormone are smaller due to a reduced growth rate [Mirth: 2014]. The next logical step for this study would be to expand the sample size and experiment with multiple levels of added juvenile hormone rather than just one level. Doing this could help us achieve a better understanding of how many different levels of juvenile hormone affect insect growth. Another important step to take in a future study would be to make sure that none of the caterpillars run out of food, for two of ours did. These two caterpillars experienced some weight loss on the last day, and this weight loss could be attributed to the caterpillars running out of food. Finally, it would be important to make sure the Precor is mixed into the food evenly. If it is not, the results of the experiment could be affected, because some caterpillars will unintentionally receive slightly more or slightly less juvenile hormone than others. It is possible that this happened in our experiment, for caterpillars 1 and 2 were smaller than caterpillars 3 and 4 by a good margin despite the fact that all caterpillars were supposed to receive the same amount of juvenile hormone. If that was true, than the caterpillars that received slightly more Precor would have been the ones that were smaller than the ones that recieved slightly less Precor. As stated in the introduction, the information gathered from this experiment is important because insect growth regulators are used as insecticides in order to benefit agriculture. Insect growth regulators are chemicals that mimic hormones in insects, so understanding the effects that different hormones have on insects is crucial to selecting which insect growth regulators would be most effective. Agriculture is crucial to society as a whole, so it is extremely important that we have a thorough understanding of how certain hormones affect insects.
