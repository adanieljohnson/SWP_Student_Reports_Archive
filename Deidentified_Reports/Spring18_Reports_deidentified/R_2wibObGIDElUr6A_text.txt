Title: Effect of Calcium Channel Activator (A23187) on a Frog Leg

Abstract:
We conducted nerve stimulation tests to determine the effect of A23187 calcium channel activator , on the timing of a muscle contraction. We performed these tests on the sciatic nerve of Rana Pipiens frog legs. Theoretically, the calcium should prolong the muscle contractions. Although we observed a difference in the thresholds with and without the activator, after conducting a two-sample t-test, these differences were not significant (p=0.204). We, therefore, cannot say that the activator had any effect on the muscle contraction prolongation for Rana Pipens frog legs.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle in vertebrates consists of thousands of myofibers which are multinucleated, cylindrical cells. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the gray matter if the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons branch out to innervate several myofibers, at locations called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses that arrive at the neuromuscular junction cause release of ACh from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber that opens sodium channels, which generates an action potential in the muscle fiber. This action potential stimulates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of calcium causes the muscle fiber to shorten. We hypothesize that if we inject 100 millimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator into the Rana pipiens, then we will see prolonged contraction because calcium ions are responsible for prolonged action potentials. In order to test our hypothesis, we plan to inject 100 millimolar of A23187 calcium channel activator into the frog leg and compare the amount of time of the contraction to the amount of time of the contraction in the control (that has no injected activator). In the past, others have done similar experiments where they test concepts such as muscle contraction time and strength on frog legs. For example, Joseph Keithley wrote in his book, The Story of Electrical and Magnetic Measurements:  from 500 B.C. to the 1940s, “we use a function transformation that leaves volume unchanged as the basis for geometric model of muscle contraction. The model is built after making an experiment on a frog leg muscle under single electrical stimulus” in order to explain a larger picture of electricity. 




Materials and Methods:
We were given three Rana Pipiens frog legs to start. One each one, we removed the skin to
expose the tissue, and spread the upper thigh tissue to see the sciatic nerve. Throughout the
procedure, we made sure to apply Ringer solution to keep the leg, especially the nerve, moist and
alive. Next, we detached the Gastrocnemius muscle from the Achilles tendon, tied a string
around the end of the muscle, and hung it perpendicular to the pan with slight tension. This made
it easier to identify any visible muscle contractions. On the first frog leg, we did not inject any
Calcium channel activator to begin with. We began at an amplitude of 0.0V, increasing the amplitude by different increments to find the exact threshold and the corresponding voltage. We repeated this process three times on this leg and recorded the average threshold amplitude. After this, we added a total of 0.1 mL of 100  mMol calcium channel activator. We repeated the threshold testing process on the leg to observe the effects of calcium on the prolonged time it took to twitch. In between each trial, we waited one minute to let the muscle rest. On the second frog leg, we applied calcium channel activator immediately in the same way as the previous leg. We recorded the threshold three times once again. After recording all the thresholds, we conducted a two-sample t-test to analyze our results.


Results:
When comparing the average threshold amplitudes of the control and treatment frogs as seen
in Figure 4, the legs with calcium channel activator had a higher average threshold. Frog 3 had a higher average threshold, while the difference between the control and treatment for
Frog 1 was much smaller.We conducted a two-sample t-test to determine if the prolonged time was significant. The p value for this test was 0.204, meaning the difference was not statistically significant.


Discussion:
When comparing the control and treatment experiments on frog 1, there is a definite increase in the prolonged time of contractions with the calcium channel activator as compared to the control. 
 This increase is more obvious when comparing the control of frog 1 and the treatment of frog 2. However, after conducting a two-sample t-test, we cannot say these differences are statistically significant. Similar results have been found in other studies. For example, in a study conducted on guinea- pigs, Lidocaine was found to have no direct effect on the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Mitchell and Plant 1988). Although we applied calcium for the channel activation, the results of this study support our own, as the release of calcium is the result of sodium channels opening which prolongs contraction. Overall, we cannot say that A23187 had any significant effect on the stimulation of the sciatic nerve in the Rana Pipiens frog leg.
