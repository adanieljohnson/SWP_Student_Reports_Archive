Title: EDTA/SrCl Inhibition of Physarum polycephalum Chemotaxis and Plasmodium Growth

Abstract:
Signaling is important for communication and execution of functions in organisms. The slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, exhibits the advanced behavior of chemotaxis - movement/growth towards a chemical stimulus - regulated by calcium ion coupled pathways, in which calcium enters the cell through surface channels. Ca2+ then stimulates additional calcium release from the smooth ER and propagates actin microfilament assembly/myosin contraction. So we hypothesized that the presence of excess calcium ion would increase or speed up chemotaxis because of its use in contractile movement/filament assembly, while SrCl and EDTA in the extracellular environment would inhibit the normal chemotaxis of P. polycephalum due to calcium channel blocking. The experiment tested 3 groups, a control, Ca2+, and EDTA/SrCl enriched agar. Growth was measured after a 15 and 24 hour incubation intervals.  After 24 hours, we saw consistent growth in the control group, averaging 38 mm. The EDTA/SrCl group was completely inhibited, having 0 mm of growth with statistical significance from the control group. From our data, we concluded that a solution of EDTA/SrCl effectively inhibits the chemotaxis growth of P. polycephalum, while excess calcium has no apparent effect.

Introduction:
Signaling plays an important role in the communication and execution of functions in organisms. Signals can vary in form as electrical currents, or as molecule/receptor interactions. Signals can also vary in pathway - traveling long distances to other cells/organisms, to nearby cells, or within a single cell. However, what most signals have in common is the propagation of intracellular mechanisms directly leading to changes in gene expression, movement, division, and many other responses. Most signaling pathways are arranged by the type of receptor, mechanism and secondary messengers involved. In the ion-coupled Ca2+-activated signaling pathway, calcium ion enters the cell through surface channels, enacting ryanodine receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. The resulting conformational change of this receptor releases additional calcium ion into the cytoplasm, where it activates actin assembly and myosin filament contraction [Johnson: 2016]. 
While signaling tends to be more simplistic in unicellular organisms, the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum is used as a model organism to study these pathways. Most of its functions are regulated by either G-protein coupled receptors or ion-coupled receptors. This organism is a multinucleate synctium (containing multiple nuclei within a single plasma membrane) [Johnson: 2016], consequently allowing a more complex network of intracellular signaling. Chemotaxis - movement/growth towards a chemical stimulus - is one of several advanced behaviors exhibited by P. polycephalum, and is the area of focus in this experiment. Upon detection of a desirable chemical in the surrounding environment, P. polycephalum’s leading edge, plasmodium, will actively move towards the stimulus using actin microfilament assembly and myosin contraction. A key fact is that the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ is kept very low, so any sudden change in concentration has significant intracellular effects. Calcium surface channels are also a factor of maintaining homeostasis, and controlling intracellular concentration.The signaling pathway known to activate and regulate these proceses are likely the ion-coupled Ca2+ pathways described above. EDTA/SrCl are known inhibitors of the surface channels of this pathway, as evident in other experiments such as Ridgeway’s study of intracellular calcium ion fluctuations [Ridgeway: 1976], and Olenhusen’s reference to EDTA/SrCl’s specfic inhibitory effect on calcium surface channels [Olenhusen: 1979]. So we hypothesized that the presence of SrCl and EDTA in the extracellular environment would inhibit the normal chemotaxis of P. polycephalum due to calcium channel blocking, while excess calcium ion would increase or speed up chemotaxis because of its use in contractile movement/filament assembly


Materials and Methods:
We began with a culture of P. polycephalum grown in at 37*C in a water agar petri dish. The culture was cut into 1 cm cubes for later transfer. We set up three experimental groups with three replicates each. The first step was to add the experimental solutions: the control group had normal agar and no additional solution added. This was considered the standard growing condition. The calcium group featured the same setup, but the independent variable (agar solution) was a Ca2+ ion solution (20mM) diluted 1 ml in 19 ml of deionized water. This dilution was evenly spread over the surface of each replicate and allowed to absorb into the agar for 10 minutes. The EDTA/Strontium Chloride group was diluted and distributed in a similar fashion (1 ml (20mM) of each, and 18 ml of deionized water). Excess solution was absorbed with a kimwipe following the 10 minute interval. Additionally, each dish had three central 1 cm cubes spaced 1 cm apart. The middle cube contained the block of P. polycephalum, the right hand block was glucose agar (25mM) (positive control) with an oat on top, and the left hand block was a blank control. . Each petri dish was wrapped in tin foil, incubated, and measured for growth at a 15 and 24 hour interval when we came back and measured the longest growth from the central P. polycephalum cube and its directionality. Measurements were performed with a metric ruler (in mm) and a protractor app (degree measurements were rounded to either 45* or 90* towards/away from stimulus). On excel we performed a two-sample assuming equal variance with a critical value of 0.05 to test for statistical significance in growth relative to the control group. Outliers were removed from the data as per the Grubb’s statistical outlier test.


Results:
After the 15 hour incubation period, only two replicates (one in the calcium group at 32 mm, and one in the EDTA/SrCl group at 16mm) with growth more that 10mm. After 24 hours, we saw consistent growth in the control group, averaging 38 mm. The calcium group finished with inconsistent growth - one replicate growing 32 mm and the other two growing only 1 or 3 mm. The EDTA/SrCl group was completely inhibited (following the removal of an obvious outlier), with the two relevant groups having 0 mm of growth. The directionality of the growth was very inconsistent, appearing to be random between each group. There was no statistical significance after 15 hours, but after 24 hours the EDTA/SrCl group had significantly less growth than the control group. EDTA/SrCl: T(3)=(t Stat=6.423,p=0.00764) p&lt;0.05.   

Discussion:
From our data, we can conclude that a solution of EDTA/SrCl effectively inhibits the chemotaxis growth of P. polycephalum. The control group consistently grew in the normal agar, but the EDTA/SrCl enriched agar effectively halted this growth. We can attribute this to the inhibitory function of EDTA and Strontium (also shown in Olenhusen's study) [Olenhusen: 1979], blocking the signal transduction pathways that generate plasmodium growth. If the surface calcium channels are blocked, P. polycephalum will be unable to change its intracellular calcium concentration - leading to a disruption of pathways that rely on Ca2+ ions. Furthermore, EDTA is known to be a chelating agent (as shown in Dominguez’s experiment), in other words, it binds metal ions such as Ca2+[Dominguez: 2009]. This leads us to believe that EDTA/SrCl might do more than block surface channels; it may also effectively isolate and remove calcium ions from their functional role in the cell. Since calcium ions are required for the activation of actin microfilaments and leading edge growth [Hasegawa: 1980], an EDTA/SrCl solution would severely impair these mechanisms from both angles (i.e. Ca2+ sequestering and GPCR IP3 pathway). Additionally, we can conclude that excess extracellular calcium does not increase growth in any way. This may be indicative of the Physarum’s ability to maintain homeostasis through these surface channels. Physarum have been known to secrete calcium into the nearby environment, perhaps in an effort to prevent excess growth. 
There were several sources of error that could have influenced our data. The depth of the agar varied by a few mm in each petri dish: this can cause problems with the agar’s ability to absorb the applied solution, in addition to creating uneven block heights upon transfer, which makes it difficult for the physarum to grow off of the block. Another source of error was the P. polycephalum culture itself: it is near impossible to generate identical 1cm cubes of P. polycephalum, which can lead to growing variance. Gaps between the blocks can also be an impediment to P. polycephalum growth. The only significant outlier came in the EDTA/SrCl group, in which one replicate grew more than any other in the entire experiment. This can be attributed to many things, but our best assumption is that the agar did not effectively absorb the applied solution.  
In future experiments, it is recommended that other factors surrounding leading edge growth are studied, such as inhibitory or amplifying agents. In this experiment we also included a calcium enriched agar group, assuming that it would be a positive control. The results were not what we expected - the calcium replicates averaged 14.33 mm of growth - much less than the 38 mm average of the control group. Consequently, we think it would be worthwhile to investigate why this result occurred, perhaps by setting up an experiment with different methods of calcium ion application (intra vs intercellular presence). More specifically, we can radio/fluorescence label strontium chloride to observe its interactions with receptors on the cell surface. This fits into the big picture of biochemical research because P. polycephalum is an ideal model organism for studying signaling. From research of P. polycephalum actin/myosin filaments, it is likely that we can apply any findings to actin/myosin filaments of Eukaryotes like Humans.
