Title: Oat Plants Demonstrate No Significant Difference With the Effect of Salinity

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to see how salinity affects the R:S weight and length measurements of the oat plant. My hypothesis is that there will be a difference in the R:S weight and length because salinity will stunt the growth in the experimental group. Through a paired-t test it is concluded that there was no significant difference from the data that was collected. Through this experiment it can be demonstrated that salinity doesn't have an affect but in the greater outlook within environment we can potentially demonstrate that certain irrigation systems wouldn't have much of an affect out the outlook of crop production. 

Introduction:
Many plants allocate their biological structures based off of their resources. This lab will be based off of the oat plant, Avena stavia. The purpose of this lab is to see how salinity effects R:S weight and length measurements. The independent variable is the concentration of NaCl that will be in the experimental water resource. The dependent variable will be the R:S weight and length measurements.  Salinity hinders the ability of plants to take up water which causes reductions in the  growth rate of both the shoot and root of a plant [Munns: 2002]. 
My hypothesis is that there will be a difference in R:S weight and length because salinity will stunt the growth in the experimental group. In a study published by B.L. Haines and E.L Dunn in 1976 concluded that growth and resource allocation response in the Spartina alterniflora to three levels of NH4-N, Fe, and NaCl in solution resulted in a decrease in shoot to root ratio and a decrease in resource allocation to the root production with an increase in the independent variables (NaCl) [Naines & Dunn: 1976]. Which gives me reason to believe that there will be a difference in the ratio of root to shoot because of an allocation to the root or shoot to compensate for the salinity stress within the plants biological system. 


Materials and Methods:
We obtained four pots and filled them with soil and then planted oat seeds in all the pots. Then we labeled two as control's and the other two as experimental. Next we watered all pots with 50 mL of miracle grow. Then watered all 4 with 100 mL of water in each pot. Then placed them in the greenhouse. For the next two weeks as a group we took turns watering the control with 100mL of water and the experimental with 100 mL of 1.3g/L NaCl concentrated water ever day. After the two weeks we determined the R:S ratio's by measuring and weighing the roots and shoots separately. To determine the results of the ratios we used a one tailed t-test to analyze the data. 

Results:
For the weight R:S ratio the average control ratio was 0.434 +/- 0.0934 and the experimental was 0.384 +/-0.1304. The p-value was 0.5059 concluding that there no significant difference within the data. For the height R:S ratio the average control was 1.098+/-0.2326 and the experimental average was 0.856  +/- 0.1341. The p-value was 0.0786 meaning there was no significant difference. 

Discussion:
In conclusion, there was no significant difference in length/height R:S length at 0.0786, we accept the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the means and conclude that a significant difference does not exist. This was the same as the weight ratio's p-value of 0.5059, resulting in accepting the null hypothesis and concluding that there is no significant difference. This in turn made out that my hypothesis was wrong and that the oat plants didn't actually allocate their resources (their shoots or roots) differently within 

The p-value in a way derails what we saw from the averages of the root: shoot ratios which were points away from each other, that being the experimental and the control. While we cannot conclude anything from the averages there is something to note that because this didn't work out with our plants there could be some lurking variables that could have affected our results. Potentially we didn't water the plants enough and the salinity couldn't take enough effect on the plants. Another thing to note about the reasoning for the hypothesis is the fact that the research I did was not similar to what we did with our plants, the plant that B. L. Haines and E. L Dunn used was a plant accustomed to saltwater marshes. They also used different concentrations of salt whereas we just used one concentration throughout or study. For future experiments, we could study the breaking point of salinity that can be used to water with till the plants' growth starts to stunt. This study can be used to help those farmers who irrigate their crops with salt water or from a local lake. 

The reason we are testing this out is because all over the world there is an irrigation issue with a higher concentration in salinity within irrigation and that can overall affect the growth of the plants and potentially hurt the farmers who are irrigating the crops. Salinity affects around 7% of all the world land area, where many people grow crops. [Munns: 2002] Another aspect of this experiment is the tolerance that the oat plants have on salinity which could be the reason for the results having no significant difference in average R:S values. This experiment can determine if a certain concentration of salt can truly affect the outcome of growth in plants. Therefore determining if there needs to be a reduction of the spread of salinization or to increase the salt tolerance of high-yielding crops which is an important global issue [Munn: 2002]
