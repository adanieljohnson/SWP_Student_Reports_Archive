Title: Effect of Salt Stress on Suspended Chloroplasts Solutions in Kale and Spinach Leafs

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of low, medium, and high salt concentrations on spinach and kale chloroplasts when submerged in different salinity levels and, correspondingly, how their photosynthetic rates were affected.  The chloroplasts were suspended by centrifuge techniques, and photosynthetic rates were measured. The increasing concentrations of salinity showed no significant data supporting the idea that increased salt concentrations decreased plant growth and overall photosynthetic rates.  A further study would be to grow the spinach and kale plants in at varying salt concentrated soils, not submerging the suspended chloroplasts in a salt concentrated solution.    	

Introduction:
A large portion of the bio-atmosphere is dependent on plants, therefore plant growth and factors that affect it is essential.  One factor that has become extremely prominent in deterring plant growth is soil salinity. The increased levels of salinity of the soil is one of the main factors that limits the spread of plants and has been an ever-increasing problem in arid and semi-arid regions of the world [Qados: 2010].   In order to ensure the stability of crops, it is important to understand how plants respond to differing salinity concentrations and to drought. Photosynthesis is one of the primary processes to be affected by water or salt stress.  It is estimated that more than six percent of the world's land and thirty percent of the land that is used to grow crops on is already suffering from highly concentrated salt soils [Pinheiro: 2008].  The affected land produces one-third of the world’s food [Machado: 2017].  Additionally, it is important to consider the faster-than-predicted climate change which is drastically changing the conditions of plant life, only accentuating the problem.  Soil salinity concentrations are such important factors to understand and research soil salinity has a great effect on plant survival, and could lead to problems in the agricultural industry [Machado: 2017]. 
In light of this, our experiment aims to study the effect of salt stress on photosynthetic rates.  In this study, we examined photosynthetic activities of kale and spinach that were submerged in varying salt concentrations and explored how increasing levels of salinity affected the photosynthetic activity in each the spinach and kale, hypothesizing that the higher the salt concentration, the less photosynthetic activity observed.  Specific objectives were to determine how salinity affected photosynthetic activity and determine the biological explanation behind our results.  Ultimately, the connection between decreased photosynthetic activity and plant growth would be analyzed.   


Materials and Methods:
Spinach and kale leafs chloroplasts were obtained through centrifuge techniques. The solution was spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC. Reaming chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC.  Photosynthetic Reduction with the Hill Reaction Assay was used in this experiment.  Test tubes were arranged according to Table 1 for Spinach and another set of test tubes were arranged according to Table 2 for Kale.  Mixtures were analyzed with a Spec 20 and absorbance’s were recorded (Table 3).  Absorbance’s were taken once every five minutes for fifteen minutes (Table 3).   
2-Tailed t- tests between the chloroplasts in kale and spinach in 10mM vs, 50mM and 100mM were used to determine if any significant difference between no chloroplasts and only chloroplasts, and with the control group and each of the 3 treatment groups.


Results:
Our results showed no statistically significant data when looking at varying salinity concentrations on photosynthetic rates.  However, in Kale, chloroplasts had the most photosynthetic activity in the 800mM salt concentrated solution and exhibited the lowest photosynthetic activity in the 10mM NaCl solution (t-stat=1.29, df=4, P=0.24, P&gt;0.05) .  In spinach, chloroplasts submerged in the 50mM NaCl solution had the highest photosynthetic rate while chloroplasts in the 10 and 800mM salt concentrated solution had the lowest (t-stat: 1.21, df: 4 Pf=0.27, P&gt; 0.05).  Despite this, there is a trend that chloroplast submerged in a level of salt had higher photosynthetic rates than the chloroplasts submerged in no salt.  Spinach would be the better candidate for further research considering the 800mM and the 10mM had the slowest photosynthetic rate.     


Discussion:
After running our experiment, our results did not support our hypothesis that increased salt concentrations would decrease photosynthetic activity in kale and spinach chloroplasts submerged in salty solutions.  Instead, our data showed that the kale chloroplasts had the highest rate of photosynthesis when placed in the 800mM salt solution and the lowest rate of photosynthesis when placed in the optimal 10mM salt solution (this optimal according to research conducted by Phillip: 1971).  The spinach showed that at the optimal salt concentration of 50mM, the highest rates of photosynthetic material followed by the most concentrated salt solution of 800mM.  Overall, none of the conditions when compared to one another yield even slightly significant results; thus the alternative hypothesis is rejected in all cases and we conclude that there is no statistically significant relationship between salinity concentration and decreased photosynthetic activity in spinach or kale leaf chloroplasts 
Our results can be caused by a few factors.  First, many other experiments that have tested how salinity concentrations affect plant growth have grown their plants in salted soil for weeks before conducting the experiment.  For example, researchers Rasmuson and Anderson grew their plants for three weeks in differing salt concentrated soils [Rasmuson: 2002].  This method is a more effective way to go about the experiment considering salinity is similar to when plants experience drought.  When plants are experiencing drought, it prevents their roots from performing at optimal osmotic activity.  As a result, the movement of water and nutrients is affected.  Ultimately, salt levels in the soil affect how well the movement of essential nutrients is throughout the plant decreasing the overall rate of photosynthetic activity [Salt Tolerance of Plants: 2001], .  Research conducted by Peinhero has found that different factors such as intensity, duration and rate of progression of such salt stress will play a role to how the plant response to the lack of water because it determines what processes will be affected explaining why only submerging the chloroplasts in different salt concentrations had very little effect on the level of photosynthesis for either plant [Peinhero: 2009].  Additionally, a study conducted by Honda mirrored more of the experiment we tried to recreate, determined the optimal medium for the isolation of chloroplasts, nuclei and mitochondria so that the specimen might be observed in vivo post isolation with minimal alterations to the appearance and function of those organelles [Honda et al; 1996].  In his research, it was found that the medium used--including the grinding and buffering solutions--might not have been optimal to begin with, resulting in damaged chloroplasts in the suspended samples.  Honda’s research also suggests that if the medium chosen was hypotonic relative to the molarity of the normal cytosol of either plant, then addition of solute like NaCl would be expected to improve photosynthetic performance to a point [Honda et al : 1966].  
In future variations of this experiment, it would be beneficial to either grow the plants in varying salt concentrated soils or to use a more effective method to isolate chloroplasts from the plants considering in order to suspend them we had to use a mortar and pestle.  Additionally, the medium used to isolate the chloroplasts should be as close in molarity as possible to the molarity of the cytosol of either plant to ensure the chloroplasts are not overly altered prior to the experimental condition being applied.  With these changes, there may be a significant result for the controls comparison, indicative that the chloroplasts are functioning at a higher rate and thus produce a higher absorbance than the chloroplast-free control (figures 1 & 5); this result was not seen in this experiment.  Another thing to consider would be procedural error in suspending the chloroplasts.  It is very possible that our suspension did not contain a dense number of chloroplasts in the samples we were looking at.  In order to avoid this ambiguity, next time it would be necessary to see the density of the chloroplasts in the sample by using a light microscope to ensure we were looking at the right chloroplast suspension. 
Understanding the response plants have to varying concentrations of soil salinity is vital in ensuring their survival on Earth as plants continue to experience climate change and increased levels of salt concentrated soil.  The agricultural and food industry is completely dependent on the well-being of such organisms and studies like these provide insight into what is happening on the molecular level.  With knowledge about what biologically is being affected by increased levels of salinity in soil, research can be done in order to adopt better solutions to such problems and eliminate it in its entirety.
