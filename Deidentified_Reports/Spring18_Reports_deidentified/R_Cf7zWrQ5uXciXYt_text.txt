Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine on the Length of Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The sciatic nerve is located in the gastrocnemius of the Raina pipiens and acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions in this muscle. In this experiment, we wanted to see if an increase in acetylcholine would increase the length of the muscle contraction in time. We hypothesize that an increase in acetylcholine will increase the length of the muscle contraction since this neurotransmitter releases calcium to stimulate muscle contractions. After testing our hypothesis through stimulation of the sciatic nerve, we concluded that there is a statistical difference in the length in time of the muscle contraction between the muscle with and without an acetycholine injection, the muscle contracts longer with an injection (p-value of .0141). Changes in acetylcholine concentration is positively correlated with muscle contraction length in time.


Introduction:
Muscle fibers contract when neurons send action potentials that activate acetylcholine to be released from the neuron and attach onto the muscle fiber. Calcium is then released in the muscle fiber and causes the cross-bridge binding of actin and myosin using ADP and ATP (Johnson, 2018). A scientist by the name of Spudich discovered how to measure the sliding velocity of myosin fibers when he connected them to natural and synthetic actin (Keurs, 2012). This experiment showed how quickly cross-bridge binding can occur, thus showing how quickly a muscle contraction can occur. In our experiment, we will work with the Rana pipiens and its gastrocnemius muscle to measure the length of the muscles contractions. The sciatic nerve is located in the leg of the Rana pipiens and we will stimulate the nerve with an electrical impulse so that an action potential will occur and cause the gastrocnemius to contract. We want to see if an increase in acetylcholine in the muscle will cause a change in the length of contraction in time because Acetylcholine allows calcium to bind to actin and allows cross-bridge binding to occur which contracts the muscle. Thus, the more cross bridge binding that occurs will cause a greater contraction. Our hypothesis is that an increase in acetylcholine will cause an increase in the length of the contraction.


Materials and Methods:
For our experiment, we used two frog legs and examined the contraction length before the legs were injected with acetylcholine and after the acetylcholine was injected. First, we removed the skin and then the gastrocnemius was isolated by stringing the leg straight in the air. Next, the sciatic nerve was isolated and silver string, connected to the iWorx system, was laid across it. The nerve was stimulated with one pulse at an amplitude of one and the contraction time was recorded. Next, Acetylcholine was injected using a syringe into the gastrocnemius and the contraction length was recorded. This was repeated for the second frog leg as well.


Results:
As in chart one, the average length of contraction for the control group was 52.085 +/- 7.38 while the average length of contraction for the experimental group was 62.915 +/- 11.00. The experimental group had a longer contraction length on average. Our two-tailed t-test yielded a P-value of .0141, 3 degrees of freedom, and a t-value of 5.1652.


Discussion:
Our P-value of .0141 proves that there is a significant difference between the average length of contractions between the legs that were injected with acetylcholine and the legs that were not, which indicates that acetylcholine causes longer muscle contractions. Since acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle contractions, the experiment shows that the muscle contraction’s length is positively correlated with the amount of acetylcholine available. Thus, Spudich’s revelation that allowed him to measure the sliding velocity of myosin fibers with actin helps us understand that in this experiment the contraction is longer perhaps because more acetylcholine causes more calcium to be released and allow more cross-bridge binding to occur between the actin and myosin that Spudich researched (Keurs, 2012). However, a fault in our experiment could be that we only tested four Rana pipiens, and perhaps to obtain more concrete results we may need to increase our sample size. Also, perhaps Spudich’s discovery of testing how fast cross-bridge binding could occur could lead to research about the effect of increases of acetylcholine on the velocity of cross-bridge binding. In conclusion, the gastrocnemius in the Raina pipiens contracted significantly longer when the muscle was injected with acetylcholine.

The left column shows the average length of contraction before acetylcholine was injected and the right shows the length after the injection. The muscle before injections had an average time length of 52.085 +/- 7.38 milliseconds and the muscle after injection had an average time length of 62.915 +/- 11.00.
