Title: Effects of Precor Juvenile Hormone on Caterpillar Growth and Development

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta are commonly known as the tobacco hornworm and have multiple life stages, one of which includes the key process of molting. Juvenile hormone is essential to the development of Manduca Sexta because it regulates vital biological processes as mentioned above. Therefore, if precor is added to the Manduca Sexta diet in the fourth instar, then the growth and development process will be hindered.

We examined the developmental effects of Precor (a JH mimic) on six insects in the fourth instar by adding the hormone to three of the six Manduca Sexta's diet for seven days, weighing each organism, calculating the percentage of food eaten, and noting important physical changes. Our results compare the means of the controll and experimental groups' average mass and the amount of food eaten per day in order to determine if there is a key difference between the two groups. Overall, our results show that there is a difference in the means, but none is great enough to show a significent statistical difference of means, due to an insufficient experiment time frame. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to test whether adding a supplement of Precor to Manduca Sexta caterpillars changes the growth and development of the larvae in the fourth instar. Manduca Sexta were used because they are easy to handle, house, feed, and are ideal for recording data due to their relatively simple biological systems.

The Manduca Sexta have holometabolous life cycles, meaning the organisms grow and develop through four major life stages; an egg, larva, pupa, and adult insect. It also means that the larvae look strikingly different than the adult insects (Comparative Physiology Laboratory Manual). The cycle starts with an egg which remains for approximately three to five days before transitioning into the first instar larva which lasts two to three days. The larva transitions into three other instars, each lasting two to three days before molting into a pupa. This pupal stage is approximately 19-23 days, at the end of which results in a molt into the adult organism (Comparative Physiology Laboratory Manual, Figure 3). The organisms in this lab were received at the fourth instar.
Juvenile hormone is essential in the regulation of metamorphosis in the early life stages of the Manduca Sexta as well as in physical properties such as color and the specific type of molt. JH also reappears in the adult insect, regulating numerous functions throughout the lifespan of the organism (Jindra et al. 2013).

The treatment studied was Precor, which is a JH mimic. Because JH is required for the insects to molt, we decided to determine if an addition of the hormone would hinder the development of the larvae. It is interesting to note that JH, and specifically Precor, are often used as pesticides which could be experimental data supporting our research in this experiment (Menn and Henrick 1981).
By organizing a schedule for regular feeding, keeping conditions stable across the course of the study, and making detailed note of physical appearance changes as well as mass and percentage of food eaten, we were able to determine the relative effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta in the fourth instar.

After reading multiple articles that suggested an addition of juvenile hormone negatively affects the molting process of organisms similar to Manduca Sexta, such as flies (Miller et al. 1999), we decided to study the effects of Precor in Manduca Sexta. Research shows that added hormone delays the molting process because a vital balance is necessary to carry out normal biological functions. We believe the average mass and food eaten of the controll group will be higher than those of the experimental group due to the Precor additive. Therefore, if precor is added to the Manduca Sexta diet in the fourth instar, then the growth and development process will be hindered.


Materials and Method:
Six Manduca Sexta were tested, three of which were controll organisms, while the other three were the experimental group. One controll and one experimental organism were kept in a single container with a notecard dividing the container in half. All three containers were kept in a refrigeration unit in the lab which was set to the ideal living temperature for the organisms. Every Manduca Sexta was easily differentiable due to the barrier separation and precise labeling of each organism's half of the container, as well as on the lid. This helped ensure that the controll groups did not ingest any of the treatment solution.

The experimental groups received five drops of diluted precor provided by the Wake Forest University Lab with approximately 10 g of food per day. The precor was diluted by our TA as follows; 4 Ml of precor with 100 Ml of water, which gave a concentration of 0.04 M. The controll group received five drops of water in 10 g of food per day. The delivery method in this case was a food additive which was ingested by the Manduca Sextas. To maintain consistency, the lab group created a schedule so that the organisms would be fed at 4:00 pm every day for seven days. 

Each feed consisted of taking observations and mass and recording the values in the google document, throwing away old food, cleaning out the defecation from the previous day, weighing 10 g of food, adding 5 drops of either water or precor, and putting the food back in the container. The method of this study were similar to those of the Emergence, Survival, and Fecundity of Adult Cat Fleas Study, but rather than the insects being sprayed as they were in the abovementioned study, we added the Precor to the food as a means of ingestion (Miller et al. 1999). It was important to ensure that the drops were added to the food and then chopped with a spoon to make sure there was an even distribution of treatment to all areas of the food.

The statistical test used was a two sample t - test because we were comparing the means from two groups of data, a controll and an experimental group. The test was completed by documenting the average mass for each organism group and the average food eaten for each organism group in an excel spreadsheet and then placing the information into the template provided by the Biology Core Resource Guide, which yielded our results. 


Results:
The mean value for mass of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.80, d.f. = 40, P = 0.43). The mean value for food eaten of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 1.256, d.f. = 34, P = 0.22).

On average, the experimental group of Manduca Sexta did not grow and develop as quickly as the controll organisms (Fig. 2). Their average masses were lower, and their color did not progress as it should in the fourth instar. Generally, (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), the controll organisms had higher average values for percentage of food eaten and average mass.


Discussion:
The two sample t - test results lead us to accept the null hypothesis because our data was not statistically significent in showing the difference in means of the two groups. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, adding Precor to the diet of Manduca Sexta in the fourth instar has little to no effect on its development. It is important to note that on day 6, E6 crawled into C3's side of the container, which could have affected the results for average amount eaten on Day 7. 

The study should have been continued. In the short time frame of this experiment, none of the organisms molted. Comparing the molting stages of the controll and experimental groups would have been valuable data regarding their development. Future experiments should increase the total observation time for the Manduca Sexta, so that the time between molts could be recorded and compared between groups. Because each instar is approximately two to three days in length, and the pupal stage is 19 - 23 days in length (Comparative Physiology Laboratory Manual, Figure 3), future experiments should study Manduca Sexta development for at least 30 days. 

It has been shown that the addition of juvenile hormone does affect organisms when studied over a longer period of time (Miller et al. 1999). Because excess juvenile hormone can inhibit the regular molting cycle of Manduca Sexta, it causes the treatment group to have lower masses and slower molting cycles, if any. 
Our observational results showed a significent difference between the two groups, as all three experimental organisms did not mature as quickly as the controll organisms (determined by coloring and activity). 

Overall, the procedure was carried out very successfully and the study yielded results that are positively comparable to many other scientific studies regarding JH mimic when looking solely at the average mass difference. However, because of the short time frame and small number of test subjects, our data was not statistically significent enough to show that Precor hinders Manduca Sexta growth and development in the fourth instar.
