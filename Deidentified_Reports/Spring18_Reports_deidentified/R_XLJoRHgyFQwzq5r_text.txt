Title: Effect of Salt Stress on Suspended Chloroplasts Solutions in Kale and Spinach Leafs

Abstract:
The purpose of experiment was to determine the effects of low, medium, and high salt concentrations on spinach and kale chloroplasts when submerged in these varying levels of salinity and, correspondingly, how their photosynthetic rates were affected.  The chloroplasts were suspended by centrifuge techniques, and then examined using a reaction buffer and DCPIP.  The DCPIP was added as a way to measure the photosynthetic rates of the chloroplasts by using a Spec 20 to measure the absorbance in five-minute intervals.  The increasing concentrations of salinity showed no significent data supporting the notion that increased salt concentrations decreased plant growth and overall photosynthetic rates.  A further study that would be helpful if conducted would be to grow the plants in differing salt concentrated soils, not only submerging the suspended chloroplasts in a salt concentrated solution.    

Introduction:
Without plants, there would be no life on Earth.  Consider, plants supply ninety-percent of the world’s food, add oxygen to the air, and are places that many organisms call “home”.  The symbiotic relationship between human and plant cannot be more explicit; humans breathe out CO2, plants breathe in CO2, plants breath out oxygen, we breathe in oxygen.  The entire bio-atmosphere is dependent on plants.  The short summary depicting how important plants are to the survival of the human race, animal population, food industry, atmosphere, and the overall well-being of the plant, is vital in understanding why studying plant growth and factors that affect it is essential.
One factor that has become extremely prominent in deterring plant growth is soil salinity.  “The over salinity of the soil is one of the main factors that limits the spread of plants in their natural habitats” and has been an ever- increasing problem in arid and semi-arid regions [Qados: 2010].  “Understanding how plants respond to drought, salt and co-occurring stresses can play a major role in stabilizing crop performance under drought and saline conditions and in the protection of natural vegetation. Photosynthesis, together with cell growth, is among the primary processes to be affected by water or salt stress.  Already, “it is estimated that &gt;6 % of the world's land and 30 % of the world's irrigated areas already suffer from salinity problems” [Pinheiro: 2008], producing one-third of the world’s food [Machado: 2017].  Additionally, it is important to consider the faster-than-predicted climate change which is drastically changing the conditions of plant life, only accentuating the problem.  Soil salinity concentrations are such important factors to understand and research “because excessive soil salinity reduces the productivity of many agricultural crops, including most vegetables, which are particularly sensitive throughout the ontogeny of the plant” [Machado: 2017] 
In light of this, our research aims to study the effect of salt stress on photosynthetic rates.  In this study, we examined photosynthetic activities of two greens that were submerged in varying salt concentrations and explored how increasing levels of salinity affected the photosynthetic activity in each the spinach and kale, hypothesizing that the higher the salt concentration, the less photosynthetic activity observed.  Specific objectives were to determine how salinity affected photosynthetic activity and determine the biological explanation behind our results.  Ultimately, the connection between decreased photosynthetic activity and plant growth would be analyzed.   


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method:
Plant and Chloroplast Preparation: Four spinach and four kale leafs were obtained from a supermarket, deveined, washed, and dried.  To suspend chloroplasts, a cold mortar and pestle were used to grind each respective leaf with 20Ml of 400mM sucrose 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0.  The entire volume of green slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.  The remaining green liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4oC.  The supernatant was poured out of the tube marked “A” into a second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”.  The 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC.  The supernatant was poured out into a clean 50 Ml tube marked “C”, making sure the pellet was not disturbed. 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and was suspended by gentle stirring with a transfer pipet to finish the preparation of the chloroplast solution.
Photosynthetic Reduction With the Hill Reaction Set Up:
Sixteen test tubes were arranged according to Table 1 for Spinach and another 16 test tubes were arranged according to Table 2 for Kale.
When each tube was properly filled, 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepared was added to the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-16, and was mixed well. These mixtures were then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes and immediately their absorbance’s were recorded (Table 3).  Absorbance’s were taken once every five minutes for fifteen minutes and were recorded (Table 3).   
Statistical Tests: T- tests were used to determine if any significent difference between no chloroplasts and only chloroplasts, chloroplasts only and chloroplasts in 50mM salt solution, and chloroplasts only and chloroplasts in an 800mM salt solution.

Discussion:
After running our experiment, our results did not support our hypothesis that increased salt concentrations would decrease photosynthetic activity in kale and spinach chloroplasts submerged in salty solutions.  Instead, our data showed that the kale chloroplasts had the highest rate of photosynthesis when placed in the 800mM salt solution and the lowest rate of photosynthesis when placed in the optimal 10mM salt solution (this optimal according to research conducted by Phillip: 1971).  The spinach showed that at the optimal salt concentration of 50mM, the highest rates of photosynthetic material followed by the most concentrated salt solution of 800mM.  Overall, none of the conditions when compared to one another yield even slightly significent results; thus the null hypothesis must be rejected in all cases and we conclude that there is no statistically significent relationship between salinity concentration and decreased photosynthetic activity in spinach or kale leaf chloroplasts 
Our results can be caused by a few factors.  First, many other experiments that have tested how salinity concentrations affect plant growth have grown their plants in salted soil for weeks before conducting the experiment.  For example, researchers Rasmuson and Anderson grew their plants for three weeks in differing salt concentrated soils.   This is another, and more effective way to go about the experiment considering “salinity acts like drought on plants, preventing roots from performing their osmotic activity where water and nutrients move from an area of low concentration into an area of high concentration. Therefore, because of the salt levels in the soil, water and nutrients cannot move into the plant roots” [Salt Tolerance of Plants: 2001], decreasing the overall rate of photosynthetic activity.  Research has found that “the intensity, duration and rate of progression of the stress will influence plant responses to water scarcity and salinity, because these factors will dictate whether mitigation processes associated with acclimation will occur” [Peinhero] explaining why only submerging the chloroplasts in different salt concentrations had very little effect on the level of photosynthesis for either plant.  Additionally, a study conducted by Honda mirrored more of the experiment we tried to recreate, determined the optimal medium for the isolation of chloroplasts, nuclei and mitochondria so that the specimen might be observed in vivo post isolation with minimal alterations to the appearance and function of those organelles.  In his research, it was found that the medium used--including the grinding and buffering solutions--might not have been optimal to begin with, resulting in damaged chloroplasts in the suspended samples.  Honda’s research also suggests that if the medium chosen was hypotonic relative to the molarity of the normal cytosol of either plant, then addition of solute like NaCl would be expected to improve photosynthetic performance to a point [Honda et al : 1966].  
In future variations of this experiment, it would be beneficial to either grow the plants in varying salt concentrated soils or to use a less traumatic method to isolate chloroplasts from the plants.  Additionally, the medium used to isolate the chloroplasts should be as close in molarity as possible to the molarity of the cytosol of either plant to ensure the chloroplasts are not overly altered prior to the experimental condition being applied.  With these changes, there may be a significent result for the controlls comparison, indicative that the chloroplasts are functioning at a higher rate and thus produce a higher absorbance than the chloroplast-free controll (figures 1 & 5); this result was not seen in this experiment which calls into question the efficacy of the method used.
Understanding the response plants have to varying concentrations of soil salinity is vital in ensuring their survival on Earth as plants continue to experience climate change and increased levels of salt concentrated soil.  The agricultural and food industry is completely dependent on the well-being of such organisms and studies like these provide insight into what is happening on the molecular level.  With knowledge about what biologically is being affected by increased levels of salinity in soil, research can be done in order to adopt better solutions to such problems and eliminate it in its entirety.
