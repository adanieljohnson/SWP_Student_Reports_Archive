Title: The effect of different light conditions on the resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum plants

Abstract:
It is often observed that the ecosystem around us is full of blossoming flowers and flourishing plant life in the sunny months of the spring and summer. One of the main reasons for this is that sunlight is the main source of energy used for growth in most plant species. Knowing that plants rely so heavily on sunlight to survive, we explored how plants would react in a situation where there is no sunlight. Specifically, we explored how shaded and sunlight environments would affect the root:shoot ratio of the Fagopyrum esculentum, or Buckwheat species. I hypothesized that shaded Buckwheat would allocate all their resources to growing their shoots in attempts to find any source of sunlight, resulting in a smaller root:shoot ratio.  To test this, we grew and cared for two trays of Buckwheat in a shaded environment and two in sunlight for 3 weeks. We found that the average root:shoot weight ratio was significantly larger for the plants in the shade. These results did not support my hypothesis, which lead me to accept a different alternative hypothesis than I originally predicted. 


Introduction:
In this lab, we explored the effect of light on plant resource allocation. Specifically, we explored how different light conditions effect the root:shoot ratio of plants. As it has been discovered in the past, plants need sunlight to survive. Along with water and nutrients, sunlight is one of the critical ingredients to plant life, and is how almost all plants get majority of their energy. Fagopyrum esculentum, the plant we focused on in our experiment, is no different. Fagopyrum esculentum, also known as Buckwheat, is a plant grown all over the world and is commonly cultivated as a grain-like crop. Buckwheat grows best in cooler environments at high elevations, but is not frost resistant [Kalinova, Moudry: 2003]. With this knowledge of Buckwheat’s environmental preferences, we explored how a sunlight vs. a shaded condition would affect the root:shoot ratio of Buckwheat plants.  
In a past experiment done on blueberries cultivation, the conclusion was that the blueberry plants under immediate shade grew faster and had longer shoots than blueberry plants in sunlight. [Hoefs, Shay: 1981]. 
With this knowledge at hand, I hypothesized that the Buckwheat grown in shade would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than the Buckwheat plants grown in the sunlight. This means that the plants in the shade would have longer shoots in comparison to their roots, resulting in a smaller root:shoot ratio. I predicted this because will little to no sunlight present, I expected the Buckwheat plants to allocate their resources to grow their shoots. This shoot growth would be a result of the plants attempting to find any source of sunlight that might be available. I expected the plants to prioritize their need for sunlight and allocate their resources accordingly; since sunlight is necessary for the plants to survive. 
Overall, this study is important because the knowledge of how plants adjust to their environment could potentially lead to improvements in how we grow and understand many different plant species. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, four trays of Buckwheat plants were prepared by filling each tray with planting soil. A handful of seeds were added to each tray, along with 50 mL of miracle grow. After watering each tray thoroughly, two trays were labeled “shade” while the other two were labelled “sunlight”. In correspondence with their labels, the two shade trays were placed underneath a dark netting, while the sunlight trays were placed in the direct sun of the greenhouse. All of the plants were observed and watered every day for 3 weeks. 
After diligently caring for the plants for 3 weeks, three plants were randomly selected from each tray.  After measuring the root and shoot lengths of all six plants in the sunlight, we calculated the root:shoot length ratio for each plant along with the average root:shoot length ratio for all of the sunlight plants. This same process was used for these plants when calculating the root:shoot weight ratio. After finding the average root:shoot values for length and weight of the plants in the sunlight, we repeated the above procedure for six random plants that were in the shade.  
After all of the averages were collected, a two-sample one tailed t-test was preformed to effectively analyze and compare the data between the two light conditions. 


Results:
Regarding the root:shoot length ratio, our raw data shows that the average ratio was larger in the shaded plants, information that can be found in Table 1. Although the raw average is greater for the shaded plants, the one tailed t-test preformed concluded that there is no significant difference between the root:shoot length ratios the two experimental groups. This insignificance is demonstrated through a t-value of 0.22, 10 degrees of freedom, and a high p-value of 0.41 0.28 found in Table 1. In essence, the amount of light received statistically had no significant effect on the root:shoot length of Buckwheat. 
	Likewise, the raw averages collected for the root:shoot weight ratios found in Table 2 also shows that the shaded plants have a higher weight root:shoot ratio. The difference between this data and the length data in Table 1 is that this difference can be concluded as significant. This significance is shown through a t-value of 2.17, 10 degrees of freedom, and a low p-value of 0.030.06 found in Table 2. This means that the shaded plants had a significantly higher root:shoot weight ratio than the plants in the sun. In other words, the plants in the shade had heavier roots in comparison to their shoots than the sunlight plants did. This data is also shown in Figure 1, which provides a visual representation of the significant difference between the average root:shoot weight ratios. 
	 


Discussion:
Overall, our results did not support my hypothesis. I hypothesized that the root:shoot ratio would be larger for the plants grown in the sunlight, and our results concluded the opposite. Our results concluded that the root:shoot weight ratio was significantly smaller for the Buckwheat grown in the sunlight. In simple terms, this means that the shoots in the sunlight grew longer in comparison to the roots than the shoots in the shade. 
These results are supported by a previous study done on apple trees. This study explored a similar question to ours, and concluded that shading of apple trees had a direct effect on reducing the number and weight of the new shoots [Jackson, Palmer:1977].
One reasoning for our results along with the apple tree results may be that exposure to sunlight gave the plants the needed energy to grow their shoots. Converting light into usable energy during photosynthesis is one of the plants major ways of getting the necessary energy needed for growth. Without any sunlight to drive photosynthesis, the plants in the shade might have not had any energy to allocate towards growing their shoots. This would result in smaller shoots, and the larger root:shoot weight ratio we found in our shaded plants. 
Although we found a significant difference in the weight ratios of the two experimental groups, there was no significant difference between the length ratios. One reasoning for this may be that we did not collect enough data. If we were to perform this experiment again, it would be beneficial to collect data from more than six plants per light condition. More data to analyze would lead to more accurate results, and could potentially lead us to find a significance between the two groups. 
Another reason I think our data may not be as accurate as possible is the shade condition used. The plants in the shade condition were put under a dark netting, but the netting was not completely solid and a small amount of light seemed to seep through. If we were to do a follow up experiment, I would want to make sure that the plants in the shaded condition had absolutely no exposure to light. This would provide more accurate conditions for the shaded plants, and could potentially alter our results to be more significant. 
Overall, this study is important because the knowledge of how plants adjust to their environment could potentially lead to improvements in how we grow and understand many different plant species. Specifically, we can apply our results to how and where we grow Buckwheat plants and potentially make Buckwheat cultivation more efficient.
