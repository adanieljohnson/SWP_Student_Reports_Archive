Title: Behavioral Analysis of betta splendens in Room Temperature Water versus Refrigerated Water

Abstract:
In this lab setting the class was to observe the behavior of the fish species betta splendens. The experiment resulted in a faster response in the colder water, however, in the warmer water the fish displayed more agonistic behaviors. The betta splenden fish are native to Southeast Asia and are not accustomed to cool temperatures, thus why there was a lack of activity in our experiment that tested with cold water. We performed the experiment using two different groups; Refrigerated water and room temperature water. Within these groups we tested the behavior of the fish when isolated, when mirrored, and when two males are put together. We determined that colder water results in a more lethargic behavior for the betta splenden. The experiment does not answer why or how these agonistic traits evolve but it gives us a better understanding of their behavior in different extremes which will potentially lead to the answer. 

Introduction:
In my lab class we engaged in looking at the behaviors of the tropical fish species betta splendens. My group decided it would be interesting to analyze the behavior of the fish species when introduced to different water temperatures. The species betta splendens are native to Southwest Asia, particularly the nations of Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Malaysia, and Indonesia. [Rowland:2010] The regions native to the Betta fish are considered tropical wet climates, which have an average temperature of 75° degrees Fahrenheit throughout the year. The water temperature bettas’ environments are even higher because most betta fish live in stagnant water environments such as rice paddies, which receive direct sunlight. The temperatures can range from 76° degrees Fahrenheit to almost 86 ° degrees Fahrenheit .[ Jaroensutasinee:2005] Betta fish are accustomed to temperatures above the average room temperature of 70° Fahrenheit. It is rare for these Asian nations to experience extreme lows in temperatures, for example in Vietnam the average low year-round is 63° degrees Fahrenheit and the water temperature rarely drops below 73° degrees Fahrenheit. [Manton:2001] The species betta splendens are an intraspecific aggressive territorial species, especially the male sex.  The intraspecific agonistic behaviors the bettas display often leads to the death of one of the two fish that come into contact with one another (if males).[Clair:2001] This behavior has baffled scientists for decades as this behavior reduces the overall fitness of the species. The group decided to analyze the behavior of the Betta fish in varying temperatures to observe how they react to the change in their environment and to better understand why this behavior was selected for. The most logical reasoning behind why the betta fish resort towards agonistic behaviors toward one another is because the amount of space, food and even oxygen are reduced the more fish that reside in the same enclosed space. Betta fish that are more adapted to their environment will eliminate the factor which reduces their proposed survival/fitness and thus eliminate the other fish. It is also true that warmer water results in higher amounts of oxygen, thus I predict that the Betta fish will display more agonistic behaviors in warmer temperatures, due to the lack of available oxygen and because they are more accustomed to these temperatures; making for a more competitive environment.[Hess:2010] 

Materials and Methods:
The first step of the experiment was to acquire all the necessary materials. The group collected a tank that could be divided into sections, a mirror, two male Betta fish of different colors, room temperature water (74° Fahrenheit), and refrigerated water (40° Fahrenheit). The reason we used a mirror was to see if there the betta would continue to present agonistic behaviors, thus proving that bettas’ show agonistic behaviors towards all male bettas they come into contact with. We decided the experiment would work best if we did two sets of testing one test for the room temperature water and one test for the refrigerated water. The tests that we would run include the behavior of the two male Betta fish when isolated, when looking at itself through a mirror, and lastly, when introduced to another male. In order to obtain the best data, we decided to test each twice; two tests for isolated males, mirrored males, and males together. We all observed the fish and counted the amount of times the betta fish performed a type of behavior. We ranked the actions in order of increasing agonistic behavior to measure the fish’s behavior. (figure. 1.)  For each observed behavior we wrote down the number of the corresponding rank, for example if the male fish performed a tail beat and its pectoral fin was erect we would have written down a 3 and a 2. If behaviors occur, then the rank number is recorded again. We performed a two tailed paired T-test to better analyze the data. 

Results:
The results of the experiments show that the change in temperature did not affect the Betta’s behavior holistically, however, the data does support that the when the Betta fish when placed in a cooler environment were more readily aggressive. There was a 13.50 average difference in the two test we performed; refrigerated and room temperature water. The total room temperature water fish behaviors indicated a 23.75 average score of aggressiveness with a total standard deviation of 11.7, whereas the refrigerated water behaviors only showed a 10.5 total average score of aggressiveness and a total standard deviation of 8.4.  The second experiment or the refrigerated water experiment resulted in a faster response from both fish. The first experiment with the room temperature water resulted in increasing constant agonistic behaviors; looking at the average number. The data shows that there is a significant difference in the two experiments, which constitutes that temperature does have an effect on the behavior of the Betta fish.  

Discussion:
The results of the two parallel experiments did  support my hypothesis that the species betta splendens would display more agonistic behavior in warmer temperatures. Again, the most logical reasoning behind why the betta fish resort towards agonistic behaviors toward one another is because the amount of space, food and even oxygen are reduced the more fish that reside in the same enclosed space. Betta fish that are more adapted to their environment will eliminate the factor which reduces their proposed survival/fitness and thus eliminate the other fish. It is also true that warmer water results in higher amounts of oxygen, The first experiment with the room temperature water resulted in high rates of agonistic behaviors between both fish, mostly the red. The second experiment with the refrigerated water resulted in a faster response, but overall a less agonistic response from both fish. Betta fish’s ideal temperature is between 76°-80℉. Betta fish that are exposed to colder temperatures, for example 40℉, they become lethargic, won't eat, their immune system is more at risk, and will often sink to the bottom of the tank to get warmer. [Davis:2018] It is not included in the data, but it was a common for the Betta fish to sink to the bottom when they were put in cold water. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that fish are ectothermic, meaning they do not regulate their own temperature, thus fish put in cold temperatures will enter shock and restrict their movement in order to maintain their body temperature. The results of our experiment are like that of other experiments. The Betta fish that were introduced to a cold environment often sank to the bottom of the tank and became lethargic. [Indy:2005] There was room for error in our experiment because we were counting the amount of behaviors that the fish displayed, and it would be easy to miss count and/or count a behavior as something it is not, for example some of my lab partners thought that the pectoral fin was actually the dorsal. If I were to modify the experiment I would count the number of time the fish came into contact with the other or the mirror instead of ranking behavior. It would be easier to count the amount of times it makes contact with the other or the glass (in the case of the mirror). It is important to understand the behaviors of species, so we can better understand the world around us, animal behavior, why and how particular traits such as, intraspecific agonistic behavior evolves in some species.
