Title: Phospholipase C, IP3 inhibition by Neomycin prevents phototaxis in Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
Physarum migrates away from light and negative chemical stimuli and toward positive chemical stimuli (including food sources). The present study was aimed at determining the signaling pathway that mediates the photoavoidance response in Physarum. Stock Physarum was placed in either a treatment or control PDA plate to test the effects of the inhibitors Curcumin and Neomycin on the Protein Kinase A and Phospholipase C signaling pathways. Total distance of migration was measured after 21.75 hours. A significant decrease in total migration distance was observed between control and Neomycin-treated Physarum. It was concluded that the Phospholipase C pathway regulates photoavoidance in Physarum. This confirms the necessity of keeping cytoplasmic calcium levels under tight control for behavioral responses.   

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold known for being a multinucleate syncytium with many nuclei contained in a single plasma membrane. Each plasmodium behaves as a large cell, exhibiting intelligent behaviors such as connecting two food sources with the shortest path [Nakagaki: 2004]. Physarum is notable for its ability to respond both to chemical stimuli and light. Because light is a stressor to the biological system, Physarum migrates away from light [Häder: 2001]. Similarly, Physarum migrates away from negative chemical stimuli and toward positive chemical stimuli (including food sources).  
The ability of Physarum to move is due to the autooscillatory nature of endoplasmic streaming [Matneeva: 2012]. Contraction of the ectoplasm creates pressure gradients that propel the plasmodium in a specific direction [Matneeva: 2012]. Thus, chemical and light stimuli must begin a chain of events that results in contractile activity of the ectoplasm to produce movement in the plasmodium.
The signaling pathway that results in chemotaxis is well-detailed by existing literature. G proteins can activate the inositol phosphate signaling pathway by activating Phospholipase C. Phospholipase C creates a cascade response with the release of intracellular calcium ions [Matneeva: 2012]. Phospholipase C converts PI(4,5)P2 into IP3 and DAG. IP3 opens Ca2+ channels in the SER, releasing CA2+ to the cytoplasm [Gibson: 2018]. DAG combines with Ca2+ to activate Protein Kinase C at the membrane [Gibson: 2018]. Activated PKC phosphorylates substrate proteins to produce the cellular response [Gibson: 2018]. Ca2+ also serves as a cellular messenger as concentration increases [Gibson: 2018].  
Another common method of cell signaling is the cAMP pathway. Once a G protein is activated it can turn on adenylyl cyclase instead of Phospholipase C. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP when activated and can make many cAMP molecules which serve as second messengers to amplify the original signal [Gibson: 2018]. cAMP activates Protein Kinase A which phosphorylates substrate proteins to produce a cellular response [Gibson: 2018].
The goal of this experiment is to determine the signaling pathway that mediates the photoavoidance response in Physarum by alternately inhibiting Phospholipase C/IP3 with Neomycin [Matneeva: 2014] and Protein Kinase A with Curcumin [Hasmeda: 1996]. Because Physarum is a model organism for cell signaling, this experiment will yield insight into other phototactic organisms. Phototaxis can be measured as a function of distance migrated from the initial plasmodium position. It is hypothesized that if Phospholipase C controls the phototaxis signaling pathway in Physarum, the total distance migrated in neomycin-inhibited samples will be significantly reduced in comparison to the control sample while the curcumin-inhibited sample will have no reduction in migration distance.


Materials and Methods:
Prior to this experiment, Physarum stock was grown in petri dishes in a growth medium with oatmeal flakes. Treatment and control conditions were prepared using the experimental protocol detailed in Table 1. Three PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates were used for each condition: positive control, neomycin, and curcumin.  
	All plates were wrapped in foil with a hole of 0.75 cm2 cut near the edge to allow light to enter and stimulate the photoavoidance response. Plates were placed in a light box for 21.75 hours. After this time, the distance from the edge of the stock sample block to the furthest migrated edge of Physarum was measured. The six values for each condition were averaged. The independent variable was the inhibitor used. The dependent variable was the average total distance migrated. A two-sample t-test was used to compare the average distance migrated for each treatment to the average distance migrated for the positive control. The difference was considered significant if p was less than 0.05.


Results:
The effects of Curcumin and Neomysin treatment on phototactic migration are shown in Figure 1. Throughout the experiment, the samples containing Curcumin migrated at a similar rate to the control group and reached the same total distance. Two sample t-test results showed no significant difference between control and Curcumin-treated Physarum total migration (t-stat = 0.618, df = 10, p = 0.55). However, a significant decrease in total migration distance was observed between control and Neomycin-treated Physarum (t-stat = 4.098, df = 10, p = 0.002). 

Discussion:
In this experiment, we expected that the presence of Neomycin (a Phospholipase C/IP3 inhibitor) would reduce phototactic migration in Physarum while the presence of Curcumin (a Protein Kinase A inhibitor) would not. Our results supported this hypothesis; according to our two-sample t-tests, there was no significant difference between control and Curcumin-treated Physarum total migration (t-stat = 0.618, df = 10, p = 0.55). However, a significant decrease in total migration distance was observed between control and Neomycin-treated Physarum (t-stat = 4.098, df = 10, p = 0.002).
	The significant change observed in response to the Neomycin inhibitor likely indicates that the photoavoidance response in Physarum is mediated by the Phospholipase C mechanism. This possibility is supported by the fact that chemotaxis in Physarum has been shown to be a response to this same signaling pathway. In a past experiment, inhibiting IP3-induced Ca2+ release resulted in the suppression of contractile activity in response to glucose in Physarum [Matneeva: 2009].
	In addition, phospholipase has been shown to respond to light during Physarum sporulation. Research on transcriptomic changes during light-induced sporulation shows that Phospholipase D is highly downregulated following exposure to light [Barrantes: 2010]. This indicates that light could produce a change in phospholipase-type enzymes involved in other Physarum behaviors. 
	A confounding variable in this study was the growth of bacteria on multiple PDA plates. This did not appear to alter Physarum migration but may in fact have reduced available nutrients by competing for the food or altered the outcome in another unknown way. Future studies could perform this experiment again with stricter adherence to the PDA plate preparation protocol. It would also be useful to redo this experiment with a greater number of replicate plates from different stocks of Physarum to reduce standard deviation and increase accuracy of the results. Additionally, testing this hypothesis by inhibiting other signaling molecules in the Phospholipase C pathway, such as IP3-activated intracellular Ca2+ channels, could confirm that this pathway mediates the photoavoidance response in Physarum. 
	The determination of the signaling pathway that controls phototaxis in Physarum has significant implications for other biological systems. In addition to giving insight into other organisms that employ phototaxis, it exemplifies another reason cells must carefully maintain cytoplasmic calcium concentrations.
