Title: Examining the Role of Second Messenger IP3 in a G-Protein Coupled Receptor Intercellular Signaling Pathway in Physarum Polycephalum Plasmodium

Abstract:
The role of IP3 in a G-Protein coupled intercellular signaling pathway has been investigated in Physarum polycephalum, a multinuclear amoeboid cell that uses autooscilllatory contractions of Ca2+ to move.  It was found that when second messenger IP3 was inhibited by Neomycin, Physarum was not able to move, even when positive external stimuli (oat flakes) were present.  In contrast, Physarum was able to move toward the food surface, and therefore increased its surface area, when IP3 was not inhibited.  Our results indicate that the motility of Physarum is dependent on the IP3 signaling molecule and the role it plays in controllling intracellular Ca2+ concentrations.  Further studies about the specific roles and amounts of Ca2+ ions and how it contributes to the motility of the Physarum would be helpful. 

Introduction:
Cells are constantly interacting with their environment; they have to respond to hundreds of different stimuli that arises from their rapidly changing surroundings.  In order to survive in these dynamic environments, cells must have the ability to respond to sudden change.  As a result of such a necessity, cells have evolved specific mechanisms that adjust their biochemistry that allow them to adapt to new environmental surroundings and respond to signals indicating environmental change [Berg: 2002].  Adjustments come in various forms; cells can change the rate in which certain enzymes and proteins are produced, alter membrane-transport processes, and even modify the way in which preexisting molecules are functioning throughout the cell [Lepock: 2005].
To make such modifications, cells use intercellular signaling pathways as a form of communication.  Consider, cell activity is governed through signals; and the chains of molecules that relay these signals inside a cell are called intercellular signal transduction pathways.  Cells must be able to receive outside stimulus, process it, and create a unified plan to address the stimulus.  Cell signaling is the foundation to many biological processes and has been thoroughly researched because it of its potential practical applications.  It is thought that manipulating transduction pathways can help [Fairweather: 2014].  Recently, such information has been applied in cancer research Ventura: 2009].
In this experiment intercellular signaling pathways using G-protein coupled receptors of Physarum Polycephalum were analyzed.  Specifically, the pathway in which inositol triphosphate (IP3) as the second messenger was the main focus.  In Physarum, Ca2+ concentration dictates the contractile activity of the cell, which is regulated by the diffusion of second messenger IP3.  Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect IP3 inhibition and activation would have on cell movement in Physarum.  Because IP3 plays a large role in cellular motion, we hypothesized that when IP3 is inhibited, Physarum would not be able to move even when an external stimulus, in this case food, was present.  On the other hand, when IP3 was not inhibited, the Physarum would be able to operate and respond normally to the external stimulus.


Materials and Method:
100 mm stock plate of Physarum growing on oatmeal-water agar was prepared.  Six water agar plates (3 controll and 3 test) were used.  The six plates were prepared according to Figure 5 and Figure 6.  Test plates were coated in IP3 inhibitor Neomycin (20M).  Oat flakes were used as food.  After set-up, plates were incubated for 18 hours and results were recorded.  Results were determined by the change in surface area which was calculated using Image J  (Figure 1).  
2-sample t_tests between the surface area of the Physarum controll plates and the surface area of the Physarum placed in water agar coated Neomycin plates were used to determine if any significent difference existed between no IP3 inhibitor and IP3 coated plates existed.  Critical values were when P&lt;0.05


Results:
Our results showed statistically significent data when comparing the movement of Physarum placed in water agar plates surrounded by oat flakes versus the motility of Physarum placed in a water agar plate surrounded by oat flakes coated in the IP3 inhibitor Neomycin (t_stat=3.47, d.f.=4, P=0.02).  IP3 is necessary to signal movement and is necessary to respond correctly to external stimuli.   


Discussion:
Our results showed that when IP3 in Physarum is inhibited, Physarum was not able to respond to an external stimulus, in this case food, and was not able to move toward it.  On the other hand, when IP3 was not inhibited, the Physarum operated and responded normally to the external stimulus, therefore it increased its surface area and moved toward the food. Ultimately, chemotaxis and motile activity was altered when Physarum’s IP3 messenger was inhibited by Neomycin and therefore our hypothesis is accepted.  
Physarum moves in an auto-oscillatory nature.  This vacillation is powered by the concentration gradient generated by movement in the endoplasm, that in which is caused by periodic contractions of ectoplasm.  These oscillations of contractile and movement are accompanied by the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions (the concentration increasing during contraction and decreasing during relaxation [Matveeva: 2011].  More specifically, contraction of smooth muscle is initiated by the increase in Ca2+, which triggers the binding of Ca2+ ions, ultimately leading to the interaction of myosin and actin to cause muscle contraction [Murthy: 1993].  This brief background offers a reason why Physarum was not mobile when its IP3 second messenger was blocked despite having food surrounding it.  Consider, the Physarum on the Neomycin coated water agar plate did not increase its surface area by moving towards the food because Ca2+ ions could not move to generate contractions and therefore power the Physarum.  Ca2+ ions were not able to form this concentration because IP3, the signal in that controlls the intercellular calcium concentration, was inhibited.  In general, our results suggested that signal transduction from receptor to target proteins, in this case using IP3 as a second messenger, enable Physarum to move.  Ultimately, IP3 release is a necessary condition for normal chemotaxis and migration of the plasmodium.
 In future variations of this experiment, it would be interesting to see what the effects of depleting Ca2+ levels would do to the motility of Physarum.  Because research suggests that oscillating levels of Ca2+ power the contractile process in the Physarum Polycephalum [Kochegarov: 2016], it would be intriguing to research exactly how much Ca2+ is needed to power the slime.  Additionally, we could research whether or not IP3 has the ability to recruit more Ca2+ ions when the Physarum was stimulated by its surrounding environment.  Lastly, research about what type of change in surroundings stimulated the Physarum to respond, and what exactly the response would be.  
Understanding the intercellular transduction pathways of cells is extremely important in the evolving world of medicine.  As the knowledge of signal transduction expands, it can be manipulated and utilized to treat certain types of disease and cancers.  For example, research has been conducted surrounding the idea of manipulating signaling molecules to controll cell migration [Phelps: 2017].  Research and knowledge surrounding the cell transduction pathway is valuable information that will one day be the face of the ever-evolving field of medicine.
