Title: Effect of colored light on photosynthetic rate of Spinacia oleracea (spinach) chloroplasts

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is key in the processes that contribute to life, it allows plants to convert light energy to into chemical energy. We wanted to extract chloroplasts and examine their isolated ability to carry out this photosynthetic process under varying environmental factors (colored light) with the easily extractable chloroplasts of (Spinacia oleracea) spinach. We hypothesized that the samples under just red or blue light would have a faster rate of photosynthesis, because blue and red light waves tend to be absorbed by the molecules in the chloroplasts, therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis and decreasing absorbance more rapidly. We calculated the percent change in absorbance of our samples after 30 minutes under their respective treatment lights.  There was significent difference between our white color and green color treatment groups, but our hypothesis that blue and red light would have the fastest rate was not supported. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is key in the processes that contribute to life, it allows plants to convert light energy to into chemical energy. Organisms that conduct photosynthesis are able to capture solar energy along with water and CO2 and utilize them to produce glucose, water and oxygen. Therefore, the products of photosynthesis contribute to energizing the plant and enriching its environment. Factors that produce changes in photosynthesis can have great effects on the plants’ production and growth. Chloroplast, namely are a critical component in the success of the photosynthetic process. One way to examine this photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts is to measure absorbance. We wanted to extract chloroplasts and examine their isolated ability to carry out photosynthetic process under varying environmental factors. A common environmental change that many organisms are subjected to is light conditions. Chloroplast absorb the solar radiation that the plant is subjected to, in chlorophyll molecules. The amount of each color light wave that is absorbed by the chloroplasts varies. A previous study showed that red and blue light produced more productive photosynthesis and plant growth, while green light had the opposite effect, and actually slowed the rate of photosynthesis (Yang et al., 2016). A good model organism for our study was (Spinacia oleracea) spinach because its chloroplast was easily extractable. Given that chlorophyll molecules often absorb red and blue light waves and reflect green, we wanted to examine the activity with one specific color of light compared with samples under other colors. We hypothesized that the samples under just red or blue light would have a faster rate of photosynthesis, because blue and red light waves tend to be absorbed by the molecules in the chloroplasts, therefore increasing the rate of photosynthesis and decreasing absorbance more rapidly. 


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, a system was created using chloroplast samples extracted from spinach leaves. In order to isolate the chloroplasts, we grinded spinach leaves with grinding buffer (20Ml) and filtered out the solid material. We centrifuged the solution once to remove debris and a second time to form the pellet that contained the chloroplasts. We added 200 μl of chloroplasts to 12 test tubes (3 for each color treatment) along with 2 Ml of DCPIP and reaction buffer. We set up four different lamps, each with one color bulb of the four treatments. Initially, we took a baseline absorbance reading of all of our samples at time 0 and then put three under each color light (white, blue, green, red) and we continued to record the absorbance every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. 

We collected these measurements in order to calculate photosynthetic activity through percent change in absorbance. We used the following equation: % change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100% . 
To complete a statistical analysis measuring the variance of photosynthesis between light colors, we used an ANOVA. This tested our null hypothesis that percent change in absorbance values will not vary across samples in different colored light. We set our significance level at 0.05


Results:
Based on the data there seemed to be an apparent trend in white light having the highest percent changes in absorbance. The ANOVA produced the following results (F-value= 5.05, d.f. = 3, P-value = 0.03) to report the statistical analysis of the variance between photosynthetic activity under experimental colored light conditions (Figure 1). 


Discussion:
The results of the ANOVA supported our statistical hypothesis that there was significent variance between the colors, however trends in our data did not support our expectation that red and blue light would have the highest rates of photosynthesis. The greatest variance in our data was between the mean percent change absorbance under white light and green light. While the averages are significently different, according to the Tukey-Kramer, one outlier in the sample data for green light had a very low percent change, bringing down the average. The large range in data points leaves the green light group with a standard error almost ten times the size of the other groups (Figure 1). Therefore, we believe that to be able to claim there is a significent difference between the effect of white and green light on photosynthesis, the experiment would need to be repeated with a greater sample size and a test for homogeny and normality of the data before conducting the ANOVA. 

Our expectation was that the chloroplasts would have the highest photosynthetic activity under the red and blue light, however our results demonstrate that white light produced the highest percent change. Similarly, in an experiment on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata), white light provided better growth conditions than red and blue light (Lin et al., 2013). Another experiment produced results closer to our expectations, reporting that plants had an increased photosynthesis rate and a greater amount of growth when grown under a red LEDs with some blue. However, their ultimate conclusions were reflective of our data in that, plants under white light had the most growth and production compared to the other colors (Goins et al., 1997). 

The general trend we found of white light producing the most photosynthetic activity is favorable for photosynthetic organisms in the natural environment because solar energy is most often in the form of white light due to its source, the sun. Thus, the chloroplasts that have optimum activity in the same light that their environment provides will be ideal for their plant’s growth and energy.
