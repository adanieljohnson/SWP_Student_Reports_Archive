Title: The Effect of Tetraethylammonium Chloride Blocker on the Action Potentials of the Rania Pipiens frog leg

Abstract:
Our specimen was the Rania pipiens, and is also known as the northern leopard frog. The Rania pipiens is native to both Canada and the United States. Our experimental group was injected with a potassium blocker called tetraethylammonium chloride, while our controll group was injected with a frog Ringer’s solution. Our independent variable was the frog leg that was not treated with blocker. Our dependent variable was the amount of twitches per leg. We used a pair t_test to find the statistical differences in our data. Our P-value was greater than 0.05; therefore, it was not significent. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
In frog legs, nerve impulses arriving at neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, which opens sodium channels that generate an action potential. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber which stimulates the release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This activates a contracting mechanism within the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. (Johnson) Pressure effects on the Ca2+ currents were studied in the Rania pipiens peripheral motor nerves. Pressure effects were stimulated by using ionic currents, Ca2+ currents, and K+ currents at the node and the axon terminal. The K+ current was reduced by withdrawing the recording electrode. (Koketsko) Other experiments have been made by determining what other stimuli can generate action potentials in the Rania pipiens leg, such as laser stimulation with infrared heat. Laser-stimulated action potentials in the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens are made using two infrared lasers have be measured. (Payton) Ionic currents in immature, ovulated Rania pipiens oocytes were studied using a voltage-clamp technique. The K+ current was only present in the youngest oocytes. The K+ current reversed the resting potential and produced an after hyperpolarization at the end of each action potential. (Johnson) Our hypothesis is if the Rania pipiens leg is treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. The purpose of this lab is to better understand action potentials and muscle contraction. 

Materials and Method:
We examined the effects of the potassium blocker on the Rania pipiens frog leg. Tetraethyl ammonium chloride was the potassium blocker used in this experiment. We looked for twitches caused by action potentials. We began by obtaining a frog leg and peeling back the skin. We then isolated the sciatic nerve and cut the achilles tendon at the lowest point. Then we tied a string to the end of the tendon and attached the other end to the force transducer. We then set the parameters of the stimulator to the threshold of .3 v and 1 pulse and hit apply and record on the computer. We used amplitude to measure the action potentials of each leg as a controll group and as a experimental group by using increments of voltage of 0.3 amps, 0.4 amps, 0.5 amps, 1 amps and 2 amps. We would stop when the twitch was visible and record the amplitude and resting period. We then performed the same process on the experimental group. Prior to firing, we injected the blocker with a syringe to the same frog leg and allowed it to rest for 3 minutes. After the experiment we disposed of the frog legs in the waste container and disposed of the syringes in the biohazard carton. The leg in the controll group was injected with frog Ringer’s solution. The leg in the experimental group is injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride. We used a pair-t test to determine our statistical figures in this experiment. We also measured the relaxation period of each action potential.

Results:
-The controll groups had higher amplitudes than the experimental groups. Three adult legs were put in each group. The controll group was soaked in frog Ringer’s solution. The experimental group was injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride, which is a potassium blocker.
-The controll groups had longer relaxation periods than the experimental groups. Three adult legs were put in each group. The controll group was soaked in frog Ringer’s solution. The experimental group was injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride, which is a potassium blocker. 
A trend was evident within the  in the action potentials in the Rania pipiens leg that were blocked by the tetraethyl ammonium chloride blocker. The frog leg response amplified as the stimulus increased. Since a greater stimulus was applied to the frog leg, a greater response was triggered, as can be seen in the data. This is inversely related to leg two in which the action potentials were less intense in the experimental group than in the controll group. The mean in regards to amplitude of the controll group was statistically different than of the experimental group (t_stat=0.2728, d.f.=14, P-value=0.86). There is not a significent difference between the controll and experimental groups for amplitude because our calculated P-value is greater than 0.05. 

Discussion:
There was no significent difference in the controll groups and experimental groups because our P-values for amplitude were so high. The p_value was a 0.79. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis which was if the Rania pipiens leg was treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. The legs treated with the potassium blocker had three to five action potentials throughout the course of our experiment. Experimental leg one and experimental leg three had five action potentials that we were able to measure. Experimental leg two had three action potentials that we were able to measure.  Another way to block potassium in Rania pipiens leg is to use pressure effects by stimulating potassium currents at the node and axon terminal (Payton). This blocks potassium in the brain of the Rania pipiens which would block potassium directly in the Gastrocnemius muscle of the leg.
