Title: How Azamax Inhibits Growth and Molting of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is an insect that relies heavily on hormones to ensure a normal development. The two main hormones that are used to regulate its growth are Juvenile hormone and ecdysone. If the caterpillar is fed food with an ecdysone blocking drug in it, I hypothesized that it would inhibit the growth significently. I did this by giving the drug to four caterpillars and normal food to four. This experiment resulted in my hypothesis being supported. This is important to demonstrate the large impact of hormones on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. This order includes all moths, butterflies, and skippers. It has a life cycle that has 8 main steps to it. Normally, this insect has a life cycle of 39-48 days. The insect begins as an egg, before going through five different instar larvae phases. It then becomes a pupa where it develops into an adult for 19-23 days, before it becomes an adult moth. 
	Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone are the hormones that controll this lifecycle. When the insect has enough nutrients, it triggers JH and ecdysone to be secreted. This increase in JH and ecdysone causes the insect to molt. Another important point in the lifecycle is the commitment pulse, which is characterized by low levels or JH and a slight increase in ecdysone. JH and ecdysone are both vital in the normal growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars.
	Azamax is an ecdysterone inhibiting chemical. Azamax is extracted from the neem seed kernel. Since a slight increase in ecdysone is needed to signal a molt, by putting azamax into the caterpillars food, it will block ecdysone from being secreted. Because of this, whether the caterpillars molt or not could be affected so therefore the growth of the caterpillar could be affected.
	We are investigating the effects of Azamax to determine whether the block of ecdysone will have an impact on the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Will these caterpillars be able to mature successfully and grow into an adult moth? Will the caterpillars not be able to mature correctly due to the hormone imbalance?
	We are asking this question because it is significent to understand the effects that hormones play in the development and life cycle of Manduca sexta. It is important because this information could be useful in creating a pesticide for this insect. We need to know specific lengths and weights of the caterpillars that have eaten Azamax and compare those to our controll group to see how this drug affects the growth and molting of these insects. We also need physical observations to determine if anything has changed about the physical appearance of these insects.
	The null hypothesis in this experiment is that the Azamax will have no effect on the caterpillars size or on the molting process of the caterpillar. Our experimental hypothesis is that the caterpillars fed Azamax will be grow less because the drug will prevent them from molting. We expect that this will significently alter the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars and prevent it from becoming a pupa. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in their fourth instar larvae phase were randoMly split into two groups of four. One group was the experimental group and the other was the controll group. We placed each caterpillar in its own section of a plastic container. Each day of the experiment, we fed all eight caterpillars ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet. In the diet for the controll group, we added seven drops of water. In the diet for the experimental group, we added seven drops of Azamax. We recorded the mass, length, and physical observations each day for seven consecutive days. All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars were kept in an incubator set to 23°C with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness for the duration of the experiment. After seven days, we analyzed our data by calculating the p_value and t-value of both the weight and the length of the caterpillars. We also analyzed our data using graphs of both the weight and the length.


Results:
At the conclusion of our experiment, our treatment group was significently smaller (both by weight and length) than our controll group. As displayed in both Graph 1 and Table 1, the average weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the controll group was much greater than that of the experimental group. As seen in Table 1, the controll group had an average weight of 9.925 g at the end of the eight days while the experimental group only had an average weight of 2.14 g. 
Graph 2 and Table 2 display the difference between the length of the caterpillars in the controll and the experimental group. As shown in Table 2, the lengths were also very different between the two groups after the eight days. The average length of the controll group was 7.68 cm while the average length of the experimental group was only 5.1 cm. Although these two values are not as vastly different as the weights were, there is still a clear discrepancy between the lengths of the two groups.
 Table 3 displays the p_value and the t-value of the weight and length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. As shown in Table 3, p_value for the weight was 0.049575, which is lower than the p_value for length. This means that there is around a 4.96% probability that this discrepancy in the weights of the two groups is due to chance. Because the p_value is below 5%, the difference of weights is statistically significent. As is also shown in Table 3, the p_value of the length was 0.104441. This means that there is around a 10.4% probability that this discrepancy occurred because of chance. Because this value is over 5%, the difference in weights is not technically statistically significent. It is important to note that a possible error in measuring the length of the caterpillars is that they are vastly different lengths depending on whether they are stretched out or not. This leads to the conclusion that their weight is a more accurate method of measuring growth.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by this experiment because we expected the Azamax to inhibit growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. As clearly shown by the difference in weight of the two groups, the caterpillars were unable to grow normally in the presence of this ecdysterone inhibiting drug. This result proves the importance of ecdysone in the life cycle of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Without the slight increase in ecdysone that normally occurs in combination with the increase in JH, a molt cannot be triggered. Since a molt creates a larger exoskeleton so that the caterpillar can grow, the absence of this hormone prevents growth of the caterpillar.
	This information is important because it reveals the effects that ecdysone has on Manduca sexta caterpillars. This information could be good for possible pesticides that attempt to prevent these caterpillars from molting and becoming moths. Because Manduca sexta caterpillars are known to eat tobacco plants, a tobacco company may feel inclined to use this drug as a pesticide to ensure that their plants are not eaten by caterpillars.
