Title: Azadirachtin Hindering Growth in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
	This experiment seeks to examine the effect of the insect growth regulator, azadirachtin, on growth in Manduca sexta, an insect commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta are considered pests when in worm form, so the manipulation of their growth is commonly studied. The dependent variable of interest was the growth, measured by weight, of the Manduca sexta. The independent variable was the food as half of the caterpillars received food mixed with azamax, which contains 1.2% of azadirachtin, while the control group received food mixed with water. We hypothesized that the experimental group would experience hindered growth compared to the control group. The weights of the caterpillars were measured each day for one week. It was found that azadirachtin does stunt the growth of the Manduca sexta, as the differences in average total changes in weight were statistically significant.

Introduction:
	Hormones are essential to the development of organisms such as insects. In this experiment, the development of the Manduca sexta will be manipulated. The Manduca sexta’s common name is the tobacco hornworm and it is in larval stages as a caterpillar before it becomes a moth (Johnson, 2018). Since they are pests as caterpillars, researchers are commonly interested in how to prevent their growth. Additionally, they are optimal experimental subjects as much research regarding their stages of development has been performed. By blocking the necessary growth hormones, methods to prevent or delay their transformation can be found. The most essential growth hormones in Manduca sexta are ecdysterone and juvenile hormone. Ecdysterone refers to a collective group of steroid hormones called ecdysteroids which are released by the prothoracic glands. It regulates the timing of molting in insect development. The amounts and ratios of ecdysterone and juvenile hormone work together and control molting, growth, and metamorphosis. A slight rise in ecdysterone during 5th larval instar, called the commitment pulse, signals a series of chemical and physiological changes that lead to metamorphosis (Johnson, 2018).
Azadirachtin is a chemical derived from the neem tree that blocks the functioning of ecdysterone (Dorn A, Rademacher J, Sehn E.1986). Schlüter (1985) found that the chemical effects endocrine mechanisms by reducing the titer of ecdysterone. In their experiment, growth was inhibited in the Manduca sexta that had been injected with azadirachtin. Our experiment also seeks to identify the effects of azadirachtin on the growth of Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis is that if we treat the experimental group with azamax it will decrease the weight of the treatment group when compared to the control group as the azadirachtin will inhibit the growth signals created by ecdysterone. The dependent variable is, therefore, the growth of the larvae while the independent variable is the inclusion or lack thereof of azamax in the larvae food.

Materials and Methods:
	First we divided four plastic containers into halves using index cards. Next we collected 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and placed them the separate sections. Using a marker, we wrote on four of the sections “control” and the other sections “Azamax” and numbered each section from #1 through #8. Next we weighed each caterpillar using a scale to obtain the starting weights. To make the food, we weighed out 40 ml of caterpillar food and added 1.148ml of water for the control group. The same process was then repeated except 1.148ml drops of 1.2% azadirachtin azamax were used for the experimental group. We then formed the food into balls. Both lumps of food were then divided into four smaller lumps of 10g and placed in the containers. Each evening, one group member weighed each caterpillar and added food when there was none left. After eight days, we cleaned out the containers and disposed of the caterpillars. We then calculated the average weights for each day and the total change in weight for each caterpillar. Next a two-sample T-test was done to find out if the total changes in weight of each group were statistically significant. 

Results:
The tobacco hornworms in the control group grew to be larger than those in the experimental group at an average weight of 9.44g compared to 2.30g on day 8. A T-test found the change in weights of the control group to be statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 12.32, df = 6, P = 1.74E-5). The standard deviation for the azamax group with an average of 1.155g was .92g while the control group had a standard deviation of .71 and an average of 8.83g. The variance of results for the experimental group was therefore greater compared to the control group. The changes in the average weights between days were consistently greater for those in the control group. For example, the average weights for days 3-5 for the control group were 1.10g, 1.30g, and 1.92g, while the average weights for the experimental group lagged behind at 1.66g, 1.89g, and 1.98g. This did not hold true for the first two days meaning the experimental group was, on average, larger to begin with. The starting average weight for the experimental group was 1.15g and was 1.10g for the control group. The average overall change in weight for the control group was nearly 8 times as great as the experimental group at 8.33g compared to 1.16g. 

Discussion:
The results suggest that our hypothesis was correct; azamax does hinder the growth hormones in Manduca sexta causing them to not grow as much compared to the growth of a control group. The average weights for day 8 demonstrate just how dramatic the growth differences are. The change in weight was always lesser for the azamax group which demonstrates that the effects on the growth were consistent throughout the week. The greater standard deviation for the experimental group signifies that the effects of azadirachtin didn’t have as consistent of effects on the Manduca sexta growth as the water (or lack of azadirachtin). It would be logical to assume that the azadirachtin successfully blocked or reduced the amount of the ecdysterone hormone which promotes growth, as supported by Schlüter et al (1985) and Dorn et al (1986).  If we had administered the experiment for longer, it would be likely that the control group would enter pupation as they would become large enough and have sufficient ecdysterone for the commitment pulse. The experimental group would have likely remained in a larval stage.
One could also speculate that azamax hindered the juvenile hormone instead as it also plays a large role in development and works closely with ecdysterone in processes such as molting and metamorphosis. Rembold et al (1984) found that azadirachtin completely inhibited juvenile hormone in Locusta migratoria, so it is possible that similar effects are true for Manduca sexta (Schlüter et al, 1985). One possible error in this experiment is that the Manduca sexta ate different amounts of food and therefore ingested more or less water or azamax. We couldn’t exactly control how much they were eating. If I were to re-administer this experiment, I would double the number of caterpillars used to increase the data and the number of trials. I would also give them food in smaller portions and track how much they were consuming to be able to factor that into an analysis of the data. 
By hindering growth in the Manduca sexta, this experiment furthered the idea that hormones play a crucial role in the life cycles of organisms and that these cycles can be manipulated for the convenience or curiosities of mankind.

Four Manduca sexta were in each group and given food mixed with either water or azamax containing azadirachtin. Each caterpillar was weighed every day for eight days. Each bar represents the average total change in weight. The error bars are ±1.34 for the control group and ±1.48
