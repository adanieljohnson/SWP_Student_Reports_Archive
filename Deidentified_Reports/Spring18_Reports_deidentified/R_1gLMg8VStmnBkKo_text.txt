Title: Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Calcium plays a fundamental role in the neuromuscular junction as it triggers the formation of an action potential. Certain compounds can serve as calcium blockers, like Lanthanum Chloride, inhibiting the release of calcium and therefore preventing a muscle contraction. Through three frog legs, with the sciatic nerve exposed, the effectiveness of Lanthanum Chloride is tested and recorded on a myogram. We hypothesized that the frog legs treated with Lanthanum Chloride will have decreased contraction strength than those that were not treated with the inhibitor.    



Introduction:
Skeletal muscle consists of thousands of myofibers innervated by motor neurons. The axons of the motor neurons innervate individual myofibers at the neuromuscular junction (Thyagarajan, 211). The effectiveness of the neuromuscular junction can be tested, specifically with frog legs. In summary, the process is as follows: acetylcholine is released from the pre-synaptic nerve terminal, binding to the receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber. This opens sodium channels which in turn generate an action potential (Usherwood, 553). Eventually, the muscle contracts. To test the neuromuscular junction, a calcium blocker, specifically Lanthanum Chloride, can be injected onto a frog leg. This will prove that calcium is fundamental to muscle contraction. We therefore hypothesize that Lanthanum Chloride will inhibit calcium in the neuromuscular junction, reducing the contraction and resulting in a decreased voltage when shocking a frog leg. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs are experimented on, each shocked at their lowest amplitude that produces a contraction, referred to as the threshold. The amplitude is multiplied by 1.25 for the following trials (three in total). The first set of trials is labeled control, not injected with the calcium blocker, and the next set is labeled treatment for each for each frog. Both frog legs will have their inner thigh muscles separated to expose their sciatic nerve. The nerves are then freed from the connective tissue. Two electrodes are placed in the gastrocnemius and are attached with a cord to an apparatus. The contraction of the control is measured with a myogram. The control and treatment are tested three times to determine validity. 

Results:

 As depicted by the graph (figure 1), the control group is exponentially higher than the treatment group with an average difference of 0.07 volts. This trend is consistent with all three legs. From the table (figure 2), we can verify the reliability of the experiment and the likelihood of repeating the experiment successfully. All data was measured through repeated contractions on t


Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported since the treatment group, the group that was injected with Lanthanum Chloride, produced a minimal contraction compared to the control group. Looking at figure 1, we can deduce that the average voltage for the control was 0.137 and the average voltage for treatment was 0.083 volts. The voltage for the frog legs treated with the calcium inhibitor are naturally not as effective, as limited calcium was released  allowing for a decreased likelihood that neurotransmitters are realsed onto the synaptic cleft (Neal, 4) . The table (figure 2), implies a relatively successful experiment with minimal chance of error, as seen in the standard deviation of 0.043 and 0.052. This therefore proves that calcium inhibitors are indeed effective and minimize the voltage of a contraction. This can be applied to the medicinal field, where certain diseases are caused by lack of sufficient calcium in the neuron.

Figure Legends: 
The graph depicts the average voltage for control and treatment measured from the three trials in each leg. The values are directly correlated to amplitude and are achieved by subtracting V2-V1. Essential data depicted in the figure includes P-value, t-critical value, and standard deviations.
