Title: Rate of Aggressiveness in Male Betta Splendins in the presence of shelter vs. no shelter.

Abstract:
Male Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are known to be very aggressive towards another male betta Splendins. According to previous research betta fish expend a lot of energy displaying aggressive behaviors. Therefore, we hypothesize that two betta fish will show a decrease in aggressiveness when they are exposed to each other with shelter vs. no shelter. We assume this because if given the chance to not have to expend energy the betta fish would choose to conserve energy. We used 6 male betta fish and performed 3 replicates testing the time the fish were being aggressive in no shelter vs. shelter for 5 min each followed by a 5 min rest. We then quantified this into an average from the 6 fish into a rate of agnostic behavior. Our results did not support our hypothesis because they showed an average increase in aggressive behavior in the presence of a shelter. According to statistical testing, our results were not statistically significent. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing the t_test.

Introduction:
We tested to see if there is decrease in aggressiveness between male Betta Splendins, "betta fish" when a shelter is present. Male Betta Splendins are known to be very aggressive towards each other through a series of ritualized displays of behavior. Displaying of aggressive behaviors benefits both of the fish because they have the opportunity to resolve the conflict without actually having to fight. Engaging is a physical fight is very dangerous for other of the fish because they have the same skill set. On the other hand, always showing signs of aggression towards other Betta Splendins has an increase in metabolic rate meaning the fish expend a lot of energy by displaying these behaviors [Castro: 2006]. There have been studies done testing the difference in aggressive when two male Betta Splendins are exposed to an audience. [Dzieweczynski: 2012] That research has been on the external factors being living organisms. The could potentially be a difference in aggressiveness if we add an external factor but one that is not living, shelter. We hypothesize that two betta fish will show a decrease in aggressiveness when they are exposed to each other with shelter vs. no shelter.

Materials and Method:
First, we placed two betta fish in a tank that is separated by a glass and plastic divider so that they couldn't see each other. Then we took out the plastic divider, leaving only the glass divider, and observed for 5 min. We had three people timing for this part: one-person timing 5 minutes, the second person timing fish 1 aggressive behavior and the third timing fish 2 aggressive behavior. After 5 minutes we placed the plastic divider between them again and let them rest for 5 min. During that time, we placed two shelters in the tank, one on fish 1's side and the other on fish 2. We then removed the plastic divider once again and observed for 5 minutes. Once again, we had three people timing: one-person timing 5 minutes, the second person timing fish 1 aggressive behavior and the third timing fish 2 aggressive behavior. We repeated this two more time to have a total of 3 reps making sure they had 5 min rest between each test. With this information we converted the time to decimals and then calculated the average time of aggressiveness in the fish with shelter and without shelter. The average time the fish spent aggressive with no shelter was 0.418 and for with shelter the average time was 0.445. To see if our results were significent or not we used a paired t_tests comparing shelter and not shelter aggressiveness as our statistical analysis. The alpha value we compared our results was .05, meaning any p_value of under .05 meant that the results were significent.

Results:
Individually 4 out of the 6 fish showed a decrease in aggressiveness when a shelter was present. However out experiment was based on the average of the results. Therefore, our results showed an average if .445 in aggressiveness when there was a shelter present, .027 higher than the average aggressiveness of no shelter present which was .418. The standard deviation was 0.353 for the shelter and 0.400 in non-shelter. After a paired t_test was done we determined that our results were not significent (t_stat = 0.421, d.f. = 5, P = 0.691). Our dependent variable resulted in a P-value greater the alpha value of .05 (P = 0.05 or less), which means that there was no statistically significent difference between aggressiveness levels based on a shelter being present of not. 



Discussion:
Our results indicated that our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Our results after statistical testing using a paired t_test with the basis that of a p value lower than .05 is significent, our results were not significent. The presence of a shelter actually increased the average aggressiveness of the 6 fish, however four of the fish showed a decreased in aggressiveness but it was proven insignificent because of their paired t_tests. While the presence of a living audience had an effect on betta fish in previous research our results seemed to conclude that external factor of shelter had no impact on the aggressiveness of Betta Splendins [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. In terms of future experiments, we noticed that in the first replicate we performed, the fishes were the same size, this is the rep where the fish increased aggressiveness with the shelter. The next two reps we did, there was one fish that was larger and one that was smaller and they both showed a decrease in aggressiveness. Therefore, if done again I would make two experiments one that has the fishes the same size and the other with one fish that is larger and the other smaller. Also a bigger tank could help as well because the shelters were far too large for the tank and there could be an anomaly with that as well.
