Title: The effect of Lathanum Chloride on muscle contraction

Abstract:
Calcium triggers contraction by reacting with regulatory proteins that in the absence of calcium prevent interaction of actin and myosin. In actin regulation, troponin and tropomyosin regulate actin by blocking sites on actin required bonding with myosin; in myosin-linked regulation, sites on myosin are blocked in the absence of calcium (Szent-Gyorgyi, 1975). In our experiment, we want to test what will happen to a muscle contraction if we effect the calcium channels. We will do this by introducing a calcium blocker, Lathanum Chloride, into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog’s leg. We used a high voltage stimulator to stimulate the systemic nerve of the leg and measured the contraction using a myogram. The data did not support our hypothesis; the threshold measured the same for both the control and the Lathanum groups were the same. 


Introduction:
Skeletal (striated) muscle is the muscle that is attached to bones and is responsible for body movement. Contraction of the muscles is triggered by calcium. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum initiates the contraction of the muscle, and after, calcium is taken up and the muscle returns to a relaxed state. In this experiment, we will be testing the effects of a calcium blocker, Lathanum Chloride, on the contraction of the skeletal muscle of a frog leg. The release of Ca2+ from storage sites in the sarcoplasmic reticulum activates the contraction of the muscle fibers and the re-uptake of Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum relaxes the muscle. We hypothesize that the contraction of the leg will be inhibited by the introduction of Lathanum Chloride into the Gastrocnemius of the frog’s leg. We expect to see this in the myogram of the contraction with a higher threshold for muscle stimulus. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to measure these contractions, we will apply a stimulus, generated by a high voltage stimulus isolator, to the gastrocnemius of a frog leg. We will use a pad and pins to hold down the frog leg around the gastrocnemius and systemic nerve. We will insert the probe of the stimulator into the systemic nerve in order to apply a stimulus and record the myogram. We will use ringers (electrolytes) on the exposed frog leg to keep the muscles hydrated. We will measure the contractions of three frog legs with three control groups and three experimental groups. In the control group, no Lathanum Chloride will be added; in the experimental group, 0.2 mL of Lathanum Chloride (1mM) will be injected into the gastrocnemius, 0.1 mL injected at the top of the muscle and 0.1 mL at the bottom.


Results:
The results suggest that our original hypothesis is not supported. We were looking for the threshold of the control group to be a lower amplitude than the threshold of the experimental group. However, for all three trials, the threshold was reached at the same amplitude for both the control and experimental. Though, there was a difference between the force of the experimental and control group contraction at threshold. The force of the contraction (in volts) for the experimental group was weaker than the force of the contraction in the control group in all three trials (see Fig. 1). We used a two-tailed unpaired t-test. The results were that our findings were statistically insignificant (p=0.4036, P&lt;0.5). 


Discussion:
In the end, our hypothesis was not supported. This could be for a number of reasons. For one, we may not have used enough Lathanum Chloride in order to see a significant difference in the change of the contraction. Also, we tested amplitudes going up one tenth (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3…), but maybe if we had tested at every 0.05 (0.0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15…) then we would have seen a slight change in threshold or more of a change in the force of the contraction. Or if we had continued to measure contractions after threshold was reached, the data might have shown more significant change. For further research, we would test the effects of either more of or a higher concentration of Lathanum Chloride, or another calcium blocker; or, test for the contraction force at more amplitudes instead of comparing when the groups meet threshold.
