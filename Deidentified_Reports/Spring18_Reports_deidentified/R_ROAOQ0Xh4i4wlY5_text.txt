Title: The Fertilization of Pisum Sativum Resultes in Growth of the Phosphorous Fertilized Plants 

Abstract:
-In this lab setting, the class engaged in manufacturing their own experiments using different plant species. Each group in the class was to analyze the way in which plants allocated their resources, analyzing the R:S values, when under certain environmental stressors. In our particular group we were given a field pea plant species called Pisum Sativum. We decided to test the effect of fertilizer on our plant species and thus, chose nitrogen and phosphorus. The group decided to have nine plants in total, which resulted in three groups of three. The result of the experiment was equal growth in both the roots and shoots of the plants fertilized with phosphorous and the control, indicating no environmental stressor. There was no growth (and thus no R:S values) at all for the plants fertilized with nitrogen, suggesting a issue. The lack of growth from the nitrogen fertilized plants is easily understood because the plant is of the legume family and is constantly fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. The addition of nitrogen fertilizer with the nitrogen that the plant was constantly producing resulted in an over-fertilization of the plant and thus no growth. The growth of the control, which lacked both nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization, can be attributed to the nature of the plant,

Introduction:
The plant that our group was assigned was a species of field pea plant, scientifically named Pisum, Sativum. Pisum Sativum, also known as "the common pea" and originates from the Mediterranean basin and Near East.  The pea plant is a legume, which is a plant which is known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Legumes are often utilized by farmers in order to reintroduce nitrogen in nitrogen deficient soil, allowing farmers to plant other nitrogen consumer plants, like that of cotton or corn. [Fabio, 2017]  The important biological concept of this lab is to observe the behavior of plants when put under specific stress in order to better understand how they function. Understanding how plants function, especially under stress is beneficial because it helps researchers understand a plant’s needs,m which then can be taught to farmers to result in more abundant harvests. In this lab the group decided to observe the amount of growth, as well as, how the root to shoot ratio was affected in pea plants when exposed to nitrogen, phosphorous, or neither (the control). Nitrogen and phosphorous are both key elements that facilitate an organisms success in a given environment. A lack of nitrogen can negatively affect cell division and the relative growth compared to a nitrogen satisfied pea plant. The lack of nitrogen will result in plants being shorter than usual, having smaller leaves, and stunted maturity. [Snyder, 2011] Plants cannot survive without phosphorus, because it forms the backbone of many pivotal molecules and facilitator in energy transfers. A low availability of phosphorous results in environmental stress and often will result in losses in crop production. [Daque, 2012] The importance of this experiment is to understand the effects of specific fertilizers on the growth of legumes. It is important to understand which fertilizers benefit which plants that way farmers can obtain the maximum output of their crops, which will then lead to the lowering of high crop prices, and thus the feeding of more people. I predict that the plants that are exposed to phosphorous and nitrogen will result in an equal root to shoot value because the plant will have satisfied all its needs, however, the control group will show an unbalanced root to shoot value as it will most likely allocate more resources to its roots in order to seek out the much-needed nitrogen. 

Materials and Methods:
In the experiment, we obtained seeds of the pea plant species Pisum Sativum. The experiment also calls for the two types of fertilizer, phosphorus and nitrogen, as well as, nine planting pots, miracle grow, ruler, scissors, vermiculite soil, and water. The first step of the experiment was to fill all nine plant pots with the vermiculite soil. The next step was to label three of the nine pots "nitrogen", three "phosphorous" and three with "neither" or "control", which represented the control. Once all the pots were labeled, we mixed in the fertilizers. After mixing in the fertilizers, we planted the seeds. We planted about 5-6 seeds in each pot and added miracle grow and water. Once the miracle grow was added and the seeds were watered, the plant was placed in an area where it would obtain enough sunlight. The final step was to leave the plants in this sunlit area for two weeks and be sure to water them on a daily basis. After the two weeks the group obtained the plants to observe what had happened. We cut the plants where the color change occurred in order to observe the difference in the root and shoot growth, in order to determine where the plant had allocated most of its resources.  We recorded our observations and analyzed the data. The group measured the roots and shoots separately in order to determine the ratio. We also performed a two sample T-test to analyze the authenticity of the data. 

Results:
The data gathered from the experiment resulted in no growth (no R:S values) in the nitrogen fertilized plants, however, in the control and the phosphorous fertilized plants growth was present. The phosphorous and control groups had equal root to shoot values indicating that the plants had all their needs satisfied. The mean value for the nitrogen plants was zero considering that those plants showed no signs of growth, and thus no margin for error. [Table 2] The phosphorous fertilized plants resulted in a mean root to shoot value of 1.01 and a standard deviation of .17. [Table 1] The control resulted in a mean root to shoot value of 1.03 and a standard deviation value of .27. [Table 3] The group decided to perform a T-test on the data to analyze its statistical value. A T-test is acceptable to use in the case of the experiment, because the nitrogen showed no signs of growth, thus we decided to perform the T-test on the two sets of data we had, phosphorous and the control. The P value for total growth for the roots and shoots was 0.058727. The P value for Root to Shoot weight was 0.646884. The P value for the root to shoot length was 0.932641.

Discussion:
My hypothesis was not entirely supported because the phosphorous did indeed have an equal root to shoot value, but so did the controlled plants. The nitrogen fertilized plants also experienced no growth and thus further disproving my hypothesis. The root to shoot value was also smaller in these plants seeing as it had more growth from the shoots. The phosphorous plants being legumes already had nitrogen and phosphorous, thus not many resources were allocated to the roots to find those necessary life building minerals. The plant that our group was given was a legume plant. Legumes are known for their nitrogen-fixing characteristics and thus lack the need for nitrogen fertilizer. Plants that are exposed to too much nitrogen will result in the "burning" or simply over-fertilization of the plant causing it to not be able to grow. [Albornoz, 2016] The limitations of our experiment were that we used miracle grow in order to help facilitate rapid growth, however, miracle grow has components in it such as phosphorous and nitrogen which may have resulted in the growth of our control. The phosphorous fertilized plants had equal root to shoot values. The phosphorous plants grew very lush due to having the nitrogen from the nitrogen fixing nature of the legume plant and fertilized phosphorous which satisfied its needs and thus why the R:S values are similar. The phosphorous plant did not need to allocate its resources to either the roots or shoots because it was given all the things it needs such as nitrogen, phosphorous, sunlight, and water. If I were to repeat the experiment I would not use the miracle grow. Another limitation of our experiment was the lack of the ability to keep the plants separate from one another. Our group kept our plants close together so they would not be lost, however, that could have possibly lead to the contamination of the other plants due to water runoff. The next step to this experiment would be to test without the addition of miracle grow and perhaps use a plant that is not in the legume family, in order to observe the effects of nitrogen on plants.
