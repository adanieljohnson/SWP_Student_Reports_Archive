Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Blocker Aza Guard on the Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In this experiment, we used Manduca sexta caterpillars in order to test the effect of a growth hormone blocker on their development over the course of seven days. The Manduca sexta is a species of insect that is holometabolous. This growth and development through molting is controlled by hormones such as Ecdysterone. In this experiment, we used an Ecdysterone blocker in order to see its effect on the growth of several of these caterpillars. This was done by feeding a control group of caterpillars regular food, and an experimental group food that had the Ecdysterone blocker Aza Guard added to it. Through thorough analysis of our attained data, we accepted our hypothesis that if the caterpillars are fed food with Ecdysterone blocker, then the molting will be inhibited causing a decrease in overall growth.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect that goes through the process of metamorphosis during its life cycle. Through this process, it transforms from an egg to larva, followed by transformation into a pupa, and finally it becomes an adult. These developmental changes are due to two main hormonesin body. These hormones are known as Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Ecdysterone affects the timing of the development of these insects, or its molting. Juvenile Hormone controls the type of molting that the insect undergoes. Altering the levels of these hormones in the insect could possibly affect its development, which is what this experiment was designed to test. [Johnson: 2016] We used an Ecdysterone blocker, Aza Guard, in order to see its effect on the growth of the caterpillars. This group hypothesized that if the caterpillars are fed food with Ecdysterone blocker, then the molting will be inhibited causing a decrease in overall growth.

Materials and Methods:
In order to perform this experiment, we used Manduca sexta caterpillars, Manduca sexta food, an Ecdysterone blocker called Aza Guard, containers, and a weight scale. 
We chose eight caterpillars, splitting them into two groups of four: the control group and the experimental group. We mixed 20 drops of Aza Guard into 40 grams of food which we divided evenly into the four experimental groups. We mixed 20 drops of water into 40 grams of food to give the control group. Over the course of a week, we weighed the caterpillars and the food remaining for each. We also replenished the food supply every day after recording the data. We analyzed the data we recorded by using a Paired T-Test.

Results:
Over the course of seven days, our data indicated a significantly larger increase in the growth of the caterpillars in the control group versus the much more meager increase in the growth of the caterpillars in the experimental group. A Two-Sample T-Test revealed that the average growth for the experimental caterpillars was only 1.775 grams, meanwhile the average growth of the control caterpillars was 7.635 grams. Through this statistical test, we also discovered the t-Value of our data to be 11.49 and the P-value to equal 2.6E-5. We also noticed clear behavioral and appearance differences between the caterpillars of the control group and those of the experimental. With time, the caterpillars belonging to the experimental group became less active. They remained small and thinner than the control group caterpillars. Their coloring also became a lot darker and browner over time. On the other hand, the control group caterpillars thrived, becoming larger and plumper than they were on Day 1. They retained a rich green color, whereas the experimental turned dark and brown. They also remained active throughout the experiment, much more active than the experimental caterpillars. 

Discussion:
Through analysis of the recorded observations, our hypothesis appears to be correct. The data shows that the group that was fed Ecdysterone blocker failed to grow as much as the control group that was not fed the blocker. Since Ecdysterone is known to affect the timing of insect molting, inhibiting the release of Ecdysterone in the experimental caterpillars would keep them from molting in regular time. In our experiment, blocking the Ecdysterone hormone release caused the caterpillars to grow substantially less and become small and frail by the end. Several studies support such a hypothesis regarding the effect of Ecdysterone and thus the effect of blocking it. For example, the article titled "Second Messengers and the Action of Prothoracicotropic Hormone in Manduca sexta" supports the idea that Ecdysterone "stimulates the ecdysteroid peak responsible for pharate pupal development." [Smith: 1993.] Therefore, were we to block this hormone, the caterpillar would be unable to correctly molt into its next developmental phase. This would also affect and inhibit its regular growth. Our experiment demonstrated this, thus rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternate hypothesis. This shows a correlation between the hormone Ecdysterone and the development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. To further support this conclusion, this experiment could be performed again with a larger experimental and control group. It could be tried using a different Ecdysterone blocker. Perhaps, the experiment could also be attempted using an Ecysterone mimic in order to see the effect of an increase amount of Ecdysterone. This could further prove the effect Ecdysterone has on this insect's development.
