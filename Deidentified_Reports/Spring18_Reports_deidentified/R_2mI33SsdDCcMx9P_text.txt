Title: The effect of common household water pollutant on photosynthesis activity on Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is used every day by plants, protists, and bacteria and can be greatly affected by common household pollutants. Photosynthesis, a process in which organisms consume light energy and synthesize chemical energy through different steps, can be affected by many outside factors, like laundry detergent. By using different dilutions, 10% and 20% percent of Tide Free and Gentle on Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgari, we were able to isolate the chloroplast and measure the change of absorbance of each treatment in 10-minute intervals of 30 minutes. This change was then used to measure the percent change in the photosynthesis rate. We hypothesized that with higher the dilutions of laundry detergent in Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgari, they both would have the lowest photosynthetic rate. The chloroplast with no laundry detergent would then have the highest photosynthetic rate. Our results showed there was no significant difference between the four treatments, therefore we accepted our null hypothesize. This insignificant difference could be because the time was too low for the laundry detergent to effect the chloroplast.  It could also be because the dilutions of the laundry detergent were not high enough to change the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
All living organisms must directly or indirectly withdraw energy from one or more sources. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, protists, and some bacteria capture and store light energy from the sun and turn it into chemical energy, also known as glucose. The glucose is broken down by the plants and used in many other different biological processes. The chloroplast, an organelle in plant and algal cells, conducts photosynthesis by a three-step process. The first two steps are light-dependent, in which the use of light helps power photosynthesis, and yield the most ATP from the ATP synthesis. The last step is light-independent, in which the enzyme RUBISCO uses ATP and NADPH to combine a 1-carbon CO2 molecule and a 5-carbon ribulose phosphate molecule to synthesize a 6-carbon glucose molecule. The equation for this process is 6 CO2  (carbon dioxide) +   12 H2O (water) --------------->  C6H12O6  (glucose) +  6 H2O  (water) +  6 O2 (molecular oxygen) [Johnson: 2016]. Photosynthesis is a very complex system with many mechanisms and factors involved that can influence the rate of photosynthesis. A crucial environmental factor that has been shown to influence photosynthesis is laundry detergent [Azizullah, Richter, PeterHader: 2014]. 

Laundry detergent, a common water pollutant, is used in many households every day. Washing machines are connected with pipes to sewage for the discharge of dirty water with high concentration of detergent. This water is then released into local lakes, rivers, and groundwater where the plants take in this highly concentrated detergent polluted water. This has been shown to inhibit growth because, after 1 to 5 days, metabolic activity in plants have ceased [Jovanic, Bojovic, Panic, Radenkovic, and Despotovic: 2010]. 

By isolating chloroplast in both Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris, we were able to measure the effects of 10% and 20% dilutions of Tide Free and Gentle laundry detergent on photosynthesis. Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris were used in the experiment because they both contain so much chlorophyll, which helps plants absorb the energy from light.  We hypothesized that both the spinach, Spinacia oleracea, and chard, Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris would have the highest absorbance and the lowest photosynthetic activity at the highest dilution of laundry detergent. We predicted this outcome because it has been shown that with the increasing concentration of detergents, there have been large disturbances to the ATP synthesis. The detergent has been shown to block ATP synthesis, therefore depleting the ATP abundance in the cell, and thus changing the outcome of photosynthesis [Aizdaicher and Markina: 2005]. Since ATP synthesis is a very important role in photosynthesis, the depletion of the ATP will slow down the light-dependent reaction, resulting in a change of the light-dependent reaction. With a slower rate of the light-dependent reaction, there will, in turn, be a slower rate of glucose synthesized. The independent variable is the dilutions of laundry detergent and the dependent variable is chloroplast in both Spinacia oleracea and Beta vulgaris subsp. Vulgaris.

With this in mind, we predicted that the rate of photosynthesis will go down and reduce the products of photosynthesis created. 

Materials and Methods:
       To begin the experiment, the mortar, and pestle, medium-sized breaker, and 3 50ml  centrifuge tubes were placed in a tub of ice to cool. The 4 leaves of chard and spinach were stripped of their veins and added into the mortar and pestle separately. For each leaf, there was 10ml of cold grinding buffer added to the mortar and pestle and were both grinded until the spinach and chard were a thick paste. Finally, 10ml of more cold grinding buffer was added, and the slurry was strained through layers of cheesecloth into the chilled breaker. 
	The B pellet was used because it contained the most chloroplast. To prepare the B-pellet, it was put into the RT-7 centrifuge twice, first for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm and then for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. Then the remaining pellet was suspended by adding 20ml of grinding buffer. 23 test tubes were used to make the 23 different substances, following the preparation guideline in Table 1. There were 3 test tubes for each, spinach plus chloroplast with no laundry detergent, spinach plus chloroplast with 10% laundry detergent, spinach plus chloroplast with 20% laundry detergent, chard plus chloroplast with no laundry detergent, chard plus chloroplast with 10% laundry detergent, and chard plus chloroplast with 20% laundry detergent. To dilute the laundry detergent, we used Tide Free and Gentle and did 1/10 laundry detergent to diluted H20 for 10% and 2/10 laundry detergent to diluted H20 for 20%.  Two blank solutions were prepared, one containing spinach and one containing chard. The tubes were then transferred into 23 cuvettes, to measure the absorbance by using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance was read at 600nm every 10 minutes for 30 minutes and was blank before the spinach reading and before the chard reading. The cuvettes were placed at room temperature with normal light in between each reading. 
	After all of the data collected, the equation % absorbance change=(absorbance at time 0-absorbance at time N)/(absorbance at time 0) was used to measure percent chance in absorbance after each time interval. The statistical test used was a two sampled t-test for % Change in DCPIP Absorbance over Time in Various Spinach Treatments and % Change in DCPIP Absorbance over Time in Various Chard Treatments. 


Results:
     The results from the following chard experiment show that having chloroplast with no detergent had the largest percent change, meaning it had the highest rate of photosynthesis.  The chloroplast with 20% dilution of laundry detergent then had the second highest rate of photosynthesis with a final average percent change of 9.6% after 30 minutes. This was slightly above chloroplast with 10% dilutions of laundry detergent having a final average percent change of 6.1% after 30 minutes. This shows that laundry detergent in chard did not make a huge difference with different dilutions. But in whole had an effect on photosynthesis because without detergent the final average percent change was 20.8% after 30 minutes. The results from the following spinach experiment show that having chloroplast with no detergent yielded the most percent change, meaning it had the highest rate of photosynthesis. The 20% dilution of laundry yielded a final percent change average of 6.7% after 30 minutes while the 10% dilution of laundry detergent yielded a final percent change average of 4.6% after 30 minutes. This, similar to the findings of the chard experiment, the spinach experiment held the smallest yield of percent change with the 10% dilutions, showing it has the smallest photosynthesis activity. 
	Even though it seems apparent that there is a significant difference in the changes of the percents, the ANOVA test showed there was no significant difference in both the spinach and chard experiments. The ANOVA calculated a p-value of .866, .699 and .599 with respect to 10,20 and 30 minutes in spinach with 10% detergent and a p-value of .408, .967 and .818 with respect to 10, 20 and 30 minutes in spinach with 20% detergent. The ANOVA calculated a p-value of .225, .241 and .223 with respect to 10, 20 and 30 minutes in chard with 10% detergent and a p-value of .393, .364 and .283 with respect to 10, 20 and 30 minutes in chard with 20% detergent. Since all of the p-values are greater than 0.05, we can conclude there is no significant difference between chloroplast with detergent and chloroplast without detergent.  

Discussion:
Due to our insignificant results, we accept our null hypothesis that laundry detergent will have no change on the rate of photosynthesis. A reason that the photosynthetic rate did not change could be that there was not enough time to change the effect of the chloroplast. In one experiment, the plants were grown with laundry detergent for 21 days while we only showed the effect of 30 minutes [Jovanic, Bojovic, Panic, Radenkovic, and Despotovic: 2010]. Another experiment measured the effect of 24 hours on motile cells, which shows that we probably did not have a significant difference because of the timing [Aizdaicher and Markina: 2005].

Another reason that the percent change was not significant could be the dilutions we used for each test. 10% and 20% may not have been the strongest dilutions, and therefore they probably had a small effect on the photosynthetic process. In one experiment they used diluted laundry detergent of various amounts, the highest being 1000ml of detergent [Azizullah, Richter, PeterHader: 2014]. 

Due to these facts, a follow up experiment could test if more dilutions of laundry detergent had an effect on chloroplast with a longer span of time. The more highly concentrated the laundry detergent is, the more effect it could have on the rate of photosynthesis and the longer the detergent has time to change the rate of photosynthesis can greatly improve the outcome of the experiment. 

Overall, understanding the effect of common household environmental pollutants, like laundry detergent, can help us reduce the effect of slowing down photosynthesis. This study also helps us understand the whole photosynthesis process and helps one understand where they should grow plants, how their plants can be healthy, and when the plants can be grown. Due to the significant importance of agriculture in our country, this study can help improve the system and save money for the agricultural industry.
