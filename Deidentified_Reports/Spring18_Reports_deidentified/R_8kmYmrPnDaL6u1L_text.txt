Title: The impact of understory light on the growth of the roots and shoots of the plant Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
The root vegetable Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus was studied under the imposed conditions of green cellophane wrap around the plant compared to clear cellophane wrap. The hypothesis of the study is that the experimental group would allocate more resources to the shoot part of the plant instead of the root in order to compensate for the different color of light being absorbed by growing larger shoots to receive more light. The results showed that the green light had an impact on the experimental group and did cause the plants to grow larger shoots than the controll group. Six plots were used in this experiment and five individual plants from each plot were measured for weight and for length. The idea that the green light encourages allocating resources to the shoot may influence growers who wish for larger stems and do not care for the roots to grow or vice versa.

Introduction:
The organism Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus is a plant native to Europe. It is a root vegetable that is known for its vast root syshoots and is often used as a cover crop in agriculture. The experiment that was conducted compared the root and shoot growth of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus in green tinted light and in unfiltered light. The green tinted light was chosen in order to emulate the light filtered through an understory of a rainforest. High intensity green light generally promotes plant growth, but in the understory there is no way to ensure of high intensity green light (Johkan M, Shoji K, Goto F, Hahida S, Yoshihara T. 2012). The Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus does grow best under high intensity light and prefers acidic soil (Warwick SI and Francis A. 2004). Plants allocate resources differently based on the type of resources they receive the most of in their habitat; if a plant receives less water, then resources will be allocated more towards the growth of root syshoots in order to capture enough water to sustain the plant. As expected, the same distribution of resources is seen in the relation between the plant and the amount of receivable sunlight (Johnson AD. 2018) . The Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus under the green filtered light, the independent variable, will allocate more resources to the shoot growth, the dependent variable, than its counterpart in the unfiltered light because of the need to compensate for the lack of the full range of light. This specific organism was chosen in this experiment model because of its ability to grow in many climate conditions and its hardiness as a plant (Warwick SI and Francis A. 2004).


Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted in a greenhouse under controllled conditions. To insure strong statistics, six small plots of the plant were planted, three for the controll and three to be tested under the implemented independent variable. Seeds were liberally scattered across the plots of soil. To emulate the understory of a rainforest, a supporting structure that enveloped the entire nine plants was constructed and green cellophane wrap was wrapped around it. The plants were then watered once a day for two weeks. After the two weeks, one plot from each group of three was extracted and water was used to diffuse the soil’s grip on the roots. Five individual plants were retrieved from each plot and those plants were cleaned of the soil. They then were weighed as a full plant and that was recorded. The plants were then cut at the meeting point of the shoot and the roots, indicated by a color change on the plant. The shoot was measured in length and in weight as was the root. The RS ratio (root to shoot ratio) was recorded for the length and for the weight. The two tailed t_test was used in order to obtain significent statistical data for the experiment.

Results:
To accurately assess the hypothesis, the averages of the three groups of the controll and the three groups of the experimental group were compiled and a two tailed t_test was run on the data. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the data and the p_value of the data was 0.04647. The weight of the shoots were measured in grams. The same test was run with the same groups, but this time testing the length of the shoots. Again, the error bars are representative of the standard deviation of the data. The shoot length held a p_value of 0.058247. The length was measured in millimeters. 

Discussion:
The results upheld our hypothesis; the shoots on the plants that underwent the experimental treatment had more overall growth than the shoots on the controll plants. However, the statistical significance of our graphs did vary. Using a base p_value of .05, the data of the shoot weight was statistically significent with the p_value of 0.04647. The data of the shoot length was not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.058247. Although the shoot length was not significent, the shoot weight was and both the shoot weight and length for the experimental group was larger than the controll group. The next step for this study would be to continue the question further and wonder if the green light would help the entire plant, which would be the root as well, grow better than the controll.
