Title: Impact of Precor on the Growth of the Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that has a life cycle between 39-48 days. We studied them in their fourth instar. Over the course of a week we fed the controll group food that was diluted in water and we fed the experimental group food that was diluted with precor solution. Precor is a hormone that mimics juvenile hormone. The dependent variable was mass and length, while the independent variable was the diet. The larvae were housed in an incubator. We used a two sample t_test to find the statistical differences in our data.  The mean in regards to mass of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group. The mean in regards to length of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis was that the the greater concentration of food soaked in precor solution inhibits the growth of the Manduca sexta, but food soaked in precor encouraged growth of the Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes butterflies, moths, and skippers. M sexta has many common names including sphinx moth, hawk moth, tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx. The Holometabolous life cycle of the M sexta is between 39 to 48 days. A Holometabolous life cycle is a life cycle that contains an egg/embryo stage, a larvae stage, a pupa stage, and an adult stage in which the larvae and adult do not look similar because of major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis. The development of the Manduca sexta is controllled by the Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. Manduca sexta typically have 5 larval instars, separated by molts (Johnson, 2018). Larvae of Manduca sexta typically have a fourth larval instar on day 0 of their fourth instar (Bollenbacher et al., 1987). Other experiments have been done on Manduca sexta. One in particular introduced hemocytes into the Manduca sexta’s environment to determine when the hemocytes would encapsulate the Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta were raised on an artificial diet at a 26 degree C under a photoperiod of 16L: 8D (Levin et al., 2005). Another experiment done on the Manduca sexta was one in which their diet was varied to determine effects on growth, composition, and maturation. Larvae received artificial diets in which protein, sucrose, and water content were varied. They measured the growth of 30 larvae over two time scales which began in the third instar to the end of the fifth instar and also over daily periods within each instar. All larvae were checked in the morning and in the afternoon so that they could observe the molting time. They calculate their overall growth rate as well. (Ojeda-Avila et al., 2003). Our biological question is, if the Manduca sexta Larvae are fed food soaked in precor solution, then will they have a smaller average increase in mass and length than if the Manduca sexta are soaked in a cortisol solution? We asked this biological question because we wanted to compare our experiment results to the results of the growth of the Manduca sexta in the Ageratum houstonianum, floss flower, study results in which we inferred that floss flower may contain juvenile hormone or a hormone similar to juvenile hormone. Our hypothesis is that the greater concentration of food inhibits the growth in mass and length of the Manduca sexta.

Materials and Method:
Over the course of a week, we fed a group of three Manduca sexta caterpillars 50 grams of food soaked in 1 Ml of precor solution with 4 Ml of precor per 100 Ml water per day. Each day we recorded our visual observations which included the physical appearance of our caterpillars, as well as, the percentage of food that they ate. We will also be feeding a group of three caterpillars 50 grams of food without the precor solution which was the controll group. The experimental group was the group of caterpillars being fed the solution. The dependent variable was the mass and length of the caterpillars after the experiment. The independent variable was the diet. The experiment was performed in a controll environment. The organisms were housed in an incubator that was set at 37 degrees Celsius. We used a two sample t_test of our data.

Results:
A trend in the mass of the Manduca sexta is that the Control 2 and Experimental 2 larvae had the largest increase in mass. The mean in regards to mass of the controll group was statistically different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.182, d.f. = 6, P = 0.86). There is not a significent difference between the controll groups and experimental groups for mass because our calculated P-value is greater than 0.05. A trend in the length of the Manduca sexta is that the Control 2 and Experimental 2 larvae had the largest increase in length. The mean in regards to length of the controll group was statistically different than that of the experimental group  (t_stat = 0.038 , d.f. =6, P = 0.971). There is not  significent difference between the controll groups and experimental groups because our calculated P-value is greater than 0.05.
 


Discussion:
There is no significent difference in the controll groups and experimental groups mass and length because our p_values for mass and length were so high. The p_value for mass was a 0.86. The p_value for length was a 0.97. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis. Our hypothesis was that the the greater concentration of food soaked in precor solution inhibits the growth of the Manduca sexta. The growth of the Manduca sexta was not inhibited by the precor solution because our controll larvae and experimental larvae grew in mass and length every day. A way to improve this study would be to analyze the impacts of different hormones that mimic juvenile hormone on the Manduca sexta larvae.

Figure Legends: 
Figures 1. Graph of the difference in mass (in grams) in the experimental and controll groups. The controll hornworms were slightly lighter than the experimental hornworms on average. Eight fourth instar hornworms in the controll group were given food soaked in water. Eight fourth instar hornworms in the experimental good were given food soaked in precor solution. The hornworms in both groups had no observed abnormalities. Mass was measured on a scale. Each bar is the mean mass of all of the hornworms from each treatment or controll group; error bars are +/- 2 s.d.

Figure 2. Graph of the difference in length (in centimeters) in the experimental and controll groups. The controll hornworms were slightly shorter in length than the experimental hornworms on average. Eight fourth instar hornworms in the controll group were given food soaked in water. Eight fourth instar hornworms in the experimental good were given food soaked in precor solution. The hornworms in both groups had no observed abnormalities. Length was measured from the head of the hornworm to the end of their bodies. Each bar is the mean mass of all of the hornworms from each treatment or controll group; error bars are +/- 2 s.d.
