Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Development of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. These pests are present in much of the American continent and are used in a variety of biological scientific experiments due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle of only 38-48 days. Insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are controlled mainly by two hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In this experiment, we utilized Martin's IGR which mimics juvenile hormone. The experimental group received 10 grams of food every other day with 3 drops of Martin's IGR. The control group received 10 grams of regular food with 3 drops of water. All eight caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 23 °C in 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light. We compared the weight and length of caterpillars over eight days. A two-sample t-test was carried out to compare the means from the weight and lengths of the control group and the treatment group. In conclusion, we rejected our hypothesis which stated that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar will prohibit proper development and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. These pests are present in much of the American continent and are used in a variety of biological scientific experiments due to its easily accessible nervous system and short life cycle of only 38-48 days. Within this short holometabolous cycle, they go through four major changes: egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. Manduca sexta has five larval instars, which are separated by ecdysis, or molting. Insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are controlled mainly by two hormones: juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. During insect development, ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting. During development, juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt.
Normally Manduca Sexta have five larval instars, separated by molts. Up to the fourth larval instar, JH levels stay fairly high. Near the end of the fourth larval instar period, JH starts to drop slightly, and there is a large increase in ecdysterone. During the fifth larva instar, JH levels drop very low. Additionally, there is a small rise in ecdysterone, called the commitment pulse. It is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth. This is the first time in the caterpillar's life so far that it has been exposed to rising ecdysterone and very low JH simultaneously.
In this experiment, Martin's IGR is used. Insect growth regulator ultimately interferes with the normal function of the corpus allatum- the organ responsible for secreting JH. In simple terms, IGR mimics juvenile hormone. "One of the earliest observations of IGRs was accidental. Researchers observed that cultures of linden bug had low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults" (Tunaz 2004). Due to this discovery, one is able to make the same assumption when determining the effect of  IGR on Manduca Sexta. In our experiment, we will test the effect of adding increased amounts of Martin's IGR to the diet of Manduca Sexta. The independent variable is the diet that the caterpillars are given, and the dependent variable is the size and length of the caterpillars. Our hypothesis is that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar in the Manduca Sexta will prohibit proper development and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph (or 6th instar).


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta were selected that were about to enter the 5th instar weighing 2.6 to 3.9 grams. We placed them into two different groups, 4 caterpillars to each group. The experimental group received 10 grams of food every other day with 3 drops of Martin's IGR. The control group received 10 grams of regular food with 3 drops of water. All eight caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 23 °C in 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light. Every day for seven days, the weight and length of each caterpillar was recorded. A two-sample t-test was carried out to compare the means from the weight and lengths of the control group and the treatment group.

Results:
Both groups grew in similar ways. They grew in size in length and then around day 4-5, the weights and lengths of the caterpillars started decreasing.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, we can reject our hypothesis which stated that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the fifth larval instar will prohibit proper development and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph. This is due to the fact that the weight and length of the control group and the treatment group were very similar in value. Additionally, there was one caterpillar in each of the groups that molted. Ultimately, it was difficult selecting eight Manduca Sexta that were all in the same stage of life. Some of the caterpillars were very large and could possibly have already entered the fifth larva instage. If this was the case, Martin's IGR would be ineffective in stopping pupation. Ultimately, we were unable to make a conclusion on the effect of Martin's IGR on entering the fifth larval instar in the Manduca Sexta due to the time constraint placed on the experiment.
