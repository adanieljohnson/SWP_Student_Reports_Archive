Title: Effects of a Precor Hormone Concentration in 4th Stage Instar Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Manda Sexta caterpillars have a holometabolous life cycle, meaning 4 phases of development, the fourth stage being an adult. In this experiment, the larvae or 4th instar Manda Sexta caterpillar was studied. In this lab, the effects of a synthetic hormone, precor, on insect development was studied. The precor was added to the food of half of the caterpillars while the other half of the caterpillars received water and food instead. Our group believed that precor would act as a growth stimulant causing those caterpillars who received it to grow faster than those who did not. Data was collected over the course of a week and averages found per day were used to see if precor caused any notable changes. The caterpillars that consumed the precor laced food were found to not gain weight as easily as those caterpillars in the control group. Overall, we rejected our hypothesis, as the calculated p-value proved that the data was statistically insignificant. The addition of the synthetic Juvenile Hormone, precor, caused caterpillars to stay juvenile for longer, hindering their growth over time which was noticeable by comparison to the control group caterpillars. 

Introduction:
Manda Sexta caterpillars are blue green insects with small appendages appearing to be "hooks" on their back. They are classified in the Lepidoptera Order, which is home to butterflies and moths (Johnson AD). These caterpillars have a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that they go through 4 different phases, which the fourth stage being and adult. They begin life as an egg/embryo, then become larvae, pupas, and finally adults. In this experiment, the larvae or 4th instar Manda Sexta caterpillar is being studied. Two main hormones Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone work together to move the insect through the cycles. 
In this lab, we will be testing the effect of a synthetic hormone, precor, on these caterpillars in order to study its effect on insect development. We know that it is necessary for these caterpillars to have interactions between Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone, both growth and development hormones (Johnson AD)- for their survival, so we will be studying the subjects to get a better idea of how precor effects growth and development. In other studies, a similar derivative of JHA, methoprene, was found to effect insects that were considered "pests". This derivative caused negative growth and development and proved to be slightly toxic to the affected insects (Retnakaran, 2006). However, oppositely, we believe that if we were to treat a number of caterpillars with a given amount of precor hormone, then the caterpillars would grow larger at a faster rate than those who did not receive the precor hormone. While these Manduca Sexta Caterpillars are pests in the outside world, we believe that in a more controlled environment, where the food is slightly laced with the JH rather than treated completely, the effects will be different, and much more conducive to positive not negative growth. (Retnakaran, 2006). Essentially, it was thought that caterpillars that consumed the precor laced food would gain more weight in comparison to the other caterpillars in the control group. This would make the precor an independent variable and any recorded effect of it, the dependent variable in this particular experiment. To monitor any process that the caterpillars are making, we plan to hold this experiment over the spans of a week, incorporating a daily feeding and weighing routine into the process to get a good look at what changes are and are not happening. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, we will begin by gathering a group of similarly sized caterpillars, weighing between 1 and 2 grams. Once the initial weights of the caterpillars have been taken, we would create each's own little ecosystem. These would be a group of 4 circular plastic containers divided in two by a white notecard. Each of the containers would be home to two of the caterpillars. The first two containers, which would soon contain caterpillars 1-4, were labelled the control group containers. Each division in the container received a lump of 10 grams of food. The control group would have a lump that wads softened by about 50µL water. Each lump was placed around the edge of the containers to ensure that the caterpillar had room to move around not on top of his or her food. The next group of two containers was made the same way, except the small lump of food received 5 drops of 1:1250 concentrated precor, a reagent, to soften it, making this group the experimental group. Each of these four caterpillars receiving the precor would notably be a part of the dependent variable being studied, whereas the precor would be the independent variable. The food for all of the caterpillars will be replaced every day, where the caterpillars would receive the 10 grams of water plus food combination in the control group and in the experimental group containing caterpillars 5-6, 10 grams of the precor plus food combination would be given instead. Every day this feeding would occur around 5 o clock in the afternoon so that there was consistency in both the feeding and weighing which would occur simultaneously. The results of this process would be recorded over a span of a week so that there would be enough data to either support or not support our hypothesis. In order to either prove or disprove our hypothesis, we used a two sample T test to compare the data received between the two groups, both experimental and controlled. This T test served to evaluate the averages of the two different groups to see if the data was statistically significant or not.

Results:
This is the data that was collected throughout the week in which the caterpillars were studied. Over the course of the week the average did indicate that the caterpillars who did not consume the precor laced food grew generally larger and weighed more than those who did consume it. The data in grams did indicate that every single day after the initial weighing, the control group caterpillars weighed a significant amount more than those tested in the experimental group of caterpillars. In all, the caterpillars that received the precor reagent concentration in their food weighed on average less than the control group. When looking at the results graphed, one can see just how the control group breaks off from the experimental group right off the bat. This shows just how the control group quickly gained weight in comparison the experimental group. A t-test was used to determine statistical significance, this gave us a p-value of 0.59. This generally proves that our data is not significant as any value more than .05 is not significant.

Discussion:
As indicated in the data above, there was a clear division early on that ultimately lead the control group caterpillars growing larger and heavier than the experimental group of caterpillars. Precor did not offer sufficient enough nutrition to cause the influx in weight gain that we had thought it would. The data disproves our hypothesis as it rather indicates that precor caused the caterpillars to take longer to mature and start to gain necessary weight. The independent variable rather than producing more weight gain, inhibited it. This might indicate that precor acts in a way that is similar to JH. JH inhibits growth as it is a hormone produced in order to keep an insect in its juvenile state. The precor most likely increased the potency of the already present and natural JH in the caterpillars that were part of the experimental group. 
There was a possibility of there being a recording error in the raw data listed above. In one of the control group containers, a caterpillar had eaten its way through a notecard, so there were two caterpillars on one side of the container. They were both from the control group, so average data was not really messed up, but this incident might have become some sort of source of error in the individual recorded weights between the caterpillars. They were caterpillars 3 and 4. To fix the problem, we replaced the divider and used sturdy tape to keep it in place. There could also have been slight error in feedings as the amount of food might have been slightly above or below 10 grams each time. This could have affected the potency of the 1:1250 precor reagent if there was less food by making it more potent, and if there was more food, the precor could have been less potent.
In other studies, precor, a derivative of a JHA, methoprene, was found to effect insects that were considered "pests".it caused negative growth and development but also proved to be slightly toxic (Retnakaran, 2006). This was data collected for interpretation of pesticides used over a large area of farm crops. Knowing this information on an outside and uncontrolled environment also effects the insects in a negative way helps to explain why we saw the results that we saw. The precor that was given to the caterpillars inhibited their growth, and according to the information seen in this aforementioned research paper, on agriculture and hormonal pesticides titled "Insect Growth- And Development- Disrupting Insecticides", caused slight toxicity of whatever was consumed, meaning their food (Retnakaran, 2006).
