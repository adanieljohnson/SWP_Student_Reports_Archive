Title: Methoprene and its effects on development in Manduca sexta caterpillar larva 

Abstract:
The primary objective of this experiment was to analyze the effects of a Juvenile Hormone analogue (Methoprene, in this case) on Manduca sexta caterpillar larva. Specifically, we hoped to find out if the addition of Methoprene to the food of caterpillar larva would increase their size significantly while also keeping them from molting and entering the next stage of development. 
Manduca sexta caterpillars are known for having a predictable pattern of growth that is regulated by hormones. We altered this pattern of growth by feeding half of our subject organisms a diet containing Methoprene (a hormone replicating JH) in hopes of engineering larger larval specimens. What we found at the end of our experiment was that the hormone we added as a replacement for Juvenile Hormone did not significantly affect the weight of our treatment group. 


Introduction:
The Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta) caterpillar is an insect found across much of the southeast. This organism is an invasive species that feeds on the leaves of many crops and is known for a predictable pattern of growth as a larva that is regulated primarily by Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Nijhout: 1974]. Ecdysterone is the hormone in insects that is responsible for the timing of molting that occurs during development. Juvenile Hormone is integral in regulating the type of molt in insects by exerting restraint on the cell processes responsible for molting [Williams: 1956].  
In this experiment, we wished to find out if Methoprene (a JH analog) would prevent molting in our caterpillars and lead to more comparative weight gain in subjects fed the prepared diet that included this chemical. Methoprene, which mimics JH, is often used as an insecticide because it prevents a caterpillar larva from progressing to its next stage of development in which it forms a cocoon and becomes a fully mature adult. We performed this experiment in order to find ways of preventing a caterpillar from developing into an adult organism and also to see if Methoprene would significantly increase weight gain in larva by acting as a JH analogue and thus blocking development into an adult insect. Methoprene could cause weight gain by blocking the physical development of a caterpillar into the next stage of development and causing the caterpillar to continue molting without reaching sexual maturity. Nutrients that may be utilized to promote sexual maturation might be redirected into tissue growth (which would thus increase size and weight).
In order to answer this question, we must have two groups of organisms to test. One group will be used as a control (against which we will measure the effects of a Methoprene diet) while the other group will be fed a diet in which the chemical has been added. The independent variable is the food fed to each group of caterpillars. The dependent variable is the change in weight of the caterpillars. We believe that feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars a diet containing Methoprene will alter growth hormones by mimicking JH secretion and thus increase their larval size. 


Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillar larva selected and then separated into two groups of 4 (1 control group and 1 test group). The subjects in the control group were fed a diet of caterpillar food mixed with 3 mL of water per 10 grams of food, while the subjects in the test group were fed a 10% Methoprene solution made with 0.15 mL of Methoprene per 10 grams of food. Each caterpillar was placed in an individual container and fed a predesignated amount of food. All subjects were kept in an incubator set at 23 degrees Celsius and the weight of each specimen was recorded daily for 8 days.

Results:
A general trend in our data showed that caterpillars fed a standard diet tended to grow larger than caterpillars fed a diet with a hormone regulator (Methoprene in our specific case). The average change in weight for caterpillars in the control group was 1.8475 grams while the average change in weight for caterpillars in the test group was 1.2475 (see Figure 1). The s.d. for the control group was 0.162762608 and the s.d. for the treatment group was 1.070903046. t-value: 3.411185. P-value: 0.014298. df: 6. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because caterpillars fed a diet that included Methoprene grew less than subjects fed a control diet, as evidenced by our P-value of 0.014298. By creating larger larva, we hoped to, in theory, create larger adult organisms that would thus have a better chance at survival because they would be more resilient and less of a target for predators. According to a study done by Frederik Nijhout and Carroll M. Williams [Nijhout: 1974], our hypothesis was in line with what is known about the growth and development cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. In their study it was determined that specified levels of JH in the 5th instar stage of development prevented the regular progression of development into adult insects, so adding a chemical to our prepared diet that mimicked this hormone should in fact produce larger larva. Development and weight gain are directly correlated because as an organism develops new systems and capabilities it must also develop structures to support those new systems (which would in turn lead to weight gain).
One error that occurred is that we did not clearly understand the feeding process involved in the experiment. We were supposed to replenish the caterpillar's food if it ran low but did not do this as we thought the food measured out on the first day of the experiment was all that each subject was supposed to consume. With this in mind, the results of our experiment varied to a degree large enough to note. If each caterpillar was fed in the method outlined above, I believe that we would have seen a larger increase in the growth of our treatment subjects. Also, the addition of Methoprene to the diet of our test organisms may have prohibited weight gain because of the role that JH (or any analogue thereof) seeks to perform as a growth regulator [Johnson: 2018].   
In addition to finding out that we can prolong the larval stage of Manduca sexta and thus prevent them from becoming adults that may destroy crops, we also know that since we can make larva larger, we can thus produce adult insects of a larger size by eventually stopping the secretion of JH and allowing a commitment pulse to happen and cause pupation [Johnson: 2018].
Moving forward from here, I would repeat this test and be certain to feed the caterpillars in a more consistent manner so that I can measure the effects that Methoprene has on weight gain in Manduca sexta larva without having to take into account any variances in feeding. By manipulating the levels of certain hormones in an insect it is possible to affect growth and development cycles in a way that either maximize or stifle the potential of insects.
