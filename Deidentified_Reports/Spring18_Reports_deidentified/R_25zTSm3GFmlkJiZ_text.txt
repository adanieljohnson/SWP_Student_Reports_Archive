Title: The Effects of Acetylcholine Receptor Inhibitor on the Muscle’s Ability to Reach Threshold

Abstract:
Rania pipiens, commonly referred to as Northern Leopard Frogs, are vertebrates that rely on the Somatic Neuromuscular System for punctual and necessary voluntary movement. The Somatic Neuromuscular System is made of motor neurons that are responsive to action potentials created by a balance of neurotransmitters and ions. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the shift in the contraction threshold from the controll group to the treatment group. We predicted that an introduction of acetylcholine receptor antagonizer into the muscle would cause the contraction threshold to increase. This experiment used four frog legs that were hung from a force transducer and their contraction threshold was recorded before and after 1 mM of tubocurarine was placed in the muscle respectively. A two-sample paired t_test proved that the results of the experiment were insignificent (t_stat= 2.0816, d.f.=3, P=0.1288). Thus, proving that the blockage of acetylcholine receptors has limited to no effect on contraction threshold.          

Introduction:
The somatic neuromuscular system is essential to voluntary movement, predatory protection and homeostatic function amongst vertebrates and invertebrates. Rania pipiens, commonly referred to as the Northern Leopard Frog, exemplify such functions throughout their life cycle. For this reason, R. pipiens are valuable to study for their ability to be maintained in laboratory settings and their simple body structures that aid in muscle contraction. The somatic neuromuscular system is composed of skeletal muscle that are “innervated by motor neurons,” within the gray matter of the spinal cord [Johnson: 2018]. These motor neurons extend into the myofibers within the skeletal muscle to create neuromuscular junctions.

When nerve impulses reach the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) is released into the synaptic cleft to bind to the ACh receptors on the post-synaptic terminals [Johnson: 2018]. This binding causes sodium channels to open, creating an action potential. The action potential stimulates the release of calcium that “activates the contractile mechanism” of the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. However, before muscle contraction can occur, the muscle must reach threshold. This process can be manipulated to stimulate weaker or stronger forces in contraction. For instance, when extracellular calcium is introduced into the muscle of a frog in a larger quantity than naturally occurs, the threshold for muscle contraction will increase with increased depolarization [Costantin: 1968]. Similarly, the effects produced by ACh can be “mimicked and antagonized” with the insertion of drugs into the muscle [Norris: 1988]. Therefore, raising the question, “Will the antagonization of ACh receptors prevent the muscle from reaching threshold?” To study this question, the independent variable would be the amount of ACh receptor inhibitor placed into the muscle. The dependent variable, on the other hand, would be the amount of voltage necessary for the muscle to reach threshold. We predict that when acetylcholine receptor inhibitor is injected into the muscle, the threshold for contraction will increase from its original threshold.    


Materials and Method:
The experiment was conducted using four Rania pipien frog legs to test muscle contraction. Before experimentation, the skin from each frog leg was removed. After the removal of the skin, the sciatic nerve was exposed by detaching the nerve from the connective tissue located on the ventral side of the frog leg. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle and a portion of the Achilles tendon was detached from the tibialis. Next, a string was tightly tied in a knotted loop fashion at the junction of the Achilles tendon and the gastrocnemus muscle. All excess string and muscle where cut to prevent interference with the experiment. Finally, the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended at a ninety-degree angle by pinning the leg to an experimental tray and hanging the muscle to the force transducer. Probes were laid underneath the sciatic nerve and the results of the contraction were recorded on myogram software. Ringers solution should be applied often to ensure the tissue remains moist for efficient voltage conduction. 

During experimentation, the threshold of each frog leg was tested respectively. Once the probes were attached to the sciatic nerve, a voltage impulse was recorded in increments of 0.1V until the threshold was determined. Once the thresholds were determined, a 1mM tubocurarine solution was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle with a syringe. This solution acts as a ACh receptor antagonizer. A period of twenty minutes was allotted to allow the tubocurarine to settle into the muscle. Then, the thresholds were tested respectively once more. A two-sample paired t_test was performed on the data to test the significance of change on the threshold capacity of muscle contraction before and after ACh receptor antagonizer was introduced into the muscle.           


Results:
The R. pipiens appear to demonstrate a general trend of gaining a threshold voltage of at least 0.1V after the ACh receptor blocker was introduced into the muscle (Fig. 1). Frog #3 demonstrated the least amount of growth by remaining at the same threshold voltage of 0.3V before and after the treatment. Frog #4, on the other hand, displayed the most growth by having a threshold at 0.4V before the treatment and 0.6V after the treatment. However, the mean of the controll group in comparison to the mean of the treatment group displays that a general increase of 0.10V was added to the threshold once the treatment was given to the frog leg (Fig. 2). A two-sample paired t_test was conducted to compare the controll group, the frog legs before the ACh receptor antagonizer was introduced into the gastrocnemus muscle, and the treatment group. In this experiment, the results were statistically insignificent (t_stat= 2.0816, d.f.=3, P=0.1288). These results suggest that the increase in threshold required to stimulate the muscle when the ACh receptor antagonizer is an insignificent factor.   

Discussion:
To test the significance of the data collected in the experiment, a two-sample paired t_test was conducted. The results of the paired t_test demonstrated that the mean of the controll group was statistically insignificent when compared to the mean of the treatment group (t_stat= 2.0816, d.f.=3, P=0.1288). Thus, the experiment’s hypothesis was not supported. When an acetylcholine receptor blocker is injected into the muscle, a significent increase in the threshold voltage should not be expected. As depicted in Figure 1, each leg responded to the ACh receptor antagonizer by increasing its contraction threshold by limited increments of 0.1V or 0.2V, if at all. Though the changes in threshold were measured and recorded procedurally, these small incremental changes in threshold could have been taken with mild muscle fatigue, which would slightly increase the contraction threshold, or the results of the myogram could have been read slightly off. In turn, recommending that alterations in ACh receptors have minimal effect on contraction threshold. However, research relating to the effects of ACh have rejected these ideas and have placed emphasis on the regulatory processes that ACh has on contraction threshold.
	A study that discusses the relationship between acetylcholine receptors and contraction threshold was conducted by Liley and North in 1952. This experiment investigated the effects of increasing tetanic stimulation on the “phrenic nerve-diaphragm strip on laboratory mice while comparing the response data to that of frogs [Liley 1952]. This study can relay to increasing contraction threshold of the R. pipiens because both species are vertebrates that rely on acetylcholine receptors to bind to the receptor sites on the post-synaptic membrane. In turn, reaching threshold for contraction and proceeding to tetany, the strongest contraction a muscle can produce. The researchers first determined the threshold of the frog, placing it on a range of high to low, and determined how the motor end plate potential could have affected this response [Liley 1952]. The results of the experiment displayed that with lower muscle thresholds, the end plate potential size was increased [Liley 1952]. In contrast, higher muscle thresholds tend to arrive with smaller end plate potential sizes. [Liley 1952]. This study found that contraction thresholds should not be reduced to a basis of chemical production in the pre-synaptic cleft. Rather, the physical size of the nerve endings can provide reasoning for the response collected from the threshold. 
	In summation, the contractile ability of a muscle in Rania pipiens are generally not limited to the chemical production or inhibition in the nerve. This experiment hypothesized that when an acetylcholine receptor antagonizer is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle, the threshold will significently increase. Though numerical data displayed a general trend of increase from the controll group to the treatment group, the paired t_test proved that this slight movement was statistically insignificent. In further studies of this hypothesis, the method of collecting data should be modified for a wider range of data collection. Once the controll group reaches the point of threshold, the researcher should go beyond the voltage to ensure that contraction after threshold was reached. The same process should be done again after the ACh receptor blocker is introduced into the muscle. By doing this process, the researcher will have a clear range of data that can demonstrate larger threshold growth. Knowing the body’s response to acetylcholine receptor blockers through the study of animals is important for application towards human medical emergencies. If a human were to have nutritional deficiencies, depleting their supply of sodium, calcium and potassium in the body, it would make it very difficult for the person’s somatic neuromuscular system to work properly. Thus, ruining their ability to walk. For this reason, medical teams would need to know the effect that this would have on acetylcholine to bind to the receptor site. The manipulation of the acetylcholine receptors would aid in recovering threshold potential to ensure that patient is rehabilitated slowly.
