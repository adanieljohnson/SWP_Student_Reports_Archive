Title: Precor decreases the rate of metamorphosis in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
	In this lab, we tested the effect of a juvenile hormone called precor on Manduca sexta growth. When administered to M. sexta during their final instar larval stage of life, precor can decrease the rate of metamorphosis. If 10 drops of precor are added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will grow at a slower rate compared to the controll caterpillars that had 10 drops of distilled water added to their food. To test this hypothesis, 4 caterpillars were assigned to the controll group and 4 caterpillars were assigned to the treatment group. Every day for 8 days, each caterpillar was massed and fed as needed (with 10 drops of precor or water added again). We found that the addition of precor to the diet significently decreased the rate of growth, thus supporting the hypothesis. This proves that precor serves as an effective pesticide against caterpillars. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, has a homometabolous life cycle. This life cycle consists of the stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. M. sexta is considered a pest when it reaches its adult stage. When it becomes an adult, it is a moth. Pesticides that fight against M. sexta often contain juvenile hormone (JH), which controlls growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the caterpillar [Goodman : 2013]. Precor, a type of JH, is used to test its effect on M. sexta weight. If 10 drops of precor are added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will grow at a slower rate compared to the controll caterpillars that had 10 drops of distilled water added to their food. 

Materials and Method:
	To perform this lab, 8 M. sexta were obtained from a biology lab company. 4 were designated as the treatment group and 4 were designated as the controll group. Each caterpillar was placed in one half of a plastic container, with a paper dividing it in half. Perforated lids were placed on top of each container to allow the flow of oxygen. Each caterpillar was fed 10 g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) food. 10 drops of 1: 1250 Precor was added to the treatment group's food, while 10 drops of distilled water were added to the controll group's food. Each day (for 8 days total), we weighed each caterpillar and recorded our data. As needed, we fed the caterpillars. When we were not weighing and feeding the caterpillars, we placed them in an incubator set at 22 degrees Celsius (although the temperature fluctuated slightly) to expose them to a controllled environment). 
	After collecting our data, we found the average of the treatment group and the average of the controll group and displayed the data in a bar graph. Then, we performed a t_test to determine the probability that our results were due to chance.

Results:
	There is not a significent difference in weight during the first 3 days. However, after the third day, there is a significent increase in weight among the controll group and a slower increase in weight among the treatment group. Additionally, as the days went on, the controll group ate more while the treatment group ate less. Additionally, the treatment group started losing its vibrant coloring and became more lethargic, especially after the fifth day. 
	After completing a paired t_test, I found t=2.53, the degrees of freedom=7, and p=0.0392. I came to the conclusion that my data is statistically significent because the value of p is less than 0.05, meaning there is less than a 5% probability that the data is due to chance. The standard deviation of the controll group is 4.10 and the standard deviation of the treatment group is 1.23. The standard deviation of the controll group is higher because the values deviate more from the mean and the weight increased more. The standard deviation of the treatment group is smaller because the values do not deviate much from the mean because overall they did not grow much. 

Discussion:
	Based on the data collected, I accept my hypothesis "If 10 drops of precor are added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will grow at a slower rate compared to the controll caterpillars that had 10 drops of distilled water added to their food." Consequently, I rejected my null hypothesis "If 10 drops of precor are added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will difference in the rate of growth compared to the controll caterpillars that had 10 drops of distilled water added to their food." The growth rate was significently slower for the treatment group compared to the controll group. A similar study was performed in which the juvenile hormone methoprene was used to regulate the growth of insects. Therefore, pesticides that contain juvenile hormones controll the development of pests as they regulate gene transcription [Harmon : 1995]. This proves precor is an effective pesticide against M. sexta when administered in their fifth larval instar stage of life. The hormone prevents the brain from secreting prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which promotes growth and molting [Nijhout : 1974]. 
	Possible errors may appear in this lab in Figure 1. Treatment #3 and Treatment #4 broke through the paper barrier and switched places at times. Therefore, the raw data values may not represent the respective caterpillar's weight. However, when conducting the t_test, the averages were used. Therefore, this error does make the final results any less reliable.
