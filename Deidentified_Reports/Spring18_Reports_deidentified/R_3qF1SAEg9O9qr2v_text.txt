Title: Effect of Tetraethylammonium Chloride on Muscle Relaxation Times in Rania pipens

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to test if blocking potassium channels in the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve would increase their relaxation time. The contraction of a muscle is caused by an action potential causing the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stored calcium ions into the sarcoplasm where they then bind to actin thus allowing myosin heads to attach and cause a muscle contraction. This necessary action potential is started by the depolarization of an axon which then carries this action potentials to the axon terminals causing a release of ACh. This ACh binds to receptor proteins on the muscle membrane continuing this action potential into the muscle cell ultimately causing a contraction. To test the effect of  tetraethylammonium Cl (TEAC aka potassium channel blocker) on relaxation time in muscles, three different Rania pipiens frog legs were used. Each frog leg acted as its own controll and then experimental group by first stimulating it without TEAC and measuring its relaxation period and then stimulating it after the injection of TEAC and measuring its relaxation period. This experiment produced inconclusive results. Statistical analysis deemed the disparity in relaxation times to be statistically insignificent even though graphical observations show the relaxatio

Introduction:
Underlying all movements in vertebrates and invertebrates is a complex neuromuscular system. Voluntary movement is controllled by skeletal muscles. These striated muscles are attached to bones of the body by tendons. The contraction of these muscles causes the bones, and correspondingly the limbs, to move. Wile seemingly simple on the outside, this is complex system with many parts. Muscles are composed of multiple bundles of muscle fibers. These bundles are made up of myofibrils which are further composed of actin and myosin filaments. The myofibrils are sectioned off into units of myosin. The interaction of these tiny filaments causes the contraction of the sarcomeres which ultimately causes a contraction of the muscles on a large scale. In order for a muscle contraction to occur, stimulation from a motor neuron is necessary. These motor neurons are synapsed to the muscle and receive an action potential signal from the spinal cord. This causes the motor neuron to release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) which then binds to the receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber. This continues the action potential into the muscle cell. As it runs down into the muscle cell through t-tubules, it causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release stored calcium ions. These ions then interact with the action, opening up the sites for the myosin heads to bind to create a contraction. In order to create this necessary action potential a stimulus has to cause voltage-gated sodium channels to open so sodium will exit the cell thus depolarizing the membrane. In order to polarize the membrane voltage-gated potassium channels open so potassium comes in. The sodium potassium pump then actively pumps two sodium back into the cell for every three potassium pumped out. This resets this voltage potential and concentration so another action potential can occur [Comparative Physiology]. However if potassium cannot come into the cell, then the membrane cannot be repolarized. Adding potassium blockers into this system would prevent this from happening. 

A study involving the outer hair cells of a guinea pig show this phenomenon as its “tetanic electrical field stimulation induces slow and delayed shortening of isolated outer hair cells” because “these responses were inhibited by tetraethylammonium” [Ohnishi: 1993]. Since this experiment already shows that blocking potassium channels slows electrical stimulation in hair cells, this then begs the question of how blocking potassium channels would affect a muscle. A good specimen to observe this in is a Rania pipiens (northern leopard) frog’s leg. Stimulating the sciatic nerve of a frog’s leg causes the gastrocnemus to contract. This contraction can be recorded by a machine which then measures the latency, contraction, and relaxation period of said contraction. It is hypothesized that if tetraethylammonium Cl ( TEAC aka potassium channel blocker) is injected in the gastrocnemus and nerve of a frog leg, then the relaxation period after the contraction of the gastrocnemus will take longer.  

Materials and Method:
To set up this experiment gather three Rania pipiens (northern leopard frog) frog legs into a dissecting pan. Take one of the frog legs and then, using forceps, grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull the skin down toward the foot, completely removing it from the leg like taking a glove off of a hand. Moisten the leg with frog Ringer’s solution. Take a dissecting probe and separate the inner thigh muscles starting at the upper end and extending toward the knee. Gently free the white sciatic nerve from its surrounding connective tissue using a dissecting needle and forceps. Take care not to agitate the nerve too much or have the metal from the tools come into connect with the nerve. Next, separate the gastrocnemus muscle from its surrounding muscle. Feel free to take a finger and use it to break the connective tissue anchoring the gastrocnemus onto the muscle anterior from it. Then, take dissecting scissors and cut the inferior end of the gastrocnemus muscle just below the achilles tendon (that way the achilles is still attached to the gastrocnemus). Cut with the tip of the scissors pointed inferiorly on the frog leg for best results. Following this step, pin the frog leg down to the dissecting pan in a way that the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus aer facing up. Tie a piece of string around the achilles tendon and then make a loop with the other end. Loop the noosed end of the string onto the hook of the force transductor. Adjust the height of the force transductor so the gastrocnemus is perpendicular to the pan and the rest of the frog leg. Connect the BNC connector to the BNC banana adaptor. Then secure the BNC electrodes underneath the sciatic nerve (be sure not to have the two wires cross). 
Once the setup is complete, the next task is to commence the actually experimentation. First, determine the minimum twitch threshold of the nerve by systematically increasing the amplitude of the simulator unil a response is measured. (Before doing this step shock the nerve at 1.0 amp to make sure everything is connected properly as a response twitch will definitely be seen at this voltage). Measure the amplitude, latency period, contraction period, and relaxation period of this twitch. This will be the data for the controll group. Now wash the muscle in tetraethylammonium Cl (potassium channel blocker) solution. Fill a syringe with 0.1Ml of this solution. Inject the gastrocnemus at a downward angle at the top and bottom. Save a few drips to wash the nerve with. Wait for 2-3 minutes for it to take effect. If the muscle begins twitching after injection, wait until twitching stops or becomes negligible so it does give a reading on the BNC connector. Then, stimulate the muscle again with the same minimum amplitude used for the muscle prior. Measure the amplitude, latency period, contraction period, and relaxation period of the muscle again. This is the data for the experimental group. Repeat these steps with each frog leg. Then compare the relaxation times between controll 1 and experimental 2; controll 2 and experimental 2; and controll 3 and experimental 3 using a paired t_test. 

Results:
As seen in Figure 1 there was a general trend for the average muscle relaxation time to be longer after the potassium channel blockers were injected. Table 1 shows that frog legs post potassium channel blockers took an average of 535 ms longer to relax than those prior. However, as Table 2 shows these values are not statistically significent as the paired t_test yielded a large p_value of 0.13596. Post TEAC injection frog leg 1 started contracting and spazzing uncontrolllably on its own accord without any electrically stimulation. Furthermore, the controll group for frog leg 2 was also twitching prior to any TEAC injection or electrical stimulation. Additionally, while the amplitude of the contractions for both controll and experimental groups of frog legs 1 and 2 were around 1 volt,  frog leg 3 had a significently lower amplitude ranging in the tenth decimal place. 

Discussion:
This experiment produced inconclusive results. Statistical analysis deemed the disparity in relaxation times to be statistically insignificent. However, graphical observations support the hypothesis that blocking potassium channels will increase the relaxation period after a muscle contraction since the relaxation times between the controll and experimental groups are visually significently different from each other. Even though the p_value from the paired t_test analyzed the data to be statistically insignificent, this large p_value was most likely due to the small sample size tested in this experiment. The graph in Figure 1 shows a large disparity between the average relaxation times of the controll group versus the experimental group thus supporting the hypothesis that potassium channel blockers increase the relaxation period of muscles. Furthermore, other experiments have produced data supporting this hypothesis. In an experiment involving tobacco plants, the “channel inhibitor (tetraethylammonium chloride) has been seen to partially reduced K+ efflux and lowered the percent of activated cells” [Breĭgina:2012].  As a result, if this experiment was to be conducted again, a more statistically significent p_value could be obtained by using a larger sample size. By making this adaptation, more conclusive results could be obtained.
