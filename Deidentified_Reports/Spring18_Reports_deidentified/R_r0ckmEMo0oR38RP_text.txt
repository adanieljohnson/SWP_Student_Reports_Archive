Title: Effects of A23187 on Physarum Polycephalum with Calcium

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a type of bacteria that can react to environmental changes; chemotaxis is a type of chemical reaction that a physarum can respond to. We tested to see what the effects of adding the activator A23187 were to physarum and if it can cause chemotaxis to occur when it is exposed to calcium. We expect the physarum to grow towards the calcium when with the activator over a 44-hour period. We tested it with a control group that does not include the activator and used a one-tailed two-sample t-test to check for significance. We put too much activator in the physarum which caused it to die, preventing chemotaxis. Based on other data we expected the physarum treated with the activator or move more than the physarum without the activator [Luckasen: 1974].

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a type of bacteria that is known for reacting based on changes in the environment. In physarum, there exists cytoplasmic streaming which is cytoplasm that flows in different directions within one single strand. This suggests that there is some type of signaling mechanism. The different changes in the environment that occurs to cause the cytoplasmic streaming can be from phototaxis (reaction based on light), chemotaxis (reaction based on chemicals), and gravitaxis (reaction based on gravity) [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment focused on chemotaxis due to observation of the effects of calcium on physarum with and without the activator A23187. One journal detailed how calcium will promote growth of the physarum during the first 48 hours, but then significantly decreased growth over the next 24-hour period [Terry: 2009]. Since we measured it within the first 44 hours then calcium will not exhibit any significant decrease in growth. The Physarum polycephalum should move more towards the calcium when it is soaked in activator than when it’s not, but both should move towards calcium. This is because the activator A23187 has an affinity with calcium that promotes growth towards it by activation of actin filaments [Luckasen: 1974]. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment will focus on trying to compare the effects of activator A23187 on chemotaxis movement on physarum polycephalum to calcium. A 1 cm x 1 cm block was cut out using sterile and heated flat tipped forceps from the center of six Petri plates with 2% agar in water. From stock physarum culture plates, other 1 cm x 1 cm blocks were removed. The blocks cut from the physarum plates were then placed individually into the recently cut out squares in each of the six 2% ager water plates. Three of the six plates were assigned to be the control group, and the other three were assigned to be the experimental group. All six plates included strips of paper that were saturated with calcium ion solution They were placed along the leading edge of the plates. In the case of the three experimental groups, approximately 50 µL of 100 µM A23187 was added using a pipette into the physarum culture plates. To control for phototaxis, the six plates were totally covered with aluminum foil. They were then placed in an incubator for 44 hours. After 44 hours, the plates were observed and the direction of growth of the Physarum and its distance in nm were measured. A one-tailed two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the distance traveled by the physarum between the control and experimental groups.

Results:
The control group had moved towards the strip for all three trials while the group treated with the activator A23187 exhibited no movement towards or away from the strip (Table 1). The control group moved toward the calcium strip an average of 35.3 +/- 5.03 mm while the group treated with Activator A23187 moved an average of 0.00+/- 0.00 mm (Figure 1). Using a 1-tail 2-sample t-test, the t-stat was found to be 12.2 with a p-value of 0.000263. 

Discussion:
Since calcium is known to promote the growth of physarum polycephalum within the first 72 hours of exposure, it was hypothesized that the bacteria will show growth towards the calcium strip [Terry: 2009]. The data that was gathered showed otherwise. With the activator A23187, the actin filaments were though to react to the calcium and exhibit the growth, but our tested physarum showed no movement, either towards or away from the actual calcium strips. Instead, the group that showed any type of growth was the control group, towards the calcium. It was discovered that instead of adding 50 µL of 100 µM A23187, 100 µL of 100 µM A23187 was added. This amount of A23187 was too much for the bacteria. The high dose of the activator killed the physarum, preventing any chemotaxis from occurring. If 50 µL of 100 µM A23187 were instead added, we would expect to see movement towards the calcium slip greater than that of the group with no movement [Luckasen: 1974]. The calculated p-value of 0.000263 shows significance for the data collected from the experiment. Unfortunately, the data was corrupted, and the significance seen here does not mean anything. It is hard to determine if the data calculated with the correct amount of activator added would have yielded significant results. For a better experiment, it might have been best to have multiple groups with different independent variables instead of having the activator being the only independent variable. The different cultures can different combinations of activator A23187 and no activator or calcium strips or no calcium strips. Real world applications can arise by use of how to better understand the effects of activators in slim molds, so it is possible to determine how to best handle them.
