Title:  Hormonal Control in Insects

Abstract:
	The Manduca sexta is a holometabolous insect that has 7 distinct stages of life and undergoes the process of molting which is controllled by two hormones; juvenile hormone which controlls the type of molting and ecdysone which determines the timing of molting. In order to explore the effects of juvenile hormone on insects, 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups of four. One group was fed food laced with 25% Precor, which is a juvenile hormone mimic, while the other group was fed food laced with normal water. It was determined that the amount of Precor did have minor negative effects on the normal life cycle of the Manduca sexta. This is shown by the fact that the treatment group had a higher overall average weight than that of the controll group. Furthermore, the two-tailed t_test indicated significance of data with a p_value of 0.0199. This reinforces the conclusion that Precor has negative effects on the development of the Manduca Sexta.


Introduction:
Categorized as holometabolous insects, the Manduca sexta caterpillar has distinct stages of life where its body undergoes complete reorganization. This body reorganization is controllled mainly by 2 hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone. Ecdysone in insects is released from the prothoracic glands and namely controlls the timing of molting. On the other hand, Juvenile hormone in insects controlls the type of molting the insect will experience. Normally, molting occurs just after the insect experiences a commitment pulse which is when there is a small spike in the internal levels of ecdysone which indicates that the insect is ready for bodily reorganization. This spike in ecdysone therefore stimulates the molting process. In a study conducted by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry [Tunaz, Hasan & Uygun, N.: 2004], it was found that the process of molting although occurs due to the concentration of ecdysone, it is Juvenile Hormone that is required for normal molting. To test this, the Pyrrhocoris apterus, or Linden Bug, was fed food laced with varying concentrations of floss-flower. Floss-flower is suspected to be an IGR, or “insect growth regulator” which affects the insect by stimulating differing hormones inside the organism. It was determined that the insects fed with higher concentrations of floss-flower failed to mature into proper adults which suggests that the floss-flower acts as a Juvenile Hormone mimic which interferes with the proper molting of the Linden Bug. To further test the effects of Juvenile hormone in insects, 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars will be split into 2 groups of 4, one acting as the controll group that is fed normal amounts of food while the other group will be fed food with 25% juvenile hormone mimic in the form of Precor. We hypothesize that this concentration will be insufficient, and therefore will have little to no effect on the development of the Manduca sexta. 


Materials and Method:
First, 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars all aged 4-5 days were selected and split into two groups of 4. One group was fed with normal food laced with four drops of water while the other group was fed food with 4 drops of of Juvenile Hormone in the form of Precor that was diluted to 25%. Each group was prepared 40 grams of food, 10 grams per caterpillar and food was refilled every 2 days. The length in cm and the weight in g was then recorded daily over the course of 8 days. Furthermore, a two-tailed t_test was used in order to determine the effects of Precor on the Manduca sexta.

Results:
When performing the two-sample t_test, it is found that the degrees of freedom were 126 while the t-value is a value of 2.357 giving an overall p_value of 0.0199. It was also observed that there was a large overall weight gain on second day. On the third day, the caterpillars were very sluggish and gained weight. By the 5th day, the caterpillars began to decrease in length overall. Furthermore, it was shown that Control caterpillars 2 & 3 and treatment 1 have browning coloration on the 6th day and on the 7th day Treatment caterpillar 1 started to crystallize on 7th day. 


Discussion:
	In this experiment, it is hypothesized that the amount of Precor added to treatment group would be insufficient to prevent any major causes in the development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. The hypothesis was supported because it was noted that a few of the caterpillars began to show signs of a color change which can indicate the beginning of the process of molting. Specifically, 2 caterpillars in the controll group and 1caterpillar in the treatment group. This could mean that the amount of JH present did not affect the normal cycle of the molting process in the Manduca sexta because in a typical Manduca sexta life cycle, the normal pupation period occurs at about 6 days. Furthermore, it was noted that there was significent weight gain in the caterpillars the second day in both the controll and the treatment groups showing an average increase in weight from 6.42±0.85 g to 9.40±0.61 g in the treatment group and 6.73±1.02 g to 7.78±1.79 g in the controll group. This is a 46.4% and a 15.6% increase in body weight respectively. Furthermore, at the end of the experiment, the treatment group weight significently more as well as had a higher average length as compared to the controll group with the weight peaking at an average of 10.38 g and the length peaking 8.10 cm whereas the controll only peaked at 7.73 g and 6.83 cm. This is an indication that Juvenile Hormone may have caused higher consumption of food and has an effect on weight and length. Furthermore, the hypothesis was further supported by the results of the two-tailed t_test as the p_value was less than 0.05 with a value of 0.0199 which indicates that the added Precor had some effect on the development of the caterpillars. Finally, these results are coherent with those found in the experiment done by Chu, K.H., et al. where the toxicity of methoprene, a JH mimic found in Precor was studied. It was found by that “Survival, longevity and fecundity were reduced at 0.05 mg litre−1 and at higher concentrations” (Chu et al., 1997). This is significent and can be paralleled to the results of the Manduca sexta as at very low levels and high levels the longevity of the insects is compromised and has negative effects indicating that proper levels of JH are required for proper development.
