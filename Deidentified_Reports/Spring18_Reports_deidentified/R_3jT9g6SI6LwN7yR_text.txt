Title: Juvenile Hormone May Hinder Growth of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The effect of juvenile hormone was studied as applied to the growth of manduca sexta. After eight days of growth, it was noticeable that juvenile hormone contributed to hindering the growth of the hornworms, however, the results were not statistically significent, making our hypothesis unable to be supported. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is known for its relatively quick growth cycle from larvae to adult moth. Because of its quick growth rate, experiments that can potentially alter a hornworm’s growth can see results within days or weeks. Part of what contributes to a hornworm’s growth is the presence of hormones. Juvenile hormone, or JH, works together with ecdysteroids to controll growth and molting, and is known to prevent metamorphosis while still allowing growth [Johnson, 2017]. 
	Hormones are a key component of insect physiology, and since JH is present in large quantities early on in a hornworm’s growth cycle, but dissipates around larval eclosion, it raises the question of what would occur if JH continued to be present in high quantities during the late stages of larvae. 
	A recent study by the University of California, Riverside notes that increased amounts of juvenile hormone in fruit flies decreased body size by slightly immobilizing the corpora allata, the organ responsible for regulating the growth rate [Mirth, 2014]. Additionally, an older study noted in Science Magazine discusses that increased JH keeps the prothoracic glands working at a lower level than normal, contributing to delayed growth and molting [Schneiderman, 1964].
	Given what is known about hormones and their effect on insect physiology, if increasing the amount of JH in hornworms’ diets leads to smaller hornworms compared to the controll group, it is expected to hinder the growth of those hornworms.


Materials and Method:
Six manduca sexta were separated into two groups of three, one controll group and one treated with juvenile hormone. Three cups were obtained and each cup was divided into two halves using index cards, creating six total areas for the worms to be housed. Each hornworm was placed into its own closed off area. Every day, each controll group hornworm was fed 10 grams of food mixed with seven drops of water, and each juvenile hormone group hornworm was fed 10 grams of food mixed with seven drops of water and seven drops of the juvenile hormone. 
	For seven days, the tobacco hornworms were weighed and fed, replacing the previous day’s food with a new 10 grams of the food mixture. 
	A two-sample t_test was run to determine if the collected data was statistically significent. 


Results:
The experiment ran as expected. The average masses of the controll group were higher than those of the juvenile hormone. However, our data was not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.3, which we attest to an outlier with one of the JH worms that ended up exhibiting the greatest change in mass. 


Discussion:
Overall, while the average changes in mass between the controll and JH groups seemed to indicate that JH was hindering the growth of the hornworms, our data was not statistically significent, therefore cannot fully support our hypothesis. 
There are no clear sources of error, however, the outlier JH hornworm indicates that there may be an alternate explanation for our data. While it is unclear why a JH hornworm would undergo the greatest change in mass, it is possible that part of that specific hornworm’s physiology was unresponsive to increased amounts of JH. 
	While most studies that focus on the effects of juvenile hormone show that excess JH led to smaller body mass over time, similar to the studies mentioned above, a study from the Howard Hughes Research Institute noted that killing the corpora allata cells that secrete JH, therefore leading to a lack of JH, also resulted in smaller fruit flies that died before pupation [Riddiford, 2010]. This contradiction makes clear the importance of following up with another experiment or two that focus on the effects of no or excess JH, and if there are multiple ways to reduce or increase body size by manipulating the natural presence of JH. 
	The next logical step for this study would be to repeat it, but on a larger scale to see if the outlier hornworm was by chance, or if there is a larger trend. For the most part, our results seemed to support our hypothesis until our statistical test indicated that our results were not significent. It would make the most sense to repeat the experiment under the same conditions to see if the results would be significent enough to support our hypothesis. 
Overall, studies like this contribute to the scientific community by providing knowledge concerning the advantages and disadvantages of altering insect hormones, and whether it would post beneficial effects on the surrounding environment and ecosystems.
