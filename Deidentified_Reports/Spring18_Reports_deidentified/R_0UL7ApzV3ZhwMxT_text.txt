Title: How Azamax Inhibits Growth and Molting of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effects that Azamax, an ecdysone inhibiting drug, has on Manduca sexta caterpillars.The Manduca sexta caterpillar is an insect that relies heavily on hormones to ensure normal development. The two main hormones that are used to regulate its growth, molting, and development are Juvenile hormone and ecdysone. In order to test the importance of ecdysone in the growth of these insects, we fed four Manduca sexta caterpillars a diet with Azamax in it, and four caterpillars without. The main hypothesis of this experiment was that the growth of the caterpillar that was given Azamax would be significently inhibited, due to the caterpillars inability to molt without ecdysone. We determined the effects of the drug by measuring the growth of the insects, specifically their lengths and masses. The experiment supported my hypothesis. Another study that also tested the importance of hormones in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars was one in which the scientists determined that when the insects are prevented from stopping the production of JH, they are unable to fully mature into adults.This study is important in demonstrating the severe and harmful effect that blocking ecdysone has on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. This order includes all moths, butterflies, and skippers. The Manduca sexta’s lifycle consists of eight distinct developmental stages. Normally, this insect has a lifecycle of 39-48 days. The insect begins as an egg, before going through five different instar larvae phases. It then becomes a pupa where it develops into an adult for 19-23 days, before it becomes an adult moth [Johnson, 2018]. This organism is good to use for this specific experiment because it is known from previous studies that Manduca sexta caterpillars rely heavily on their hormones in order to develop normally. This study will test the extent to which that is true. Additionally, Manduca sexta caterpillars were chosen for this experiment because their normal lifecycle is relatively short, meaning the experiment does not have to be conducted over a series of weeks. Lastly, Manduca sexta caterpillars are easy to find and inexpensive.
	Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone are the hormones that controll this lifecycle. Ecdysone is significent because it triggers the timing of the molt, and JH is vital in controllling the type of molt. When the insect has enough nutrients, the secretion of JH and ecdysone is triggered. This increase in JH and ecdysone causes the insect to molt. Another important point in the lifecycle is the commitment pulse, which is characterized by low levels of JH and a slight increase in ecdysone. JH and ecdysone are both vital in the normal growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars [Johnson: 2018].
	Azamax is an ecdysterone inhibiting chemical. Azamax is extracted from the neem seed kernel. Since a slight increase in ecdysone is needed to signal a molt, by putting Azamax into the caterpillars diet, it will block ecdysone from being secreted. Because of this, whether the caterpillars molt or not could be affected so therefore the growth of the caterpillar could be affected.
	We are investigating the effects of Azamax to determine whether the block of ecdysone will have an impact on the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Will these caterpillars be able to mature successfully and grow into an adult moth? Will the caterpillars not be able to mature correctly due to the hormone imbalance?
	We are asking this question because it is significent to understand the effects that hormones play in the development and life cycle of Manduca sexta. It is important because this information could be useful in creating a pesticide for this insect. In order to determine this, we need to measure the specific lengths and weights of the caterpillars that have eaten Azamax and compare those to our controll group. We also need physical observations to determine if anything has changed about the physical appearance of these insects.
	The independent variable of this experiment is whether or not we added Azamax to the diet of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. The dependent variables are the weight and length of the caterpillars.
	The null hypothesis in this experiment is that the Azamax will have no effect on the caterpillars size or on the molting process of the caterpillar. Our experimental hypothesis is that the caterpillars fed Azamax will be grow less because the drug will prevent them from molting. We expect that this will significently alter the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars and prevent it from becoming a pupa. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in their fourth instar larvae phase were randoMly split into two groups of four. One group was the experimental group and the other was the controll group. We placed each caterpillar in its own section of a plastic container. Each day of the experiment, we fed all eight caterpillars ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet. In the diet for the controll group, we added seven drops of water. In the diet for the experimental group, we added seven drops of Azamax. We emptied previous uneaten food or excretion for both groups each day. We recorded the mass (in grams), length (in centimeters), and physical observations of the insects each day for eight consecutive days. All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars were kept in an incubator set to 23°C with 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness for the duration of the experiment. After eight days, we analyzed our data by calculating the p_value and t-value of both the weight and the length of the caterpillars. We also analyzed our data using graphs of both the weight and the length.


Results:
At the conclusion of our experiment, our treatment group grew significently less (both by weight and length) than our controll group. As displayed in Figures 1 and 2, the average change in weight and length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the controll group was greater than that of the experimental group. As seen in Figure 1, at the conclusion of the eight days, the controll group had grown by around nine grams, while the experimental group had only grown by around one gram. In Figure 1, the two groups grew at a similar rate until day four, in which the controll group began a rapid increase in growth, while the controll group leveled off in weight.
As seen in Figure 2, although the experimental group were measured as longer initially, the controll group ultimately grew more than the experimental group by fourth day. After the fourth day, the controll group continued growing longer, while the experimental group began to level off in length, and even decreased at the end. 
Table 1 also supports the notion that the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the controll group grew more than in the treatment group. Table 1 was created using data from day eight of the experiment. In this table, the mean weight of the treatment group (2.1 g) was less than the mean weight of the controll group (9.6 g) Additionally, the mean length of the treatment group (5.1 cm) was less than the mean length of the controll group (7.7 cm). This table also showed that the p_value for both weight and length are under 0.05. This means that the confidence interval is above 95%, meaning that there is less than a 5% chance that these results are due to chance. Lastly, as shown in Table 1, the standard deviations for both the weight and length were much higher for the treatment group (1.1 and 1.1) than in the controll group (0.6 and 0.4).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by this experiment because we expected the Azamax to inhibit growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. As clearly shown by the difference in weight of the two groups (Figure 1), the caterpillars were unable to grow normally in the presence of this ecdysterone inhibiting drug. This was also shown by the different in length of the two groups (Figure 2). This result proves the importance of ecdysone in the life cycle of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Without the slight increase in ecdysone that normally occurs in combination with the increase in JH, a molt cannot be triggered. Since a molt creates a larger exoskeleton so that the caterpillar can grow, the absence of this hormone prevents growth of the caterpillar.
A published study that also studied the importance of hormones in the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars was conducted by H Frederik Nijhout and Carroll M. Williams at Harvard University in 1974. In this study, Nijhout and Williams prevented Manduca sexta caterpillars from stopping the production of JH. As stated in their study, normally, “The corpora allata cease to secrete JH when the larvae attain a weight of approximately 5 g” [Nijhout, 1974]. Because the two scientists prevented the caterpillars from stopping production of JH, the caterpillars were unable to release prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), and therefore unable to mature into full adulthood. This study is significent because it proves (similarly to this our experiment) the monumental effect that hormones have on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars.
A possible alternate explanation for our data is that the caterpillars did not enjoy the taste of the Azamax, which led them to consume less food, and therefore grow less than the controll group. Because we did not measure how much food they ate each day, we are unable to fully know if this drug inhibited their growth, or if the caterpillars in the experimental group were not eating as much as in the controll group. A way to ensure that this was not the case in our experiment, it is necessary to repeat this study, this time measuring the food eaten by the Manduca sexta caterpillars. If the caterpillars in both groups eat a similar amount, we can ensure that our results are not due to the taste of the drug, but the effects it has on the hormones of Manduca sexta caterpillars.
An error in this study was the discrepancy in the way we measured the lengths of the insects. Because of the caterpillars ability to both stretch out and make their body less long, the lengths were not an accurate method of measuring growth. Instead, we should have consistently measured the caterpillars when they are fully stretched out. Because of this error, mass was a much more accurate method of measuring growth in our experiment.
	This information is important because it reveals the effects that ecdysone has on Manduca sexta caterpillars. This information could be good for possible pesticides that attempt to prevent these caterpillars from molting and becoming moths. Because Manduca sexta caterpillars are known to eat tobacco plants, a tobacco company may feel inclined to use this drug as a pesticide to ensure that their plants are not eaten by caterpillars.
