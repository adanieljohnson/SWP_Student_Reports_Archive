Title:  Manduca Sexta: Effect of Precor (mimic Juvenile Hormone) on Growth, Development, and Molting

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta are a type of holometabolous insect whose molting cycle is controlled by differing levels of Juvenile Hormone and ecdysone. Specifically, when molting from 5th instar phase to pupae phase, there are high levels of ecdysone and low levels of JH. In this experiment, we tested the effect that consistently high levels of JH would have on growth, development, and molting by adding a mimic of JH (Precor) to Manduca Sexta food. Throughout the seven days of this experiment, although neither control or experimentals molted, we found that the addition of Precor affected their behavior, making them less active, and their physical developments, preventing markings from appearing on their skin and stunting the growth of adult legs prior to molting. Based on these results, we can conclude that low levels of JH initiate physical developments that occur prior to molting, as well as affecting general growth and behavior.

Introduction:
Manduca Sextas are holometabolous insects, meaning the life cycle that they go through has multiple stages, each one very different than the last. The stages consist of egg, larvae, pupae, and adult. The larvae phase is a time for feeding, growth and development, preparing for pupation. This phase is broken down into “instar” phases, in which the larvae go through five stages of growth before molting (therefore transitioning into the pupal phase as a 5th instar). The pupal phase is the phase that transitions between larvae and adult. For holometabolous insects, such as Manduca Sexta, this is the time when the insect completely transforms from its larvae form to its adult form. The timing of when the Manduca Sexta transitions from one stage to the next is controlled by a blood meal (Wigglesworth, 1940) and the release of two hormones: ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone. Ecdysone controls the timing of molting while Juvenile Hormone controls the type of molt (Nijhout, 2015). Naturally, Juvenile Hormone inhibits the release of PTTH, a hormone secreted by the brain that causes the release of ecdysone (Williams, 1974). Based on other experiments, scientists have been able to determine that molting is based on the changing levels of each hormone throughout the insect’s life cycle. Specifically, when there are low levels of Juvenile Hormone and high levels of ecdysone, the insect molts from a larvae to pupae (Weeks, 2003.). However, these experiments demonstrate how the insects natural production of these hormones influences the molting process. Because of this, we thought it would be interesting to test how the amount of Juvenile Hormone affects the molting process, altering the levels of Juvenile Hormone that exists in the Manduca Sexta naturally. This could lead one to ask exactly how the amount of Juvenile Hormone affects a Manduca Sexta’s growth, development, and molting cycle. For instance, what if the levels of these hormones are different than how they naturally exist? Does the organism die? Does it never molt? Does it affect its growth, behavior, or appearance? In order to answer these questions, we will have a control group that receives regular diet and an experimental group that will receive the regular diet as well as a mimic of Juvenile Hormone, known as Precor Hormone, and record how this difference affects the weight, appetite, behavior, and other observable changes in the Manduca Sextas. The Manduca Sexta was good to use in this experiment because it is a holometabolous insect and has a relative short life cycle, lasting approximately 39-48 days (got from lab packet, source not accessible), allowing us to focus on changes during a specific part of the life cycle and study the effects of Precor on the insects in a relatively short period of time. Considering this knowledge about Manduca Sextas, if a mimic of Juvenile Hormone (Precor) is present in a Manduca Sexta diet during the larvae stage, thus maintaining high levels of Juvenile Hormone, then the growth, development, and molting process of the Manduca Sexta will be hindered.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we obtained 6 Manduca Sexta, all of which were in their 4th instar phase, and divided them into two groups: 3 Manduca Sexta made up the control group while the other 3 made up the experimental group. Each Manduca Sexta was put in an enclosed, solitary environment throughout the duration of this experiment. We weighed each Manduca Sexta before giving them their food. Each control was given approximately 10.00g of food, with approximately 5 drops (50 microliters) of water added. The food was also weighed before given to the controls. Each experimental was also given approximately 10.00g of food, with approximately 5 drops (50 microliters) of diluted Precor added (4 mL of Precor in 100 mL of water, making 0.04 concentration of Precor). The food was also weighed before given to the Manduca Sextas. All the food used in this experiment was obtained from Great Lakes Manduca. The only difference between the two groups was the presence of Precor in their food. Because of this, any significant differences between the two groups can be attributed to the presence (or lack) of Precor. We also took note of any visual observations we noticed, such as the presence of a horn, the color, markings, how active they were, etc. Every day for seven days, at approximately the same time, we took out all the food (and defecation) and recorded the weight before replacing it with new food, treated the same way as the first day. Each Manduca Sexta was also weighed each day, and we recorded any visual observations or changes in previous observations that we noticed. Throughout the seven days, the Manduca Sextas were kept in an incubator, and only taken out when being measured.

Results:
While there were many changes between the control and experimental group throughout the experiment, there were observations that did not correlate specifically to either group. For instance, while some Manduca Sextas had horns at the beginning, there were no obvious changes in whether horn was present or not during experiment (Day 1 in Figure 1). In addition, all the Manduca Sexta involved in this experiment gained weight (Figure 2). Lastly, the amount of food that each group ate per day does not show one group consistently eating more or less than the other group (Figure 3).
However, there were many visual observations that demonstrated clear differences between the two groups over the seven days. For instance, the first visible changes in color between control and experimental groups were noticed on Day 4; the control groups maintained the bright green color while the experimental groups faded to a lighter green (Day 4 in Figure 1). Controls also grew to be larger and more plump than experimentals (Figure 1). In addition, while the control group maintained activity, the experimental group became noticeably less active by Day 3 (Day 3 in Figure 1). This change in activity continued for the remainder of the experiment. One very noticeable change had to do with the presence of different markings between the two groups. By Day 3, the controls began to show black markings and red dots on sides and back while experimental group did not develop these at all, with exception of Animal 6 on Day 6 (Day 3 and Day 6 in Figure 1). However, the experimental group did develop darker blue markings where black markings were on controls. In final days of experiment both control and experimental groups did not show any markings near head area (Day 6 & 7 in Figure 1). Between Days 5 & 6, all Manduca Sexta in this experiment developed 6 insect-like legs. However, controls’ legs were much larger and darker while experimentals’ legs were smaller and white (Day 5 & 6 in Figure 1).


Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, our hypothesis (if a mimic of Juvenile Hormone (Precor) is present in a Manduca Sexta diet during the larvae stage, thus maintaining high levels of Juvenile Hormone, then the growth, development, and molting process of the Manduca Sexta will be hindered) was not supported - While the presence of Precor hormone in diet prevented Manduca Sextas from growing, developing, and molting, our results were not significant enough to determine that this was from only the addition or absence of Precor. We used a two sample T-test to determine if our results were significant, finding that the mean value of the control group (in relation to weight) was not statistically significant compared to the experimental group (t-stat = .80, df = 40, P = .43). In relation to amount of food eaten, the control group was also not statistically significant compared to the experimental group (t-stat = 1.256, df = 34, P = .22). Because of this, our experiment supported the null hypothesis: if we add Precor (mimic JH) to our subjects food, then the Manduca Sexta’s growth, development, and molting process were not hindered.
As stated before, the control group grew to be larger and more plump than the experimental group. This can be attributed to the fact that high levels of Juvenile Hormone prevent Manduca Sexta from developing so that they can molt, thus keeping them in a juvenile state. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Juvenile Hormone stunts growth and development in Manduca Sexta. 
To add, the experimental group became less active and was not as brightly colored as the control group. Both of these factors would have to do with the insect’s overall health, which is directly affected by their nutrition. Because of this, one can conclude that juvenile hormone affects the nutrition of the Manduca Sexta, impairing the insect’s overall health. This can be attributed to the possibility that the hormone inhibits the absorption of all the nutrients that the insect is taking in. It is unlikely that this observation is related to the insect’s appetite, considering that there was no significant difference in the amount of food that each group ate day to day.
Some of the most obvious observations had to do with the difference in markings between the two groups, specifically the fact that black markings and red dots only appeared in control group. Based on these observations, we can conclude that black markings and red dots indicate that the Manduca Sexta is developing and will soon reach the point of development in which it can molt. Therefore, these markings indicate that molting will happen soon. Furthermore, the experimental group did develop dark blue markings, which can indicate that black markings will appear soon. Because of this, we can conclude that high levels of JH slow development, thus postponing molting.
Near the end of the experiment, neither group had markings near the head area, but both groups had insect-like legs near head area. This can indicate that adult legs develop before molting and that the area near the head will transform into an adult during pupation. Furthermore, the legs of the control group were large and dark while the legs of the experimental group were small and white, indicating that legs need to fully (or at least almost fully) develop before molt/pupation. Since the two groups grew legs at the same time, but the experimental group’s legs did not develop fully (while control legs did), we can assume that JH does not affect the emergence of adult legs, but does affect the growth, development, condition, and maturation of the legs.
In the time between measurements on Day 6 and Day 7, Animal 6 got into Animal 3’s food, preventing the results of these two animals to be inapplicable for the last day of the experiment. 
While our results were not statistically significant, they were approaching the results that we expected them to have. If we were to do this experiment again, more Precor in the experimental group’s food would make the effects of Juvenile Hormone much more obvious. Since we did not know the amount of Precor that would produce significant changes, the amount that we added (50 microliters per day) was an estimate. Had we added more each day, the changes between the two groups would probably have been more obvious, making the conclusions that we draw much less ambiguous and have a higher probability of relating to the presence or absence of added Precor. If we were to do this again, it would be logical to double the amount of Precor added to the food (100 microliters) per day. If 100 microliters of Precor were added to the diet of Manduca Sexta each day, then the effects of Juvenile Hormone on growth, development, and molting would be enhanced, making it much easier to conclude how Juvenile Hormone affects the molting process.
