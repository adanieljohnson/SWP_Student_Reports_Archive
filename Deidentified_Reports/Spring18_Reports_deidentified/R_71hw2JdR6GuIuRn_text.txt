Title: Effects of AzaGuard on Growth Hormones in Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are important growth hormones involved in the life cycle of insects. Insect growth regulators manipulate the growth hormones to interfere with the natural life cycle. Weight is also an important signal in the molting process. Juvenile hormone inhibits the molt, keeping the insect from undergoing metamorphosis to the next stage. The objective of this experiment was to test the affects of AzaGuard on an insect’s weight to determine whether a juvenile hormone was produced. The experiment was done using eight Manduca sexta caterpillars. Four caterpillars made up the controll group and were fed food mixed with water. The other four made up the treatment group and were fed food mixed with AzaGuard. It was hypothesized that AzaGuard would decrease the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars and prevent molting. The results supported the hypothesis because the mean weight of the controll caterpillars increased significently while the mean weight of the treatment caterpillars increased little. This suggests that AzaGuard provides a juvenizing hormone that inhibits the molting process. AzaGuard is an insecticide that works by prohibiting the molt and therefore keeping the insect from reaching adulthood and having the ability to reproduce. 

Introduction:
Hormones travel through the bloodstream to affect multiple target cells and processes. Insect development is controllled by two important regulating hormones. Juvenile hormone controlls the type of molt, while ecdysterone (20E) controlls the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile hormone causes larvae to remain in the larvae stage, while the absence of juvenile hormone allows the insect to molt. Ecdysterone initiates the molt. The Manduca sexta caterpillars are a good organism for studying growth controll in insects because they have a specific weight that must be obtained for the molt to happen; juvenile hormone also has an inhibitory effect on the molting process [Suzuki: 2013]. Insect Growth Regulators are agonists for growth hormones involved in molting; they can mimic ecdysteroids or juvenile hormone to disrupt the growth process [Rechcigl: 1999]. AzaGuard is an insect growth regulator that affects the growth process by prohibiting molting between different life stages by interfering with ecdysone. The objective of this experiment was to test the effects of AzaGuard on the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The dependent variable in the experiment is the weight of the caterpillars, and the independent variable is the food, both with AzaGuard and without. It is hypothesized that AzaGuard will decrease the weight of the caterpillars, preventing a molt from happening, meaning that juvenile hormone is introduced by AzaGuard.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were obtained and weighed on a scale. Two caterpillars were placed in each of 4 round plastic containers, separated in the middle with an index card. 10 grams of food was weighed for each caterpillar, 80g in total. Four of the caterpillars received food with ten drops of water mixed in it (using a pipette), these were the controll caterpillars. The other four, the treatment caterpillars, were given 10g of food mixed with 10 drops of AzaGuard (using a pipette). The caterpillars were weighed and observed for color and amount of food eaten over a seven-day observation period. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator for the entirety of the observation period. Data was collected in a chart and translated into a bar graph to depict correlation between AzaGuard and weight. One two-sample t_test was done to test whether the hypothesis was supported or not.

Results:
After the observation period ended, the overall average weight for the controll and treatment groups was analyzed using a bar graph and a two-sample t_test. The average weight of the controll caterpillars was greater than that of the treatment caterpillars. Upon observation, the controll group appeared to be healthier than the treatment groups. Treatment caterpillars had food left over at the end of the observation period, while controll caterpillars had no food left. A two-sample t_test was conducted to determine whether the hypothesis was supported. The mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the treatment group (p=0.009,t=3.79), meaning the null hypothesis was rejected. Figure 1 shows the average weight of the caterpillars in the controll and treatments groups, allowing for comparison of the treatments.

Discussion:
The mean weight of controll caterpillars was more than the treatment caterpillars. This result supported the hypothesis that the AzaGuard would prevent the caterpillars from molting by keeping their weight low. Caterpillars must obtain a certain weight to begin the molting process. AzaGuard had a significent effect on the weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The commitment pulse is the signal that they have reached this weight and that the insect needs a burst of ecdysone to begin molting [Johnson: 2018]. Azaguard works by preventing the Manduca sexta caterpillars from reaching the necessary weight to begin molting, thereby preventing reproduction because they are not able to reach adulthood. The caterpillars with treatment food did not eat as much as caterpillars with controll food. IGRs, such as Azaguard, manipulate growth hormones to prevent insects from surviving. In this experiment, juvenile hormone was manipulated. AzaGuard created an increase in the juvenile hormone in the caterpillars, keeping them in a small larvae state. The controll group could increase their weight because the juvenile hormone was not in effect. Ecdysterone was not allowed to trigger the molt because the insect never reached the desired weight. As discovered in a previous experiment concerning the growth hormones in insects, the juvenile hormone is inhibitory on the molting process [Suzuki: 2013], which is why the molt could not happen with caterpillars eating food with Azaguard mixed in. The insect growth regulators, provide juvenile hormone that circulates in the blood stream of insects and prohibits growth and molting. If the experiment were to be done again, I would suggest a longer observation period. In this experiment, a molt was not actually observed but was implied by the weight and health of the controll caterpillars. Another change that would be helpful is to keep controll and treatment caterpillars in separate containers, because during this experiment controll caterpillars and treatment caterpillars were found on the same side in one container. This experiment supported the hypothesis that Azaguard provides a juvenizing hormone to prevent the molting process. Comparing the weights of treatment and controll caterpillars, as seen in Figure 1, allows the null hypothesis to be rejected because the mean weight of controll caterpillars was significently different than controll caterpillars. Weight is an important factor in the molting process, and juvenile hormone needs to be absent for the insect to begin molting. If juvenile hormone is present, ecdysterone will not be able to trigger a molt and the larva will remain in the larvae state, eventually dying. IGR’s are affective in this way by manipulating the growth hormones and life cycle of insects. This experiment proved that AzaGuard is effective in pest controll.

Figure 1. Effects of AzaGuard on weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Control caterpillars (blue bar) had a higher average weight than treatment caterpillars. Treatment caterpillars (orange bar) had a lower average weight than controll caterpillars, and did not significently increase weight. Eight caterpillars in a larvae state were placed in containers with controll food with only water added or treatment food with AzaGuard added and allowed to incubate for seven days. Each caterpillar was weighed each day and each bar is the mean weight of 4 caterpillars from the treatment or controll group for the entirety of the observation period; error bars are +/-1 s.d.
