Title: The Effect on Levels of Salinity on the Percent Change of Absorbance in Time of Both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica

Abstract:
The question the experimenters wished to answer was whether or not high salinity would have an effect on rate of photosynthesis in both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica chloroplasts. The overall salinity of water in agricultural lands are rising to due human causes, so the effects of this change are relevant to crop production. The experimenters hypothesized that if salinity is high, the rate of change in the hill reaction will be low. If the salinity in which the chloroplasts are tested is high, there will be a lower percent change found in those chloroplasts compared to those not in high salinity. The chloroplasts are isolated using a centrifuge, and then reacted with 1X reaction buffer to allow photosynthesis to take place. DCPIP is also used in the experiment so that it will turn from blue to clear as photosynthesis allows it to be reduced. This is measured using absorption to track the change in color as a way to mark photosynthetic activity. The results did not show any significance, but the kale appeared to prefer the high sodium concentration. A study on the effect of photosynthesis in kale that is grown in high salinity would be beneficial because of the rising salt concentration in most agricultural lands.

Introduction:
One of the new environmental issues facing today’s world revolves around the high salt concentrations that are becoming common in soil. Salinity in the environment can cause cells to become hypotonic, meaning they start to shrink in size because of the diffusion of water and make the cell perform with less effectiveness [Rasmuson & Anderson: 2002]. It not only affects plants at the cellular level, but also the overall health of the plant structure. Studies show the increased levels of salinity can shrink roots, meaning less nutrients can be absorbed up into the plant, and also decreases the overall leaf number and size on the plant [Amira & Qados: 2011; Salt Tolerance of Plants]. The effects of salinity on the rate of plant photosynthesis is something that has become increasingly important as more agricultural land has been irrigated with water that has a much higher salinity because of a shift to using low-quality water in irrigation. The rise in salinity is shown to reduce the productivity of agricultural crops, including vegetables [Machado & Serralheiro: 2017]. The test subjects chose were first the Spinacia oleracea, also known as spinach. This was a good choice of test subject because it is commonly used as an experimental plant In a hill reaction study on chloroplasts, it was found that the salinity would not kill the chloroplasts, but lessen their photosynthetic behavior between 0.08-0.8M, and that the optimal amount would be 5 mM of sodium [Campbell & Pitman: 1971]. The other test subject chosen was Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, also known as Kale. Kale is a common vegetable that has recently entered into popularity so it would be beneficial to study further. Knowing that salinity is a factor in the productivity of vegetables, it would be beneficial for scientists to understand the effects of salt concentration on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach and kale. These are common crops used in many meals, and in the case of spinach there are other research being done about the effects of salinity. To measure salinity, DCPIP will be added to the hill reaction because it turns from blue to clear as it is reduced as photosynthesis is completed. With this knowledge, if salinity is high, the rate of change in the hill reaction will be low. If the salinity in which the chloroplasts are tested is high, there will be a lower percent change found in those chloroplasts compared to those not in high salinity.


Materials and Method:
The chloroplasts will first need to be isolated from the other organic materials which was done by crushing up four leaves in a mortar and pestle that has been packed in ice. This is then put in a 50Ml centrifuge tube and this then centrifuged at 200 times gravity for 10 minutes and then again at 1,000 times gravity for another 10 minutes. The chloroplasts were found to be in the pellet created by the second time in the centrifuge, and was resuspended using 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer. This was done with both the spinach and the kale. After the isolation of the chloroplasts was the preparation and completion of the hill reaction to have been able to record the absorbances and complete the percent change calculations. The test tubes were prepared with reaction buffer, DCPIP to track absorbance, and chloroplasts as detailed in the supplemental figures and tables. The reaction buffer was added to the test tubes to begin the reaction and the absorbance was recorded at time zero, and then again after 5 minutes, and then 10 minutes for a total period of 15 minutes for the experiment. The percent change was then calculated using the equation: (absorbance at time 0 - absorbance at time x/absorbance at time 0) x 100. The averages of the percent change were analyzed using a paired t_test and significance was determined.


Results:
For spinach, none of the paired T-tests run were found to have significance. As shown in Figure 1, the 10mM salinity showed an incline at 5 minutes, but then a steady decline over the next 10, but was still not significent. The 50mM salinity percent change showed a bit more variability in its values over the 15 minutes, but still did not show significance between the controll (t=0.286, p=0.785). The 800mM dropped at the five-minute mark, but then showed a sharp incline to match the percent change of the 10mM salinity at a value of about 34%. It still did not show a significent difference (t=1.124, p=0.27).  For kale, whose percent change data is shown in figure 2, the 10mM salinity showed no significent difference (t=0.460, p=0.661). In the case of 50mM salinity the percent change went down at the 5 minute reading, but there was still no significent difference overall compared to the controll. It should be noted, however, that the p_value was within 0.02 of significance (t=1.769, p=0.07). The 800mM salinity percent change did take a major decrease at the 5-minute, but it was followed be a clear incline to the 15-minute mark when the experiment ended. For this as well there was no significent difference (t=0.614, p=0.561).

Discussion:
The results of this experiment for spinach showed that while it is not significent, in the end there is a slight decrease after the 15-minute point. Since it is not statistically significent in the difference between the controll, the results cannot support the hypothesis. In the case of the kale, there is no evidence that the salinity lowered the effectiveness of the chloroplast, but appears to have made the percent change higher. This was also not found to be significent so it can also cannot refute the original hypothesis that the high salinity would lower the percent change in the hill reaction. The data overall is inconclusive since the spinach refutes the alternative hypothesis, but the kale does not support or refute either the alternative hypothesis. When looking at the article “Salt Tolerance in Plants”, it is possible that the spinach was still able to function in high salinity since in certain plants salinity does not affect photosynthetic activity, but other parts of the process [Salt Tolerance of Plants]. While this is not the case in all the research, it should be mentioned as a reason why the spinach would not support the findings. Another explanation for the results is the experiment might have been run for slightly too short of a time because there have been examples of plants reacting initially by exhibiting an increase in ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) in the plant once the chloroplast is introduced [Suo et al.: 2017]. If this was the case in the spinach that could possibly explain the initial spike in the percent change at the 5 minute measurement, but not why some of the salt concentrations still continued to trend upwards. Possible causes of error in this experiment would be human error in measurements. It is possible that some of the measurements were not all constant throughout the experiment. It is also possible that the amount of time it took to get through all the absorbance measurements at each time would skew data since we would start from the controll and worked through to the 800mM test tubes, meaning that the times would not be the same depending on how fast the measurements were taken. It is also possible that the reaction buffer that was used was not strong enough to correctly start the reaction. The reaction buffer is important to making the experiment run effectively, meaning that if the buffer needed to be less diluted than it was and that would alter the significance of the experiment. While this would not fully explain, the insignificent data found, it could explain parts of what has been observed in the percent changes.  The importance of testing salinity on crops is the growing levels in the soil of the agricultural lands. Cells do not generally perform well in these environments because an increase in sodium puts more osmotic stress on the cells in the plant, making it harder for them to perform optimally [Rasmuson & Anderson: 2002]. A good follow up study to this one would be to grow the kale, which performed better, in soil with a high sodium to see if it increases its carbon fixation and has a higher percent change as the DCPIP is reduced and turns colorless. If the kale does perform well in the sodium environment, then it could mean that if would be a good product to use in agricultural lands that no longer allow for optimal growth of other plants. In a time when some plants can no longer grow in their natural habitat like is the case in some areas of the world it would be beneficial to know of plants that can still use that high salinity area [Amira & Qados: 2011].
