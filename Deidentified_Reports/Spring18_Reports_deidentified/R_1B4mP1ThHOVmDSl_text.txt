Title: Blocking 20-hyproxyecdysone (20E) in Manduca sexta Larva Slows Pupation and Molting

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars are holometabolous insects that rely on juvenile and 20E hormones to control their maturation and pupation process into full grown adults. This study shows how inhibiting the 20E hormone prevents the caterpillar from molting into an adult. Eight caterpillars were selected and separated into a control and experimental group. The experimental group was given a drug to inhibit 20E and their weights were charted across a seven-day span. A 2 sample T-test was run to analyze the results. Due to the 20E inhibitor, the caterpillars in the experimental group showed decreased weight gain because it could not continue the pupation process. The hypothesis was proved correct and the control group continued to molt, while the experimental group ceased pupation. 

Introduction:
There are two main hormones that control the molting and maturation process in Manda sexta. The first hormone is Juvenile hormone, which controls whether the larva will molt into another instar or into an adult. The second hormone is 20E, which controls when the larva will molt (_2018). Previous studies show that any interference with these hormones will either skew the molting process or achieve abnormal development at inappropriate life stages (Smagghe 1999).  In this experiment, we looked at the effects inhibiting the hormone 20E had on Manda sexta caterpillars and how it affected their pupation process. Azadirachitin is an insecticide that inhibits the production of 20E hormone. By injecting a certain amount of azadirachitin, we hypothesize that it will inhibit the production on 20E and prevent the caterpillars from any growth or pupation. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we started with eight Manduca sexta caterpillars around the fourth larval stage (instar). We separated them into two groups of four. One group received a treatment of a 20E inhibitor, Azadirachitin. While, the other group of four received water to serve as the control group. The treatment group was served 4% dilution of azadirachitin which was mixed into their food and then separated evenly into four containers. The control group received the same amount of water mixed into their food and then also evenly separated. Next, we took the initial weight of each caterpillar for a base. We compared the weight of the treatment group to the weight of the control group across seven days and monitored their pupation and maturation process. We ran a 2 sample T-test to analyze the weight of our control and experimental groups. 

Results:
Figure one shows the average change in weight for the control group (1) vs the average change in weight for the treatment group (2). The average weight change for the control group was 4.025 g over seven days and the average weight change for the experimental group was .365 g.  

Discussion:
Based on our results we observed that the experimental group who received the Azadirachitin treatment had significantly less weight changes of the course of the seven days. Whereas the control group who received no treatment gained weight more rapidly than the experimental group. The difference in weight gains between the two is due to azadirachitin inhibiting the 20E hormone. As we hypothesized, the absence of the 20E hormone inhibited the molting process of the caterpillars and prevented it from growth and pupation.
