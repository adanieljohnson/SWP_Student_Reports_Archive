Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine on the Contraction Period of the Gastrocnemius of a Frog

Abstract:
The effect of Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter released from the presynaptic nerve terminal, was tested on the gastrocnemus of  Rania pipiens frog which is also known as the mountain leopard frog. ACh binds to the receptors on the muscle fiber membrane which causes sodium channels to open and eventually leads to muscle contraction. We hypothesized that the addition of 10 mg/Ml will increase the messenger sent out into the synapse by exocytosis, causing a higher amplitude in the contraction period. By conducting this experiment, we learned that by injecting the leg muscle of a frog with 10 mg/Ml there is a higher amplitude during the contraction period than without it. This gives insight to muscle contraction and the relationship between neuromuscular controll and how organisms react to stimuli. The results of this experiment supported our hypothesis and aligned with our observations.


Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to signal and respond to their internal and external environments within an extremely small window of time, unlike hormone systems which take longer [Johnson: 2002]. A nerve stimulates the contraction of the muscle by action potentials that travel along the axon and arrive at the neuromuscular junction. The neuron is then depolarized which causes the release of Acetylcholine. This neurotransmitter is contained in the presynaptic vesicles and is released into the synaptic cleft when an impulse reaches the end of the nerve [Johnson: 2002]. It diffuses to the muscle and binds to a receptor on the muscle fiber membrane which opens sodium channels and stimulates the release of  Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of the calcium ions activates the contraction and then reuptake occurs and allows the muscle to relax again. In addition contractile fatigue is produced in an isolated frog gastrocnemus when it is stimulated electrically until there is no response [Dixon, Davenport, Ranson: 1929]. This experiment will involve the stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of a Rania pipiens frog. We will experiment on frog legs in order to test the effects of ACh increase in the muscle. We will then record a myogram to determine if the amplitudes are higher than when there is no increase in ACh in order to test our hypothesis that an addition of  ACh will increase the messenger sent out into the synapse by exocytosis, causing a higher amplitude in the contraction period. 


Materials and Method:
We performed a standard procedure for degloving the 3 frog legs using forceps and Ringer’s solution as needed. We pulled the skin down to the feet of the frog and used a dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles in order to reveal the white sciatic nerve and blood vessels 
The distal end of the gastrocnemus of each leg was cut while the medial end was left attached. We freed the nerve from connective tissue with a dissecting needle and forceps and tied a piece of thread to the tendon while the other end was tied to the spring of a transducer arm.  began to determine the twitch threshold with direct stimulation. The transducer was mounted above the frog leg so the Gastrocnemius w.as suspended at a 90 degree angle. We then pinned the leg down using straight pins as needed and the electrode was placed under the sciatic nerve so it rested on the prongs of the electrode. Each leg served as its own controll and we determined the twitch threshold with direct stimulation in order to record myograms using the iWorx software. We then added 10 mg/Ml of acetylcholine to each frog leg, waited one minute for it to develop, and recorded a myogram to compare the amplitudes. For each of the frog legs, the three determined amplitudes for the pre and post-treatment were averaged and standard deviations were found. A paired t_test was run between the average amplitude of both the experimental and controll group meaning before the treatment of ACh and after the treatment of ACh to determine the significance of the results. 



Results:
After running the paired t_test we found that the p_value = 0.00000125 with 2 degrees of freedom. During the experiment we noticed visible twitching of the frog leg at .00m and were able to visualize a higher voltage in the treatment group that received the acetylcholine treatment. While creating the myogram using the iWork software,we were able to determine an increase in amplitude and contraction. The average difference between the amplitudes of the controll and experimental group was 0.5201 (see Figure 1).



Discussion:
The trend from frog leg to frog leg was consistent - the amplitude increased after acetylcholine was injected and there was a visible difference in the muscle contraction. With a p_value of 0.00000125 we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported and the amplitude increased between the treatment and controll groups (see Figure 1).An addition of 10 mg/Ml of acetylcholine will increase the messenger sent out into the synapse by exocytosis, which leads to a higher amplitude in the contraction period. This is because acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter and synaptic vesicles are general storage centers for neurotransmitters and release them into the synaptic cleft. It has been confirmed that the membrane-walled compartments inside frog motor nerve terminals undergo changes when in contact with neurotransmitters released from the synaptic vesicle membrane [Heuser and Reese: 1973]. In relation to this experiment, we concluded that the neurotransmitter had an effect on the gastrocnemus of the frog, causing the muscle to contract with a higher amplitude.
