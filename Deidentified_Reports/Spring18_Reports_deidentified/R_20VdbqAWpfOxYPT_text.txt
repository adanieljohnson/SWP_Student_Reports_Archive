Title: Sodium Channel Blocker, Lidocaine, Causes an Increase in Threshold of Frog Legs of the Rana pipens

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are the sources of almost all movements in animals. Muscle contractions start from an impulse or external stimulus, down a motor neuron, to the neuromuscular junction and into a muscle fiber, to the sarcoplasmic reticulum where actin and myosin slide past each other to create contractions. In this experiment, a sodium channel blocker, lidocaine, was used to compare the thresholds required for a muscle contraction between a regular leg and an experimental leg of a Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens. The group hypothesized that the treatment group injected with 25 mM lidocaine would require a higher voltage to reach threshold when compared to a regular frog leg. The results supported this hypothesis, as the thresholds of the treatment group were shown to be higher than the untreated control group. This was due to the fact that a lack of sodium required an increase in voltage to help propagate the signal through to eventually cause the muscle to contract.

Introduction:
Muscle contractions in both vertebrates and invertebrates occur via a series of reactions and processes in the cells of muscles. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Axons of these motor neurons extend into the muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson 2018]. These neuromuscular junctions are the locations where action potentials are fired, which causes muscles to contract. Nerve impulses release acetylcholine (Ach) from the presynaptic nerve terminal, which allows receptors to open sodium channels that generate the action potential. From here, action potentials spread to the t-tubules, allowing a release of calcium that enables the muscle to shorten and contract. This synapse occurs in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which binds to troponin and allows myosin and actin (two proteins in the thick and thin myofilaments) to slide past each other. The binding of ATP to the myosin head causes the sarcomere to relax, completing the cycle of a muscle contraction [Costantin: 1970].
	The purpose of this experiment was to determine how certain stimuli effect nerve and muscle function during a muscle contraction in the leg of a frog. Using an electrical stimulus, we sent volts into the nerve muscle of the frog leg to analyze the threshold of the muscle contraction. The threshold was determined as the minimum amount of volts required to produce a twitch in the frog leg. Specifically, lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, was injected into the leg to see how it affected the chemical signaling between the neurons in the cell when compared to the leg with no lidocaine added. Sodium channels play a vital role in muscle contraction because they allow transmitters to be sent through the receptors of the post-synaptic cell, which then cause an action potential. If many of these sodium channels are blocked, the muscle will require more volts to reach threshold for the channels being blocked. The lidocaine that was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens served as the independent variable for this experiment, and the twitch threshold was the dependent variable that we measured. Rana pipiens was used for this experiment because of their small size and easily accessible muscles and nerves. Rana pipiens’ similarity to the anatomy of humans allows the experimenters to make generalizations of our own muscles based on this study. Based on our knowledge of muscle anatomy, we can hypothesize that the injection of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine will cause an increase in the twitch threshold of a muscle contraction in the frog leg when stimulated with an electrical signal.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we obtained two total frog legs, which were each used for as a control group and a treatment group. The independent variable was the 25 mM lidocaine that was injected into the frog legs, and the dependent variable was the effect that the lidocaine had on the twitch threshold of the legs.
Each frog leg was first skinned using tweezers as demonstrated in an instructional video. Afterwards, their thigh muscles were separated, and the sciatic nerve was exposed. Then, the gastrocnemius and Achilles were cut and tied back to the Achilles, allowing an isolation of the nerve to be experimented on. The leg was then attached to the iWorx electrophysiological recorder, and the program LabScribe was downloaded to ensure that the data could be properly recorded and measured. Throughout the experiment, the legs were kept moist in Ringer’s solution, which prevented the tissues from twitching spontaneously. 
Once the leg was properly dissected and attached to the machine, they were each tested to determine the minimum amount of volts required to reach threshold. This was achieved by slowly increasing the amount of volts until a visual twitch in the leg was noticed. We then set the program to fire 1 amplitude and recorded the average contraction amplitude for each of the legs. This data was clearly presented in the myograms of LabScribe and were recorded into our lab notebooks. After this information was recorded for each leg, we injected 25 mM of lidocaine into the leg and waited around 6 minutes before testing again. Once the sodium channel blocker had settled, we repeated the same data collection method and recorded them into our lab notebook. These two sets of data served as the control and treatment groups, respectively. A paired t-test was used to compare the control and treatment groups in order to analyze if the data was statistically significant.


Results:
In this experiment, we compared the muscle contraction of frog legs in Rana pipiens under two conditions: a standard frog leg and a leg injected with lidocaine sodium channel blocker. In addition to our two experimented frog legs, we were provided with additional data for our same experiment that allowed a proper statistical test to work and a deeper analysis and understanding of the data. A very clear overall trend in the data for our 10 legs is that the twitch threshold occurred at a higher voltage when lidocaine was present in the treatment group (Fig 1- Average Differences). The paired t-test that was performed showed that the mean of the control group was statistically different than that of the treatment group (t-stat= 4.778, df= 9, p= 0.001). The standard deviation for the control group was +/- 0.11, while the standard deviation for the treatment group was +/- 0.20. All of this data shows a high statistical significance in our experiment, and that the trends in the data are physiologically accurate.



Discussion:
We hypothesized that an injection of a sodium blocker would increase the voltage required to reach threshold in the muscles of a frog leg. Based on statistical analysis, our hypothesis was supported by the p-value of 0.001. This number reflects a substantial significance of our data, and further shows that our hypothesis was correct. For 9 of the 10 frog legs tested, the twitch threshold for the treatment group was markedly higher than that of the control group. From a physiological perspective, this conclusion makes sense. To further analyze what was explained in the introduction, sodium ions in a normal muscle contraction rush into the axon, and this buildup propagates the signal to push down the axon terminal to later fire an action potential. When the lidocaine was added and these sodium channels were blocked, there were less available sodium ions that were able to cross through the voltage gated ion channel. Because of this, an increase in voltage was required to push the signal through the axon terminal and cause an action potential, or “twitch”. When experimenting, we observed a slight delay between the firing of the electrical signal from LabScribe and the frog muscle twitching. This can also be explained by the lack of sodium ions being sent through the channels, which lead to a delay in the influx of calcium and the firing of an action potential to contract the muscle. In a similar experiment performed in 1970, Costantin and his experimenters made very similar conclusions to ours. After a motor neuron releases acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft, it binds to cells on the muscle fiber and triggers the release of sodium through sodium channels. The sodium release creates the action potentials that carry out muscle contraction when sodium channels are blocked, all of the action potentials do not fire, resulting in a smaller muscle contraction but a higher threshold. [Costantin: 1970]. The common denominator in both experiments is that the sodium channels directly effect the production of a muscle contraction in frog legs. Because the signal must pass through these channels first, they determine how fast and how strong a contraction is.
	Even though the experiment yielded results that supported the hypothesis, there were a few limitations to the overall study and experiment. The first of which is that our group had access to only two frog legs, which limited the amount of testing we could perform. This problem was fixed when our group received data from other groups to help solidify our data. Another potential issue was that the experiment used detatched limbs from a deceased frog. These legs, although similar, are different than the legs of living frogs where oxygen and energy are supplied rather than an electrical stimulus. To better the study, we can use multiple, living frog legs to receive more accurate results of the role of sodium in muscle contraction.
