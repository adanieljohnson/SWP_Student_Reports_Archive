Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride as a Calcium Channel Blocker in Voltage Stimulated Frog Legs 

Abstract:
Frogs have strong hind legs to propel themselves long distances. Because of this, it can also be assumed that this structure is an ideal test subject for neuromuscular control. The experiment used freshly severed legs of frogs so that ATP levels in the legs were as high and intact as possible in order to measure how well the leg would respond to stimulus. Under normal circumstances, calcium ions bind to proteins called troponin causing tropomyosin, another protein, to initiate a muscular contraction similar to what our stimulus would. We wanted to know how calcium’s absence would affect this process. We believed that the frog legs would not be able to conduct voltage as well given that there was some addition of calcium channel blocker present. To test this theory, an experimental group, the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg was injected with a small (.2 mL) dosage of Lanthanum Chloride, a calcium channel blocker, and the sciatic nerve was shocked with small but increasing amount of voltage. Overall, we rejected our hypothesis as the p-value was found to not be statistically significant. The difference between the two measurements were inconclusive and threshold voltages between the controlled and experimental tests were visibly different, but not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
The long hind legs of frogs are specifically designed for jumping, they contain muscles such as the gluteus, femoris, and the gastrocnemius which maximize their ability to make far fast movements. (Azizi 2010). Movement is stimulated by electrical impulses in the muscle that is conducted by a combination of both the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve, a basic property of neuromuscular control (Johnson AD). The neuromuscular system is the umbrella term used to describe the nerves and muscle combinations that control quick responses to both internal and external stimuli (Johnson AD). In normally functioning frog legs, there are neuromuscular junctions that receive the nerve impulses and act on them. For this process there is a release of the chemical substance acetylcholine (Ach) in the presynaptic nerve terminal which binds on a receptor and thus opens sodium channels. Normally, these action potentials spread throughout the length of muscle fibers stimulating the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. From there that release activates the contractile mechanisms of the myofibers of the skeletal muscle, and thus inducing the muscle to shorten which causes a contraction (Johnson AD). Following this there is a reuptake of calcium in preparation for the process to repeat again. If those channels were to be blocked, contraction might become blocked as well, or it may be delayed. This addition of calcium blocker, reduces the ability of the frog leg to conduct the electrical impulse which stimulates the contraction (Duncan 2005). This being said, the leg will not likely contract or at least twitch forcefully. A specific calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride was inserted into the frog leg in order to test this. This calcium channel blocker has been found to inhibit, either fully or partially, the movement of calcium ions across the cell membrane by blocking L-type calcium ion channels (Duncan 2005). With this in mind, we believe that the contraction we will be stimulating will still occur, however it will occur at a higher threshold in the experimental group by comparison to the control group studies. This might mean that the leg will contract only when a specific amount of voltage is applied to the sciatic nerve, or it may not contract at all with the L-type calcium channels completely inhibited. However, what can be agreed upon is that where the leg contracts, if it contracts, there will be less of a forceful movement in the form of a lower response voltage presented. To look at all the information we expect to observe, we looked specifically at a myogram created by an iworx’s software which recorded latency, the short period before the contraction or twitch, the contractile period in which myofibers shrink, and the relaxation period in which the myofibers relax and stretch out again. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, we will begin by gathering 3 similarly sized frog legs by which we will deglove, dissect, and hit with small amounts of voltage. We began first with the degloving of the first frog leg, meaning we removed the skin, starting first at the hip area down to the knee joint and finally to the toes. From there we treated it with a Gatorade-like substance full of electrolytes in order to keep the leg hydrated during the entirety of the experiment. This substance is called frog Ringer’s solution, it will allow the leg to remain viable for the conduction of voltage. After treating the leg, we went ahead and exposed the sciatic nerve, a visibly creamy white, string-like structure in the thigh of the frog leg. This nerve will later be what is stimulated with low but increasing levels of voltage. The final part of the dissection in preparation of this experiment, includes detaching the gastrocnemius muscle or the thigh from the Achilles tendon. This involved separating the gastrocnemius muscle from the tibialis anterior and cutting towards the toes to detach the muscle and part of the Achilles. Later we tied a knot at the junction between that gastrocnemius muscle and small portion of dissected Achilles which would later be the means by which the muscle was suspended by force transducers. Once that suspension process was completed and the muscle sat with a tiny amount of tension on the string at a 90-degree angle to the rest of the leg. The leg was pinned across the tibia and knee joint, the femur bone was also immobilized by a series of pins. From here the leg was prepared and sat ready to attach probes and conduct voltage. A computer was set up to record a myogram, a visual recording of a muscle twitch as stimulated vis an amount of voltage (Johnson AD).  The program which would be used to measure and record this information would be the iworx software known as Labscribe. This software made it possible for us to see the latency, contractile, and relaxation periods which later helped us to record amplitudes of the response twitch, a crucial part of our experiment. This computer was attached to the stimulator, which would conduct an amount of voltage into the leg allowing there to be some sort of response or lack thereof. We started stimulating the leg at .1 volts and then increased by .1 each time until we met threshold. This process was repeated for each leg. Each leg however was stimulated to threshold, over an interval of a single second, twice, the first time, under no influence of calcium blockers, and the second time after having injected .2 mL of a 1mM concentration of calcium blocker lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle. The process allowed the control test of the leg to be recorded first and then the experimental version to be tested. After the data was collected a paired T-test was done to determine whether or not the data collected was statistically significant. 

Results:
This is the data that was collected for the measured threshold values per each test. According the averages of the thresholds per control and experimental groups, the threshold response measured in volts was significantly higher than that of the control group than that of the experimental group which was under the influence of the lanthanum chloride. On its own, each controlled leg test measured well above its experimental partner. In general, it could be said that the control group responded more forcefully to the applied electrical impulse and was able to conduct said impulse better, achieving a maximal response voltage as a twitch. As indicated in the graph, maximal response conduction was achieved more readily in the frog legs not injected with the lanthanum chloride A paired t-test was used to determine the statistical significance or rather the statistical insignificance. In this instance the p value measuring .01587 was found to be less than .05, meaning that the data we found was not statistically significant. As a result, our data does not indicate a true difference between the data and the control and experimental groups.

Discussion:
As indicated by the data above, there was division in the response thresholds as the threshold of the control group responded with higher values that the experimental groups. However, the data according to a two-tiered t test, is not significant and no clear difference is present. The calcium channel blocker lanthanum chloride did have some effect on the response threshold as indicated by the lower threshold response found in the data, however it was no significant difference than measured in the control groups responses. It is known from previous studies that calcium channel blocking agents inhibit the movement of calcium ions across the cell membrane. Different types of these calcium channel blocking agents have not been found to interact much differently in different muscular systems (Duncan 2005), so it can be assumed that the calcium channel blocker we used to perform this experiment did in fact inhibit those channels from releasing and reuptake of the calcium and thus hindering a large or normal response, however, similarly in the other report, there was no real significance found in that data. There was possibly something to say about the health of the frog legs as a few days prior to our conducting this experiment, a number fell ill to a leg infection. We had to use frogs that had recently been delivered to the lab rather than those that had been in the lab setting for a number of days. While it is unclear if this could have affected their ability to conduct musculature response, it should be noted that there was some scrambling to get these legs in a timely fashion so that the experiment might be performed. In another sense, the legs twitched on their own freely of electrical impulse. This could mean that it was a very healthy frog leg or rather one that contained a lot of mitochondria and ATP. It could also have been excessive stimulation of the sciatic nerve while we dissected it from muscle surrounding it. Either way the toes of the frog continued to twitch throughout the entirety of the experiment unprovoked. This might have affected our response thresholds as such small twitches still consume some amount of ATP in the leg. The final notable thing to happen in the experiment was the measurement values of the final leg. The third leg that we tested measured significantly lower on response conducted voltage in comparison to the other frog legs. This could have been due to it drying out a bit while not treated with the frog Ringer’s solution even if we didn’t deglove it. Otherwise, there is the possibility that is was just not a very well energized leg, meaning the leg did not contain a significant amount needed of ATP to perform better towards its threshold response and used what it had, a minimal amount.
