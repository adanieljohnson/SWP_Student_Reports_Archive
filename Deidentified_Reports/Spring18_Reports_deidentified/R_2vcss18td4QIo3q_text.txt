Title: Energy Allocation in Radishes: Root-To-Shoot Height Ratios

Abstract:
Sunlight has a large impact on the lives of plants all over the earth. Energy allocation is a key factor in understanding how a specific plant's response might differ in certain environments. In this lab our group looked at energy allocation in radishes, and how it relates to the root-to-shoot ratios in several groups of seedlings. To set up this lab we placed one of our two groups in a sunny area, and the other under a shade cloth. We came back at least every other day to water both groups. The r:s weight/height ratios were measured in three random seedlings from both groups. We used a two-sample, one-tailed t_test. Our stats gave us the p_value for the root-to-shoot length ratio as 0.0913, and the p_value for the root-to-shoot weight ratio as 0.12 which are both insignificent at the 95% significance level. According to our results we were able to determine that the r:s ratios were not significently larger in our natural group compared to our shaded group, so the hypothesis was not supported. Our data may not have been very conclusive, but if we were able to constantly produce statistically significent results by correcting our flaws then we might be able to learn if plants tend to allocated more resources to their shoot system when in light deprived environments.

Introduction:
Sunlight has a large impact on the lives of plants all over the earth, because plants uniquely gain their energy through a sunlight-trapping-process called photosynthesis. This process is driven by the green pigment in leaves, chlorophyll, which uses these energetic rays of light emitted by the Sun to allow them to combine CO2 from the air with water from the soil in order to feed themselves. Energy allocation can be a key factor in understanding how a specific plant's response might differ in certain environments. In this lab our group looked at energy allocation in radishes, and how it relates to the root-to-shoot ratios in several groups of seedlings. One study done on several types of plants (Atwell, Kridemann, Turnbull: 1999) compared plants in high-light conditions to plants in low-light conditions. The study found that the plants in low-light environments tended to allocated more resources to light-harvesting pigments. A very basic concept in botany is that the leaves and stems (shoot systems) of many plants are where these specific pigments are most present. Therefore, the plants in the study must have allocated more resources to their shoot system making their root-to-shoot ratio smaller. I hypothesized that, because of what we now know, our plants in the shade treatment will have a lower root-to-shoot height ratio while the sunny treatment will have a higher ratio (because their allocation to their shoot system will be relatively lower than the shaded plants). The reason this experiment could be useful is because it could tell us more about how radishes (and other plants studied in our class) allocate their energy in resource rich environments, full of water, sunlight, and nutritional soil, compared to resource deprived environments which put much stress on these organisms.

Materials and Method:
To set up this lab our group was given four small soil buckets in which we buried and planted tens of radish seeds evenly throughout the soil. The next step we took was to separate the buckets into groups of two, with two buckets each. We then placed one of the two new groups in a sunny area within a greenhouse, and the other group into a shaded area under a 75% shade cloth in the greenhouse. We came back at least every other day to water both groups. We then measured the root-to-shoot weight/height ratios in three random radishes from both the sunlit and shaded groups. We used a scale to measure the total weight of each extracted plant, and we used a standard ruler to measure, in centimeters (later converted to millimeters), the length of the entire plant. We then carefully cut each of the previously weighed/measured plants at the point where the shoot and root systems met. After this step we were able to separately weight and measure the shoot and root systems of all six plants. We collected the data and calculated our statistics using a two-sample, one-tailed t_test.

Results:
After running the t_test, our p_value for the root-to-shoot length ratio was found to be 0.0913. In addition to that, we found the p_value for the root-to-shoot weight ratio to be 0.12 which are both insignificent at the 95% significance level. Generally speaking there was not much difference between the two group’s, shaded and lit, length or weight ratios. The p_value is slightly smaller in the length ratio compared to the weight ratio. Looking at Figure 1 we can see the mean length ratios were smaller at 0.363mm for the shaded group, and larger at 0.48mm for the sunlight treatment. Additionally, we can observe in Figure 2 the mean weight ratio for the shade treatment sits at 0.57g while the sunlight treatment is higher at 0.108g. The standard deviations, seen in both figures, was ±0.024 (weight ratio) and ±0.0597 (length ratio) for the shaded group. The standard deviations for the light group were ±0.0597 (weight ratio) and ±0.1106 (length ratio). When we initially observed the plants on the day we collected data it appeared to the naked eye that radishes from the shade treatment were less "full" and appeared to be more string-like than their sunlit counterparts. Referring to Figure 3 this observation becomes clearly visible.

Discussion:
According to our results we were able to determine that the root-to-shoot height ratio was not significently larger than our shaded group, so the hypothesis was not supported. Even though the average of the root-to-shoot ratio was numerically higher for the natural treatment, it was not so to a statistically significent level. The biological reasoning behind why our experiment did not go as planned could be explained by time. After around two weeks we didn't find any significent difference, but perhaps if we waited even more time and allowed more and more resources to be allocated in the shade treatment we would see more statistical significance between the two groups. Conversely, it is possible that if we gathered the data a week sooner than we did we might see a more rapid, early-onset of this resource allocation in the shaded treatment. When we compare our results from this experiment to those from Ericsson, we see in that under most circumstances generally plants with improved light conditions will allocate more resources to their root systems (Ericsson: 1995). Unfortunately, in our experiment this does not happen to a statistically significent degree. It is likely that there was some human error in gathering the data for the lengths. We used a silver sharpie to mark off where the roots ended, and the shoots began, but after washing dirt off the roots most of the sharpie came off with it. At that point it was mostly a guess as to where this divide between the two occurred. Also, if we had used a larger sample of plants from each group it is possible that our final numbers would have been more in line with our original hypothesis. I believe that if these confounding variables were better controllled in a repeat of the experiment, we would find statistically significent data. Our data may not have been very helpful in this experiment, but if we one day were to constantly produce significent results then we might be able to learn if plants tend to allocated more resources to their shoot system when in light deprived environments. If that is so then we could find at what rates this might occur, and according to the study done by Ericsson, knowing this information could help us predict the long term effects of the changing global climate on a variety of plant species’ growth and development.
