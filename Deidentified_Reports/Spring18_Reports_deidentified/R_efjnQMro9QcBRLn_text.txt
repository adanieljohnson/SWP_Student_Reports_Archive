Title: Impact of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if an extremely small supplement of Juvenile Hormone to the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars would have an effect on their maturation and pupation. We hypothesized that larval pupation would be delayed in a group of caterpillars fed a small supplement of JH in relation to a control group not fed that supplement. The background for this experiment was based on the knowledge of hormones as signaling molecules as well as the purpose of JH to prevent pupation in m. sexta caterpillars. This experiment collected data from 8 caterpillars weighed and measured every day for a week, 4 of which were fed a normal diet and 4 of which were fed a supplement to their normal diets of Precor (JH). The results of this experiment supported our hypothesis. Visually, the caterpillars in the treatment group resembled those in lower stages for maturation while the control group had progressed, and the treatment group was, on average, larger than the control group. Also, the P values from the T-Tests suggested that it is unlikely that those findings were most likely due to the added JH in the treatment group’s diet. 

Introduction:
Hormones are signaling molecules. They are released from one cell or gland into the bloodstream where they eventually reach their target(s) that they affect in some way. One example of the effect of hormones in humans is puberty where hormones cause growth and development. In manduca sexta caterpillars, JH is a hormone that inhibits the maturation into adulthood by delaying pupation. It is explained in one study in the following terms, “JHs are status-quo hormones that maintain the insect in its current form as the insect is responding to the molting surge of ecdysone,” (Truman). Some people are now asking about the use of these hormones in commercial uses in the form of pesticides. Our question involves the amount of JH that will have an effect on the timing of pupation, but in m. sexta caterpillars. We will have a control group, fed a normal diet, and an experimental group that will be fed a small supplement (12 drops per forty grams of food) of JH to se if this amount will still delay pupation. We hypothesize that larval pupation will be delayed in the m. sexta caterpillars fed the diet with the 3 drop supplement of JH per 10 grams of food. 

Materials and Methods:
We first obtained 80 grams of normal food for m. sexta caterpillars and split it into two equal portions of approximately 40 grams each for the control and treatment groups. We then added 12 drops of water to the control group’s 40 grams of food and 12 drops of Precor to the treatment group’s food and stirred the food. After that, we selected 8 manduca sexta caterpillars and weighed and measured the length of each of them. We then put them in separate rearing tubes formed by placing and taping a notecard into the middle of each container, so that two caterpillars could fit in each container. At this point we labelled each container with our initials, lab group and caterpillar number and group (control or treatment). We gave each caterpillar 10 grams of its diet (control with no added JH or treatment with added JH in the form of Precor). Throughout the week, we kept all the caterpillars in an incubator so they were exposed to the same environmental conditions and we weighed and measured each of them every day (for a total of 8 days) feeding them as needed (3 times total). The Precor that was used was a 1:1250 dilution/concentration. We recorded visual observations as the week progressed and, after all of the data was collected we performed a 2 sample T-Test for the average length and weight of the control and treatment groups. 

Results:
Observations:
	Day 3: Caterpillar number 3 (in the control group) has begun to shed skin. Caterpillar number 6 (in the treatment) has already shed some skin. 
	Day 4: Caterpillar number 3 (in the control group) still has not finished shedding its skin. 
	Day 5: All the caterpillars in the treatment group (numbers 5-8) are lighter in color than the control group. There is also little to no black marking on the backs of the caterpillars in the treatment group. Numbers 6 and 7 (of the treatment group) do not have any black markings on their backs. 
	Day 6: Caterpillar number 3 (in the control group) is significantly smaller than any of the other caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups and still has not shed the skin it began shedding in the beginning of the week.

Discussion:
In this experiment, the added JH in the form of Precor in the diet of the m. sexta caterpillars, did appear to delay or slow down the pupation of the caterpillars in the treatment group. This conclusion is based on the P values from the T-Tests for length and weight. The P value for length is approximately 0.01 and for weight is 0.07. That means that there is less than a 1.4% chance that the results showing that the length of the caterpillars changed due to the addition of JH in the diet were caused by chance. For weight, there is a strong correlation, based on the slightly higher P value and so it is 7.3% likely that the results for weight are representative of changes caused by JH and not because of chance. This, according to Truman’s article, suggests that, because our hypothesis is supported by the data collected and is likely due to the addition of JH to the diets of the treatment caterpillars, that change is likely correlated to a change in the timing of metamorphosis, specifically with JH hormone, pupation. In addition, the treatment caterpillars were larger than the control group and they did not have the black markings on their backs. These points indicate that the treatment group of caterpillars stayed in 1st or 2nd instar phases, only growing larger while the control group began to progress on to further maturation. Our only issue with data involved caterpillar number 3 in the control group. It is considered an outlier as there was obviously something wrong with its health upon observation. It was not eating and so was not developing, skewing the data slightly. The other caterpillars in the control group did, however, support our hypothesis.
