Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on the Threshold Amplitude of Rana pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
The contraction of a muscle requires an intricate chain of reactions involving many chemicals that activate others, starting with the receiving of a stimulus and ending with the contraction itself. Calcium is essential to this process because it activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. It was hypothesized that the blocking of calcium through the chemical lanthanum chloride injected into a Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle would inhibit muscle contraction and thus require a greater stimulus to contract. Subsequently, the threshold amplitude of the muscle would be higher than that of an untreated muscle in which calcium was not blocked. This hypothesis was proven to be true due to the fact that the untreated muscle had a lower threshold amplitude than the treated muscle (p= 0.272207). This proves that an uninhibited amount of calcium is essential to achieving the minimum threshold amplitude of a frog leg and that the inhibition of calcium requires a greater stimulus and therefore produces a higher threshold amplitude. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles contract after receiving a signal from a stimulus [Johnson: 2018]. At the neuromuscular junction, nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to its receptor on the membrane of a muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. This binding opens sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber, which stimulates the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2018]. This release of Ca2+ causes the muscle to contract by activating the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. The minimum stimulus required to make a muscle contract from this process is called the threshold amplitude. Lanthanum chloride is a calcium-blocking substance, which could inhibit this process and therefore require a higher stimulus to make the muscle contract. In 1987, Glusa and Markwardt performed an experiment that tested the effects of lanthanum chloride injection on a human postmortem femoral vein and found that it inhibited the contraction by 90% [Glusa: 1987]. We hypothesize that if we inject the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg with lanthanum chloride, the threshold amplitude of the muscle contraction will be higher compared to that of an untreated muscle due to the lower concentration of calcium in the muscle. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to perform this experiment, we used an iWorx electrophysiological recorder and data analysis software to record electromyrograms. We attached the frog leg nerve to the recorder and fired a stimulus to the nerve to find the initial threshold amplitude three times to obtain an average untreated threshold amplitude. We then injected the frog leg with .1 mL of 1 mmmol concentration of lanthanum chloride using a syringe. Due to the large size of the molecules, we waited eight minutes to stimulate the nerve again to allow for the molecules to diffuse. We stimulated the muscle after eight minutes, nine minutes, and ten minutes and then obtained the average threshold amplitude from the three calculations. The average threshold amplitude for both the treated and untreated leg, the degrees of freedom, the t-value, and the p-value were obtained through a paired t-test.



Results:
The average threshold amplitude of four frog legs before being injected with lanthanum chloride was 0.064625 Volts. After being injected with lanthanum chloride, the average threshold amplitude of four frog legs was 0.071125 Volts. The mean change in threshold amplitude between the injected and un-injected frog legs was 0.0065 Volts +/- 1.191708 Volts. The mean threshold amplitude of the lanthanum chloride-treated frog leg was significantly greater than the mean of threshold amplitude of the frog legs before being treated with lanthanum chloride (t-stat = 1.191708, df = 7, P = 0.272207). These values were obtained through a paired t-test.

Discussion:
Based on our results, the hypothesis that the threshold amplitude of the muscle would be higher after being injected with lanthanum chloride was supported. This means that the lanthanum chloride did indeed block Ca2+, and therefore there wasn’t as much Ca2+ to activate the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, requiring a higher stimulus threshold to activate contraction. This difference in threshold amplitude between the treated and untreated frog leg was statistically significant (p= &gt;0.05). This is consistent with our hypothesis and Glusa and Markwardt’s study that explored the ability of lanthanum chloride in human muscle to block Ca2+ and supported the fact that less Ca2+ means that the threshold amplitude would be higher as opposed to a greater concentration of Ca2+ that activates the contractile mechanism. Although the contraction of the muscles was not inhibited to the same degree that Glusa and Markwardt’s were, both experiments support the fact that an inhibition of calcium subsequently affects the muscles threshold of contraction, requiring a greater stimulus to contract. The ability to inhibit calcium in a muscle in order to increase the threshold amplitude is important because one can understand the importance of calcium to the muscle contraction process through this experiment. Calcium is essential to creating the lowest threshold amplitude possible- it’s inhibition raise this threshold amplitude, making it more difficult for the muscle to contract. Moving forward, studies could be performed that examine the effects of blocking other molecules involved in the process of muscle contraction, such as ACh and Na, to understand the effect they have on threshold amplitude of muscles. Knowledge of how certain molecules affect muscle contraction is important because it gives us a greater understanding of the intricate processes of muscle contraction.

Figure 1: Average Threshold Amplitude of Untreated and Lanthanum Chloride-Treated Rana pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle. The threshold amplitude before injecting lanthanum chloride into the muscle was found three times for each leg before an average was obtained. The legs were then treated with .1 mL of 1mmmol concentration of lanthanum chloride and the threshold amplitude was found after waiting 8 minutes, 9 minutes, and 10 minutes after the injection. Four legs were measured in this way and the results of the untreated and treated threshold amplitudes were averaged. Each bar is the mean threshold amplitude of each group; error bars are +/- 0.064625 Volts for the untreated leg and +/- 0.272207 Volts for the lanthanum chloride treated leg.
