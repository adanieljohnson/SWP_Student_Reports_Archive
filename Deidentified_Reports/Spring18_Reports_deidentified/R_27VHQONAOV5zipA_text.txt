Title: Frog legs: Nerve and Muscle performance 

Abstract:
  This experiment involved the use of frog legs in order to display the basic unit of neuromuscular controll. This was done through the obsvervation of the length of the contraile and relaxation phases of the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve.Acetylcholinesterase blocker will be used throughout this experiment to effectively controll the contractile and relaxation phases of  the frog leg muscles. The effect of the acetylcholinesterase blocker will be inhibited, therefore prolonging the length of the contraction. The hypothesis for this experiment is that if the amount  of acetylcholine is increased that the muscle will not be able to relax and will remain contracted for a longer period of time. The iWorx program was used to collect the data for the 3 frog legs with and without the injected acetylcholinesterase blocker solution. We found  that before treatment the twitch duration was shorter. In addition to this we noticed that the acetylcholine , in the 2nd frog leg, effected the threshold value the most in comparison to the other frog legs. In addition after the introduction of the acetylcholinesterase blocker the twitches were longer while before the introduction of the drug the twitches were longer. 


Introduction:
Skeletal muscles in invertebrates and vertebrates consist of hundreds and thousands of fused aggregates of cells. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. Motor neurons extend into the muscle and innervate individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. The arrival of nerve impulse at neuromuscular junctions trigger the release of acetylcholine. This leads to a series of cascading operations that eventually lead to the contraction, the shortening, of a muscle. This experiment will focus on phases of muscle contraction and relaxation in specific muscles in a frog leg. The frog leg is used to display the basic units of neuromuscular controll. This experiment will controll the amount of acetylcholine in the postsynaptic cleft by utilizing an acetylcholinesterase blocker. Acetylcholinesterase blocker will be used throughout this experiment to effectively controll the contractile and relaxation phases of  the frog leg muscles. The effect of the acetylcholinesterase blocker will be inhibited, therefore prolonging the length of the contraction. The hypothesis for this experiment is that if the amount  of acetylcholine is increased that the muscle will not be able to relax and will remain contracted for a longer period of time. The specific muscle that is being manipulated is the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve.

Materials and Method:
After each experimental group was given a 2-3 frog legs, the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve had to be exposed through the removal of the frog skin on the frog leg. The muscle tissue was then kept moist due to the periodical administration of the electrolyte solution or Frog Ringer solution. Then the probe, attached to the iWorx myogram reader, was secured onto the sciatic nerve. The data for the threshold, the average contractile length and the average amplitude. The iWorx program was used to collect the data for the 3 frog legs with and without the injected acetylcholinesterase blocker solution.

Results:
 Before treatment the twitch duration was shorter. In addition to this we noticed that the acetylcholine , in the 2nd frog leg, effected the threshold value the most in comparison to the other frog legs. In addition after the introduction of the acetylcholinesterase blocker the twitches were longer while before the introduction of the drug the twitches were longer. Our experimental group combined results with other groups that utilized the acetylcholinesterase blocker  as well. So, we have an additional 3 frog added to our data and after analysis of their data found that on average before treatment the amplitude of the twitches were  larger in  comparison to the treatment group. In addition the twitch duration after treatment increased as well.

Discussion:
Acetylcholinesterase blocker prevented the acetylcholine from exiting the postsynaptic cell cleft. Therefore this allows the muscle contraction is prolonged. However in our specific experiment, with each frog leg the muscle contractile length decreased after the introduction of the treatment. Which could mean the relaxation period after the muscle contraction decreased after the introduction of the treatment.
