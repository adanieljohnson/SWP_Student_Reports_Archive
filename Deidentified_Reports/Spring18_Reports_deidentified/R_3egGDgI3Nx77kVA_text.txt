Title: Colder Water Temperatures Decrease Aggressive Behavior of Male Bettas

Abstract:
Betta splendins or Siamese fighting fish are best known for their bright colors and their inability to have two males coexist. We know that male bettas display several different kinds of aggressive behaviors towards one another, but we do not know some of the factors that influence what encourages or discourages this behavior. This experiment tested and observed the differences in behavior with an environmental influence of cooler temperatures. It is found that the male bettas are much more active and aggressive in the room temperature water. When placed in the cold water, the two males show little to no interest in each other but rather more interest in conserving their limited energy reserve due to this environmental factor influencing the amount of oxygen available to the bettas. 

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish, better known as betta fish, are a fish that originated in southeast Asia but are now more commonly known as domesticated aquarium fish. In their natural wild habitats, they are not the bright colors we typically think of when we think of betta fish. These bright colors are their fighting colors, displayed typically in the presence of another male as a defensive demonstration. When a male betta is in the presence of another male betta, they become territorial and begin to display an array of aggressive behaviors including: tail beating, erect pectoral fins, tail flashing, spreading of the opercula, pelvic fin flickering, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. Behavioral displays can be viewed as a way that one gathers information on their opponent and their skills as well as initiating a fight if they assess that the outcome will prove positive for them. [Arnott: 2016] However, one study done shows that when introduced to another male and after displaying their spread gills for a prolonged period, they will switch to spreading their fins instead. Of the behavioral displays mentioned previously, the spreading of the opercula takes the most energy. Both spreading the gills and spreading fins are ways to make themselves appear bigger to the opposing male to defend their territory without making physical contact. This suggests that the conservation of energy is important to bettas as it is a limited resource that must be used carefully. [Forsatkar: 2017] We know that some of these aggressive (or agnostic) behaviors consume a lot of energy. We do not know about the biochemical responses that correspond to performance and metabolic rate during these displays of agnostic behavior. [Regan: 2015] 
	The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect of colder temperatures on the aggressive behavior of male bettas in comparison to an environment that the bettas would be used to which is simply room temperature water; as well as be able to statistically analyze our data findings. I hypothesize that colder temperatures will decrease behavior due to the reduction of oxygen in colder temperatures. Due to the decrease in oxygen, the bettas will display less behavior in order to maintain their energy reserve and focus it on themselves rather than others. 


Materials and Method:
To do this experiment we began with a tank of room temperature water with two male bettas and put another tank of water into the refrigerator to bring down the temperature of the water while we performed the first part of the experiment. To be able to statistically analyze the change in behavior we came up with a scale that ranked the most common aggressive movements displayed by betta fish. In observation, we would write down the number of the ranking of the behavior they performed each time it happened in the time allotted for observation. The two male bettas were separated by both a clear piece of glass and an opaque partition, so they could not view each other. We first observed the bettas for 2 minutes and noted any sign of aggressive behavior of the two males in isolation. Then we removed the opaque partition, leaving the glass so the two could see each other but not make physical contact. We observed them for two minutes, made notes of each time they showed any aggressive behavior, then replaced the partition to rest the fish for five minutes. We then repeated this observation with no physical contact and rested them again. We then removed both the partition and the glass to observe the aggressive behavior between the males with no physical barriers. We again observed, noted and scored any aggressive behavior shown by both fish and separated the two as soon as they made physical contact. If they did not make physical contact, we set the observation time at two minutes. We replaced the partitions, rested the fish for five minutes, then repeated the last behavior observation. We then transferred the fish to the tank that had been in the refrigerator and repeated the same behavioral observations that we had with the room temperature tank. With our results we took the average of each test that we had performed twice to get the most accurate number for comparison. To analyze our results, we used a paired t_test, comparing the room temperature behavior versus the colder temperature behavior of each fish. 

Results:
In general, the change in behavior and activity of the two fish was visibly significent between the change in temperature. When placed in the colder water, the bettas became more sedentary and less interested in each other than they had been previously. This is best displayed by the comparison of the average of Fish 1 in the room temperature water versus the colder water (Figure 1). In this graph the decrease in behavior ranking is easily noticeable. When the paired t_test was performed it was shown that the average rank of the behavior of both groups decreased between the two different temperatures (t_stat = 1.23, d.f.= 1, P= 0.43). This P value represented by the paired t_test confirms that the difference between the two groups is significent. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that the colder water would prove a decrease in aggressive behavior from two male bettas and this was supported by the data found from this experiment. Based on our behavior ranking scale you can see a significent difference in the behavior score of Fish 1 between temperatures (Figure 1). The data found for Fish 2 also supports the hypothesis but the difference between the two temperatures was not as drastic for Fish 2 as it was for Fish 1. The reason for the change in behavior presumptuously has to do with the bettas need to conserve energy in the colder temperatures. Instead of the betta expending its energy and resources on another fish, it focuses more on itself, maintaining homeostasis, and conserving energy that could be used on something of more significance than fighting another betta fish. Additionally, those fish who do exhibit more aggressive behaviors, have higher surfacing frequencies, as well as higher aerobic capacities. [Regan: 2015] If in the colder water the fish did exhibit more profound aggressive behaviors, it would not only require more energy for them to display these behaviors, but it would also require additional energy for swimming to the surface to obtain aerial oxygen. With the reduced amount of energy, if a betta had to complete these actions they would exhaust very quickly, leaving them energy depleted and less likely to be able to defend their territory if necessary. Rather, the bettas simply stay in place for the most part metabolizing energy for them to be able to use. 
	The one issue with this experiment that could possibly improve results if redone, was the fish. These bettas had been in and out of tanks and been observed for their aggressive behaviors for two weeks. Even in the room temperature water with no physical barriers, they were slightly slow on making physical contact/interacting and displaying behaviors to one another. It was very noticeable that the energy of these fish was completely drained. In ending there are two options: One, the hypothesis was proven correct by the data found in this experiment, or two that by the time we had conducted this experiment, the fish simply werenâ€™t as interested in each other anymore as they possibly had been at the beginning of the two weeks of experiments. If redone, it would be interesting to see what results the experiment would yield. If it would additionally support our hypothesis, or if it would completely disprove it.
