Title: Effects of Ecdysone Blockers on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
When analyzing the effects of Azamax (ecdysone blocker) on the Manduca sexta, there should be a clear inhibition on the growth and development of the caterpillar. There will be a control group where the food is supplemented with water and the treatment group will have food supplemented with Azamax. Despite the presence of what was thought to be an effective ecdysone blocker, the Azamax did not have a clear effect on the development of the caterpillars because this specific blocker does not affect the organism Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
Hormones are very critical to all life on Earth. They begin and mark the end of changes in an organism’s body. One of these changes is known as “Puberty,” which involves hormones and fluctuating levels of hormones which cause change and maturation of the human body. Something similar to Puberty can happen in a way to insects, where this similar process involves two hormones responsible for physical change – Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone. A case study was performed by Tunaz H. and Uygun N. and they found evidence of insect growth regulators (IGRs), which “adversely affect insect growth and development” (Tunaz: 2004). These IGRs do not provide any toxicity hazards but rather lead to a multitude of abnormalities that impair insect survival. These researchers first discovered IGRs by observing the cultures of the linden bug, which had low egg hatch rates and failed to mature into adults. Likewise, in our experiment, we hope to find the same results when inhibiting the hormone, ecdysone, in the Manduca sexta, because varying levels of ecydonse and ecdysone inhibitors should cause changes in development and growth (Schlüter: 1985). We hope to see that the presence of the Azamax (ecdysone inhibitor) will affect and inhibit the hormone, ecdysone, thus inhibiting the growth and inhibit of the insect, just as the IGRS affected the Linden Bug. 

Materials and Methods:
First, as a group, we selected eight, 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing about 1.0 to 2.0 grams, dividing them into groups of two. Four containers were utilized in order to provide an environment for the caterpillars; each container was separated by a notecard and two caterpillars were placed in one container. Two containers were marked as treatments and the other two containers were marked as controls. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets. One of these diets, (1) the control, was ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet, made as recommended by the manufacturer and had six drops of water added to the ten grams of food. There was a total of four caterpillars that received this food diet. The second diet, (2) the treatment, was ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet, made as recommended by the manufacturer and with the addition of six drops of Azamax per ten grams of food per caterpillar. All eight of these caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 25 degrees Celsius, in a 12 hour dark : 12 hour light cycle. Every day, for approximately seven days, our group recorded the final weight, length, observations, and amount of food eaten by each caterpillar. In this experiment, we will be using a two-sample t-test in order to analyze our data, and thus our experiment.

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the weight (g), length (mm), and amount of food eaten (%) by each group caterpillars was that they all generally decreased as time passed. The majority of the caterpillars remained a bright greenish blue color throughout the experiment There was however a major color change from control #3 from green to yellow and there was a slight color change from green to yellow in treatments #1,2, and 4. Also, control #3 and treatment #3 started to pupate towards the end of the experiment. 

Length: t-stat = 0.70, df = 14, P = 0.493

Weight: t-stat = 2.03, df = 14, P = 0.062

Amount of Food Eaten: t-stat = 0.81, df = 12, P = 0.434

Discussion:
Based upon on our data, we cannot come to the conclusion that the presence of Azamax in the caterpillars’ food did in fact affect and inhibit the hormone, ecdysone, and thus inhibit the growth and development of the insect. The data for both our control and treatment groups were very similar; the general trend for both groups for the recorded length, weight, and the amount of food eaten all decreased as time passed during the experiment. There is no clear distinct difference based upon the charts when analyzing the data and no difference in trends when comparing the presence of the ecdysone blocker to the absence of ecdysone blocker. This can be seen with our P-values and t-stats, as well as the standard deviation bars in the figures above. In order to conclude that one’s results were not by mere chance, or coincidence, the P-value should be less than 5%, which is equivalent to 0.05. As seen for Length and Amount of Food Eaten, the P-values are significantly higher than 0.05, therefore not ruling out the possibility that our data was due to pure coincidence and thus not allowing our group to come to a conclusion based upon the prescribed amounts of ecdysone inhibitors provided to our caterpillars. Also, with our weight, the t-stat is also significantly high as well, where the t-stat is a measure of the range of the statistical estimate. The standard deviation bars in our figures are large as well, meaning the data spreads over a large range compared to that of the mean. 
	There may have been no effect on the caterpillars due to a multitude of potential factors. One, there may not have been enough Azamax added to the caterpillar’s food. As a result, there was not a sufficient amount of ecdysone inhibitors in order to have an effect on the development of the caterpillars. Due to this, there could have been enough ecdysone produced in the caterpillar to reach the commitment pulse, which then could be cause for the color change and pupation of certain caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups. It is also stated in a journal that Azamax may affect growth of Manduca sexta, but however, low amounts of ecdysone inhibitors did not cause any change in growth; the caterpillars still grew and pupated. Although, when given a lot larger dosages, the caterpillars were not able to grow, did not completely development, and thus did not pupate, ultimately dying in the end (Schlüter: 1985). Another potential cause for the inaccuracy of data could be the stacking of containers within the incubator. Some of the containers may have been stacked within the incubator, thus limiting the amount of oxygen that gets to the caterpillars. This condition would affect both the treatments and the controls, limiting the amount of oxygen circulating through their body and inhibiting their development and growth. Another potential reason for why there is no significant difference between the two groups could be the fact that our group used the wrong ecdysone blocker. There are multiple ecdysone blockers but each one has different conditions and effects on the Manduca sexta. In Gilbert’s and Gill’s book, Insect control: Biological and synthetic agents, it states that the ecdysone blocker, Azamax, does not inhibit the hormone ecdysone and thus does not inhibit the growth and development of the Manudca Sexta (Gilbert: 2010). Also, it states that Azamax may potentially increase and extend the JH peak, thus causing the caterpillar’s body to not acknowledge the commitment pulse and therefore not pupate and continually grow in weight and length (Gilbert: 2010). This could lead to similarities and lack of difference between our control and treatment groups. 
	Based on our results and lack of significant effects of the Azamax, we cannot reject our null hypothesis. Our experiment did not run parallel to the IGRs in the Linden bug, discovered by Tunaz and Uygun in that the ecdysone blockers did not impair the development of the caterpillars. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported by our data and in order to improve our data if we were to do this experiment again, we should be careful not to stack the containers in the incubator, target an ecdysone blocker that directly has effects on the Manduca Sexta, and most likely apply more drops of the ecdysone blocker to the caterpillars’ food.
