Title: Taking Betta Fish and Placing them in their Normal Environment Causes them to Decrease their Aggressive Behaviors 

Abstract:
Betta fish are indigenous to flood plains, canals, rice paddies and medium to large rivers 
in Southeast Asia, but they became domesticated around 1850 [Nasim: 2017]. They can live in turbid water better than other fish because they have a labyrinth organ which allows them to get water from the surface instead of having to rely on the oxygen in the water. These fish are loved for the “fighting colors” they exhibit when they are exhibiting aggressive behaviors. The male Betta fish are very territorial and exhibit aggressive behaviors when around another male, which caused them to show their different colors. In the animal kingdom, aggressive behavior plays a significent role in the fitness of animals [Nasim: 2017]. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that two domesticated male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior towards each other when in clear water than in turbid water. This hypothesis was proven by the results of this experiment. In the turbid water the mean of the broadside movements was 24.67±2.082 while in the clear water it was 38.33±10.504. The mean for the facing movements in the turbid water was 20.33±13.50 while in the clear water it was 55±13.077. Both the broadside and facing movements were higher in the clear water than in the turbid water. The resu

Introduction:
Ethology was one of the major components used to carry out this experiment. Ethology is the study of animal behavior, and ethologists try to understand the physiological purposes behind behaviors and how they have been shaped by evolution. These studies allow ethologists to compare different species with different ecological backgrounds and histories. The Betta splendes, or Siamese fighting fish, are indigenous to more muddy waters in Southeast Asia. They started to become domesticated around the year 1850. The males are very territorial and in the presence of other males, and exhibit aggressive behaviors. Betta fish can tolerate oxygen-poor water because of their labyrinth organ which would come in handy in the muddy water they were indigenous to. It was hypothesized that two domesticated male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior towards each other when in clear water than in turbid water. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, the aggressive behaviors the Betta fish displayed were being counted. The fish can exhibit both broadside and facing movements of aggression. In order from least aggressive to most, for broadside movements, it is pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. In order from least aggressive to most for facing movements it is, facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading its opercula, and then protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. The lowest sign of aggression in both the broadside and facing got assigned 1 point, the next most aggressive got 2 points, and the most aggressive got 3 points. In this experiment, there were two male Betta fish that were separated by a glass wall. They were at first in clear water and the colored separator was removed so they could see each other. The amount of times both fish exhibited each behavior was recorded for a total of 5 minutes. The color separator was then placed so the fish could rest. The observation of the fish in the clear water happened a total of 3 times, each at with 5 minutes on and 5 minutes rest. After the clear water was observed, dirt was put in both sides of the tank to make the water turbid. The dirt was mixed in the water and it became very groggy. The fish were then observed again for 5 minutes as they exhibited their aggressive behaviors. This was observed 3 times as well, for 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off. The amount of points each fish got for each round was calculated and a paired t_test was used to determine the statistical significance of the experiment. 

Results:
The mean for the score of broadside movements for both fish in the clear water through the entire experiment was 38.33±10.504 (Table 2). The mean for the facing movements for fish 1 and fish 2 in the clear water was 55±13.077 (Table 1). In the turbid water, the mean for the broadside movements was 24.67±2.082 for both fish (Table 4). The mean for the facing movements for the fish in the turbid water was 20.33±13.50 (Table 3). The results of the pair t_test was: t_stat=2.054792, d.f.=3, P=0.132155.

Discussion:
The results prove the hypothesis of this experiment was supported. The amount of aggressive behavior in the fish that were in the turbid water was significently lower than the fish that were in the clear water. Although the means say the hypothesis was supported, the t_test showed the different in the groups were not significently different because p was not less than 0.05. These fish exhibited less behavior aggressive in the turbid water in order to preserve energy. These fish do have the labyrinth organ which allows them to breathe better in turbid water, but these fish were domesticated since they were baby fish. One reason this hypothesis was supported is because it is found that domesticated Betta fish are more aggressive than wild-type males [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. The male betta fish in this experiment exhibited more aggression towards each other because they are more aggressive in the audience of a male than of a female [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. This is a main reason the Betta fish exhibited an aggressive behavior toward each other in the first place. In the lab, one of the male betta fish was being more aggressive than the other. Male fish tend to act different around fish they know have won a fight [Dzieweczynski: 2012]. These fish had been swapped in and out for experiments and the fish that was less aggressive may have noticed the other make betta was more aggressive than him, so he backed down more often. Although this may all be true, the real reason the hypothesis was supported was because of the turbid water. Betta fish in turbid water are less aggressive because they have to spend more energy making sure they have enough oxygen. A domesticated betta fish does not really need to worry about oxygen as much, which allows them to allocate more of their energy to their aggressive behaviors.
