Title: The Effect of Water Visibility on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta splendens

Abstract:
Animals in every environment have to compete for resources like food, nutrients, territory for mating, and space to live. Organisms are required to use defense mechanisms based on the amount of competition they face in their environment. The Siamese fighting fish or Betta splendens are highly aggressive towards each other when competing for resources. The fish show multiple levels of aggression towards one another and can fight to the death. In this experiment, two male betta fish were encouraged to interact in an aquarium setting. We examined the effect of water turbidity on the aggressive behaviors towards an opponent. We found that the results of this experiment supported our hypothesis that the amount aggression is decreased when there is less water visibility. Overall, our results show that the betta fish are more aggressive to one another when they can see one another. 

Introduction:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, is used to understand actions of animals through their perspective. Animal behavior, like aggression, is used to defend oneself and prevent predators or other organisms causing harm. Within each environment, every organism has to interact and compete for resources like food and territory to mate and live. They are required to interact and coexist with both abiotic and biotic factors of their environment. Competition and interaction almost requires some form of defense mechanisms by each organism. Similarly, aggression can be useful to compete for the resources necessary for survival. In this experiment, Betta splendens, a fighting fish that originated in Southeast Asia, are placed in a small aquarium environment to observe aggressive behaviors in two different water environments. Male bettas can show extreme aggression towards one another and are significantly more aggressive towards each other than females (Forsatkar, Nematollahi & Brown, 2016).  This experiment tests whether turbidity of water can affect the amount of aggression. I predict that the betta fish will have quicker and more aggressive behaviors in the clean water environment. 

Materials and Methods:
Obtain a sectioned aquarium with the availability of two individual slots. Create the two sectioned off areas in the aquarium using both a transparent glass slide and a solid white slide. Put one male Betta fish of similar size in each side of the aquarium with both the white and glass slides separating the fish. Raise the white slide so the two fish can see one another but leave the glass slide so they cannot make any physical contact. Let the fish react and write observations down using a point system (1x=pelvic flickering, 2x=tail beating, 3x=tail flashing, etc.) for both broadside and frontal behaviors by amount of aggression. Observe and record tally marks for five minutes, and immediately put the white slide back into the aquarium to let the fish rest for five minutes. Repeat for a total of three trials. Let the fish rest for five minutes then add unfertilized soil to the water and let the fish rest for five minutes. After the resting period, repeat the same procedure as the clear, clean water. Record and count all of the tally marks. Find the means and standard deviations of the broadside and frontal movements of both fish. Perform a paired t-test to compare the data. 

Results:
The betta fish in clean water responded to each other with more aggressive behaviors than in the turbid water. Based on the average number of aggressive behaviors during each trial, there was a significant difference between the behaviors in the two environments. The mean amount of aggressive behavior for trials in the clear water (93.33) was greater than the mean amount of aggressive behavior in turbid water (45). Additionally, the standard deviation of the behavior in clear water (22.50) as also higher than in turbid water conditions (15.54).  In a paired t-test, the results show that (t=2.055, df=3, p&lt;.05) for the aggressive behaviors between the two betta fish. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the male betta fish would have quicker and more aggressive behavior in clear water than turbid water was supported. The mean number of aggressive acts in clear water was almost twice as much as the mean number of aggressive acts in the turbid water. This could be explained by the amount of visibility in the water in the turbid water versus the clear water. The soil made the water much cloudier and the fish could have had a harder time seeing their opponent, more specifically, their size. The fish could also have had a hard time determining their territory and the limits of their territory in the aquarium due to the turbidity. Also, due to the biology of the fish, swimming in the turbid water could have been more energy consuming. They could have expressed less aggression due to energy allocation and focus on conserving energy for food. In this species of fish, there seem to be a few cues that can prompt the aggressive and agonist behavior (Romano, et al., 2017). In a similar lab, betta fish were placed in front of a mirror and this resulted in aggressive behavior towards the reflection. The fish continued their aggressive behavior in multiple trials (Frances & Hinde, 1968). This could be due to the identical size of the fish in the reflection and the mirrored behavior displayed. Betta fish tend to use this aggressive behavior to distinguish where their territory is and began in the rice patties in Southeast Asia. In their original environment, the Betta fish would fight until the death of an opponent, and this allows for competition to lead the natural selection of aggressive traits.
