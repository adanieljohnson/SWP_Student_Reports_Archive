Title: Caffeine’s Effect on the Muscle Contraction of Rana Pipiens Legs

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment is to investigate the effect of added stimulant, in this case caffeine, on muscle contractions of Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. Our hypothesis is that if the frog muscle is treated with caffeine, it will go into immediate tetany. We will be testing three Rana Pipiens frog legs, each will be tested first for normal muscle contractions, and then again with a injection of caffeine, as the experimental design, in order to see the direct effects of caffeine. Due to the fact that we are treating each leg as both the control and treatment group, a paired t-test will be conducted. We will focus on recording the voltage, amplitude and time of each contraction in order to notice any differences between the two groups. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system includes all the muscles, and nerves associated with them, in your body. In order for your muscles to contract, resulting in movement, your nerves and muscles must work together. Skeletal muscle, specifically, consists of bundles of myofibers and motor neurons. Every muscle contraction begins with nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction, causing acetylcholine to be released in the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to multiple receptors of the muscle fiber, resulting in the opening of calcium channels. Calcium binds to troponin, troponin shifts tropomyosin, which before was blocking the active sites of actin. Myosin heads form cross-bridges with the actin active sites, and the cross bridges pull actin, which slides over myosin. ATP attaches to myosin causing the breakage of each cross-bridge. Overall, this process leads to the shortening of the sarcomere, the functional unit of a muscle cell. Furthermore, the shortening of the muscle fiber is what defines a contraction. We are observing the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana Pipien frog. One way to effect the contraction of the muscle would be to perform chemically induced tetany. Tetany is associated with the lack of calcium ions during contraction, which leads to muscle fatigue. After too long, a motor neuron unit will run out of ATP and the muscle will relax and not re-contract if stimulated again. With this said, we are observing the effect of caffeine, which ultimately inhibits the release of calcium, on the muscle contraction. In a case study done by R. Rudel, he performed test on isolated frog muscle fibers in order to see reversible changes in twitch and tetanus contractions and how they were generated by varying the duration and strength of an applied stimulus. He found that the general slowing of relaxation, after long, intense stimulus, relates to the effect of electrical stimulation on release or re-uptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Rudel). Our hypothesis is that if the frog muscle is treated with caffeine, it will go into immediate tetany. We will be testing three Rana Pipiens frog legs, which will each be treated with caffeine to see their neuromuscular response. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to interpret the effect of caffeine on frog leg muscle contraction, we will test three frog legs without caffeine and then again with caffeine. First, we will observe each of the frog legs reaction to normal muscle contractions without the caffeine, as the control group. Then, we will inject caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle for the experimental data. We will record the voltage, amplitude and time it took for contraction and to reach tetany, allowing us to acknowledge the effects of added stimulant. Furthermore, the IWorx software will show the latent period, contraction phase and relaxation phase. According to our stimulus, we will focus on the amount of time it takes for the muscle to go into tetany. We will perform a paired t-test to analyze the data.

Results:
By observing our results, we were able to see that without the added stimulant, the control design resulted in normal contraction phases: a latent period, contraction phase, and a relaxation phase. In contrast, in the experimental design the frog legs were injected with caffeine and they failed to have a relaxation period, instead the muscle continued to remain contracted for about 30 more minutes. In addition, the average voltage before injection was 0.256 and changed to 0.7 after the injection of caffeine. In relation to our data, we did further calculations and found that the p-value was 0.211606, statistically insignificant, the t-value was 1.812436, and the degree of freedom was 2. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that by injecting the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana Pipiens frog leg with caffeine, it will go into immediate tetany. With this said however, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change, due to the fact that our p-value of 0.211606 was too high. Our data does not prove a direct correlation between caffeine and tetany. Despite what our data shows, it is proven that caffeine inhibits calcium levels, resulting in immediate tetany. In a case study done by Kolawole Victor Olorunshola and L.N. Achie, they did test to prove how caffeine alters skeletal muscle contractions by opening calcium ion channels. They concluded that caffeine causes a dose dependent increase in both the force of a contraction and the duration of the skeletal muscle contraction by increasing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the process of physical coupling and conformational changes in the voltage sensitive dihydropyridine receptor (Olorunshola). With this said, it has been proven that caffeine affects the release of calcium ions. Due to the relation between caffeine and calcium, one can also include that caffeine can ultimately effect tetany, which is marked by a deficiency of calcium ions, confirming that chemically induced tetany is possible.
