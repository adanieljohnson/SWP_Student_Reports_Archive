Title: Acid rain on Triticum aestivum plants showed no significant difference in root length than plants watered with normal water 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we were testing the effects of acid rain on Triticum aestivum plant energy allocation, specifically at the length of the roots. It was hypothesized that because acid rain depletes nutrients in the soil, the roots of the plant would grow longer than plants watered with regular water because they are compensating for the lack of nutrients in the soil. We had two variable groups, one set of plants watered with a pH 4 solution and another set of plants watered with hose water. The plants were watered everyday with their respective solution for two weeks. After two weeks we measured the length of the roots and found that there was not statistical difference between the root length of the control group and the experimental group. 

Introduction:
Acid rain is harmful to terrestrial life and one of the largest causes is sulfur oxides. Pollution is the leading cause of sulfur dioxide gas in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide is a natural component; it is found naturally in volcano emissions, for example, but large concentrations of sulfur dioxide are released upon the burning of fossils, crude oil has approximately 1-2% of sulfur in weight (Smith, et. al: 2005). Large sulfur dioxide increases occurred as the use of fossil fuels became more widespread but hit an all-time high around the 1970’s (Smith, et. al: 2005). Since the 70’s, the emission of sulfur dioxide has decreased, but the effects have not. When sulfur dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it can decrease the pH of the rain below a pH of 5.6, which is considered normal rainwater pH [Likins: 1979]. This decrease in pH is harmful to life on earth, and in this experiment, we will be looking at the effects acid rain has on plants, specifically Triticum aestivum, or wheat. 
When the soil is contaminated with acid, the levels of aluminum in the soil is increased because the aluminum in the soil is soluble in the acid of pH 5 or lower [Gazey: 2017] [Kochian: 2005]. Aluminum is toxic to plants and can cause significant damage to plant growth. On top of the damaging effects of aluminum of plants acid washed soil leads an increase of soil pH stripping nutrients from the soil [Sumner: 1991].  A shortage of nutrients for the plants to use can lead to stunted growth in plants, significant injury to plants and/or improved root growth [Macaulay: 2015]. In the case of improved root growth, lower nutrients in the soil caused by the acid cause the plants to change a typical behavior in order to survive [Macaulay: 2015]. If there are just enough nutrients for survival, the plants can grow elongated roots, or roots that are able to cover more surface area, in order to take-up the most nutrients it can with these limited resources. The plant growth is not improving with the soil, rather using more of its energy in root growth to make up for the lack of nutrients. This process will take energy away from another aspect of plant growth, but if the root length is significantly longer in lower pH water plants, it will indicate a preference for gaining nutrients through roots. 
In this experiment, we will be testing the difference between plant growth when watered by a solution of pH 4 and plant growth when watered with normal hose water. Based on the information given, we predict that the roots in the experimental group will be longer in the control group because of the decreased levels of nutrients in the soil due to the acid rain. 


Materials and Methods:
To conduct the experiment, we set up 6 pots with vermiculite soil, seeds and 50 mL of Miracle Grow each. We then separated the pots into 2 groups of 3; the control group was watered with regular hose water, and the experimental group was watered with a solution with a pH of 4. The plants were watered until fully saturated. After two weeks, the plants were weighed, and the roots and shoots measured and weighed individually. To weight and measure the plants, we removed the soil and plants together and placed the unit into a large container of water. This was to ensure that the roots remained intact in order to obtain accurate results. After the plants were removed from the soil, they were cleaned, dried and weighed. Then the roots were cut off, and the roots and shoots were measured and weighed individually. Soil and other waste were disposed of properly. 
After all the measurements and data were collected, we conducted at Two-Sample T-test to determine the relationship between our variables. 
H0 = root length of pH 4 plants not longer than root length of controlled plants
Ha = root length of pH 4 plants longer than root length of controlled plants

Discussion:
As stated previously in the introduction, acid rain reduces nutrients in the soil, which negatively impacts plant life. Based on research from previous studies I hypothesized that because the acid would “wash” away most of the nutrients, the plants with the acid treatment would grow longer roots to compensate for the lack of nutrients. In actuality, we saw not significant difference in our plant root length between the two experimental groups. After performing a two-sample T-test on the control root length and the experimental root length, I found a p-value of 0.817, which is extremely high, and means that the experiment did not support our hypothesis.  
During the plant growth process, we noticed mold starting to grow from or on the plants. It seemed that the mold was growing from the seeds because the areas with high seed concentration also had the highest mold concentration. Mold also grew on all of the pots, so it was not a conflicting variable. However, it does raise the question as to whether the mold did affect the plant growth in some way. In nature, mold can be beneficiary to breaking down dead organisms and reintroducing nutrients back into the soil. If this is true of the mold growing on our plants, then some of the nutrients stripped by the acid could have been reintroduced by the mold [Chapin, F.S., et.al: 1987].  
Looking at the rest of the data, aside from the T-test, our results aren’t that surprising because the averages for the control and experimental groups were very similar. The surprising piece of information gleaned from the data, is that the average shoot length for the experimental group had a bigger difference. When a T-test was performed on the shoot lengths of the control and experimental groups, the p-value was significantly lower at 0.0266. This number would have been statistically significant if my hypothesis had been about shoot lengths, because the number is lower than 0.05. The acidity of our solution was pH 4 which is the average pH for acid rainfall. Although pH 4 is on the higher side of the acidic scale, we still expected to see some difference in root lengths because of the lower levels of nutrients in the soil [ Sun, et. al: 2015]. Maybe for wheat plants, growing longer shoots is more beneficial for nutrient intake. This could be something to test in the future for wheat plants because there could be a link between energy allocation and shoots with wheat plants.
