Title: The Effect of Caffeine on the Muscle Contraction of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Excitation-contraction coupling is the process through which a nerve stimulates a muscle to contract. This process involves acetylcholine (Ach) and calcium, without which, contraction would not be able to occur. Muscle contractions can be enhanced or reduced by adjusting any of the components involved. In this experiment, the goal was to enhance the muscle contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens by injecting the muscle with caffeine. It was hypothesized that the caffeine would cause the amplitude of the muscle contractions recorded. Three legs were stimulated at different voltages, once without the caffeine, and once adding the caffeine. The contractions were collected using a myogram. It was proven that due to chemically induced tetany, the caffeine did increase the amplitude of the muscle contractions.


Introduction:
	Skeletal muscle is what supports and moves the body. Muscles are made up of hundreds of thousands of myofibrils. Each myofibril contains sarcomeres, which are the units of contraction for muscles. Muscle contractions are controllled by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. The axons of motor neurons extend into muscles and connect at points known as neuromuscular junctions. Muscle contractions begin with an action potential that depolarizes the neuron which then causes the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine diffuses to the muscle fiber which then opens voltage-gated sodium channels. The activation of the sodium channel creates an action potential in the muscle fiber which stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium is essential for muscle contraction because it allows for the binding of the actin and myosin filaments in the sarcomere. Once bound, the actin and myosin filaments pull towards each other which results in muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. 
The force generated by the action of multiple motor units to produce muscle tension is called summation. There are two types of summation. In spatial summation, the number of axons carrying action potentials increases which causes the number of active motor units to increase as well. The second type of summation is temporal summation. Temporal summation is the repeated stimulation of a given number of motor units. If the axon is stimulated frequently enough, a new twitch starts in the motor unit before the relaxation phase of the last twitch finishes causing a fairly continuous pull of the muscle. Temporal summation leads to tetanus, the maximum force that a muscle can sustain. Tetanus leads to muscle fatigue because if a muscle is sustained for too long, the muscle will run out of ATP [Johnson: 2018]. Without ATP, the muscle no longer has the capability to contract. 
Multiple studies have been performed to test the effects of different chemicals on muscle contraction [Endo: 1970]. Throughout these varying method, it has been found that caffeine is one of the chemicals that triggers the strongest muscle contractions and stimulates the largest release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Itoh: 1981]. This lab will explore the the muscle function in the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens, specifically after the addition of caffeine. This added caffeine will optimize the flow of calcium into the muscle filaments. The increased availability of calcium will cause the amplitude of the muscle contractions to increase. 


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were stripped of their skin to enable direct access to the gastrocnemus muscle. The gastrocnemus of the leg was stimulated at different voltages to find the threshold voltage for contraction. Once the threshold voltage was determined, the response from that stimulus was recorded. Next the response was recorded on the same leg from a stimulus of 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 Volts. A caffeine solution of 0.1 Ml was injected into the gastrocnemus of the same leg. The threshold stimulus was found again to see if the threshold with the caffeine was different, and the responses were again recorded using the same previous stimulation protocol to measure the effect of caffeine on the amplitude of the contractions. Any observations of differences in the gastrocnemus were noted, and a paired T-test was used to find the statistical significance of the results. 


Results:
The amplitude of the contractions for the non-injected muscles were higher than those of the caffeine-stimulated muscles (Figure 1). The mean contraction amplitude for the muscles when stimulated with no caffeine was 0.415 ± 0.112 V (Figure 2). The average amplitude of the response for the caffeine-injected trials was 0.262 ± 0.190 V (Figure 2). However, when seen on the myogram it was identified that the legs began to contract immediately after caffeine injection but before the electrical stimulus was applied. This is called chemically induced tetany. When the tetany value was added it was found that the actual contraction amplitude for the 0.877 ± 0.223 V (p=0.0007, paired t_test). This was further proven by the observation that as soon as the muscle was injected with caffeine, it tensed up and became very firm. The muscle stayed firm throughout the remainder of the lab.  


Discussion:
Caffeine was added to the three Rania pipiens legs to see if it would intensify the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle. Caffeine opens the calcium channels in muscles which then facilitates the contraction of muscle [Itoh: 1981]. Although the amplitude values of the contractions for the controlls were larger than the amplitudes of the trials with the caffeine-injected legs, chemically induced tetany explains that the caffeine causes an immediate contraction of the muscle which must be considered when analyzing the data. The ITXA and SMT-220 does not start recording during the initial contraction caused by the caffeine. Instead, the three smaller contractions following the initial contraction were the data recorded from the electrical stimulus. With the addition of the knowledge of chemically induced tetany, it is clear that the amplitudes of the responses for the caffeine trials were, in fact, higher as mentioned in the results. The results show that because of the increased amplitude of the contraction, the caffeine did facilitate the flow of calcium in the muscle filaments. As soon as the caffeine was injected into the muscle, the muscle began to contract until it approached tetany [Johnson: 2018]. The three smaller contractions recorded on the myogram must be added to the tetany value to produce the true amplitude of the contraction after the injection of caffeine. 
As seen in Figure 1, the standard deviations were fairly large. One of the legs was much larger than the others which likely contributed to the larger standard deviation. The amplitudes of the response was higher for the larger leg than the two other legs. 
As noted in the results, the caffeine caused the muscles to be hard for the remainder of the lab. Due to these results, it can be inferred that the relaxation period of the muscle would also be longer due to the addition of caffeine. To conclude, while the raw data says the caffeine did not enhance the muscle contraction, chemically induced tetany and observations of the myogram showed that caffeine greatly increased the amplitude of the muscle contractions. The response recorded was due to the electrical stimulus that caused the muscle to contract further on top of the tetany. When adding in tetany and the recorded contraction, the response to the stimulus was much higher after the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.
