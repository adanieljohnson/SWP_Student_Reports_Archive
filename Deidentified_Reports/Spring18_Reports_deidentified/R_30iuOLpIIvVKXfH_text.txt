Title: Change in clarity of water showed no significant difference in the agonistic behavior amongst betta splendens. 

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab is to see how reduced water clarity affects the expression of aggressive behavior in Betta splendens. We did this experiment by quantifying the number of times the betta splendens observed  I hypothesize that there will be a difference in the agonistic behavior that is observed when we change the betta splendens environment from clear water to murky water. There was no significant difference between the total behaviors before and after the treatment (t-stat= 2.32, df= 2, p= 0.07). Therefore, my hypothesis was not supported. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to see how reduced water clarity affects the expression of aggressive behavior in Betta splendens. Betta splendens, typically called betta fish elicit aggressive behavior and are bred for fighting and being beautifully colored fish. This also means that they are domesticated fish. Because betta splendens are domesticated fish they are typically in clear water fish tanks. Within our experiment we want to see how betta splendens react in their wild-life habitat of murky water. Betta splendens originate in Thailand where they are typically in many varieties of environments such as rice paddies, ditches and other muddy and sluggish water [Bio 113 Lab Manual]. Because of this we thought it would be interesting to view how domesticated betta splendens would act in their original habitats. 
An experiment that was published in 2004 that studied the effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behavior can be used to supplement further thinking in the fact that we are placing the betta splendens in an environment that they are not use to just like pollutants are not common to fish life. One of the most frequently measured indicators of altered social relations in fish exposed to toxicants is the idea of the altered frequency of agonistic acts. They found that the frequency of threats, nips, or chases increased with a combined increase in concentration of toxicants. Another thing that is worth noting is the fact that exposure to the certain environment increased the overall frequency and occurrence of the total agonistic behavior amongst groups of fish [Scott & Soloman: 2004]. With this in mind I hypothesize that there will be a difference in the agonistic behavior that is observed when we change the betta splendens environment from clear water to murky water. 


Materials and Methods:
We obtained three betta splendens and paired them up with each other to make three replicates for our data. We labeled the fishes 1, 2, and 3. The first pair was fish 1 and 3. The second pair was 1 and 2. And the last pair, 3, was 1 and 3. Then we observed each pair for five minutes with only the clear divider up among the pairs. We observed the pairs by quantifying their agonistic behaviors. We viewed each fish separately counting how many times one of them elicited tail flashing and red mane behaviors and then added those numbers together to get the total of those agonistic behaviors from one of the pairs. After we observed the first pair we let the fishes rest for five minutes. For the next two pairs, we observed for five minutes and then let them rest for five minutes. Lastly, we recorded this information in a table and computed significant values through a paired t-test.

Results:
The average was -6.33 behaviors displayed. There was no significant difference between the total behaviors before and after the treatment (t-stat= 2.32, df= 2, p= 0.07). In figure 1 the total behaviors before the exam were larger than after the exam. There was more variability in the after treatment data. 

Discussion:
In conclusion there was no significant difference from the behaviors displayed before the exam and after the exam. Therefore, we accept the null hypothesis that there's no difference between the means and conclude that a significant difference does not exist. There was a difference in quantitative results as you can see in figure 1. There was a decrease in number of times aggressive behavior was displayed after the treatment, but that cannot conclude our overall results. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported. Changing the environment, from clear water to murky water, of Betta splendens within this experiment did not have a difference in the number of times aggressive behavior was displayed. This could have been an error on the experimental design side whereas if we had let the Betta splendens in the murky water for more than 5 minutes we could have viewed a difference in the behaviors displayed. Another thing to note about the reasoning for the hypothesis is the fact that the research I used to come to my hypothesis was not similar to what we did to our Betta splendens. The fish within the researched experiment were exposed to the different environment of toxicity could have had other psychological affects that affected the fish within that experiment to another extent, to where in my experiment we simply changed the clarity of the water[Scott & Soloman: 2004].
Changing the clarity of the water could have changed the view of the fish but not necessarily it's complete brain functions.  Within Scott and Solomon's experiment they introduced toxins such as copper within the fish's environment and that could have resulted in neurological altering affects. For future experiments we could potentially leave the betta splendens in the murky water for a prolonged period of time, more than 5 minutes and view them as they have adapted with their new environment. This experiment can be useful to those who study how certain environments and pollutants affect fish, while this just tested the clarity of the water, pollution and the stress resulting in pollutants is something that needs to be taken into consideration when dealing with fish in a domesticated view point or a farming view point.  In an experiment that tested sediment pollution and its effects on fish through the food chain in the Yangtze River found that there was around 10,000 times higher concentration of heavy metals in the sediment in the Yangtze River than there was in the water [Yujun, Zhang, Guoan & Xuehua: 2008]. This effected the fish and invertebrates by having high concentrations of those heavy metals in their tissue. They also mentioned that the microhabitat environment and feeding habits of the fish had changed significantly because of the heavy metals in their systems [Yujun, Zhang, Guoan & Xuehua: 2008]. While the experiment that I conducted with my lap partners was a change in environment so is sediment pollution and these changes need to be observed for the safety of our wildlife and even for our own food. We do not consume betta splendens, the people surrounding the areas of the Yangtze and other people who consume fish should be aware of the conditions their fish are under in order to avoid consuming contaminated fish.
