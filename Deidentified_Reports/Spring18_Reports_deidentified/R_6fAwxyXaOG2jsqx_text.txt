Title: Insect Endocrinology in the Manduca sexta: How Synthetic Growth Hormone Affects Caterpillar Size

Abstract:
Upon studying the importance of hormones and how they regulate an organisms growth and development, it is important to ponder the effects of manipulating a hormone’s concentration during an organism’s developmental stage. The Manduca sexta, or Tobacco Hornworm, goes through 4 different life stages, yet Juvenile Hormone (JH) has been discovered to only be a crucial part of the insect’s instar stages. The objective of this lab is to conduct an experiment where an insect growth regulator (IGR) that mimics JH is fed to a group of M. sexta caterpillars and observe the difference in development after excess IGR enters the caterpillars’ system. It is important to note that the length of each insect is used to gauge the caterpillars’ growth, and the hypothesis predicts that 4th instar M. sexta caterpillars which are exposed to Martin’s IGR will increase in length more than that of the controll caterpillars after seven days. A two-sample t_test suggests that this hypothesis be rejected, and ideas of further study encourage an experiment that lasts over a longer period of time so that the M. sexta is able to enter its pupal phase.

Introduction:
The Tobacco Hornworm, or Manduca sexta caterpillar, is an example of a holometabolous insect, as it goes through 4 stages of development (egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, adult), each of which is separated by a molt (Johnson: 2018). The M. sexta is a helpful organism when it comes to understanding hormone regulation due to its distinct developmental stages. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is an organic molecule that helps regulate the type of molt the M. sexta undergoes (Rowland: 2017).  High JH levels before a molt will cause the larva to molt into another larva. Conversely, if JH levels are low, the larval insect molts into a pupa (Rowland: 2017). It has been concluded that if an insect is exposed to artificially high JH levels during its final larval stage, the insect will not molt to a pupa. Instead, it will molt into another larger larva (Rowland: 2017).  In this experiment, two groups of M. sexta caterpillars will be observed and measured for one week during their 4th instar larval stage. The experimental group will be fed the insect growth regulator “Martin’s IGR,” while the other group will receive regular caterpillar food with no supplements. The size of the two groups will be compared after the seven-day period. Observing the effects of the IGR on the M. sexta will aid in the understanding of insect metamorphosis and the overall appreciation of how hormones can affect an organism’s life cycle. Given this information, a reasonable hypothesis is that if 4th instar M. sexta caterpillars are exposed to Martin’s IGR, then their length will increase more than that of the controll caterpillars after seven days.

Materials and Method:
Begin with 4 different plastic containers, each divided in 2 with index cards. Place the 8 caterpillars in these plastic containers, with two caterpillars per container (one per living space) and number 1-8 on the containers. #1 through #4 will be the controll group, #5 through #8 will be the experimental group. Measure 10 grams of food for each caterpillar. Add 10 drops of DI water to each food portion for the controll group caterpillars and 10 drops of Martin’s IGR to each food portion for the experimental group caterpillars. Mix the food and liquid thoroughly so it does not dry up. Place the clumps of food in the containers. Keep the caterpillars in an incubator set to 23 degrees Celsius. Each day for 7 consecutive days, feed each caterpillar 10 g of food and 10 drops on DI water (controll) or Martin’s IGR (experimental) and record the length of the caterpillar in cm.  A two-sample t_test will be used to compare the average length of the two groups after 1 week, which will be used to conclude whether the final caterpillar length in the two groups are statistically different.

Results:
In general, almost all the caterpillars, 1-8, grew in size, with the exception of #4, which actually decreased in length and appeared to be in very poor health by the end of the 7-day period (not moving much, not as plump). After 7 days, the average length in the controll group was 6.7 cm ±2.368 cm, and the average length for the experimental group was 7.3 cm ± 1.711 cm, as seen in Figure 6. While all of the caterpillars (with the exception of #4) seemed healthy and grew in size, the members of the experimental group appeared the fattest overall. This is shown in the line graph in Figure 5 The largest caterpillar in the group, with a recorded final length of 8.6 cm, was a member of the experimental group, which received the IGR that mimicked JH. As seen in Figure 3, the t-value was approximately .41, which suggests that the recorded difference in length between the two groups are not statistically different from each other. The degrees of freedom were 6, and the p_value was .685, which means there is a 68.5% possibility our results could have happened by chance. In other words, we must reject our hypothesis because the data is not statistically significent.

Discussion:
In the end, my group’s hypothesis will be rejected due to a large t-value, which means that the difference in the averages in length between the controll and experimental groups could possibly have occurred by chance. One biological reason for this could have been due to predetermined patterns in the caterpillars’ growth and development, meaning that their genes could have played a large role in determining their size. This may also be due to the sample size of the experiment; 4 members per group is not a large experiment to have a standard deviation of 2.37. Likely sources of error include the fact that the M. sexta caterpillar is able to stretch and shrink. Upon measuring the caterpillars each day, there may have been variance in how “stretched out” each caterpillar actually was. Because of this, a more effective study to conduct in the future may be to measure the caterpillars’ mass instead of length to get a more accurate measurement. Another suggestion for a future study may be to conduct this experiment over a longer period of time, so that we could compare pupal phase of the controll group with that of the experimental group. The pupal phase is supposed to begin approximately 20-25 days into the M. sexta life cycle (Rowland: 2017). Elongating the experiment could further our understanding of how JH could affect the M. sexta long-term. Overall, an organism’s hormones, whether they are insects or vertebrates, are paramount in the regulation of growth, how/when development occurs, and signaling within the body (Johnson: 2018). Understanding the effect of different hormones in insects allow biologists to understand how hormones work and ultimately how different organisms regulate their physiology.
