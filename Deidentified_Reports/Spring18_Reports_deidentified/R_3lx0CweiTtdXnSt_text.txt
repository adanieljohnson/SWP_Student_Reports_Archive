Title: Resource Allocation During Buckwheat Plant Growth in Vermiculite vs. Sand

Abstract:
Vermiculite and Sand are two substances that buckwheat can grow in. However due to the difference in nutrients they affect the way buckwheat allocates its resources. This can be proven by their weight- root shoots ratio sand lenght root-shoot ratios.Three pots of buckwheat in vermiculite and three pots of buckwheat in sand were planted and placed in the same environmental conditions and observed for three weeks. Previous research supported our hypothesis and this experiment was designed to test our prediction that the sand buckwheat would have a higher weight and length root-shoot ratio than vermiculite grown buckwheat. This is because the sand grown buckwheat would allocate more of its resources in its roots since there are less nutrients in the sand that the vermiculite. Our results did show a higher weight and length root-shoot ratio in the sand grown buckwheat. Unfortunately they were not statistically significent. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing the t_test.


Introduction:
In this lab we tested how buckwheat will allocate its resources when placed in either vermiculite or sand. Buckwheat is classified as part of  “the family of Polygonaceae”, it is very similar to cereals and is mostly grown in china. The harvest of buckwheat has been trending down over the last 100 years, mainly because of self-incompatibility, which can make breeding difficult because the plants breed better with plants other than itself(Wijngaard: 2006). Vermiculite is a “hydrated magnesium-iron-aluminum silicate” which allows it to increase water and nutrient retention (Moeller: 2010). This will lead to healthier and stronger plants. In general, when the access to nutrients increases plants will usually allocate their resources in places other than their roots since their roots have access to rich nutrients. This is congruent with the “resource optimization hypothesis” which states that the more available a nutrient is the less work is needed to get that nutrient (Göran: 2003.) Therefore, I predicted that the plants in the sand will have longer roots because this where they will allocate their resources since they are in a nutrient deficient environment, making the plants in the sand have a higher root-shoot ratio. 


Materials and Method:
First we planted 6 sets of 20 buckwheat seeds, 3 of which were planted in vermiculite and another three in sand. We then monitored them everyday, watering when necessary, for three weeks. It is important that both groups be consistent in every other aspects, such as sun exposure and amount of water so that substance buckwheat was grown in is the only variable that is different. After three weeks we separated the plant into two groups: vermiculite 1,2,3 and sand 1,2,3. From each pot we harvested three plants, cleaned them thoroughly and weighed them. Then we separate the roots from the shoots by cutting at the root-shoot junction and weighted the shoots. With this information we did some calculations to weight of the whole plant= weight of roots + weight of shoots. Afterwards we measured the maximum shoot and root length from each pot. Lastly we calculated the root-shoot ratio for the weight and length by dividing the root weight/length by the shoot weight/length. Afterwards we disposed of everything ina waste container. To see if our results were significent or not, we used a t_test, twice, to compare the root-shoot weight ratio of vermiculite grown buckwheat vs. sand grown buckwheat. The t test was repeated but this time with the root-shoot length ratio. The p_value we compared our results was .05, meaning any p_value of under .05 meant that the results were significent.


Results:
Concerning the comparison of the root-shoot weight ratio between vermiculite and sand grown buckwheat there is a higher weight root-shoot average in the buckwheat grown in sand of .02g  (Fig. 3) After a t_test was done to determine of the results were significent we determined that the increase wasn’t significent (t_stat = 0.57, d.f. = 4, P = 0.597)
(Fig. 1.) For the length root-shoot ratio between the vermiculite and the sand the data the buckwheat in the sand once again showed a high root-shoot average of .15g  (Fig. 4).  A second t_test was done to determine if the results of the length root-shoot ratio were significent. The statistical analysis failed to prove the results significent (t_stat = 2.24, d.f. = 4, P = 0.087.) Our dependent variable resulted in a P-value greater than the common 95% confidence interval (P = 0.05 or less), which means that we are unable to there was no statistically significent difference between buckwheat grown in vermiculite or sand.



Discussion:
Our results indicated that my hypothesis was overall supported by our data in both the weight and length root-shoot ratios (Figure 1 and 2.) However, our results after statistical testing using T-tests with the basis of a p value lower that .05 being significent, our results were not significent. Even though our results were proved to not be significent, our prediction was correct in relation to the resource optimization hypothesis. In the research article Annals of Botany it explains how a plant with less nutrients in the soil will make up for that by allocating their resources in their roots creating a higher root-shoot ratio in the plant that is nutrient deprived. Our trend in our results showed proved the resource optimization, even though it wasn’t as big of a difference as we would have liked the data in Figure 3 and 4 show this. I think if we were to do this study again if would be beneficial if we tested more than just three pots on one group and three in another. Maybe plant 10 pots with vermiculite and 10 with sand and then compare those. Also letting the plants grow for a longer period of time, 5 weeks instead on three weeks would allow us to see a better view of how the plants differentiate long term and looking specifically at their root-shoot ratios. Thus while previous research has concluded that plants less nutrients in the soil will make up for that by allocating their resources in their roots, our experiment concluded that there is no significent difference between root-shoot ratio and access to nutrients.
