Title: Methoprene and its effects on hormone regulation & development in Manduca sexta caterpillar larv

Abstract:
The primary objective of this experiment was to analyze the effects of a Juvenile Hormone analogue (Methoprene, in this case) on Manduca sexta caterpillar larva. Specifically, we hoped to find out if the addition of Methoprene to the food of caterpillar larva would increase their size significently while also keeping them from molting and entering the next stage of development. 
Manduca sexta caterpillars are known for having a predictable pattern of growth that is regulated by hormones. We altered this pattern of growth by feeding half of our subject organisms a diet containing a hormone replicator in hopes of engineering larger larval specimens. What we found at the end of our experiment was that the hormone we added as a replacement for Juvenile Hormone did not significently affect the weight of our treatment group. 
We conclude that this result stemmed mainly from an error in our feeding pattern that likely resulted in skewed results that are not representative of previous experiments on this same subject. 


Introduction:
The Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta) caterpillar is an insect found across much of the southeast. This organism is an invasive species that feeds on the leaves of many crops and is known for a predictable pattern of growth as a larva that is regulated primarily by Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH) [Nijhout: 1974]. Ecdysterone is the hormone in insects that is responsible for the timing of molting that occurs during development. Juvenile Hormone is integral in regulating the type of molt in insects by exerting restraint on the cell processes responsible for molting [Williams: 1956].  
In this experiment, we wished to find out if Methoprene (a JH analog) would prevent molting in our caterpillars and lead to more comparative weight gain in subjects fed the prepared diet that included this chemical. Methoprene, which mimics JH, is often used as an insecticide because it prevents a caterpillar larva from progressing to its next stage of development in which it forms a cocoon and becomes a fully mature adult. We performed this experiment in order to find ways of preventing a caterpillar from developing into an adult organism and also to see if Methoprene would significently increase weight gain in larva and thus make it possible for larger adult organisms to develop. 
In order to answer this question, we must have two groups of organisms to test. One group will be used as a controll (against which we will measure the effects of a Methoprene diet) while the other group will be fed a diet in which the chemical has been added. The independent variable is the food fed to each group of caterpillars. The dependent variable is the change in weight of the caterpillars. We believe that feeding Manduca sexta caterpillars a diet containing Methoprene will alter growth hormones and thus increase their larval size. 


Materials and Method:
1.	8 Manduca sexta caterpillar larva selected 
2.	Separated into two groups of 4 (1 controll group and 1 test group) and each placed in a compartmentalized container
3.	Each organism was fed a predesignated amount of food
4.	All subjects were kept in an incubator set at 23 degrees Celsius 
5.	Weights of each specimen recorded daily for 8 days

Our experiment was conducted by separating 8 caterpillars into two groups, one that was fed standard caterpillar food and another that was fed standard caterpillar food with Methoprene mixed in. After preparing our food and separating our specimens, we measured their weight each day for 8 consecutive days. The test groups food was mixed with a 10% Methoprene solution. We used a two-sample t_test to compare our controll and test groups. 


Results:
Overall, we found that the caterpillars that were fed a diet that included Methoprene grew less in weight than those fed the controll diet. The average change in weight for caterpillars in the controll group was 1.8475 grams while the average change in weight for caterpillars in the test group was 1.2475 (see Figure 1)

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because caterpillars fed a diet that included Methoprene grew less than subjects fed a controll diet. By creating larger larva, we hoped to, in theory, create larger adult organisms that would thus have a better chance at survival because they would be more resilient and less of a target for predators. According to a study done by Frederik Nijhout and Carroll M. Williams [Nijhout: 1974], our hypothesis was in line with what is known about the growth and development cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. In their study it was determined that specified levels of JH in the 5th instar stage of development prevented the regular progression of development into adult insects, so adding a chemical to our prepared diet that mimicked this hormone should in fact produce larger larva. 
One error that occurred is that we did not clearly understand the feeding process involved in the experiment. We were supposed to replenish the caterpillar's food if it ran low but did not do this as we thought the food measured out on the first day of the experiment was all that each subject was supposed to consume. With this in mind, the results of our experiment varied to a degree large enough to note. If each caterpillar was fed in the method outlined above, I believe that we would have seen a larger increase in the growth of our treatment subjects. Also, the addition of Methoprene to the diet of our test organisms may have prohibited weight gain because of the role that JH (or any analogue thereof) seeks to perform as a growth regulator [Johnson: 2018].   
In addition to finding out that we can prolong the larval stage of Manduca sexta and thus prevent them from becoming adults that may destroy crops, we also know that since we can make larva larger, we can thus produce adult insects of a larger size by eventually stopping the secretion of JH and allowing a commitment pulse to happen and cause pupation [Johnson: 2018].
Moving forward from here, I would repeat this test and be certain to feed the caterpillars in a more consistent manner so that I can measure the effects that Methoprene has on weight gain in Manduca sexta larva without having to take into account any variances in feeding. By manipulating the amount of certain hormones in an insect, it is possible to affect growth and development cycles in a way that either maximizes the potential of insects that can benefit the environment (such as the honey bee) or stifle nonnative pests that degrade produce and destroy crops.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1- Effect of Methoprene on weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The controll group showed a higher percentage change in average weight while the treatment group showed less of a change. 4 caterpillar larva were placed in each group and were separated into partitioned containers and fed either the controll or treatment diet. Weights were measured daily on a scientific scale. Error bars are plus/minus 2 s.d.
