Title: Added phosphorous to the species Pisum sativun did not impact the root-to-shoot ratio nor the growth of the plant

Abstract:
In this lab, we tested whether added phosphorous to Field Pea plants would stimulate the growth and make the root to shoot ratio less than the plants that did not have added phosphorous to them.  We used field peas because they are easy to measure and grow.  Phosphorous is essential for the health and growth of all plants.  Some growth factors that are associated with phosphorous are stimulated root development, increased stalk and stem strength, and increased nitrogen fixation properties.  To test our hypothesis, we grew plants with added phosphorous and plants without extra added phosphorous.  After two weeks, we measured the plants roots, shoots, and weights.  We found that the plants were very similar in their root and shoot length and weight.  This was also supported by the T-test that we used.  Ultimately, our hypothesis was wrong, but this could be due to error in our measurements or other natural environmental factors including: the addition of too much phosphorous, too high or too low of a PH, or insufficient sunlight.


Introduction:
During this lab, we wanted to see if added phosphorous to a plant (seeds) would stimulate growth or change the root to shoot ratio of the plant.  In this lab, we chose to use field pea plants.  We chose to use field pea plants (Pisum Sativim) because they are easy to observe and grow.  The pea is a cool-seasonal legume plant that has a vine that is smooth with a green waxy appearance.  The stem of pea plants alters from white, to green, to purple.  In addition, the stem is hollow.  Coming off of the stem on a pea plant is leaves.  They are alternate and oval shaped.  Pea plants carry many nutritional values, such as high content in carbohydrates, protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin A and B [Watt and Merrill: 1963].  Many nutrients, including phosphorous, are essential for the growth of pea plants.
	Phosphorous one of many nutrients that is essential for optimum plant growth and reproduction.  It is found in every living plant cell and cannot be replaced by any other nutrient.  Phosphorous enters a plant through the root hairs and root tips.  Once phosphorous is inside the plant root, it is either stored in the root or transported to the upper portions of the plant.  Then it is incorporated into organic compounds (including: nucleic acids, phosphoproteins, phospholipids, sugar, enzymes…).  Once it is in these forms, the plant is able to use it for energy transfer.  Phosphorous is involved in many functions that take place in plants, including energy transfer and photosynthesis [Richardson:2001].
Like all plants, field pea plants go through a process known as photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is one of the most important chemical reactions that takes place in nature.  Photosynthesis is a process that plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to synthesize glucose and oxygen.  Photosynthesis is very much influenced by different environmental conditions including nutrient availability and phosphorous [Richardson: 2001].
The hypothesis of this study was that plants with extra added phosphorous would be larger and have a smaller root-shoot ratio than plants without added phosphorous.


Materials and Method:
The very first thing that we did when we conducted this experiment was we placed soil in 6 containers.  After we added the soil, we added about 10 Ml of miracle grow to each of the containers.  Then, we mixed the soil and the miracle grow together.  Following that, we added about 10 Ml of phosphorous to three of the containers and mixed the mixture well.  Then, we set each of the containers in water so that the containers could soak up the water allowing the soil to dampen.  Following that, we placed 20 Field peas in each container and covered them in the soil mixture.  Following that we placed the containers in the greenhouse.  For 2 weeks, we left the plants in the greenhouse, watering them once each day.  After the two weeks, we harvested the plants.  First, we carefully pulled the plants out of the containers that had phosphorous added to them.  This was done by placing the plants in a tub of water.  Then, we dried off each bunch (about 5 plants) and weighed and measured them.  We did the same process for the plants that did not have phosphorous added to them.


Results:
According to table 1 for plants with added phosphorous, the mean value for the max root length was 129mm, mean max shoot length 127.33, and the mean Root: shoot length ratio is 1.01.  Looking at table 2, the mean value for the max root length was 130mm, mean max shoot length 126.33mm, and the mean Root: shoot length ratio is 1.03mm.  According to table 1, the standard deviation values for max root length was 28.29, SD for max shoot length 9.69, and SD for R:S length ratio .17.  According to table 2, the standard deviation values for max root length was 35.59, SD for max shoot length 6.34, and SD for R:S length ratio .27.  Using the T-test with both of the Root: shoot length ratio values for the plants with and without added phosphorous, the degrees of freedom was 4, the t-value was 0.102, and the P-value was 0.923.  Using the T-test with both of the R:S weight ratio values for the plants with and without added phosphorous, the p value was .64.  


Discussion:
Our hypothesis of this experiment was that plants with extra added phosphorous would be larger and have a smaller root-shoot ratio than plants without added phosphorous. Using the data shown in tables 1 and 2, we concluded that our hypothesis was somewhat incorrect.  The values for the root: shoot length and weight ratios of the plants with and without added phosphorous were mostly the same and there was very little difference.  Using the T-test, we concluded that there was not really a significent difference between the two plants.  Therefore, we cannot use our data conclude that the plants with added phosphorous are larger with a smaller root-shoot ratio.  Phosphorous is an essential nutrient and serves as a catalyst in the growth and functioning of plants.
There was likely error in our measurements or there were environmental factors involved that made the plants with and without added phosphorous to basically be the same.  One reason for this could have been time.  Had we let the plants grow longer than two weeks (maybe 1 month), the plants with added phosphorous could have been larger with a lower root: shoot ratio than those without added phosphorous, considering that a plant can only use so much phosphorous at one time.
	Another reason as to why the added phosphorous may have not had much of an impact on the plants was the sunlight available.  During the two weeks that we let our plants grow, it rained a lot and was often very cloudy.  Phosphorous is important in its role in capturing and converting the sun’s energy into useful plant compounds [Leopald: 1964].  If there was less sunlight, then the amount of phosphorus energy used was most likely less.  
	Another reason as to why the plants growths were not very different could be that we added too much phosphorous in addition to the miracle grow that we had in the soil with the plants.  Too much excess phosphorous can be bad.   Phosphorus carries a chemical charge that competes with other micronutrients for plant uptake.  Too much phosphorous also inhibits the growth the of mycorrhizae in the soil [Elgar 2011].  
	Lastly, the PH of the soil could have impacted the growth of the plants with added phosphorous.  Precipitation of phosphorous as slightly soluble calcium phosphates occurs in calcareous soils with pH values around 8.0.  Maybe the PH of soil was significently higher or lower than 8.  Soil PH is one of the factors that accounts for the usability of phosphorous [Austin 1966].
	Overall, the addition of phosphorous to the plants should have stimulated growth and produced a smaller root: shoot ratio.  It should have had a smaller root: shoot ratio because plants that have significently larger and longer roots than the shoots, it means that they do not have as many nutrients and are lacking in nutrient availability.  This reflects the relative abundance of above-ground and below-ground resources, including phosphorous.
