Title: Neuromuscular Junction

Abstract:
Rana Pipiens was an ideal model species for this experiment because they have same neuromuscular junctions as most complex animals and is thus relevant for understanding the systems of the human body. In neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine activates skeletal muscles which require voluntary movement in the body by generating an action potential and sends signals to other cells in the body from nerve cells in a synapse called the neuromuscular junction which is ideally suited for studies of synaptic plasticity because there is only one neurotransmitter and one neurotransmitter receptor type there (Wang: 2018). We wondered how the introduction of 10 mg/ml acetylcholine onto the exposed muscle tissue of Rana Pipiens would affect the amplitude of the muscle at 1 Hz at .1/1/2/3/4/5 amps when stimulated directly through the nerve using a silver wire. We cut the gastrocnemius muscle and injected it with added acetylcholine. Since the leg muscle of Rana Pipiens was not injected correctly, the leg of Rana Pipiens was interrupted disrupted to the point where it demonstrated a reduced function, therefore our hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
Rana Pipens is the scientific name for the northern leopard frog. Rana Pipiens live in the marshes and grasslands in parts of Canada and United States. Rana Pipiens is known for its irregular brownish spots that form a pattern like a leopard, hence its name. Rana Pipiens was an ideal model species for this experiment because they have same neuromuscular junctions as most complex animals and is thus relevant for understanding the systems of the human body. Acetylcholine is a natural chemical that works as a neurotransmitter in the human body. It sends signals to other cells in the body from nerve cells in a synapse called the neuromuscular junction which is ideally suited for studies of synaptic plasticity because there is only one neurotransmitter and one neurotransmitter receptor type there (Wang: 2018). In neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine activates skeletal muscles which require voluntary movement in the body by generating an action potential. We wondered how the introduction of 10 mg/ml acetylcholine onto the exposed muscle tissue of Rana Pipiens would affect the amplitude of the muscle at 1 Hz at .1/1/2/3/4/5 amps when stimulated directly through the nerve using silver wire.

Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we used two legs of Rana Pipens, a ringer, 10 mg/ml acetylcholine, a spray bottle, stimulation probes. In a process called degloving, the skin of the frog leg was peeled off. Next, the thigh was opened by pulling it apart to get to the sciatic nerve. Then, the tip of a pair of scissors was used to clear the connective tissue between the gastrocnemius muscle and the tibiofibula bone of the frog. Using those scissors, the gastrocnemius muscle was then cut off at the Achilles tendon along with a large part of the Achilles tendon. A knot was tied between the lower part of the gastrocnemius muscle and the Achilles tendon. At the end of the string was a loop used to hang it on a stand and lift the gastrocnemius muscle. The rest of the excess string and the Achilles tendon were cut off. Pins were placed on the frog leg to keep it in place and the stand was adjusted to suspend the gastrocnemius muscle at 90 degrees on the tray. The black stimulation probe was inserted in the lower part of the gastrocnemius muscle and the red stimulation probe was inserted in the middle part of the muscle. The sciatic nerve was laid down on the sleeve probe which was closed by a rubber sleeve. A spray bottle was used to evenly spread the acetylcholine over the leg. We tested the control group first without additional acetylcholine and then did the same thing but with added acetylcholine. We test the experiment using a computer to capture the amplitude of muscle contraction.

Results:
We can conclude is that there is a loose correlation between increased neuromuscular junction activity with the additional 10 mg/ul acetylcholine treatment. The groups were significantly different but did not tell us a clear indication that added acetylcholine affected the muscle. In figure 2, the data show that the 10 mg/ul injection of acetylcholine resulted a statistically significant decrease in the activity of the neuromuscular junction while the data in figure 1 maintain a similar relationship between the amplitude of muscle contraction and the current of the amplitudes.

Discussion:
There were several procedural errors that may have influenced the results of this experiment. Because it wasn’t properly injected, it’s possible that the muscular tissue in the leg of Rana Pipiens was sufficiently disrupted to the point where it demonstrated a reduced function, which would be evidenced by figure 2. It is possible that the right and left legs of Rana Pipiens were not interchangeable. The neurotransmitter junction could be an important thing to understand for patients suffering from psychohallucinogenic disorders such as Alzheimer’s or schizophrenia (in that we could monitor the acetylcholine system in NMJ) Acetylcholine and other neurotransmitter are more likely to provide deeper insights to consciousness in the brain (Perry: 1999).
