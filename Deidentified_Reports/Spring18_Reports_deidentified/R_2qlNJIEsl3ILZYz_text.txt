Title: Effect of ACH-Esterase Inhibitor on Frog Legs

Abstract:
In this procedure, 6 frog legs were used to determine the effect of Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitor (ACH inhibitor), on the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. ACH is a critical neurotransmitter for muscle contraction, and ACH esterase is needed to recycle the ACH to be used for further muscle contraction. Each frog leg was dissected, and the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated from the rest of the leg. A string was then tied to the Achilles tendon, with is connected to the gastrocnemus muscle. The opposing end of the string was tied to a transducer, which recorded the contraction of the muscle through the use of a myogram. Two electrodes were used to stimulate the siatic nerve, with caused the sarcomere in the frog leg contract. The amplitude and threshold was measured. Then, 0.1Ml ACE esterase inhibitor was injected into the leg, and three minutes were given to allow the agent to distribute through the muscle. The siatic nerve was stimulated again, and the amplitude and threshold were measured. The results showed mixed data, as the threshold decreased while the amplitude decreased for two legs. On the other hand, the third frog leg showed an increased threshold with a higher amplitude. With this being said, it cannot be said with certainty that the hypothesis is supported.

Introduction:
In the terminal button of a neuron at the neuromuscular junction, an action potential opens voltage-gated calcium channels, which allow calcium to enter the terminal button and hyperpolarize it. As a result, vesicles containing ACH bind to the membrane of the terminal button, releasing ACH into the synaptic cleft. The ACH then binds to ligand-gated sodium channels on the muscle membrane, causing them to open and allow sodium to enter through the membrane. (Legay C: 2018) This causes an action potential to travel down the muscle membrane into T-tubules, which contain DHP receptors. As a result, the DHP receptors open and allow calcium to enter the sarcoplasm. (Methfessel C: 1986) After calcium is released into the sarcoplasm, in short, the sarcomere shortens which constitutes a muscle contraction. After the muscle is finished contracting, ACH is released from the ligand-gated sodium channels back into the synaptic cleft. (Legay C: 2018) The ACH is removed from the synaptic cleft by ACH-Esterase, which removes ACH-Esterase from the synaptic cleft and recycles it into acetate and choline. The acetate and choline is then reabsorbed back into the terminal button to be used again as ACH. (Methfessel C : 1986)
Frog legs were used in this procedure, as they contain skeletal muscle that functions in the manner described above. An ACH-Esterase inhibitor inhibits the function of ACH-Esterase. (Legay C: 2018) By using and ACH-Esterase inhibitor, ACH will not be released from the synaptic cleft. As a result, ACH will continue to bind to ACH receptor cites on the ligand-gated sodium channels and calcium will remain in the synaptic cleft. This will eventually result in a lower threshold for an action potential in the motor end plate of the frog leg. Also, the amplitude for the frog leg will increase as a result of this lower threshold. 


Materials and Method:
A total of five frog legs were used for this procedure, three from one lab group and two from another lab group. Both groups collaborated and shared data, which will be incorporated into this report. The amplitude and threshold were measured for three frog legs in one group, while only the threshold was measured for two legs in another lab group preforming a similar procedure. 
Each leg was skinned, and the cyatic nerve was dissected from the leg until it became visible. Scissors are placed between the gastrocnemus muscle and the thigh in order to separate them. After cutting the Achilles tendon, a string is tied to the end of the Achilles, which was connected to the gastrocnemus muscle. The other side of the string was attached to a transducer, which is suspended above the frog leg by an apparatus. The string was kept at a high tension while still keeping the frog leg on the ground. Two electrodes were then placed along the sciatic nerve. It was imperative that the two electrodes did not touch each other. The muscle was pinned down, and the gastrocnemus muscle is suspended by a string attached to the transducer. The probes were taped to the tray containing the frog leg in order to prevent the probes from touching each other or from sliding off the siatic nerve. The probes were attached to a myogram, which measured the contraction of the frog leg. Each leg was attached to the probes for testing in order. For six legs, the threshold for each contraction was measured. Only three legs were used to measure the amplitude of each contraction. Then, 0.1mg of ACE esterase inhibitor was injected into each leg, and three minutes elapsed before any further stimulation was performed. Also, a small amount of ACE inhibitor was injected directly into the siatic nerve. Upon waiting, the threshold and amplitude were again measured via the electrodes stimulating the siatic verve. A two-sample t_test was used to compare the legs that were not treated to the legs that were treated with ACH esterase inhibitor.  


Results:
After the ACE esterase inhibitor was injected into the frog legs, the thresholds of two frog legs decreased while the amplitude of concentration was higher than previously recorded. For the first leg, the threshold decreased by .08 Volts. The threshold for the second frog leg decreased by .10 volts. For the third frog leg, the threshold increased by .01 Volts. When observing the amplitudes of all three legs, similar patterns are observed. The average amplitude for the first leg decreased by an average of 0.1546 volts, the second leg decreased by .0854 volts, while the third leg decreased by .1202 volts. In addition to the values for these three legs, the threshold was recorded for two additional legs by another group preforming a similar procedure. The first leg in the other group decreased by .05 volts after injection of the ACH esterase inhibitor, while the second leg decreased in threshold by .05 volts after injection. After a two-sample t test was preformed, a p_value of 0.8 was calculated for the frog legs before being treated, while a p_value of 0.6 was calculated for the frog legs that were treated with ACH esterase inhibitor. 


Discussion:
The Presence of ACH inhibitor influenced the threshold of the frog legs because it inhibited the ACH esterase in the synaptic cleft. As a result, the thresholds and amplitudes changed both positively and negatively. This is not consistent with the initial expectation that the amplitude would increase, as the amplitude of contraction decreased after the injection of ACH esterase inhibitor for all three frog legs. Although the amplitude did not increase for two frog legs, the expected result did occur in one frog leg. In this leg, results show that upon stimulating the siatic nerve, the threshold decreased during the refractory period, which made it easier for an action potential to arise and stimulate the muscle to contract. As a result, the muscle contracted. The opposite effect was observed in the other two frog legs, where the threshold increased. As a result, these two frog legs could not contract. 

The observations recorded during this procedure do not confirm the hypothesis of this procedure, mainly because of the vast variability of the results when compared to the hypothesis. With this in mind, the data recorded for this procedure cannot confirm the hypothesis, that the addition of ACH esterase inhibitor will decrease the threshold of the sarcomeres in frog skeletal muscle. The main reason for this being that the threshold actually increased for two frog legs, while the expected result occurred in the third frog leg. With this inconsistency in mind, it would only be safe to confirm that the hypothesis—that ACH esterase inhibitor will lower the threshold— is not correct for this procedure. Furthermore, with a p_value of 0.6 for the treated legs and a p_value of 0.8 for the legs before being treated, the hypothesis is not supported.
