Title: The Effect of Shelter on the Agonistic Behaviors of the Betta splendins.

Abstract:
Betta spledens that have access to shelter will demonstrate fewer red manes than those without access to shelter.  To find this out, we placed two betta fish into a tank without shelter and counted the number of red manes demonstrated.  Then we added shelters to the tank and counted the red manes again.  A significent difference was found in the number of red manes demonstrated without access to shelter in comparison to access to shelter.  

Introduction:
Betta splendins, or just betta fish, are a domesticated aquarium fish known for their aggressive behaviors.  In the presence of other betta fish, the males will exhibit agnostic behaviors toward the other fish.  There are two types of agnostic behaviors: broadside movements and facing movements, with the most aggressive being the protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes to create a “red mane.”  Recent research suggests that betta fish automatically flare their gills to an intruder who comes into their territory [Forsatkar, Nematollahi, Brown: 2016].  In an environment with access to shelter, we hypothesize betta fish will exhibit fewer “red mane” than those without access to shelter.  Our purpose was to see if the addition of some shelter to the environment of the betta fish would be enough to change the behavior of the fish.  

Materials and Method:
First, we need three fish that we will group into pairs, that can have repeating fish.  In one tank with a physical and vision divider, we placed two of the fish.  After becoming used to their new environment, we remove the vision blinder and count the number of red manes from both fish, combing the numbers from both fish into one for each replicate of two fish.  Then we swap one fish for the third fish and give time for the fish to rest to not habituate to each other.  We did this for all pairs, using three replicates for each no shelter and with shelter.  After that we added a form of shelter to both sides of the divider and introduced the fish.  One shelter was a bridge, which the fish could hide under and behind, and the other shelter was a skull, which a fish could hide inside of and behind.  Again, we removed the vision divider and counted the number of red manes; we did this for all pairs again, allowing for rest.  We then used a one tailed paired t_test to see if there was a significent difference in the number of red manes demonstrated from no shelter to shelter.

Results:
Our results showed that we have an average of 9.0 ± 7.44 for the number of red manes demonstrated with no shelter and an average of 3.167 ± 3.39 for the number of red manes demonstrated with shelter.  The trend we see in the data is that the number of red manes for no shelter is higher than that of red manes demonstrated with shelter as shown in figure 1.  Our paired t_test showed that there was a significent difference between red manes demonstrated with shelter versus without shelter (t_stat= 2.44, d.f.= 5, P= 0.03).

Discussion:
Our results did support our hypothesis that fewer red manes would be demonstrated with access to a shelter.  In every fish, we saw a decrease in the number of red manes demonstrated from no shelter to a shelter accessible environment, except for one fish, who never demonstrated red manes in either environment.  Most of our fish, except the one, follow the expected behaviors by demonstrating red mane when an intruder is introduced to their territory [Forsatkar, Nematollahi, Brown: 2016].  While we didn’t look for other agnostic behaviors, some were obvious, such as tail beating, the dominant agnostic behavior was demonstrating the red mane, again in line with previous research [Forsatkar, Nematollahi, Brown: 2016].  Biologically, our results support the idea that an organism won’t demonstrate aggressive behaviors if they have the opportunity to hide, because aggression puts the organism at increased risk of injury or death, thus if a fish seeks aggressive behaviros they would decrease their fitness, or number of offspring, potentially.  This would explain why betta fish in an open tank are overly aggressive to other fish, because they have no place that they can take shelter and thusly have to be aggressive to survive and try to keep from seeing a decrease in their fitness.  If we were to perform this experiment again, we could improve by having more pairs of fish, so we could have more data.  We could also improve by seeing if the fish that demonstrated no red manes was blind, if so then we should avoid using the fish.  From this we can try and learn why domesticated betta fish are aggressive, so that we could potentially avoid the aggressive behaviors.  It is also important, because we see a contradiction in behaviors from the aggressive betta fish, to a shelter seeking betta fish, which could in turn help us understand other species who display such differing behaviors.
