Title: Azadirachtin’s Effects on the Growth Hormones of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
In this lab report, Azadirachtin’s effects on the growth hormones of Manduca Sexta is studied. As Azadirachtin is a kind of botanical insecticide that disrupts the endocrine system and alters many cellular functions in different parts of the insects, it is hypothesized that the presence of Azadirachtin in food will disrupt the growth of caterpillars. The prediction was largely supported by the experiment result regardless some inconsistencies of the experimental design.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, commonly known as tobacco hornworm, is a perfect model insect for studying the regulations of growth hormones. During the larvae stage of one insect, Juvenile Hormones(JH) and Ecdysone(20E) controll the molting of the larvae[Johnson: 2018]. While JH regulates the type of molting, 20E controlls the time of molting. Because that 20E infusion induces the apolysis and deposition of pupal cuticle, which is a critical step of the metamorphosis of an insect, 20E is of particular interest in this lab report [Nijhout: 1976]. Azadirachtin is a botanical insecticide that obtained from Indian neem tree; it is widely used because of its property of blocking the secretion of 20E from the endocrine system, alternating the digestive enzyme production, and inducing the antifeedant behaviors, which then lead to the regulation of harmful insects[Nisbet: 2000]. In the experiment, insects will be treated with Azadirachtin. It is predicted that the caterpillar that is treated with Azadirachtin will stop growing and fail to enter the next stage of metamorphotic development due to blocking of 20E. 

Materials and Method:
There were 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars used in experiment. They were divided into 2 groups, controll and experimental. The lengths and weights were firstly measured with a ruler and a balance. Each group was then evenly distributed into 2 plastic containers; while each container had an index card in the middle to separate the two caterpillars. After labeling the 4 plastic containers, 10g of food was weighed and provided for each caterpillar; for the caterpillars in experimental groups, their food was stirred with 5 drops of AzaMax, an artificial insecticide that contains azadirachtin. The 4 containers were put into an incubator. The lengths and weights of each caterpillar were then collected each day of the following week. Later on, a two-sampled T-test was performed on all of the data collected.

Results:
Figure 1. Menduca Sexta Caterpillars’ Lengths over 8 Days of Growth. Each data point represents the average value of length of different groups. The standard deviation among each group is represented as error bars. The controll group is the group that was treated with water and food only, while the experimental group is the one that was treated with AzaMax.

Discussion:
From Figs. 1 and 2, it is known that the caterpillars in the controll group show their largest change in their weights and lengths from day 4 to day 5. After day 5, they showed only gradual changes in their lengths and weights. However, for the experimental group, their weights and lengths only fluctuated through the 8 days, no significent changes. And according to Figs. 3 and 4, the caterpillars all show increases in their lengths during the week of experiment. while controll groups have shown large increases in their weights, the experimental groups have shown very little change, and some even showed decreased in their weights. In addition, the two-sampled T-Test shows that there are significent differences between the growth (lengths and weights) of caterpillars given the normal food and the ones treated with the AzaMax. Therefore, as azadirachtin is known to disrupt the functioning of endocrine system, the stated hypothesis that the chemical used to block the secretion of 20E restricts the Manduca Manduca caterpillars from growing larger seems to be confirmed[Nisbet: 2000]. However, as mentioned earlier, the presence of azadirachtin can induce the antifeedant behaviors of the insects because azadirachtin stimulates some cells in the chemoreceptors on the insect mouthparts, blocking the firing of some sugar receptor cells that induces feeding behaviors[Nisbet: 2000]. Then there is another factor that may lead to the same result observed. According to the visual observations, the food prepared for the 4 caterpillars in the experimental groups haven’t been eaten much at the end of the experiment. This indicates that the experimental caterpillars didn’t have enough nutrients for growth compared to the other 4 in the controll group. The behavior of food avoidance was also studied by R. Bezzar-Bendjazia and his colleagues. They found out that when the Drosophila larvae was treated with azadirachtin during their early stages, their food intakes were significently decreased. This was due to that the azadirachitin reduced the activity of some larval enzymes while increased the activity of lipase, affecting the insect’s ability to digest food[Bezzar-Bendjazia: 2017]. In all, our hypothesis is supported by the experiment, but improvement on the experimental design is needed for the clarification of the factor that causes the reduce of weights and lengths of the caterpillars.
