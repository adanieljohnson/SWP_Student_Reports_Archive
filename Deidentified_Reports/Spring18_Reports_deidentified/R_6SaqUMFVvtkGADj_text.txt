Title: Study of the Effects of Juvenile Hormones on the Life Cycles of Manduca Caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment explores the effects of excessive juvenile hormones in the diet of Manduca Caterpillars. We test two groups of caterpillars, one being the control and the other an experimental group that was fed a diet that consisted of food that had been mixed with additional JH. The caterpillars weight was compared from the beginning to the end of the experiment and the experimental group was compared to the control group to determine if the additional JH had an affect on the growth patterns of the caterpillars. In the end we discovered that there was little to no difference in the growth patterns of the caterpillars. 

Introduction:
: In this experiment we are testing the effects of juvenile hormones, specifically the Precor concentration, on the life cycles of Manduca sexta (Mandura Caterpillars). These caterpillars are in the Order Lapidetora and grow into a type of moth. Common names of this insect are the sphinx moth, hawk moth tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx . The Mandura Caterpillar has 5 larval instars before they pupate and turn into a moth. Throughout the instar periods Manduca Sexta have high levels of juvenile hormones (JH) which signal that the caterpillar is not ready to pupate and needs to harvest more nutrients and grow larger. Just before it pupates the JH value decreases dramatically signaling that the caterpillar has acquired enough nutrients to go through the process of pupation. In this experiment we want to see if excessive levels of JH, delivered in the food, stops the caterpillar from entering the 5th instar and pupating.  We hypothesis that if the caterpillar is continuously exposed to JH, provided through its food, then it will not begin to pupate. We can test this by understanding that Manduca sexta will decrease slightly in size as it begins to pupate because it stops eating in order to begin creating its pupal case . Thus if the experimental group does not diminish in size, but rather continues to gain size. 

Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment we selected 8 healthy Manduca caterpillars and placed them in their own individual living environments. We did this by dividing 4 plastic bowls in half with an index card . Each caterpillar was weighed before being placed in its environment. We divided the caterpillars into 2 groups, consisting of 4 caterpillars each. The first was the control group. Each caterpillar was fed 10 grams of food which was mixed with 10 drops of filtered water . The food was mixed with the water to keep the food from drying out. The second group was the experimental group. In this group each caterpillar was fed 10 grams of food mixed with 10 drops of the JH precor concentration. The caterpillars were then placed in an incubator and fed every day for 7 days. Each day the weight of the caterpillar was recorded as well as the weight of the food left over from the previous days feeding. By measuring the amount of food left over we were able to determine how much food the caterpillar ate since the previous feeding and how much food the caterpillar ate over the course of the 7 days. 

Results:
The results of the experiment showed that there was not a major difference in the growth patterns between the control and experimental group of caterpillars. The general trend of growth in both groups was very similar. By examining figure’s 3 and 4 there is a clear similarity in the growth patterns of the two groups. Both groups start with an initially slow growth and then begin to gain weight much quicker. Looking at the Day 7 table there is a clear outlier in the experiment group which gained almost 3 grams more weight than any other caterpillar in its group. This outlier can be used to explain the statistical difference in the means of the weight gained by the two different groups. The control group gained an average of 10.55 grams of weight while the experimental group gained 10.89 grams of weight. Experiment caterpillar 5 gained much more weight than the other caterpillars in its group and this skewed the mean making it noticeably higher than the mean for the control group. Therefore the outlier can be used to explain the difference in the means. 

Discussion:
Through analysis of the results of the experiment it is clear that our hypothesis was not supported. We initially hypothesized that exposure to higher levels of JH would lead to noticeably larger growth, however the statistical data does not support this hypothesis. Due to the very similar growth patterns of the control and experimental groups it is clear that the increased JH levels did little to change the growth patterns of the experimental groups. In fact we see that both of the groups began to gain less weight in the final 2 days  which could be a result of the caterpillars beginning to pupate. When a Manduca sexta starts the process of pupation its growth levels off and they even begin to lose weight as they start developing their pupal case. The slowing of growth in the final days of the experiment indicates the beginning of  the process of pupation. Therefore, because both groups of caterpillars, the control and experimental, seem to be going through a typical instar cycle the increased JH, at the volume used in the experimental food, did very little to effect the life cycle of the Manduca caterpillar.
