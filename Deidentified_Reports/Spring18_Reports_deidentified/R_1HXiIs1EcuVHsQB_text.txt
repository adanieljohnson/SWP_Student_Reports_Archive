Title: Alteration of Ecdysterone (20E) hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
The role of the hormone ecdysterone (20E) is vital in the timing of molting and metamorphosis in Manduca sexta caterpillars. To molt from one instar to the next, the presence of ecdysterone in correspondence with the proper amount of juvenile hormone at specific times is necessary. In the presence of Azamax, a known ecdysterone receptor blocker, the ecdysterone hormone should not be able to impose its effect on the receiving structures within the caterpillar. Without active 20E receptors, the larvae may not be able to molt from one instar to the next, resulting in a smaller change in weight than the caterpillars not treated with Azamax. To test this hypothesis, eight caterpillars are divided into two groups: control and treatment. Over a course of one week, one group is feed food supplemented with Azamax while one is fed normal food and the weight of all caterpillars are recorded. A two-sample t-test is then performed which indicates no statistically significant difference between the means of the control and treatment groups, although the average change in weight among the control groups is  2.8 grams greater than that of the treatment group. Although the results do not indicate statistical significance, the increased change in weight does correspond with the group not treated

with Azamax. Further investigation into the effects of Azamax utilizing a longer study and larger sample size could result in statistically significant results which could yield an improved understanding of such antagonists used in chemicals such as insecticides and their effects on the caterpillars and other secondary organisms.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are holometabolous insects whose growth and molting is controlled primarily by the hormones ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Manduca sexta are an ideal subject because their molting cycle is well understood and the roles of 20E and JH are well documented. In order to further understand the regulation of the insect’s endocrine system, Azamax (an ecdysterone blocker) will be added to the diet of eight sample insects. The insect weight (dependent variable) will be measured against the presence or absence of Azamax in the diet of the sample insects (independent variable). Ecdysterone is responsible for the timing of molting during insect development that mimic the morphogenetic changes that occur in vivo [Judy: 1971]. Without active receptors of 20E, the larvae may not be able to grow into larger larvae in preparation for metamorphosis and will not receive the commitment pulse which triggers metamorphosis, resulting in a smaller change in weight over the course of a week than those caterpillars not being fed Azamax. 


Materials and Methods:
Initially, 80 grams of Manduca sexta food were weighed out and separated into two 40 gram clumps: one treatment and one control. To create the treatment food, 28 drops of Azamax were added to the provided control food (7 drops per 10 grams) and mixed in. In the control food, 7 drops of water per 10 grams were added in the same fashion and mixed in. From here, both food samples were divided into four samples of 10 grams. Four clear tubs with aspirated lids were then obtained and divided in half by notecards. Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and one was placed in each compartment along with 10 grams of either the control (diluted with 7 drops of water) or treatment food (diluted with 7 drops of Azamax). A number was assigned to each caterpillar and each container was labeled with the group name and identifying number of the insect. Containers were placed in a 25°C incubator on a twelve hour light/dark cycle. For seven days, weight was recorded every day for each insect. After one week of observation, all caterpillars and containers were discarded. Using the collected data, a two-sample t-test assuming equal variances was performed.


Results:
During the testing period, variance in physical appearance of the caterpillars was observed between and within the control and treatment groups; the caterpillars in the treatment group were visibly smaller than the control caterpillars. Additionally, the control caterpillars were brighter in color by the end of the testing period than the treatment caterpillars. The average change in weight of the control group was measured to be 5.135 grams while that of the treatment group was only 2.335 grams. A two-sample t-test performed on these data yielded a P-value of 0.63 which was greater than the α-value of 0.05, indicating that the average of the control group and that of the treatment group were not statistically different from one another. 


Discussion:
     As indicated by the results, the presence of ecdysterone blocker Azamax in the food of Manduca sexta caterpillars corresponded with a smaller average change in weight over one week than the change in weight of the control group. The mean of the treatment group was not statistically different than that of the control group (t-stat = 0.49, df = 14, P = 0.63). Because the Azamax was blocking the reception of 20E within the caterpillars-- which normally regulates the timing of molting that mimic the morphogenetic changes that usually occur in vivo-- there were no spikes in ecdysterone levels which are known to trigger the molting of Manduca sexta caterpillars from one instar to the next, or from a 5th instar to a pupa [Judy: 1971]. Therefore, the presence of Azamax in the food source of caterpillars should inhibit the growth of the caterpillar in preparation for molting which will not occur due to the insufficient reception of ecdysterone. Although statistically insignificant, this inhibitory effect of Azamax is reflected in the smaller average change in weight of the treatment group compared to that of the control group over the week long testing period in the data collected. Antagonistic chemicals such as Azamax, which block the reception of hormones such as ecdysterone, are vital in the understanding of many of the insecticides used in the agricultural world today. Continuations of studies such as this one on different species could lead to insight on the effects of ecdysteroids on the health of other organisms which they indirectly affect. In future studies, increased time to conduct the study and a larger sample size could both lead to more accurate and informative results as well as a greater possibility for the production of statistically different means.

Figure 1. Change in weight of each sample Manduca sexta caterpillar over the eight day recording period. Time represented on the x-axis against weight in grams (dependent variable) on the y-axis. All caterpillars demonstrate an increase in weight over the week, however there in clearly a greater change among the majority of the control caterpillars with treatment caterpillar eight representing an outlier with a much greater change in weight than the other treatment caterpillars.

A two-sample t-test yielded a P-value of 0.63, a t-stat of 0.49, and a df of 14. Standard deviation of the control group average was 3.50 while the standard deviation of treatment group average was 2.55.
