Title: Introducing food reduces aggressive behavior in Betta splendins

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether food has an effect on the display of aggressive behavior by an animals. Animals display aggressive behavior when they sense a threat. The animal used for this experiment was the betta splendins. The betta fish was chosen due to the aggressive behavior they display in the presence of another betta fish. The hypothesis of the study was that the betta fish would display aggressive behavior for a lesser amount of time with the introduction of food. This was tested by placing two betta fish in a container with a glass separation. Data was collected by observing the amount of time aggressive behavior was shown by the betta fish in the absence and presence of food. The result of the study was that the hypothesis was not supported.   

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. They study of the animals is conducted through observations. The observation of the behaviors can lead researchers to draw conclusions about why the behavior is displayed.  Animals display agnostic, or aggressive, behavior when they sense a threat. The type of behavior they exhibit has varying levels. The type of agnostic behavior exhibited corresponded to the level of aggression the fish are showing. [Lynn, 2007] The specie under study in this experiment was the Betta splendins. The betta originated from southeast Asia. The fish were selectively bred to display colorfully.  The betta fish were selected for this study due the aggressive behavior they display in the presence of other betta fish. The behavior displayed with the betta fish is classified as intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behavior has type of movements which can be further classified by the physiological changes the betta display.  Responses to threat can also decrease due to habituation. Habituation is the reduction of a response to a constant stimulus. In a research conducted by Monmouth College, betta fish saw a reduction in response to another fish due to prolonged exposure. [Meliska, 1976] In this experiment we will be testing the effect of food on the aggressive behavior of the betta fish. I predicted that if we introduced food to the betta fish, the amount of time the betta show aggressive behavior will decrease because the fish will allocate their time towards gaining energy by eating food rather than displaying aggressive behavior. Therefore, the amount of time the fish show aggression will decrease.     

Materials and Method:
The experiment consisted of two male Betta fish. One fish was a primarily red while the other was primarily blue. The two fish were placed in a container. The container contained a partition which physically separated the fish along which a white sheet of glass which did not allow the fish to see each other. The white glass was removed to allow the fish to see each other. The fish were exposed to each other for 5 minutes. The amount of time each fish showed aggression to one another was recorded in seconds. After 5 minutes the white glass sheet was added back, and the fish could not see each other. They were allowed a period of rest for 5 minutes. This process was repeated two more times. The data collected from this trial served as the controll group. Next, food was added as the same as the white sheet of glass was removed. The same process of recording the amount of time each fish showed aggression. The fish were exposed to each other for 5 minutes. A period of 5 minutes rest was then allowed. The process of adding for and removing the white sheets was repeated two more times. The data was analyzed by conducting a one tailed T-test. The alpha level of the statistical test was 0.05. 

Results:
The trend observed in the seconds aggression shown in respect to the introduction of food was decreased when comparing the experimental groups to the controll groups. The average amount of aggression shown in red fish without food was 29   16.5 seconds.  The average amount of aggression shown in the red fish with food was 5.6   8.9 seconds. In the blue fish, the average amount of aggression show without food was 41.3   24.2 seconds while without food it decreased to 2.6   2.3 seconds. The results of the statistical test when conducted for both the red and blue fish were significently indifferent. For the red fish, the p_value of the test was 0.25 which was higher than the alpha level. For the blue fish, the p_value of the test was 0.10 which was also higher than the alpha level.

Discussion:
Based on the data collected and the statistical tests conducted, our hypothesis was not supported. The average amount of aggression shown in the two groups of betta fish decreased. This portion of the data support our hypothesis. However, when a statistical test was conducted, the data were statistically indifferent. Therefore, our hypothesis in the end is not supported. We expected to see a decrease in the aggression shown. The reasoning for the aggression to decrease was that the betta would rather spend its time gathering energy through eating food rather than expending energy displaying aggressive behavior. A research conducted by the University of Toronto similar to this experiment yield the same conclusion. The fish chose to eat food rather than show aggression. [Bols, 1979] Another explanation of why the fish decreased aggressive behavior could be due to habituation. Due to repeated exposure over many days with the betta fish could have cause habituation to occur.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The comparison of the average amount of aggression in seconds shown by the red Betta splendins between the controll and experimental groups. The trend observed was that the average amount of aggression decreased when comparing controll groups to experimental groups.  The values depicted were not statistically different (T-value= 1.58, degrees freedom=2, p_value=0.25). The error bars in the figure represent one unit of standard deviation. 
Figure 2. The comparison of the average amount of aggression in seconds shown by the blue Betta splendins between the controll and experimental groups. The trend observed was that the average amount of aggression decreased when comparing controll groups to experimental groups.  The values depicted were not statistically different (T-value= 2.93, degrees freedom=2, p_value=0.10). The error bars in the figure represent one unit of standard deviation.
