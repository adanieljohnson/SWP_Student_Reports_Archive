Title: Effect of Ecdysterone Blockers on the Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In this experiment we examine the effect of Ecdysterone hormone blockers on the weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. Manduca Sexta caterpillars have two main hormones that promote development and growth throughout their lifetime, Juvenile Hormone, which is more prominent from birth to the fifth in-star larva stage, and Ecdysterone, which is more prominent starting from the fifth in-star larva stage and throughout adulthood. We hypothesize that the addition of Ecdysterone hormone blockers will cause a significant decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, compared to those not receiving the treatment. Eight Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were used in this experiment; four experimental caterpillars which received seven drops of AZA Guard: 20E Blocker in each of their 10g of food, and four control caterpillars which received seven drops of DI water in each of their 10g of food. The caterpillars were weighed every day for a total of eight days. A 2 Sample T-Test was preformed, along with multiple comparisons of the average growth and means of each group, deviations included. The hypothesis was supported by this experiment; the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars in the experimental group were significantly smaller than those in the control group because the Ecdysterone Blockers di

Abstract: In this experiment we examine the effect of Ecdysterone hormone blockers on the weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. Manduca Sexta caterpillars have two main hormones that promote development and growth throughout their lifetime, Juvenile Hormone, which is more prominent from birth to the fifth in-star larva stage, and Ecdysterone, which is more prominent starting from the fifth in-star larva stage and throughout adulthood. We hypothesize that the addition of Ecdysterone hormone blockers will cause a significant decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, compared to those not receiving the treatment. Eight Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were used in this experiment; four experimental caterpillars which received seven drops of AZA Guard: 20E Blocker in each of their 10g of food, and four control caterpillars which received seven drops of DI water in each of their 10g of food. The caterpillars were weighed every day for a total of eight days. A 2 Sample T-Test was preformed, along with multiple comparisons of the average growth and means of each group, deviations included. The hypothesis was supported by this experiment; the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars in the experimental group were significantly smaller than those in the control group because the Ecdysterone Blockers did not allow a commitment pulse to take place, therefore not allowing the Manduca Sexta's to grow to an appropriate size and store enough nutrients to partake in metamorphosis.
Introduction: Hormones are chemical like substances found in living organisms that permit and hinder different bodily processes from taking place. Alternating hormones has shown to alter the growth and bodily regulations of certain organisms. In a case study done on Linden Bugs, accidentally, an insect growth regulator (IGR) was shown to lower egg hatch rates and decrease the maturation process into adults of all bugs that the IGR came into contact with. It was later found that the IGR present was Juvabione, a substance present in the paper towels used during the experiment (Tunaz, 2004). We as a class, and individually in our biology lab groups, want to test our own IGR on a different organism: the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta has two main hormones of its own that allow it to grow and develop properly: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone. Both JH and Ecdysterone are present in varying levels in a Manduca Sexta's lifetime. In the beginning of a Manduca Sexta's life, up until about the fifth instar larva stage, JH levels are high, while from the fifth instar larva stage, to the full grown adult stage, JH levels are shown to taper off. The opposite is true for that of ecdysterone. Besides a few pulses early on in a Manduca Sexta's life, ecdysterone levels are low up until the fifth instar larva stage, while from that fifth instar larva stage, to the fill grown adult stage, ecdysterone levels are high. I hypothesize that if we administer ecdysterone (E20) blockers to the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, there will be a significant decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta with the 20E blockers, compared to those without it in a given period of time. 

Materials and Methods:
Methods: Select eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars and divide them into two groups of four. Identify a control group and an experimental group. Gather four, round, clear plastic containers and place an index card horizontally across the container, separating the container in half. Tape the index card into place by folding the edges approximately 1cm in and secure with clear tape. Label each "half" of the container by identifying each caterpillar (number, letter, name etc.), whether the caterpillar is control or experimental, and any other information specified by the instructor such as class section and/or name of group. Pair the control caterpillars together, and the experimental caterpillars together to limit cross contamination of food. Weigh out eighty grams of caterpillar food: ten grams for each caterpillar. Be sure to zero out the scale before adding the food to the measuring container. Stir the food well with a clean metal spoon. From the eighty grams of food, separately measure ten grams for each caterpillar, and place on each side of the index cards in the containers. With a clean transfer pipette, add exactly seven drops of DI water to the CONTROL caterpillar's food. Once added, stir very well with a clean metal spoon to ensure water is evenly distributed throughout the food. With a new and clean transfer pipette, add exactly seven drops of AZA Guard: 20E Blocker to the EXPERIEMENTAL caterpillar's food (the original ratio of AZA Guard: 1-part AZA Guard to 1250-parts of deionized water).
Once added, stir very well with a new and clean metal spoon to ensure blocker is evenly distributed throughout the food. Leave all food in a clump in the containers to prevent food from drying out. Obtain caterpillars and weigh each caterpillar separately on a scale. Be sure to zero out scale after each caterpillar has been weighed. Record beginning weight and visual observations and place each caterpillar in desired section of the containers. After each caterpillar is weighed and each side of the index cards has food and a Manduca Sexta, cap the containers and store in an incubator that allows for constant temperature and light for each organism. Every day for one week, record the weight and visual observations of each caterpillar, ensuring the measurement is accurate by zeroing out the scale each time. If, throughout the week, the caterpillar's food appears to be less than half, repeat the process above and give each Manduca Sexta ten more grams of food with the appropriate dilution of water or 20E blocker. Run a 2-Sample T-Test to compare the means from the experimental group to the control group. The p value indicates the chance that the results were all from chance. 


Results:
Over the course of the eight days the experiment took place, the control group caterpillars weighed significantly more than the experimental caterpillars. They saw a greater change in weight as well.

Discussion:
Discussion: My hypothesis was supported by my experiment; I stated that if we administer ecdysterone (E20) blockers to the Manduca Sexta caterpillars, there will be a significant decrease in the weight of the Manduca Sexta with the E20 blockers, compared to those without it in a given period of time, and that is exactly what happened. The ecdysterone blockers did exactly what the name implies: they ceased the release of ecdysterone from the Manduca Sexta's hormone secretors. Throughout a Manduca Sexta's life, from birth to the fifth instar larvae stage, Juvenile Hormone levels are high, while ecdysterone levels are found to be low. However, there are periods of time during this period where ecdysterone levels spike extremely high, and become higher than the release of Juvenile Hormone, these are called Ecdysterone pulses. The most significant Ecdysterone pulse to a Manduca Sexta's life cycle happens during the fifth instar larva stage; it is called the Commitment Pulse. The commitment pulse occurs when a Manduca Sexta caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate into a normal size moth, and it starts a series of changes that start metamorphosis including behavioral, genetic, morphological, and physiological changes. By supplying our experimental Manduca Sexta Caterpillars with E20 Blockers, we cut off the Ecdysterone levels which allowed the continual release of Juvenile Hormone, with no Ecdysterone pulses, including the commitment pulse, taking place. The absence of the commitment pulse did not allow the caterpillar's hormones to be able to signal whether or not it is of capable size and health to continue through metamorphosis. The excess levels of Juvenile Hormone signaled the Manduca Sexta's bodies to continue to grow into the next stages of instar larva, even if they were at the appropriate fifth instar stage. The control Manduca Sexta's did not have the alteration and therefore were able to properly signal if they were able to start the transformation into metamorphosis. The control Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were significantly larger, and grew significantly more because they're hormones, (specifically the Ecdysterone commitment pulse), were signaling to them that they were getting toward the end of the fifth instar larva stage, and nearer to metamorphosis. They were then able to continue to grow to a substantial size, and store ample nutrients to be able to make the necessary biological change, explaining the substantial weight difference between the control and the experimental groups. As shown here, and in the Linden Bug study mentioned previously, altering an organism's hormones may affect its growth and/or bodily regulations. The Linden Bug study displayed how alternating one of a Linden bug's main hormones caused them to have significantly less egg hatch rates and decrease the rate of the maturation process into adults. (Tunaz, 2004). This shows how vitally important hormone levels and the specific timings of those hormone levels are to each individual species' progression of life. Each stage of the life cycle an organism goes through relies of the proper releasing of hormones in the body, altering these hormones can have a drastic, and sometimes even a deadly effect on these stages.
