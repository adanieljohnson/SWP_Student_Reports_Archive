Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Frog Leg Nerve Stimulation : Rana Pipien

Abstract:
Rana Pipien are commonly known as the leopard frog and have easily accessible leg muscles and nerves, similar to those of humans. When stimulated, the nerve creates a muscle contraction readable on a myogram and measurable by amplitude of the contraction. Sodium channels are vital to the Rana Pipien leg muscle and nerves as they play a major role in the process of nerve signaling and muscle twitching. Therefore, if a sodium channel blocker (Lidocaine) is added to the Rana Pipien leg muscle and nerve, then the threshold will increase, and the muscle contraction will be severely delayed or completely inhibited. 
We examined the effects of Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the right and left legs of a Rana Pipien. One leg was treated with Lidocaine and the other was not, although the second leg was then tested with Lidocaine as well. We measured the differences of the muscle twitch thresholds and the corresponding threshold. Our results compare the difference of means of the control and experimental groups' average threshold and voltage of the muscle contraction. Overall, our results show that there is a difference in the means, but none is great enough to show a significant difference of means, due to an insufficient sample size. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to test whether adding Lidocaine to Rana Pipien legs changes the strength of muscle contraction of the organism. Rana Pipiens were used because their leg muscles and nerves are easily accessible because the organisms are large enough to dissect, the nerve is visible, and the muscle contraction is noticeable without the need for microscopes or other viewing tools. 	
The Rana Pipien have skeletal muscles consisting of hundreds of fused aggregates of cells called myofibers. The skeletal muscle is comprised of motor neurons which innervate the myofibers. This grouping is known as a neuromuscular junction (Johnson 2016). Neuromuscular junctions are vital to muscle contraction because nerve impulses arrive at this point and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine opens sodium channels which then create action potentials in the muscle. Calcium is then released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the muscle fiber contracts (Johnson 2016). Effects of sodium channel blockers were tested in this experiment because they are vital to the contractile mechanisms of Rana Pipien leg muscles and nerves. 
This experiment was focused on two primary structures of the Rana Pipien leg, the gastrocnemius muscle (similar to the calf in humans) and the sciatic nerve which runs up the thigh area. The sciatic nerve extends from the spinal cord and is the primary nerve involved in the control and sensations of the leg muscles (Yeomans 2018). 
Sodium channels are essential in the contractile mechanism of muscles because they initiate the contraction of the muscle. An important aspect of sodium channels is the relaxation period after a process called slow inactivation which is when the channel has been repeatedly stimulated and, thus, prevents the channel from being activated for an extended amount of time (Simkin and Bendahhou 2011). It is important to utilize rest periods between stimulations so that the results are accurate.
The treatment studied was Lidocaine, which is a sodium channel blocker. Because sodium channels are required for muscle contraction, we decided to determine if a blocker would hinder the muscle contraction and to what degree. Lidocaine binds to and blocks sodium channels. This blockage alters the signal conduction by not allowing for depolarization or action potential release which is required for sodium release which initiates muscle contraction (Vono 2011). It is interesting to note that Lidocaine is often used in dental surgeries for pain management because it has an anesthetic effect, which could be experimental data supporting our research in this experiment. 
By utilizing the LabScribe software, we were able to manipulate multiple variables to test the differences in the threshold and voltage of each frog leg. These differences allowed us to determine the relative effects of Lidocaine on the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle through sciatic nerve stimulation in Rana Pipiens. The LabSribe software produces a myogram which is a mechanism for showing the velocity and intensity of a muscle contraction. The myogram allows researchers to determine the threshold of the muscle and the corresponding voltage of the contraction. A threshold is the lowest amplitude that produces a contraction. These calculations will be used to determine whether Lidocaine affects the time and strength of muscle contraction in Rana Pipien. 
Studies have suggested that sodium channel blockers when utilized in vitro in adult male rats have caused prolonged blockages of the neuromuscular function in muscle twitch amplitude (Tulunay 1996). Another study stated that when applied to smooth airway muscles, Lidocaine also inhibits the contractile mechanism influenced by sodium channels and sodium release due to the concentration dependent decrease and relaxation of the muscle caused by the Lidocaine (Kai 1993). We believe the threshold and voltage of the experimental group will be higher than those of the control group due to the effects of Lidocaine on muscle contraction. Therefore, if Lidocaine is added to the Rana Pipien leg muscle and nerve, then the threshold will increase, and the muscle contraction will be severely delayed or completely inhibited. 



Materials and Methods:
Two frog legs were tested, one right and one left leg of the same organism. One leg acted as the control and was tested without Lidocaine and then tested a second time with the Lidocaine treatment. The alternate leg was tested only once with Lidocaine. The gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve were isolated by removing the skin of the leg and separating the upper thigh. The gastrocnemius muscle was then tied to a hook in an upright position so that tension in the muscle was created. The nerve was isolated and electric probes were placed directly on the nerve. The LabScribe software was then utilized to fire stimuli and record the contractile variables. 
	The experimental muscles received 0.1 mL of Lidocaine (provided by the Wake Forest University Lab), inserted directly into the gastrocnemius muscle and onto the sciatic nerve. Both groups were frequently rinsed with Ringer's solution to preserve the muscles. The delivery method in this case was injection which was carried out by following lab safety protocol.  
	Each test began by setting the baseline values in LabScribe to: 
		Amp: 0.000V
		# Pulses: 1
		F(Hz): 5
		W: 5 ms 
	The only variable changed in this experiment was the amplitude. 
The nerve was stimulated as a baseline reading and then the amplitude was manually increased by 0.1 volts until the threshold of the muscle contraction was calculated. Each leg was tested three times with sixty second breaks in between the trials so that the muscle could have a relaxation period. The average of the three trials was taken and used in the calculations for our statistical test. Voltage was calculated through mechanisms provided by the LabScribe software. 
The methods of this study were similar to those of the Responses of Human Muscle Spindle Endings to Vibration during Isometric Contraction study, in that the electrodes were carefully placed, contractions were visually observed, Lidocaine was injected, and delayed responses were recorded (Burke et al. 1976). It was important to ensure that the Lidocaine was injected evenly throughout the gastrocnemius muscle and directly onto the sciatic nerve to make sure that there was an even distribution of treatment to all areas being stimulated. 
	The statistical test used was a two - sample t - test. 


Results:
The mean value for the threshold of the muscle was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 1.39, df = 7, P = 0.21). The mean value for the voltage of the contraction was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.084, df = 7 , P = 0.94 ).
On average, the treated Rana Pipien leg did not contract as strongly or as quickly as the control leg. Muscle treated with Lidocaine required a higher amplitude before contracting, whereas the untreated leg was able to contract at a lower stimulus (Fig 1). Generally, (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2), their average threshold values were higher, and their voltage recordings were fairly equivalent although the experiment group was slightly lower.  



Discussion:
The two sample t - test results lead us to accept the null hypothesis because our data was not statistically significant in showing the difference in means of the control and treatment groups. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, adding Lidocaine to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of Rana Pipien has little to no effect on its muscle contraction. It is important to note that though the data was not statistically significant, there were noticeable differences between the two test groups. 
	The study should have been continued with multiple legs in order to receive a better and more reliable reading. Also, only one control reading was taken which could have skewed the data because two experimental readings were calculated. Leg 2 should have been tested without treatment before the Lidocaine was added in order to keep the procedure consistent across both legs. Future experimenters should study multiple legs and test each as a control prior to adding Lidocaine to receive accurate and more comparable readings. 
	It has been shown that the addition of Lidocaine does affect the ability for muscles to contract (Burke 1976). Because sodium channel blockers inhibit the muscle's ability to properly contract, it causes the treatment group to have higher threshold at lower voltages. 
	Our observational results showed a fairly significant difference between the two groups, as the experimental leg muscles did not contract as quickly or as rigorously as the control muscle (determined by visual observations and calculated differences in voltage). 
	Overall, the procedure was carried out very successfully and the study yielded results that are positively comparable to many other scientific studies regarding sodium channel blockers when looking at muscle contractions. However, because of the limited number of test subjects, our data was not statistically significant enough to show that Lidocaine hinders Rana Pipien muscle contraction through sciatic nerve stimulation.
