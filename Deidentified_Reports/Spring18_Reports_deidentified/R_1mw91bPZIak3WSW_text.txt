Title: Visual exposure to the Poecilia reticulata fish Increases agonistic behavior in the Betta splendens fish

Abstract:
The limiting factors which regulate animal behavior include both time and energy. When these finite resources are made use of to perform a behavior, there is less which can be used for another. This trade-off can be used to explain why an animal may or may not exhibit aggressive behavior. There must be a sufficient benefit for an organism to exhibit such behaviors, and testing aggression between species can be used to understand when aggressive behavior is beneficial. To test the impact of another fish on the behavior of a Betta splendens fish, an experiment was performed in which Bettas were visually exposed to Poecilia reticulata. It was hypothesized that when a male Betta fish was visually exposed to another fish species, the Betta would exhibit aggressive behavior more so than when it was not exposed visually to another fish species. When a paired t-test was performed on the results, the p-value was 0.0208 with an alpha-value of 0.05 and a t-value of 6.83. The results were statistically significant. These findings lead to the conclusion that aggression was beneficial to the Betta splendens in visual interactions with the Poecilia reticulata. Future studies may determine what features of other organisms elicit aggressive reactions most often in the Betta. 

Introduction:
The energy and time tradeoffs associated with animal behavior must be considered in association with aggressive behavior. One species with distinct aggressive behavior is the Betta splendens, which exhibits colorful displays in the presence of other individuals. In order for a Betta to display agonistic behavior, it must perceive a benefit resulting from it in order to make up for the sacrifices to both time and energy being made.  Its aggression can be exhibited in intraspecific interactions, behaviors exhibited in the presence of other members of a species, but also interspecific interactions, behaviors exhibited in the presence of a member of another species. Differences in Betta reactions toward conspecifics, or members of the same species, and members of other species depends on the way their response is measured and the methods of the experiment being conducted [Miley: 1977]. Additionally, aggressive Betta behavior can be increased by smaller body length and facing the direction of the other individual [Simpson: 1968]. Thus, there are many factors that influence Betta reactions and subsequent agonistic behavior, including features of the experiment as well as characteristics of the other organism. In order to elicit these reactions from the Bettas, an opaque partition separating the Betta from a member of another species can be lifted from their tank, visually exposing the Betta to another individual. Then the Betta can see the other organism while a clear partition still separates them. This clear partition prevents physical altercations while still facilitating the visual exposure and stimulus of another fish to the Betta. It can be hypothesized that when a male Betta fish is visually exposed to an individual from another fish species, the Poecilia reticulata, the Betta will exhibit aggressive behavior more so than when it is not exposed visually to another fish species.

Materials and Methods:
A male Betta fish was obtained and placed into a tank with water. The fish was observed for 5 minutes alone as the control treatment. This was repeated twice. Next, a clear plastic and oquae plastic divider was inserted into the tank. A Poecilia reticulata fish was placed on the other side of the opaque plastic divider. The opaque divider was lifted, and the Betta’s behavior was observed for 5 minutes. The opaque divider was put back in the tank for 5 minutes to allow the Betta to rest. The opaque divider was lifted and the Betta was observed for 5 minutes twice more, followed by a 5-minute break each time. The observed aggressive behaviors were quantified, with pelvic fin flickering having a value of 1, tail beating having a value of 2, tail flashing having a value of 3, erect pectoral fins having a value of 4, spread gill covers having a value of 5, “red mane” having a value of 6, and all agonistic behaviors, including raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, and darting, all had a value of 7. These behavioral values were summed to come to a single behavioral value for the trial. The mean of the 3 trials for each treatment was found. This data was analyzed using a paired t-test with an alpha value of 0.05. 

Results:
The average behavioral value of the Betta fish was higher in the treatments with visual exposure to the Poecilia reticulata than the average of treatments without this visual stimulus. The average behavioral value in the Poecilia reticulata exposure treatments was 25.67 +/- 6.507 (Figure 1). The average behavioral value in the treatments lacking this visual stimulus was 0 +/- 0 (Figure 1). The p-value was 0.0208 with an alpha value of 0.05 and a t-value of 6.83. 


Discussion:
	The hypothesis that the male Betta fish visually exposed to another fish species would exhibit more aggressive behavior than a Betta fish without this stimulus was supported by the findings of this experiment, as the data was found to be statistically different. The fish may have exhibited this behavior as Betta’s are territorial both within their own species and when exposed to other species of fish and the Poecilia reticulata was infringing upon the Betta’s area. In order to defend this area, the Betta exhibited agonistic behaviors in order to scare the Poecilia reticulata off.  Bronstein’s 1984 study of male Bettas yielded similar findings, as longer residency within the tank lead to an agonistic advantage both between Bettas and between Bettas and members of another species [Bronstein: 1984]. Because in this experiment the Betta was within the tank longer and thus had a greater duration of residency, the Betta perceived the Poecilia reticulata as invasive and, similar to what Bronstein found, displayed greater agonistic behavior. Another factor contributing to the Betta’s behavior may have been the size of the Poecilia reticulata. As the Poecilia reticulata is a smaller fish, the larger Betta may have seen itself as capable of winning in a physical altercation, and thus exhibited aggressive behavior. Bronstein, again, found that large body size produced an agonistic advantage, meaning that greater agonistic behavior was exhibited [Bronstein: 1984]. The greater agonistic behavior exhibited may indicate the Betta’s dominance compared to other fish, in this case the Poecilia reticulata. If the Betta perceived itself of capable of losing, it may not have exhibited this behavior. Finally, the bright coloring of the guppy is similar to that of other male Bettas, possibly contributing to confusion about the species of the fish. Thus, the Betta may have exhibited this behavior as it saw the Poecilia reticulata to be of its own species and, as such, saw it to be a direct threat. However, Lissman’s well known 1933 experiments came to the conclusion that color had no effect on agonistic behavior [Lissman: 1933]. Similarly, Johnson’s 1973 study of the behavior of Betta fish found that they engage in agonistic behavior and altercations with fish, regardless of the species, sometimes fighting with fish of another species for over an hour [Johnson: 1973]. Thus, the factor of color may not be the sole factor which drove the male Betta’s within this experiment to display agonistic behavior, as it has been determined that Bettas engage with fish of all species, regardless of coloring. The characteristics of both fish, including the Betta’s territorial nature and the Poecilia reticulata’s small stature and bright coloring contributed to the aggressive behavior of the Betta. Characteristics of the experiment that may have contributed to the Betta’s agonistic behavior could include the chemical associations linked to the plastic tank inserts that were previously thought to be harmless [Bronstein: 1984]. These biotic and abiotic elements lead to a deeper knowledge of the factors eliciting aggressive Betta behavior. Understanding what the Betta perceives as worthy of agonistic behaviors under certain circumstances (more limited energy, more limited time) is a promising area for future study.
