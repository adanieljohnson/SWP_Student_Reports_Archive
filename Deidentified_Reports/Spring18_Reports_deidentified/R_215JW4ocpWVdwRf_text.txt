Title:  Effects of Acetylcholine on the Duration of Contraction on Rana pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment is testing the effects of Acetylcholine on the duration of a contraction of a frog leg, testing whether or not the neurotransmitter will cause the duration to be shorter or longer. This experiment was conducted on the frog species, Rana pipiens. During this experiment we injected the frog leg with Ach, then using a computer program, iWorx, we measured the duration of the contraction. We found that the control frog legs had an average contraction of 52.05 +/- 7.37 ms and the experimental frog legs had an average duration of 62.9 +/- 11.002 ms. We then ran a paired t-test finding a p value of 0.15 significance and a t value of 1.63 which means that our results were not significantly significant and we could not reject our null hypothesis.

Introduction:
Our experiment studies the process of Neuromuscular control, focusing on the duration of contraction of frog legs. A muscle contraction is triggered when Acetylcholine rushes into the cell and then Ca++ is pumped into the cell causing muscles to contract for longer. Ach is involved in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and directs muscle movement within the body. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that creates muscle contractions. The function of Ach is to bring the cell to a resting potential that will lead to a muscle contraction. The Ach is an inhibitor that allows the Ach to build up in the synapse thus overstimulating the receptors. Once these receptors are overstimulated this will cause the frog leg to go into a state known as Tetanus. This state is the maximal contraction of the frog’s muscle caused from the overstimulation of Ach. A study done by Michael Fulton in 2001 looked at muscle fatigue and the overstimulation of muscles [Fulton:2001]. Fulton’s study examined the effects of Organophosphorus insecticides, OP, which cause similar effects to the Ach. Ach increases duration whereas OP works to inhibit enzymes but both focus on the duration of the contraction. The OP functions by inhibiting certain enzymes in the nervous system causing prolonged contractions leading to muscle fatigue. This experiment was performed on estuarine fish and found that when the OP was injected the contractions increased in duration. Fulton’s experiment looked at how the amplitude and duration would be affected by the injection of OP. Based on previous studies and our knowledge of muscles and action potentials we hypothesize that the injection of Ach will cause a longer duration of contractions in the frog legs.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we used Lithobates pipiens that were collected [MR1] by Wake Forest University Biology department. We used 4 frog legs that were obtained and dissected on the pan. The top layer of the frog skin was taken off where the two thigh muscles were exposed. We then cut the gastrocnemius, with part of the Achilles tendon. We then tied the Achilles to the string and then to the force transductor. We identified the sciatic nerve and placed the metal strings hooked up to the electro stimulator machine[MR2]  over the nerve in order to elicit a muscle twitch. Using 4 pins we stabilized the frog into place. Throughout the experiment we used ringer’s solution to maintain the pH within the frog’s leg. For the control data we recorded the lengths of four different contractions waiting one minute in between to allow the muscle to rest. For the experimental data we injected the frogs with .1mL of the Ach into the top of the muscle, recording the lengths of four contractions for each leg. Using the computer program iWorx we were able to record the lengths of each contraction tested which we then used to run a paired t-test. Obtaining this data gave us a p-value and t value.

Results:
After injecting the Ach into the frog leg we found that it increased the duration of the contraction. On average, the control group had a duration of 52.05 +/- 7.37 ms while the experimental had an average duration of 62.9 +/- 11.002 ms. We performed a paired t test and found a p value of 0.15 significance and a t value of 1.63.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our findings as our p value was 0.15 therefore we failed to reject the null. By the end of the experiment we were able to observe quantifiable results of how the Ach impacts the duration of contractions of frog legs. We were not able to reject our null because we did not have substantial evidence that the duration of contractions increased. This could have been due to the strength of the frog legs used or the lack of trials done. In future research it would be helpful to do more tests on each leg, tests that included a larger number of frog legs in total, and tests that allow the muscles of the frog leg to relax more in between contractions. When there is an increase of the Ach the contraction lasts longer because there is an increase of Ca++, allowing the receptors to remain open for longer. A study published in 1971 by Duchen also looked at the effects of Ach on muscle contraction (Duchen, 1997). Duchen focused on mice with a hereditary disease, motor-end plate disease, and found that their muscles were giving weak responses to nerve stimulation but when Ach was injected the muscles were super sensitive. His findings support the theory that some muscle fibers can become functionally denervated, but with the injection of Ach, the muscles are temporarily stimulated due to the rapid increase of Ca++. This could lead to future research focusing on the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor instead of Ach. It is important to study the neurotransmitter Ach because it is released from the body during the flight or fight response to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. For future research it would be interesting to look at how the release of Ach affects the flight or fight response in different organism. It would also be interesting to see how a stimulant such as coffee would affect the flight or fight response.

Figure 1. Effect of Ach on frog legs. Control groups (blue bar) were not injected with Ach. Experimental groups (orange bar) were injected with Ach. 4 frog legs were used to measure the baseline contractions and then the duration of contractions after the Ach injection. Durations were measured from the start of the contraction to the end of the contraction. Each bar shows the average of the control groups and then of the experimental groups; error bars show the SD.
