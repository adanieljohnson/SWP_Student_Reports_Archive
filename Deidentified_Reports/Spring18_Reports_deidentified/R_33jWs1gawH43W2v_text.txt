Title: Sunlight Increases Root to Shoot Height and Weight Ratios in Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus

Abstract:
Sunlight is necessary for a plant’s survival. For this experiment, we placed three radish plants in the sunlight and three in the shade. After two weeks, we cut samples of each radish plant at the root to shoot junction and weighed and measured the separate parts, comparing the root shoot ratios of the radishes grown in the sunlight versus the shade. The biological question we addressed was: how does light affect radish resource allocation and root to shoot length and weight ratios? It was hypothesized that in the shadier condition, the shoots will be taller than the roots, and therefore the root to shoot ratio will be lower. It was predicted that the radishes would allocate their resources to the shoots to maximize the sunlight they received and take advantage of their resources. While the root shoot length and weight ratios supported this prediction, the results were not statistically significant because the weight p-value was 0.12, and the height p-value was 0.091—both of which were greater than 0.05. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is important for a plant’s survival. Depending on its environment, a plant must adapt to the resources available. If a plant lacks sufficient sunlight, it’s shoot will grow longer in order to possibly reach more sunlight or expand the surface area receiving sunlight to maximize its resources. The solar energy can be allocated to new growth, existing leaves and stems, root storage, and root growth. For this experiment, we are studying the effects of sunlight on radishes, or Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus. Radishes are a reliable organism to study in the lab because they germinate and grow quickly and are generally predictable. Radishes are commonly used to study the effects of light on plants [Snowden, Cope, Bugbee: 2016].  
	Our biological question is: how does light affect radish resource allocation and root to shoot ratio? Our hypothesis is that in the shadier condition, the shoots will be taller than the roots, and therefore the shaded plants will have a lower root to shoot ratio. 
	It is important to understand resource allocation and solar energy in plants because it shows how plants adapt to their surroundings and maximize their resources. This knowledge can be applied to agroforestry, urban forestry, growing plants in greenhouses, sustainable farming, and more. 
	A study conducted by David H. Miller and Leonard Machlis looked into how sunlight affects the growth and development of the Liverwort plant, Sphaerocarpos donnellii Aust. They found that light increases the rate of growth in plants (Miller, Machlis.: 1968). 

Materials and Methods:
To prepare for this lab, we planted radishes two weeks before and placed three pots in the sun and three underneath a shade cloth. We watered each set equally every day.  We analyzed the root to shoot ratio of radishes grown in the sun versus radishes grown in the shade. To begin, we harvested the plants by pulling them out of the tray and separating the roots. After washing the plants, we weighed them, then cut them at their root to shoot junction. We then weighed the roots and shoots separately and measured their lengths. The procedure was repeated three times for each plant in both conditions—light and shade. We used a two-sample one-tailed t-test to compare radishes grown in the sunlight vs. the shade. We determined significance at the p=0.05 level. 

Results:
	The root to shoot weight ratio averaged higher in the plants grown in the sunlight. As seen in Figure 1, while the average of the root to shoot weight ratio of the plants grown in the shade was 0.057, it was 0.108 for the plants grown in the sunlight. The standard deviation of the shaded plants was 0.057, while the standard deviation for the plants that received more sunlight was 0.0597. The p-value was 0.12. 
	As seen in Figure 2, the root to shoot length ratio also averaged higher in the plants that received more sunlight. The average root to shoot length ratio of the plants grown in the shade was 0.36 and 0.48 for the ones grown in more sunlight. The standard deviation of the shaded plants was 0.059, and 0.11 for the plants that received more sunlight. The p-value was 0.091. 
In Figure 3, it is clear that the radishes grown in the sunlight (on the right) look fuller, healthier, and less stringy than the ones grown in the shadier conditions (on the left), based on their coloration and the fullness of their leaves. 


Discussion:
Our results were not statistically significant. We predicted that the radishes in the shadier condition would have a lower root to shoot ratio than the plants in the sunlight because the radishes would allocate more resources to their shoots to take advantage of the ample sunlight, but the difference between the results of the two sets of data was not significant enough to support our hypothesis. However, the root to shoot weight average and height average were higher in the radishes grown in the sunlight, which agreed with our predictions. 
	A source of error could have been measuring the roots and shoots too early in their growth process. If we had measured them three or more weeks after planting them could have given us more consistent results and more time to see the differences between the radishes grown in the sunlight versus shade. 
	Stanton, Weeks, Dana, and Mickelbart’s study titled “Light Exposure and Shade Effects on Growth, Flowering, and Leaf Morphology of Spiraea alba Du Roi and Spiraea tomentosa L,” found that plants will be taller, grow more flowers, and have greener leaves when they are grown in full sunlight. They studied plant performance and growth under six different light treatments, ranging from full shade to full sunlight. They found that the plants in full sunlight performed best and appeared the healthiest. Both our experiment and this experiment demonstrate how plants in different environments respond to their surroundings by allocating their resources. Plants in the shade are more likely to be taller because they allocate more resources to their shoots (Stanton et al: 2010). 
We need to know how light levels affect crop plants in order to know where to plant them to predict how tall they will be. For example, in agroforestry, a question that can be asked is how crop fitness is affected by shoot height, which is determined by the amount of light it receives. Taller plants are generally more fit in this case because the shoot is the portion of the plant that humans consume. Another example that applies to our experiment is urban forestry. Planters need to figure out how to maximize the sunlight reaching the plant when there is large amounts shade from tall buildings in urban areas.
