Title: Sunlight affects resource allocation, increases root:shoot length ratio in Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
Environments often possess limited nutrients or resources, forcing plants to alter resource allocation strategies in order to maximize their chance of survival and reproduction. Previous research states that resource allocation of plants can vary based on variables such as air temperature and light level. In this experiment, we observed the effect of the amount of sunlight on phenotypic plasticity of plants by measuring the root:shoot ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum, commonly referred to as buckwheat, subjected to varying levels of light. We hypothesized that buckwheat grown in higher levels of sunlight would exhibit a higher root:shoot weight and length ratio than those grown in shade since plants grown in sunlight would allocate less resources toward obtaining sunlight, which is plentiful in its environment. Our hypothesis was not accepted by our data, as a significent difference was not found between the average root:shoot weight ratios or the average root:shoot length ratios of the two groups. However, due to the trends in our data and previous research, we still believe that our hypothesis is correct.

Introduction:
Often presented with limited resources and nutrients (such as sunlight, nitrogen, and water) in their environments, plants are forced to alter resource allocation strategies in order to increase their chance of survival and reproduction. While allocation patterns for specific species are mostly ingrained in the genome of the plant, some room does exist for plants to modify their strategies based on its surrounding environment. As a result, two plants of the same species may exhibit different physical traits, such as root length or stem height, when raised in differing environments which possess varying levels of each resource. Past research has concluded that variables such as environmental temperature [Pierson: 1990] and light level have an impact on resource allocation [Davidson: 1969].
    In this experiment, we observed the effect of the amount of sunlight on phenotypic plasticity of plants by measuring the root:shoot ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum subjected to varying levels of light. In an experiment similar to ours, researchers concluded that Bromus tectorum grown in high light conditions were found to have a greater proportion of biomass located in the roots as compared to the shoots [Pierson: 1990]. In order to observe if these findings apply to other species, we designed a similar experiment using Fagopyrum esculentum. Commonly referred to as buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum was chosen because of the relatively large size of its seedlings. We hypothesized that Fagopyrum esculentum grown in higher levels of sunlight would exhibit a higher root:shoot weight and length ratio than those grown in shade since plants grown in sunlight would allocate less resources toward obtaining sunlight, which is plentiful in its environment.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we observed the phenotypic plasticity of plants by measuring both the root:shoot weight ratio and root:shoot length ratio of plants grown in environments with full light or shade.
    First, we obtained six plastic planters and buckwheat seeds from the Wake Forest biology department. Three of the planters were designated as members of the full light group, while the remaining three served as members of the shade group. Each planter was packed with vermiculite, soaked with water, and topped of with a little more vermiculite. Next, nine holes were created in each planter (arranged in a 3x3 square). For each planter, a total of twelve seeds were placed in the nine holes, with each hole receiving at least one seed and some receiving two. The seeds were then recovered in vermiculite and MiracleGro (3.8 g/L) was added to each planter.
    The planters were then placed in their designated treatment areas. The full light group was placed on a table in the greenhouse, where, on sunny days, large amounts of sunlight was present. The shade group was placed in the same greenhouse, but was instead placed under a large awning of shade cloth, blocking some sunlight from reaching the plants. The planters were then watered and left to grow in the greenhouse for a duration of two weeks. We returned each day during the 14 day period in order to water both groups.
    After the two weeks, the buckwheat seedlings which emerged were gathered so that data could be collected. Making sure to keep the plants from each planter separated, we carefully removed three seedlings from the vermiculite of each planter, rinsed them carefully with water, and patted them dry. The combined mass of the three individuals from each planter was recorded. Next, each seedling was cut at the area on the stem where the color changed, allowing us to separate the roots from the shoots. Everything above the color change was considered shoots, while everything below was labeled roots. For each planter, the combined mass of the shoots was recorded. Root mass was then determined by subtracting shoot mass from total mass. The root and shoot length for the individuals in each planter with the maximum shoot length and the maximum root length were recorded.
    Next, the average root mass, average shoot mass, average maximum root length, and average maximum shoot length were determined for each planter. Root:shoot weight ratio for each planter was then calculated using the values for mass, while the root:shoot length ratio was determined using the maximum root and shoot length values. For both the full light and shade groups, the average root:shoot weight ratio and the average root:shoot length ratio were determined, as well as standard deviation. In order to determine if there was a significent difference in between the data of the full light and shade groups, the average root:shoot weight ratios were compared using an unpaired t_test. The process was repeated for the average root:shoot length ratios.

Results:
The average root:shoot weight ratio for the full light and shade groups were relatively similar (see Figure 1) at 0.512土0.130 and 0.523土0.051, respectively. See Figure The difference between the two groups was not found to be significent (t(4)=0.137, p=0.898).
A moderately higher average root:shoot length ratio was obtained for the full light group as compared to the shade group (see Figure 2). Averages root:shoot length ratio of 0.733土0.109 and 0.596土0.062 were found for the full light and shade groups, respectively. The difference between the two groups was not found to be significent (t(4)=1.89, p=0.132).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not accepted by our data, as a significent difference was not found between the average root:shoot weight ratios or the average root:shoot length ratios of the two groups. However, given the trends in the data for average root:shoot length ratio (see Figure 2), we believe that, had the experiment been performed on a large scale with more trials, the data would support our hypothesis. Despite not finding either group significent we are still confident in our results for average root:shoot length ratio, as the trends display a higher average ratio for the full light group. However, our results for the average root:shoot weight ratio are a little more puzzling, causing us to have less confidence in them. Our results displayed virtually identical average root:shoot weight ratio for the full light and shade groups, a finding which has not been replicated in other studies. As mentioned before, researchers observed a higher average root:shoot weight ratio in Bromus tectorum grown in high light as compared to shade [Pierson: 1990]. This leads us to believe that we did not controll all confounding variables adequately. 
One possible confounding variable is soil temperature. In an experiment which controllled for air temperature, scientists tested the effects of soil temperature on plant growth. Soil temperature was found to have a decent effect on plant growth, with growth of plants at the extremes of both hot and cold temperatures becoming stunted [DeLucia: 1992]. While our two groups did not varying in air temperature, as they were placed in the same greenhouse, the sunlight experienced solely by the full light group may have minimally raised soil temperature. Therefore, the two groups did not receive identical treatments, which may have affected growth and also root:shoot ratios.
Another possible confounding variable is the space between seedlings. In an experiment on Pisum sativun, researchers concluded that the presence of a neighbor seedling was associated with a lower average root:shoot weight ratio [Jacob: 2017]. While we did attempted to space out seeds in our planters, we did place multiple seeds in close proximity is some cases. This, in turn, could affect root:shoot weight ratio.
    As our root:shoot length ratio data and previous suggests, plants allocate resources differently based on environment. The phenotypic plasticity of the plants allows the plants a better chance of survival and reproduction, as it can better suit itself for its environment. Plants exposed to plentiful light allocate more resources to roots, as they need to expend less energy collecting light. A possible next step for this research would be to examine the resource allocation of the offspring of plants grown in this experiment in order to determine if there is a genetic component to the magnitude of the phenotypic plasticity found in Fagopyrum esculentum.
