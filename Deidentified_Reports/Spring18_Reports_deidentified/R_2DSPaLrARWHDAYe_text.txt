Title: Lanthanum Chloride Hindering Muscle Contraction in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment seeks to examine the effect of the calcium blocker lanthanum chloride, on muscle contraction in Rania pipiens, an amphibian commonly known as the northern leopard frog. The dependent variable of interest was the threshold voltage needed to stimulate a muscle twitch of the gastrocnemus muscle. The independent variable was the injection or lack thereof of .1 Ml of 1 mM lanthanum chloride. We hypothesized that the experimental group would require a higher threshold voltage compared to the controll group. Four frog legs were used; each one tested first without the injection and then after the injection. It was found that lanthanum chloride does not necessarily affect the threshold needed for muscle contraction in Rania pipiens, as the differences in average total changes in threshold voltages were not statistically significent (P = 0.2259). However, the average threshold for the controll group was lower than that of the experimental group.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system works to convert signals into responses such as the contraction of a muscle (Johnson, 2018). A nerve stimulates muscle contraction through excitation-contraction coupling which involves action potentials depolarizing neurons which leads to the release of Acetylcholine (Johnson, 2018). This neurotransmitter diffuses to the muscle fiber and binds to a receptor, causing sodium channels to generate an action potential (Johnson, 2018). This action potential travels through the fiber, catalyzing the release of calcium out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Johnson, 2018). This causes the muscle fiber to contract as the myofibril shortens until the calcium is reabsorbed which causes the muscle fiber to return to relaxation (Johnson, 2018). Myograms are used to observe the activities of a muscle or nerve at a macroscopic level (Johnson, 2018). They work by attaching a muscle to a force transducer and recording the amount of force generated over a given time (Johnson, 2018). A myogram depicts the latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase of a muscle contraction (Johnson, 2018). The threshold of the muscle is the minimum amount of electrical stimulus needed to stimulate a contraction (Johnson, 2018). There are various chemicals that are known to inhibit the contractile processes of muscles. One of these is lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker (Glusa: 1987). A previously done study found that the strength of muscle contractions of muscles in Rania pipiens continued to decrease as they were injected with increasingly stronger concentrations of Lanthanum chloride (Debassio: 1961). Rania pipiens, commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, has a slim green body with brown spotting and can be found in the United States and Canada (Rana). As frogs are known for their incredible ability to jump, their legs are popularly observed. The independent variable of this experiment is the injection of lack thereof of Lanthanum chloride in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Leopard frogs. The dependent variable is the threshold voltage needed for contraction of the muscle. We hypothesize that if we inject the leg of the Northern Leopard Frog with lanthanum chloride, the threshold voltage for the muscle contraction will be higher. 

Materials and Method:
First we obtained four Rania pipiens legs and placed each in a dissecting dish. Using forceps, the skin was pulled down and off, exposing the leg muscles. The thigh muscle was then separated so that the white sciatic nerve and blood vessels were in sight. The gastrocnemus muscle was then isolated and the nerve was carefully separated from the connective tissue. The leg was consistently moistened with frog Ringer’s solution. We then attached the monitor clips of the myogram to a piece of silver thread. The other end of the thread was placed under the nerve of the gastrocnemus muscle of the controll group’s leg. The leg was suspended using thread and so that it was only lightly grazing the pan. We then used the iworks program and a force transducer to stimulate an electrical impulse creating an action potential that spread through the nerve and to the muscle. We increased the amplitude until the threshold was found. The same process was repeated for the other legs after .1Ml of 1 mM lanthanum chloride was injected into the muscle using a syringe. For the experimental group, the threshold was tested at 8 minutes, 9 minutes, and 10 minutes post injection. A paired T-test was then performed to test the significance of the differences in thresholds.

Results:
The average difference in threshold before and after injection was 0.013 V. A paired T-test found the change in thresholds from pre-injection to not be statistically significently different than that of post-injection (t_stat = 1.5198, d.f. = 3, P = 0.2259). Although the average threshold pre-injection was less than that of the post-injection, the difference was not great enough to be considered significent. The pre-injection data had an average threshold of .057 V ± .088034084 while post-injection data had an average threshold of .063 millivolts ± .019117209.

Discussion:
The legs injected with lanthanum chloride on average needed more stimulus to produce a twitch. However, our hypothesis is not supported as the results cannot be interpreted as valid since the T-test found them to be insignificent. If more trials were run and the results became significent, an explanation for the results would be that the lanthanum chloride inhibited the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since a sufficient amount of calcium does not then spread through the cell, the muscle fiber has a harder time contracting. However, if a great enough action potential is generated, more calcium will overcome the prior shortage until a contraction occurs. This explanation is supported by Debassio et al 1961 which found that as much lanthanum was injected into the Rania pipiens, the necessary threshold increased (Debassio; 1961). An alternate explanation for such results could be that lanthanum chloride blocks acetylcholine, before calcium has the opportunity to be released. Both theories would explain the lack of muscle contraction. However, multiple studies have shown that lanthanum chloride is in fact a calcium blocker.  An important possible error of this experiment was that we could not observe how effectively the lanthanum chloride was spreading throughout the muscle. Since the frog legs have no circulatory systems functioning, the spread of the chemical relied on gravity. This means that the chemical may have not spread properly which may explain the insignificance of the data. The next logical step for this study would be to perform many more trials so that the variability of the spread of the lanthanum chloride is reduced. I would also use new legs as opposed to injecting the same leg with the solution because the muscle fatigue could also be playing a role in the hindering of contraction.  If done properly, this study has the potential of demonstrating the crucial role calcium plays in allowing organisms to move and function in their day-to-day lives.
