Title: Manduca sexta and Azamax Hormone Modulator Investigation

Abstract:
In this study, hornworms (Manduca sexta) were studied to determine if insect hormone regulators such as Azamax would inhibit the growth of insects. This was tested by feeding Azamax to the tested worms while giving food mixed with water to the worms under the controllled conditions and using the T-test to compare our observations, the masses of the food eaten and the masses of the worms. We hypothesized that the worms that consumed the Azamax would weigh less because insect hormone modulators mimic insect hormones that direct the worms to molt. Directing the insects to molt too early can result in inability to reproduce when transitioning to an adult or an unsuccessful molt. We expected the experimented worms to be significently smaller than the controllled worms. Our results supported our hypothesis. The controllled worms weighed from 5-7 grams more than the experimented worms with the exception of an outlier which only weighed 1 gram more than the experimented worm. These results show that the Azamax impeded the growth of the hornworms and they are successful hormone modulators.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as hornworms, are considered pests because they destroy “tomato, potato, pepper, eggplant and tobacco plants” (Planet Natural Research Center, 2017). Pest controll is essential to protect our crops and to prevent contamination of our food supply. Pesticides such as Azamax are used to controll pests to keep them from reproducing and causing more damage because they serve as hormone modulators. By manipulating insect hormones, it can prevent them from molting, which prevents them from transitioning into their adult phase and reproducing.  
This study is being conducted to see if hormone modulators impact the growth development of hornworms. To test this, we will use Azemax as a modulator and observe the development of hornworms. If the modulator does not have an effect on its growth, the insects will continue to molt and can grow up to 10 grams. If it does affect the development, the hornworms will be significently smaller and weigh less. Conducting this study will test the effectiveness of common pesticides.
The diluted Azemax affects the hornworms because hormones such as juvenile hormones or ecdysone allows it to molt depending on the concentration of the hormones during the critical period. An example of this modulator are juvenoids, which are “man-made chemical mimics of the juvenile growth hormones that occur in an insect’s body” (Pinto & Kraft, 2012). 
If the modulator is able to manipulate the hormone levels, it will prevent the insect from molting, therefore, they will grow significently less. We hypothesize that the Azemax modulator will affect the hornworm’s development due to interruption of “synthesis and metabolism of ecdysone and the juvenile hormone” (AzaMax). If the insects transition too soon, they will not be able to reproduce, thus allowing the population of insects to decrease. The modulator can also imitate the hormones to create an unsuccessful molt so the insects are smaller. Knowing that modulators can imitate the hormones and create this change allows us to hypothesize that the modulator will make the experimented on caterpillars grow notably less than the controllled caterpillars. The null hypothesis is that the experimented hornworms will grow just as quickly as the controllled worms, thus showing that hormone modulators have no effect on insects. 
Manduca sexta are used to conduct this experiment because they grow quickly, therefore, they are easy to observe and sufficient data can be gathered from their growth development. We chose to monitor the effects of hormone modulators through feeding the modulators to the worms and observing their growth because it is the most effective way to track whether the pesticide impedes the growth of the hornworms. We used a diluted Azamax solution as a hormone modulator because it is a common pesticide that is easily accessible.


Materials and Method:
The larvae used in this experiment were in their fourth instar. We monitored the growth of 6 hornworms, keeping one controllled and one experimented on caterpillar in each of the plastic containers. First, we ensured that the caterpillars would stay separated by taping index cards down the middle of the plastic container to separate the controllled and experimented caterpillars. Ensure that each side of the container is properly labeled to show which is the controllled and which is being experimented on. This was done for all three containers, as well as numbering each container.  
We then weighed 10 grams of food obtained from "Great Lakes Manduca" for each worm. Next, 4 drops of Azamax were added to the experimented caterpillar’s food and stirred well to ensure the Azamax was equally distributed throughout the food so the caterpillars would eat the Azamax. The solution was diluted to 4Ml of Azamax per 100Ml of water. This was added to the half of the container labeled “E”. Then, 4 drops of water were added to the controllled caterpillar’s food and stirred well before we put it in the half labeled “C”. Each drop of water or Azamax was about 10 μL. These steps were repeated for each of the three containers. Record the masses of the food in a table for each caterpillar. 
Lastly, each caterpillar was weighed using a balance and the masses were recorded in another data table, which showed which caterpillar would be controllled or an experimented on. After each caterpillar was weighed, they were put into their assigned section of the container. Every day the caterpillars and the food were weighed and recorded. The food for each caterpillar was also replaced every day and the new masses were recorded. 
To carry out this experiment, we used the two-sample T-test so we were able to compare the averages of the masses of the controllled caterpillars compared to the masses of the experimented caterpillars.



Results:
P = 0.040225

Figure 1 and Figure 2 portray the average growth of the hornworms throughout the week and the P value represents the significance of the results. The orange line represents the hornworms who did not consume the Azamax and the blue line represents the hornworms who consumed the Azamax. It is clear from figure 1 that the hornworms in the controllled conditions grew significently more than the hornworms who consumed Azamax. The calculated P value is less than 0.05.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that the hormone modulators would impede the growth of the hornworms and they would be significently smaller than the controllled experiments. The null hypothesis was that the Azamax would not affect the hornworms and the experimented on hornworms would grow as quickly as the controllled. The masses of the worms kept in controllled conditions were significently larger than the experimented ones. This shows that the modulators affected the growth development of the worms by disrupting their “synthesis and metabolism of ecdysone and the juvenile hormone” (AzaMax); therefore, they support our hypothesis and we rejected the null hypothesis. The modulators affected the growth development because they imitate insect growth hormones to create an unsuccessful molt for the insects. Therefore, the hornworms grew smaller than the controllled hornworms. Moreover, the calculated P value is 0.040225, which shows that our hypothesis is supported and the results are not due to chance. The third controllled worm not growing significently more than the third experimented worm, so the ratio between them being significently affected by the modulator and not being affected by the modulator was only 2: 1. To improve the study, it would be more beneficial to use more insects for this test to leave room for random errors and outliers such as C3.
