Title: Stimulation of Frog nerves and how they are effected by Ion channel blockers

Abstract:
In our experiment, we measured the myograms of frog legs before and after injecting a leaky Potassium channel blocker. In both our legs we observed a lower v2-v1 for our treatment compared to our controll. This corresponds to a lowered time to reach tetany and a decreased maximal muscle contraction threshold. 

Introduction:
We will be stimulation the leg of a Frog (Rania Pipens) with electrodes and measuring the muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is dependent the the movement of ions such as sodium in and out of a nerve cell with is called an action potential. We believe that by blocking the leaky potassium channels we will continually stimulate the muscle into contraction and tetany at a lower frequency than normal.[1][2] 


Materials and Method:
Prep the Rania Pipens leg by removing the skin, severing the calf ligament and exposing the nerve for stimulation. Insert electrodes for applying the shocks and attach the leg to the myogram recording device. We then stimulated the leg for our controll group and recorded the data. Then we injected 100mmol leaky  potassium channel blocker called tetra ethyl ammonium chloride.[2] 
With an amplitude of 1.5 we changed the frequency by 5Hz and measured and recorded the contractions at every interval. 


Results:
In our first leg the Control reached tetany at 8Hz then after receiving the injection of Tetraethylammonium Chloride it reached tetany at the lower frequency of 7.5 Hz.[3] Its controll v2-v1 was .56v and its treatment v2-v1 was .058v. This shows a significent decrease as compared to the controll. The second leg had a v2-v1 of.408v and a treatment v2-v1 of .336v.[4] This shows a much less significent decrease but still a decrease compared to the controll. 


Discussion:
The potassium channel blocker likely prohibited maximum muscle contraction or at least decreased the extent of the muscle contraction over time. Although this data and decrease could also be explained by fatigue. Follow up experiments are suggested. In the future, it would be best to have multiple frog legs and subject half of them to the controll environment and the other half the treatment. Then measure both and compare the means to determine if our data was truly due to the fatigue the muscle endured
