Title: The Effects of Lidocaine on [Physarum polycephalum] growth

Abstract:
[Physarum polycephalum] is a multinucleate syncytium that lacks a nervous system but is capable of intelligent behaviors such as growing towards favorable environments and away from unfavorable environments. The fungus grows by extending its actin microfilaments. Because sodium ions are known to promote depolymerization of actin filaments and thus inhibit growth, I hypothesized that lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, would inhibit [Physarum polycephalum] growth. An unpaired two tailed two-sample t_test between the average maximum growth of Physarum surrounded by lidocaine and Physarum surrounded by water over the course of 40 hours yielded a p_value of 0.899, and so the hypothesis was not supported. This may be due to the fact that other ions such as potassium can induce G-actin polymerization as sodium ions do. 

Introduction:
[Physarum polycephalum] is a multinucleate organism that remains a unicellular plasmodium as long as it stays in a damp, dark environment [Johnson: 2018]. Slime mold functions as one large cell would and, although it does not have a nervous system, it demonstrates intelligent behaviors. Physarum can sense and move away from unfavorable conditions like sunlight and towards favorable environments and food sources [Mayne: 2015]. Because it has no nervous system, Physarum relies on a complex network of signal transduction pathways to sense external stimuli [Johnson: 2018]. Subsequently, it uses actin microfilaments to grow towards or away from the stimuli depending on whether it is favorable or unfavorable [Johnson: 2018].   [Physarum polycephalum] move and grow by a process called cytoplasmic streaming. The cytoplasm can flow bidrectionally within the slime mold which allows the multicellular fungi to move in different directions. This motility of the cytoplasm is attributable to actin polymerization [van der Honing: 2007]. Actin filaments are composed of G-actin monomers, and the rate of growth of actin depends on the G-actin ATP concentration; a new G-actin monomer can only be added to the actin filament when ATP is bound [Alberts: 2014]. It is known that sodium ions will induce the polymerization of G-actin monomers and, thus, promote growth of actin filaments. Additionally, low ion concentrations can lead to depolymerization of the actin filament [Lodish: 2000]. In this lab, we tested how a sodium channel blocker affects [Physarum polycephalum] growth. The independent variable was the treatment, and the dependent variable was the distance that the Physarum grew over a ring of filter paper soaked in lidocaine or water towards a food source over the course of 40 hours. [Physarum polycephalum] are ideal organisms to use for this experiment because they use a variety of signal transduction pathways that are very similar to the signal transduction pathways that occur in humans, and their growth can be easily quantified. We hypothesized, that Physarum growth would be inhibited by a sodium channel blocker. Lidocaine was used to test this because it is commonly used and known to block sodium channels and prevent the flow of sodium ions [Cummins: 2007].

Materials and Method:
Six water agar plates were obtained, and a 1 cm   1 cm square was cut in the middle of each using sterilized forceps and a spatula. A 1 cm   1 cm piece of Physarum was placed in each of these square wells. Three plates were randoMly assigned to be the controll group. For each of these plates, a 0.5 cm ring of filter paper with an internal diameter of 3 cm was soaked in water and placed around the Physarum. A ring of 8 oats was placed around the outside of the circle of filter paper. Three plates were randoMly assigned to be the experimental group. For each of these plates, a 0.5 cm ring of filter paper with an internal diameter of 3 cm was soaked in 1.25 mM Lidocaine and placed around the square in the center of the plate so that the square was fully encompassed. A ring of 8 oats was placed around the outside of the circle of filter paper. The plates were placed in an incubator set to 37 C  for 40 hours. After 40 hours, we returned to lab and measured the distance between the center of the original location of the Physarum and the farthest edge of the Physarum using a ruler. The average maximum distance that the Physarum in the group surrounded by a ring of filter paper soaked in water was compared to the average distance the physarum in the group surrounded by a full ring of filter paper soaked in lidocaine was compared using an unpaired two-sample t_test with a confidence interval of 95%. 

Results:
As depicted by Figure 1, the average distance the Physarum surrounded by lidocaine grew in 40 hours is similar to the average distance the controll Physarum grew. The experimental group grew an average of 3.733 cm   0.255, and the controll group grew an average of 3.833 cm   1.25. An unpaired two-sample t_test with a confidence interval of 95% indicated that the difference between the two groups was not significent. (p_value= 0.899, t-value= 0.135, d.f. = 4).

Discussion:
The Physarum surrounded by lidocaine did not grow significently less than the Physarum surrounded by water, and so the hypothesis was rejected. The lack of statistically significent results supported the null hypothesis. This may be due to the fact that other ions such as Mg2+ and K+ can induce polymerization of actin filaments and fulfill the role that Na+ ions often play [Lodish: 2000]. Furthermore, literature suggests that [Physarum polycephalum] prefer low sodium concentrations to high sodium concentrations because they need environments with high levels of moisture. High sodium concentrations can transform the slime mold into spherules, which is not an ideal condition for the Physarum [Furuhashi: 2008]. Low sodium levels, on the other hand, do not cause severe problems for the Physarum. Future experiments should be done to test whether increased levels of lidocaine have any sort of impact. It is possible that the Physarum grew over the lidocaine because it did not block enough sodium channels. It may be beneficial to use a higher concentration of lidocaine and soak the entire water agar plate in it, rather than just a strip of filter paper. Additionally, future studies should avoid the use of filter paper. Although Physarum grew over the filter paper, it had as minimal contact with it as possible in both the experimental and the controll group; filter paper may be a confounding variable. This experiment has larger implications because human cells also use actin to initiate movement and growth, and the actin filaments grow by the same mechanism. Additionally, lidocaine is commonly used in clinical settings. In humans, lidocaine is meant to block sodium influx in neurons to prevent action potentials and numb patients [Cummins: 2007]. Had we seen that lidocaine affects actin growth in Physarum, it would have raised questions as to whether lidocaine has unintended effects on actin filaments in cells in addition to its impact on neuronal activity.
