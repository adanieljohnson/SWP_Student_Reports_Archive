Title: Increase in root-shoot length ratio for sand environments on Fagopyrum esculentum 

Abstract:
In the world today, environments constantly undergo changes that alter the landscape and resources that organisms depend on to survive. It is therefore mandatory that these organisms adapt to their new environments, and one organism in particular, the plant, has evolved a process called resource allocation to deal with a new environment. The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of resource allocation by controllling the different soil environments of the plant called Fagopyrum esculentum and measuring the plant’s responses by taking root to shoot weights and root to shoot lengths of the species in the different types of soil. The proposed hypothesis states that in a sand environment, which is nutrient deprived compared to the soil environment, the root to shoot length ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum will be longer than those in the soil environment. The results of the conducted experiment support the hypothesis with the finding of the root lengths in sand being significently longer than those in the soil environment. But there was no significent difference between the root to shoot ratios of plants in the sand environment. It is then concluded that different types of soil, specifically those that are nutrient deprived, cause plants to undergo a process of resource all

Introduction:
 Over time many experimental and observational studies have been performed on the foundation of obtaining new knowledge on how plants adapt to their changing environments. A specific environment is continuously metamorphosing with drastic changes in resources that are vital to a plant’s survival. These studies have proven that plants adapt to their environments by a process called resource allocation. Resource allocation is defined as the relative amount of two resources that can be acquired for a given expenditure of reserve [Bloom Arnold: 1985]. The prior knowledge and the previous experiments conducted supported the backbone of this experiment with the intention of studying how resource allocation performs in different soil environments and what the outcomes are of resource allocation.
	The proposed question is stated as what will be the effects of resource allocation on plants in sand environments in comparison to the effects of resource allocation in soil environments with the studied variable being the ratio of root to shoot lengths. This is an important question to ask because a plethora of information can be obtained from the results of this experiment. The results will help the agricultural industry better learn how to more efficiently grow crops in sandy landscapes to obtain a better harvest season. Also, the data will help scientists predict how future generations of plants such as the Fagopyrum esculentum will respond to new environments, because if the plants die, then they will no longer contribute to providing oxygen that humans need to breathe. 
	The hypothesized predictions of this performed experiment claim that Fagopyrum esculentum will have a greater root to shoot ratio in the nutrient-lacking sand environment in relation to those that are grown the in the soil landscape. This means that the expected outcomes for the data are that the roots will be longer and the shoots will be shorter in the sand environment, because resource allocation is diverting all energy to growing longer roots to obtain more nutrients that allow the Fagopyrum esculentum to survive and thrive in that habitat. 


Materials and Method:
The experiment was performed by means of planting Fagopyrum esculentum in two different types of soil. The first type was the sand, and the second type was the normal soil that was provided. The sand was poured in 3 planter’s bins, which were provided, filling up to the ¾ mark. Then the soil was poured in 3 other planter’s bins up to the ¾ mark. After, approximately 20 seeds were planted in a planter’s bin that was provided. This was done six times, with each time placing 20 seeds in each planter’s bin. After the seeds were planted, the three sand planter bins were filled to the top with sand and the three soil bins were filled to the top with soil. Finally, approximately 20 Ml of liquid fertilizer, which was provided, was poured in each of the six planter bins. After that was complete, the planter’s bins were placed in a tray, and they were brought to the green house. Once they were placed in the greenhouse, the plants were watered daily until water was leaking out underneath each of the planter bins. 

Results:
The resulting data did not support the originally claimed hypothesis of higher ratio of root to shoot length for sand environments when compared to soil environments because the data was not significently different for root to shoot length ratio (Table 1). However, the length of roots in sand was significently different for sand when compared to soil, meaning that the hypothesis was supported in terms of longer root length for sand (Table 1). The graph of root to shoot length ratio is seen below (Figure 1). The trends showed that there were longer root lengths and higher root to shoot length ratios for Fagopyrum esculentum in the sand environment compared to the soil environment (Table 1, Figure 1). The mean and standard deviation for root to shoot length ratio for soil was 0.44±0.065 mm and for sand it was 0.59±0.097 mm. The two-sample t_test for comparing root to shoot length ratio was run at the 95 percent confidence interval and it was calculated to be p=0.097, d.f.=3.46, t=-2.25, and since it is above the 95 percent confidence interval it is not significently different. The mean and standard deviation for root length for soil was 119±7.2 mm and for sand it was 160.7±8.02 mm (Figure 2). The two sample t_test was run at the 95 percent confidence interval and it was calculated to be p=0.0027, d.f.=3.96, t=-6.69, and since it is within the 5 percent it is significently different. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis states that in a sand environment, which is nutrient deprived compared to the soil environment, the root to shoot length ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum will be longer than those in the soil environment. The data did not support the hypothesis for root to shoot length ratio as no significent difference was found, but the length of roots supported the hypothesis in the essence that lengths were longer in the sand environment with the difference being significent. An explanation for why the data was not significently different for the root to shoot length ratios is because the seeds that were used in conducting the experiment were expired and had mold growing on them. Also one of the data points collected for the sand environment was an outlier compared to the other data points, which affected the significance of the data. Some other biological explanations for why the data was not significently different is that the plants in a nutrient lacking landscape do not want to spend resources such as energy and growing more roots when there are no nutrients to obtain. Also, the plants might have decided to reallocate resources to forming cuticles on the leaves to prevent evaporation to save what little nutrients they had. 
	In conclusion the failed significance for root to shoot length ratio can be explained for many reasons, but the data achieved will help in the future to better understand how Fagopyrum esculentum and other plants will respond to their future environments. Other experiments have been conducted on plant resource allocation as well, and their results support a developmentally explicit model of plasticity in biomass allocation in response to limiting resources (Coleman John: 1999). This along with other studies have concluded that resource allocation is crucial to the plant’s survival status in the case of nutrients, because biomass allocation is a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply. This data will help give a better understanding to farmers of how to more efficiently grow crops and how scientists can further prevent the extinction of plants amidst changing environments. Plants are the reason why humans can breathe oxygen and the necessity to keep plants alive in the future is a concern that every scientist has. With this experiment and future experiments, scientists gain more knowledge on how to allow plants to survive and thrive through a better understanding the resource allocation process.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1: Raw data of root and shoot lengths and root to shoot ratios. The table shows that in the sand environment, the lengths and root to shoot ratios are much greater than those in the soil environment. 

Figure 1: Effect of environment on root length mean. The graph shows that Fagopyrum esculentum has longer root lengths in sand environments than in soil environments due to resource allocation. 

Figure 2: Effect of environment on root to shoot length ratio mean.  The root to shoot length ratio is much higher for Fagopyrum esculentum in sand environments than soil environments because plant resource allocation causes the roots to grow longer and the shoots to grow shorter.
