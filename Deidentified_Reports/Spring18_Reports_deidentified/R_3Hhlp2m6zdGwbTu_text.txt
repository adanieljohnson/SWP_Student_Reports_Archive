Title: Effects of Acetylcholine on the Duration of Contraction on Lithobatis pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment is testing the effects of Acetylcholine on the duration of a contraction of a frog leg, testing whether or not the neurotransmitter will cause the duration to be shorter or longer. This experiment was conducted on the frog species, Lithobatis pipiens. During this experiment we injected the frog leg with Ach, then using a computer program, Aquaknowledge, we measured the duration of the contraction. We found that the controll frog legs had an average contraction of 52.05 +/- 7.37 ms and the experimental frog legs had an average duration of 62.9 +/- 11.002 ms. We then ran a paired t_test finding a p value of 0.15 significance and a t value of 1.63 which means that our results were not significently significent and we could not reject our null hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Our experiment studies the process of Neuromuscular controll, focusing on the duration of contraction of frog legs. A muscle contraction is triggered when Ach rushes into the cell and then Ca++ is pumped into the cell causing muscles to contract for longer. Ach is involved in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems and directs muscle movement within the body. According to the 2018 BIO 114 Wake Forest University Lab manual Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that creates muscle contractions. The function of Ach is to bring the cell to a resting potential that will lead to a muscle contraction. The AChE is an inhibitor that allows the Ach to build up in the synapse thus overstimulating the receptors. Once these receptors are overstimulated this will cause the frog leg to go into a state known as Tetanus. This state is the maximal contraction of the frog’s muscle caused from the overstimulation of Ach. A study done by Michael Fulton in 2001 looked at muscle fatigue and the overstimulation of muscles (Fulton, 2001). Fulton’s study examined the effects of Organophosphorus insecticides, OP, which cause similar effects to the Ach. Ach increases duration where as OP works to inhibit enzymes but both focus on the duration of the contraction. The OP functions by inhibiting certain enzymes in the nervous system causing prolonged contractions leading to muscle fatigue. This experiment was performed on estuarine fish and found that when the OP was injected the contractions increased in duration. Fulton’s experiment looked at how the amplitude and duration would be effected by the injection of OP. Based on previous studies and our knowledge of muscles and action potentials we hypothesize that the injection of Ach will cause a longer duration of contractions in the frog legs. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment we used Lithobatis pipiens that were farmed by Wake Forest University’s Biology department. We used 4 frog legs that were obtained and dissected on the pan. The top layer of the frog skin was taken off where the two thigh muscles were exposed. We then cut the gastrocnemus, with part of the Achilles tendon. We then tied the Achilles to the string and then to the force transductor. We identified the sciatic nerve and placed the metal strings hooked up to the machine over the nerve in order to elicit a muscle twitch. Using 4 pins we stabilized the frog into place. Throughout the experiment we used ringer’s solution to maintain the pH within the frog’s leg. For the controll data we recorded the lengths of four different contractions waiting one minute in between to allow the muscle to rest. For the experimental data we injected the frogs with .1Ml of the Ach into the top of the muscle, recording the lengths of four contractions for each leg. Using the computer program AquaKnowledge we were able to record the lengths of each contraction tested which we then used to run a paired t_test. Obtaining this data gave us a p_value and t value. 

Results:
After injecting the Ach into the frog leg we found that it significently increased the duration of the contraction. On average, the controll group had a duration of 52.05 +/- 7.37 ms while the experimental had an average duration of 62.9 +/- 11.002 ms. We performed a paired t test and found a p value of 0.15 significance and a t value of 1.63. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our findings as our p value was 0.15 therefore we failed to reject the null. By the end of the experiment we were able to observe quantifiable results of how the Ach impacts the duration of contractions of frog legs. When there is an increase of the Ach the contraction lasts longer because there is an increase of Ca++, allowing the receptors to remain open for longer. A study published in 1971 by Duchen also looked at the effects of Ach on muscle contraction (Duchen, 1997). Duchen focused on mice with a hereditary disease, motor-end plate disease, and found that their muscles were giving weak responses to nerve stimulation but when Ach was injected the muscles were supersensitive. His findings support the theory that some muscle fibers can become functionally denervated, but with the injection of Ach, the muscles are temporarily stimulated due to the rapid increase of Ca++. This could lead to future research focusing on the AChE inhibitor instead of Ach. It would also be interesting for future research to see if injecting Ach into different animals has similar reactions to the frogs. For future research it would be important to use a larger number of frog legs to make the research more reliable. We also noticed that the frog legs differed drastically in their first initial contraction, showing that each frog had significent differences in their strength. It would be beneficial in future research to make sure that the frogs have similar diet, strength, and exercise amount so that the experiment can be more controllled and yield more accurate results.

Figure #1. Effect of Ach on duration of contractions in frog legs. Control frog legs (blue bars) not injected with Ach have a lower average weight. The experimental frog legs (orange bars) have a higher average weight. 4 Lithobatis pipiens were placed in each group, and the experimental caterpillars were injected with .1Ml of Ach before the contraction. The contractions were measured using AquaKnowledge every minute for 2 trials.
