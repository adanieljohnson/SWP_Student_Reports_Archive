Title: The Effect on Wieght of Manduca sexta While Consuming Precor 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to observe the effects of Precor, an artificial hormone that inhibits pupation, that imitates the function of the Juvenile hormone, on the weights of Manduca sexta. There were two groups of Manduca sexta that were observed, one was a control group that consumed caterpillar food, and the treatment group consumed caterpillar food with a dosage of Precor. They were observed for 7 days and were kept at a constant temperature. Our group hypothesized After a t-test, the P value was 0.552, meaning that the weight differences between both groups were not significant. 

Introduction:
Hormones regulate the development of plants and animals. Today’s observations will take into account the development of the Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta have been used since the 1960s due to it being a prime model to gaining the understanding of physiological and hormonal controls that regulate molting and metamorphosis.(Kingsolver 2007). They typically have five larval instars before molting commences. A hormone known as Juvenile Hormone or JH, regulates the growth of the Manduca sexta in determining whether it is going to be a larvae or if it will metamorphosize. Insect growth regulators affect the overall physiological processes that are vital in the development of the insect and its offspring. We will be introducing an IGR, insect growth regulator, known as Precor, into the food of a small population of Manduca sexta, and it will mimic the function of the JH hormone. As a group we hypothesize that the Manduca sexta group with Precor added to their diet will have a significant increase in weight compared to the control group, which does not have Precor. The Precor inhibits the pupation of the Manduca sexta, causing it to remain in the instar phase. This can be inferred due to previous research that states that if JH levels are low, pupation will commence. (Kingsolver, 2007)  



Materials and Methods:
While wearing latex-free vinyl gloves, eight Manduca sexta were placed in a weigh boat, each one was weighed individually in grams on a scale. Each Manduca sexta’s weight was recorded. Four Manduca sexta’s were randomly separated from the other four. One was the control group, the other was the treatment group. The control group of four Manduca sexta were then divided into subgroups of two placed into a plastic container with a divider, separating one side from the other. One Manduca sexta was placed on each side of the divider. This was done for both the control and treatment group. Setting the Manduca sexta aside, 80 grams of caterpillar food were collected. The 80 grams were divided into two groups, 40 grams each. In a separate container, 40 grams of caterpillar food was prepared for the control group, by adding 20 drops of distilled water. This was mixed thoroughly with a spoon until the water was no longer visible. The other 40 grams were placed in another plastic container but 20 drops of Precor were added and thoroughly mixed until Precor was no longer visible. Each Manduca sexta was given 10 grams of their respective food. They were then placed in a refrigerator for seven days. Everyday their weights were recorded. Food was replaced once it appeared that it had dried out throughout the week. To calculate the mean, and other statistical data by doing a two-sample t-test.


Results:
From observations, the treated Manduca sexta had a slightly higher mean than the control group. The Manduca sexta that weighed the most consistently throughout the experiment was in the treatment group as seen in figure 1. From the 2 sample t-test with equal variance, resulting in the P value being 0.552, due to the P value being higher than 0.05, it is not significant.


Discussion:
The treatment group on average had a higher amount of Precor present in their diet, therefore inhibiting pupation.(Kingsolver 2007). The Precor mimicked the effects of the Juvenile Hormone (JH), causing them to consistently gain weight without going into their next stage of metamorphosis. Their weight gain was observable physically.  We accept the null hypothesis because there was no significant change in weight between the control and treatment according to research Kingsolver which states that presence of JH will inhibit further pupation of the Manduca sexta, causing them to continue gain weight and grow .
