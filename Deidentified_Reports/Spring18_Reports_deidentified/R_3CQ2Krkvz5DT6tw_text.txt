Title: The Effect on Levels of Salinity on the Percent Change of Absorbance in Time of Both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica

Abstract:
The question the experimenters wished to answer was whether or not high salinity would have an effect on rate of photosynthesis in both Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica chloroplasts. The chloroplasts are isolated using centrifuging techniques, and then reacted with a specific reaction buffer to allow photosynthesis to take place. DCPIP is also used in the experiment so that it will turn from blue to clear as photosynthesis allows it to be reduced. This is measured using absorption to track the change in color as a way to mark photosynthetic activity. The results did not show any significance, but the kale appeared to prefer the high sodium concentration, but not quite to the degree of significance. A further study that would be beneficial with the growing amounts of salinity in the soil due to human causes would be to look at Kale growing in sodium to see if it has the same effects.

Introduction:
Different organisms are able to acquire energy in different forms. In plant species, the main form of energy consumption is through photosynthesis which takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. The chloroplasts use solar energy as well as nutrients from their surroundings to create glucose, a major form of energy for other species of animals that use plants as a form of food. This process also fixes carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. The act of carbon fixation is something that has been frequently studied in science, especially when looking at the environment and human effects on the O-zone. Plants are some of the largest carbon sinks in the natural world, which means they are actively taking carbon out of the atmosphere as other sources, such as cars and planes, and putting these “Greenhouse Gases” into the environment.
	The ability of plants to photosynthesize is important in order for humans to be able to live the lifestyle society has become accustomed to, but there are many factors that can alter the rate of photosynthesis. One of the new issues revolves around the problems with high salt concentrations that are becoming common in soil. Salinity in the environment can cause cells to become hypotonic, meaning they start to shrink in size because of the diffusion of water and make the cell perform with less effectiveness [Rasmuson & Anderson: 2002]. It not only effects plants at the cellular level, but also the overall health of the plant structure. Studies show the increased levels of salinity can shrink roots, meaning less nutrients can be absorbed up into the plant, and also decreases the overall leaf number and size on the plant [Amira & Qados: 2011; Salt Tolerance of Plants]. The effects of salinity on the rate of plant photosynthesis is something that has become increasingly important as more agricultural land has been irrigated with water that has a much higher salinity because of a shift to using low-quality water in irrigation. The rise in salinity is shown to reduce the productivity of agricultural crops, including vegetables [Machado & Serralheiro: 2017].
	In a hill reaction study on chloroplasts, it was found that the salinity would be not cause effects between 0.08-0.8M, and that the optimal amount would be 5mM of sodium [Campbell & Pitman: 1971]. Knowing that salinity is a factor in the productivity of vegetables, it would be beneficial for scientists to understand the effects of salt concentration on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach and kale. These are common crops used in many meals, and in the case of spinach there are other research being done about the effects of salinity. To measure salinity, DCPIP will be added to the hill reaction because it turns from blue to clear as it is reduced as photosynthesis is completed. With this knowledge, if salinity is high, the rate of change in the hill reaction will be low.


Materials and Method:
Pack a mortar and pestle, 2 medium sized beakers, and 6 50Ml centrifuge tubes into ice. First, the chloroplasts needed to be isolated from the other organic materials, so with a mortar and pestle, crush up four large spinach leaves after their large veins have been removed, adding 10Ml of cold grinding buffer. After that is a thick paste, add 10Ml of cold grinding buffer again and mix, then strain into a beaker through three layers of cheesecloth, and pour the strained liquid in a centrifuge tube to be centrifuged at 200 X G for 10 minutes. Then pour the liquid of that centrifuged tube into a second and care was taken to not have the solid at the bottom in the next tube. This tube was centrifuged at 1,000 X G for 10 minutes, and the liquid was poured out, leaving the pellet at the bottom of the tube. The pelleted contained the most chloroplasts, so it was re-suspended using 20Ml of cold grinding buffer. This was all repeated with Kale as well.
	Next, the hill reaction needed to be completed, so test tubes were compared in the following manner:

Once these are all made for both the Kale and the Spinach, the 100ul of chloroplasts were added and the test tubes were mixed. The absorbance was measured for time 0 and recorded. After 5 minutes, the absorbance was measured again, and then again after 15 minutes and the percent change was calculated.


Results:
For spinach, none of the paired T-tests run were found to have significance. The 10mM salinity showed an incline at 5 minutes, but then a steady decline over the next 10, but was still not significent. The 50mM salinity percent change showed a bit more variability in its values over the 15 minutes, but still did not show significance between the controll (t=0.286, p=0.785). The 800mM dropped at the five-minute mark, but then showed a sharp incline to match the percent change of the 10mM salinity at a value of about 34%. It still did not show a significent difference (t=1.124, p=0.27).

For kale, the 10mM salinity showed no significent difference (t=0.460, p=0.661). In the case of 50mM salinity, there are a point where the percent change went down, but the significent difference was not there, but it was very close and within 0.02 (t=1.769, p=0.07). The 800mM salinity percent change did take a major decrease at the 5-minute, but it was followed be a clear incline to the 15-minute mark when the experiment ended. For this as well there was no significent difference (t=0.614, p=0.561).


Discussion:
The results of this experiment for spinach shows that while it is not significent, in the end there is a slight decrease after the 15-minute point. Since it is not significently significent in the difference between the controll, the results cannot support the hypothesis. In the case of the kale, there is no evidence that the salinity lowered the effectiveness of the chloroplast, but in fact appears to have made the percent change higher. This was also not found to be significent so it can also not refute the original hypothesis that the high salinity would lower the percent change in the hill reaction. The data overall is inconclusive since the spinach supports the null hypothesis, but spinach seems to refute the hypothesis since there was shown to have an increase, but there is also no significance in the percent change, so that is also inconclusive.
When looking at the research, it is possible that the spinach was still able to function in high salinity. There are some research findings that suggest that salinity does not affect photosynthetic activity, but other parts of the process [Salt Tolerance of Plants]. While this is not the case in all the research, it should be mentioned as a reason why the spinach would not support the findings. 
	Possible causes of error in this experiment would be human error in measurements. It is possible that some of the measurements were not all constant throughout the experiment. It is also possible that the amount of time it took to get through all the absorbance measurements at each time would skew data since we always started from the controll and worked through to the 800mM test tubes, meaning that the times would not be the same depending on how fast the measurements were taken. While this would not fully explain, the insignificent data found, it could explain parts of what has been observed in the percent changes.
	The importance of testing salinity on crops is the growing levels in the soil of the agricultural lands. Cells do not generally perform well in these environments because an increase in sodium puts more osmotic stress on the cells in the plant, making it harder for them to perform optimally [Rasmuson KE, Anderson JE. 2002]. A good follow up study to this one would be to grow the kale, which performed better, in soil with a high sodium to see if it increases its carbon fixation and has a higher percent change as the DCPIP is reduced and turns colorless. If the kale does perform well in the sodium environment, then it could mean that if would be a good product to use in agricultural lands that no longer allow for optimal growth of other plants. In a time when some plants can no longer grow in their natural habitat like is the case in some areas of the world it would be beneficial to know of plants that can still use that high salinity area [Amira & Qados: 2011].
