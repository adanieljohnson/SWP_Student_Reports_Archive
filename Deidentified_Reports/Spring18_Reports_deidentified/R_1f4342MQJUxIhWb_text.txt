Title: Resource allocation of Vigna radiata does not change significantly under different light wavelengths

Abstract:
This experiment was created to study the effects of differing light wavelengths on the resource allocation of Vigna radiata. This was done by placing a blue light filter over one set of plants and a clear light filter over the other set, watering them daily for 14 days and measuring their root to shoot mass ratio. Because white light contains the full spectrum of red, blue and white light, it was predicted the leaves under white light would grow taller while the plants under blue light would have a larger root to shoot ratio. Our hypothesis was not supported by this data; our two-tailed t test did not show a significant difference in the root to shoot ratio between the two groups. 

Introduction:
Plants allocate their resources differently according to their surrounding conditions in order to maintain homeostasis. This experiment will examine the growth of the roots and shoots of plants in response to two different light conditions: a group placed under blue light and one placed under white light. Blue light, which lacks red wavelengths, should cause the plant to allocate more resources to the roots whereas under white light resources will be allocated to the leaves as they are able to obtain wavelengths from the full color spectrum. Photosynthesis is the most stimulated under white light as far-red light induces quicker opening of  photosystem II reaction centers [Zhen & van Iersel: 2017]. For these reasons, we expect that plants will grow taller under white light while more resources will be allocated to the roots under blue light. After a week, the root to shoot ratio of the plants was analyzed. It was hypothesized that plant growth under white light will have a lower root to shoot ratio than under blue light. This is because white light contains the full spectrum of colors: red and blue light wavelengths are the main energy sources for processing of CO2 which occurs during photosynthesis [Lin et al.: 2013].

Materials and Methods:
Approximately 30 mung beans were placed in each of 6 small soil pots. 50 mL Miracle-Gro was  added to each plant. 3 plants were specified and labeled for each experimental group. 3 groups of approximately 20 plants were placed in a tub and a tent structure was constructed using 4 poles and a blue light filter. This process was repeated with the other 3 groups plants and the clear light filter. All 6 plants were placed in the greenhouse for 14 days. Each plant was watered once daily for 10 seconds on a mist setting. 3 groups of 4 plants were extracted from each plant. The roots of each group were then separated from the shoots using scissors and the lengths and masses of roots was recorded for each plant. This was subtracted from the masses of shoots to acquire the masses of the shoots. A two-tailed t test was used to compare the average root to shoot ratios of the group under blue light with the group under clear light.

Results:
The average root to shoot ratio for the plants under clear light was 0.386 ± 0.073 while the average root to shoot ratio for plants under blue light was 0.474 ± 0.118 [Figure 1]. The average masses of each pot did not vary significantly according to light color [Figure 2]. According to a two-tailed t test assuming equal variances performed, there was not a significant difference in the root to shoot ratios for the plants under blue light when compared with the plants under clear light (t-stat = -1.08, df = 4, P = 0.340) [Figure 1]. 

Discussion:
Our results did not show a significant difference between the root to shoot ratio of plants grown under blue light versus those under clear light. Our hypothesis was not supported by this data; the differences between the values was not found to be significant according to the statistical test because the p value found was greater than 0.05 [Figure 1]. 
White light is predominantly used in greenhouses to grow plants most effectively. In an experiment performed on lettuce plants, white light was shown to be most beneficial for the accumulation of sugars [Lin et al.: 2013]. Because photosynthesis, the process of acquiring sugars, occurs in the leaves, the leaves are expected to grow taller under white light. Blue light lacks far-red wavelengths, which reduce the diffusion of light as heat [Zhen & van Iersel: 2017]. This means that plants grown under blue light may not absorb light as efficiently. This experiment and similar ones could help determine what wavelength of light is ideal for maximum leaf or root growth in an agricultural setting.
