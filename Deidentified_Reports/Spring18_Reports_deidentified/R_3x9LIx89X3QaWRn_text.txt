Title: The Effects of Martin's IGR on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta is a pest that is easily affected by hormone levels. They are easily studied as they have distinct stages of growth and certain hormones that directly affect growth. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone levels affect the development of this species. In this experiment, we placed four caterpillars in a controll group, feeding them each 10 g of food with 3 drops of water added, and four caterpillars in a treatment group, feeding them each 10 g of food with 3 drops of Martin’s IGR. We compared the weight and length between controll groups and treatment groups every day for seven days and observed how Martin’s IGR affected their growth. After analyzing the data collected, our hypothesis is rejected which stated that adding Martin’s IGR to the Manduca Sexta’s diet would not allow the caterpillars to molt and would cause them to enter a 6th instar, or a supernumerary nymph. As two of our caterpillars, one from the treatment and one from the controll group molted and were about to begin to pupate, our hypothesis is rejected. Due to a variation of starting sizes of the caterpillars and a time restraint, no data was able to provide a clear enough conclusion. 


Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is a moth of the family Shingdae present throughout the American continent. These pests have an important model system for understanding the physiological controll of growth. This species goes through four major stages of growth throughout their lives. They begin as eggs where they will stay for 2 days then they enter the larva stage where they continue to grow through 5 larva instars. Then the species will begin to molt and enter the pupa stages and then finally become an adult moth. This whole growth cycle lasts about 39-48 days. Two hormones are essential for the growth of the Manduca Sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In order to pupate, Manduca Sexta must molt and go through a commitment pulse. The commitment pulse occurs when the caterpillar is large enough and has stored enough nutrients to pupate. At the commitment pulse, ecdysterone levels will drastically rise, as it is a necessary hormone for molting. Juvenile hormone will begin to fall after the fourth instar and continue to decline during the fifth instar. This drop in juvenile hormone is necessary as it allows for the caterpillar to successfully molt and grow. Juvenile hormones helps regulate the type of molting the Manduca Sexta will do, and the levels of this hormone present will determine whether the caterpillar can enter the pupate stage. 
In this experiment, amounts of juvenile hormone were altered with the use of an insect growth regulator, Martin’s IGR. “…Most currently known IGRs can are either chitin synthesis inhibitors (which disrupt cuticle formation), or substances that either interfere with or over-activate processes regulated by the insect hormones (i.e. JHs, ecdyteroids) (Tunaz: 2004). The IGR used in our experiment was an over-activate processes IGR in order to over-activate and mimic the purpose of juvenile hormone. Martin’s IGR will interfere with the corpus allotum, which is responsible for releasing juvenile hormone. Martin’s IGR will act on the corpus allotum to essentially mimic juvenile hormone in the caterpillars. The independent variable is the diet that the groups of caterpillars were given and the dependent variable is the size and length of the caterpillars after digesting their diet. Our hypothesis states that increasing the amounts of juvenile hormone with Martin’s IGR at the onset of the 5th larval instar growth will be disrupted and a 6th larval instar will come forth, instead of the commitment pulse to pupation, and this is known as the supernumerary nymph. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were selected, each caterpillar was around the fourth and fifth larva instar. All caterpillars weighed 2.6-3.9 g and were separated into two groups with four caterpillars in each group. The groups were a controll group and a treatment group. The controll group’s diet consisted of regular food with water added and the treatment group’s diet consisted of regular food with Martin’s IGR added. Each caterpillar in the controll group received 10 g of food with 3 drops of water, and each caterpillar in the treatment group received 10 g of food with 3 drops of Martin’s IGR added. The caterpillars were kept in closed containers with small holes on the lids and kept in an incubator at 23 °C, in 12 hours of darkness and 12 hours of light. Every day for seven days, the caterpillars weight and length was recorded, as well as obvious changes to appearance.


Results:
Both groups were similar sizes and weights near the beginning and end of the experiment, both increasing their weight from day 1. Around day 4 and 5 weights and lengths of the caterpillars began to decrease after reaching a peak.

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment our hypothesis is rejected. Our hypothesis was that adding Martin’s IGR to the Manduca Sexta diet will lead to a 6th instar and not allow the caterpillars to pupate. This is rejected because one of the treatment caterpillars and one of the controll caterpillars molted and were going to begin to pupate. As well the caterpillars from both groups were similar in weight and length. Ultimately, it was hard to gather eight caterpillars from the exact same stage and being the exact same size that may have affected our varying results. Most of our caterpillars were very large and possibly could have already entered the fifth larval instar. If this was the case, three drops of Martin’s IGR per 10 g of food would not be enough to stop the caterpillar from molting. Due to the time restraint and our varying results, an accurate conclusion was unable to be made about the effects of Martin’s on an entering 5th instar Manduca Sexta.
