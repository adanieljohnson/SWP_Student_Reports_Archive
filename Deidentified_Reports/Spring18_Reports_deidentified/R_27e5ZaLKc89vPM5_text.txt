Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Photosynthetic Rate of Spinach

Abstract:
The object of the experiment is to accurately determine the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of a saline solution. The hypothesis of the experiment is that if there is a saline concentration present in the solution, then water will leave the chloroplasts as the cell will shrink, therefore reducing the rate of photosynthesis. The organism used for this experiment was spinach. The reason that we use spinach as our model organism is because it is rich in chloroplasts. The method used for determining the rate of photosynthesis was measuring the percent change in absorbance for the chloroplasts exposed to the varying saline concentrations. This experiment was done by making an enriched chloroplast preparation from spinach leaves using a centrifuge. Then the Hill reaction buffer will be used along with differing concentrations of saline in order to conclude if there is an effect on the rate of photosynthesis. The data collected was the absorbance of the samples taken over the course of thirty minutes at ten minute intervals. After the experiment was carried out, it appeared that the absorbance of the samples exposed to the saline conditions in fact, slightly increased contrary to what was predicted. Something that can be taken away from the course of the investigation is that the

Introduction:
Plants capture energy from sunlight and convert it to chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. This is important for glucose production in the plants and the oxygen animals breathe. If a salt concentration is present in the chloroplast solution, then the water that is inside of the cell will escape because the solution is hypertonic. The water will travel across the membrane in order to balance the concentration of salt on the outside of the cell with the salt inside of the cell. This process is called osmosis. DCPIP is a blue dye that acts like electron receptor. Once it has been reduced, the dye is no longer blue but colorless. The reason that we use DCPIP is because it allows the reducing agents in chloroplasts to be detected. The hypothesis of the experiment is that if there is a saline concentration present in the solution, then water will leave the chloroplasts as the cell will shrink, therefore reducing the rate of photosynthesis. The independent variable of the study is the concentration of saline concentration while the dependent variable of the study was the absorbance.


Materials and Methods:
The first step in the procedure was to create a “pellet” of chloroplasts after centrifuging. This was done by taking four medium sized spinach leaves and grinding them with a mortar and pestle and 10 mL of grinding buffer. Another 10 mL of grinding buffer is added to make the grinding easier once the bulk of it is done. After grinding, the solution was then poured into a beaker. A three layered cheesecloth was used to filter out the solid part of the mixture. This solution was then put into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at four degrees Celsius for three minutes at 200 x G. The supernatant from this was put into another centrifuge tube and spun in the centrifuge at four degrees Celsius for ten minutes at 1000 x G. The next step in the experiment was to prepare a chloroplast solution. The supernatant from the second centrifuge step is disposed. The “pellet” that is at the bottom of this centrifuge was suspended with an addition of 20 mL of the grinding buffer. The “pellet” solution was added to a centrifuge tube and put on ice. The next step of the lab called for the preparation of solutions. Test tubes were labeled 0-12. The first test tube is a blank with 8 mL of water and 2 mL of Hill reaction buffer. Test tubes 1-3 and 4-6 are filled with 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM of DCPIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Test tubes 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12 all contain 100 µL of enriched chloroplasts. Test tubes 7-9 and 10-12 are filled with 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM of DCPIP, 2 mL of Hill reaction buffer, and 1 mL of their respective concentrated saline solution. Test tubes 7-9 contained 50 mM saline solution, and test tubes 10-12 contained 100 mM saline solution. Each mixture was transferred to a cuvette in order to read the absorbance using a spectrophotometer. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm. An initial reading was taken of each of the mixtures. The cuvettes sat under a lamp for a total of thirty minutes with ten minute intervals to take the readings. After the readings were taken and the values were recorded, the percent change of absorbance was recorded for all of the mixtures over all of the times. From these values, an average was calculated in order to analyze and use it for the results. The statistical test used was an ANOVA test. The positive control in this experiment was the solution prepared with chloroplasts and a 0% salt concentration. A negative control in this experiment was the solutions prepared with no chloroplasts and a 0 mM salt concentration. Other negative controls include solutions prepared with chloroplasts and a 0 mM, 50 mM, and 100mM salt concentration. 


Results:
Saline and non-saline mixtures were made in order to compare the photosynthetic rates in each of the samples. The values of the average percent change in concentration from the raw data was taken and used in an ANOVA test. The result from this test gave a p-value of 0.584. This was done to determine if salinity has an effect on the rate of photosynthesis. 


Discussion:
To conclude, the hypothesis was not supported, but the null hypothesis was supported by the data collected. An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was conducted and the p-value was 0.584 which tells us that the data is not significant since the p-value is greater than 0.05. Some improvements to this study would be to increase the time of exposure to the conditions or to increase the sodium concentration. Initially, 50 mM and 100 mM concentrations were used because there was a study that found that salt does have an effect on photosynthetic rates, and these were the concentrations that were used (Critchley, 1984). The reason that this experiment is important is because photosynthesis is an important process in the world. It is imperative that the process is understood and see how it can be effected by factors such as saline concentration. After the experiment was carried out, it appeared that the absorbance of the samples exposed to the saline conditions in fact, slightly increased contrary to what was predicted. The reason for this maybe was because the chloroplasts did not have enough time to experience salt stress within the timeframe of the experiment. Salt stress is dependent on the species of plant one is working with, and it can vary in terms of the conditions the experiment is subject to (Chaves, 2009). The spinach chloroplasts that we worked with may have just been tolerant of the concentration of sodium present in the solution. Another explanation for this may be that thirty minutes was not enough time to observe a significant change in photosynthetic rates. For further testing, it would be interesting to see if this experiment could be reworked by either increasing the sodium concentration or by increasing the time of exposure to these conditions before reading the absorbance.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The percent change in absorbance from the chloroplast solutions were calculated. From there, the average of these percent changes of absorbance was taken and put into this figure. There were four points at which the data was collected: initial, after 10, after 20, and after 30 minutes.
