Title: How Precor Affects the Growth of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This study’s main objective is to detect if Precor affects the weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. As an IGR, specifically the methoprene in Precor, keeps the insect from growing through the metamorphosis stages to stop infestations. The alternate hypothesis is that if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor in their food, then their weight will differ from those not exposed to Precor. The treatment group consisting of four caterpillars was given ten grams food with no Precor while the controll group consisting of four caterpillars was given ten grams of food with five drops of Precor. Each caterpillar was weighed every day and then the average of each day for the controll and treatment groups was recorded. There was no statistical significance between the controll group and the treatment group, so the alternate hypothesis was rejected. However, there was a mistake in the process of the experiment in which the caterpillars were never given fresh food, so they began to starve. Therefore, the effect of Precor on the caterpillars could not be analyzed properly and the experiment would need to be done properly by giving the caterpillars fresh food every day. 

Introduction:
Precor is an IGR, which is an Insect Growth Regulator. Precor is used to prevent the insect from reaching its adult stages by targeting its larval stage, as is the purpose of an IGR (Csondes, 2004). The main ingredient of Precor is methoprene (Csondes, 2004). Methoprene is the chemical that halts the growth of the insect before it reaches its adult stage (Csondes, 2004). The insects would not be killed by Precor because it is not toxic to insects (Csondes, 2004). Precor works at its best when it is sprayed prior to the infestation of pests (Cilek, 1987). This IGR is used in indoor environments to specifically prevent flea infestations (Cilek, 1987). However, in this experiment Precor will be used in attempt to see its effect on Manduca sexta caterpillars. Our objective is to find out if the amount of Precor solution mixed with the food of the caterpillars will affect the growth and subsequently the size of the caterpillars. Will the amount of Precor solution mixed in with the food affect the weight of the caterpillars? The dependent variable is the amount of Precor solution mixed into the food and the independent variable is the weight of the caterpillars. The Biological Null hypothesis for this experiment is if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor in their food, then their weight will not be affected. The Biological Alternate Hypothesis is if the caterpillars are exposed to Precor, then their weight will differ from those not exposed to Precor in their food. The Statistical Null hypothesis is that there is no statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to Precor in their food will be affected. The Statistical Alternate hypothesis is that there is statistical significance that the weight of the caterpillars exposed to Precor in their food will differ from the weight of those not exposed to Precor. 

Materials and Method:
The experiment began by separating eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups of four. One group of caterpillars was the controll group and the other group was the treatment group. There were two caterpillars in each container with a perforated top. The two caterpillars were separated by an index card. The treatment group was separated in the same way. Each caterpillar in the controll group received ten grams of food with five drops of distilled water and no Precor mixed in by using a pipet. The treatment group received ten grams of food but their food was mixed with five drops of Precor by using a pipet. The four containers then were placed into an incubator. Every day for seven days at 1:00 pm the caterpillars were weighed by using a weigh boat and a scale. Each weight was recorded. At the end of the experiment, the weights of the controll group on each day were averaged as well as the weights of the treatment group. The data will be analyzed using the two- tailed t_test. The t_test will be applied to the mean changes in weight for each caterpillar. The results of the two-tailed t_test will determine the affectedness of Precor as an IGR.

Results:
As observed in Fig. 1, the controll group experienced a greater average change in weight over the seven day trial. The error bars mostly overlapping show that there is most likely no statistical significance between the controll and treatment group (Fig. 1). The two-tailed t_test was applied to the difference of weight between Day 7 and Day 1 for each caterpillar in the Control and Treatment groups. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.407, d.f. = 6, P = 0.698). Because there was no statistical significance, the alternate hypothesis was rejected while the null hypothesis was accepted. 

Discussion:
As explained in "Trends in Development of Insect Growth Regulators in Plant Protection" by Sukh Dev, the caterpillars that were fed Precor should have experienced a greater decrease in weight between Day 1 and Day 7 because the Precor, as an IGR, would have inhibited the growth and therefore the weight of the caterpillars (Dev, 1986). Late larvae should have been affected by the methoprene in Precor, and subsequently their metamorphosis hindered (Oswaldo, 2005). As shown in the results, the controll group experienced a greater mean change in weight than the treatment group with Precor in the food. However, there is no statistical significance shown between the controll and treatment groups. Therefore, Precor was not successful as an IGR and would not be effective in pest controll because it did not inhibit the growth of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars. 
However, there was human error that affected the results as a whole. Every day the caterpillars were weighed the food was not refreshed. Towards the end of the seven days there was no food left, so it is impossible to see if Precor affected the caterpillar’s weight or not. If we refreshed the food every day with giving the controll group regular food and giving the treatment group the food with Precor, we would be able to see if the Precor changed their weight or not compared to the controll group. In order to genuinely test the hypothesis, we would have needed to give the caterpillars fresh food every day. The next step is to modify the experiment and repeat it by making fresh food every day with and without Precor for the treatment and controll groups.
