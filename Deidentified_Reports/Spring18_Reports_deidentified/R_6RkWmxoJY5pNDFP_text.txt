Title: Chemical Signaling via Hormones 

Abstract:
For this experiment, our objective was to determine if very small amounts of Juvenile Hormone added to the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars would have an influence on the pupation and maturation. We hypothesized that the larval pupation would be delayed in the group of caterpillars with the JH added when compared to a controll group that was not fed a diet with any JH. The background for this experiment included the knowledge of hormones serve as signals as well as the purpose of JH to prevent the pupation in the m. sexta caterpillars. This experiment obtained data from 8 caterpillars that were weighed and measured every day for a week. 4 of these caterpillars were fed a normal diet and 4 were fed a supplement to their normal diet of Precor (JH). Our hypothesis was supported in this experiment. It was seen that the caterpillars of the treatment group resembled those in lower stages of maturation while the controll group showed visual signs of progression. The treatment group was also, on average, larger and heavier than the controll group. The P values from the t_test we ran suggested that the development of the findings by chance were unlikely and that it was most likely due to the addition of JH in the treatment group's diet. 

Introduction:
Hormones serve as signals that can trigger and controll many things in all organisms. They are released from a cell or gland into the bloodstream and reach a target. Most commonly, hormones controll change and growth. This can be seen in humans with puberty, where the hormones involved trigger change and growth from childhood to adulthood. In Manduca sexta caterpillars, Juvenile Hormone is a hormone that inhibits the progression into adulthood by delaying the pupation. It is explained in one study as "JHs are status-quo hormones that maintain the insect in its current form as the insect is responding to the molting surge of ecdysone," (Truman). For our experiment, we decided to test the effects on the amount of JH given, to see if only a small amount JH would still cause a delay in pupation. We will have a controll group which is fed a normal diet, a treatment group which will be fed a small amount of JH (12 drops per 40 grams of food) to see if this will still delay the pupation. We hypothesize that the addition of 3 drops of JH in the caterpillar's diet will cause a delay in larval pupation in the m. sexta caterpillar. 

Materials and Method:
Firstly, we obtained 8 caterpillars and divided them into two groups, the controll and treatment. Next, we weighed and measured the intimal lengths and weights of the caterpillars and placed them into their own separate rearing tubes. We made these containers by placing an index card down the middle to make two sides in the circular container. We labeld these containers wirh our initials, lab group, and caterpillar number. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets one being the controll, no JH added, and the other being the treatment, 3 drops of JH in the form of Precor (1: 1250 dilution/concentration) added to 40 grams of a normal diet. 10 grams of food was given to each caterpillar. The We kept all of the caterpillars in the same environmental conditions. We then came and weighed and measured the caterpillars every day for one week, feeding them twice more throughout the week, three times total. They were placed in the incubator every night. All data was collected and we will be conducting a 2-sample t_test. 



Results:
Observations: 
Day 3: one of the controll caterpillars began to shed some of its skin. 
Day 5:  it is seen that all of the treatment groups are lighter in color, being more of a sky blue than green. Caterpillars T6 and T7 have no black markings on their back. 
Day 6: it is seen that C3 is significently smaller than the rest of the caterpillars and still has not completely shed the skin it started to on day three. 
Day 7: C3 looks like he is barely living, still moving slightly. 


Discussion:
In this experiment it is seen that the added JH in the form of Precor to the caterpillar's food did appear to slow down or delay the pupation of the larval caterpillars in the treatment group. This conclusion is based on the p value for weight and length from the 2-sample t_test. The p value for length is 0.01 which means that there is less than a 1.4% chance that the JH influenced length by chance. The p value for weight was 0.07, which means that there was a less than 7.3% chance that the JH influenced the weight by chance. This, according to Truman's article, suggests that, because our hypothesis is supported by the data and is likely due to the adding of JH to the diets of the treatment caterpillars, the change is likely linked to a change in the timing of pupation. In addition, the treatment caterpillars were larger than the controll group and they did not have the black markings on their backs. This suggests that the treatment group of caterpillars stayed in 1st or 2nd instar phases. These caterpillars grew larger while the controll group began to progress on to further maturation. Our only problem with data involved caterpillar number 3 in the controll group. It is considered an outlier as there was obviously something wrong with its health upon observation. It was not eating and so was not growing or developing, altering the data slightly. The other caterpillars in the controll group did, however, support our hypothesis.
