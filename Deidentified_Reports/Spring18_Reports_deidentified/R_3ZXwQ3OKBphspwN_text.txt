Title: The Effect of Methoprene on the Molting Patterns of Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta)

Abstract:
This study tests the effects of methoprene, an insect growth regulator, on the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta), and its ability to pupate from a 4th instar larvae to a pupa. There was a control group and treatment group, the treatment group receiving Precor, a chemical containing methoprene, in their standard food. The control group received water in their food. Length and weight of the larvae were recorded. Two of the control group caterpillars began pupation, meanwhile none of the treatment group caterpillars began pupation. The hypothesis that consumption of Precor would result in the inability to molt into a pupa was proven correctly, however was not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
Tobacco Hornworms (Manduca sexta), a kind of holometabolous insect, develop and grow through a life cycle in which starts with an egg and ends with an adult phase[Johnson-2018]. This cycle, which consists of an egg stage, 5 instar larva stages, a pupa stage, and an adult stage, is controlled by hormones[Johnson-2018]. Two hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, determine when and what phase a Manduca sexta molts into, which occurs between every phase[Johnson-2018]. A decrease in juvenile hormone signals the larvae to pupate and this decrease is required in order to molt into a pupa[Johnson-2018]. Insect growth regulators(IGR) can interfere with or over-activate processes regulated by the insect hormones, such as juvenile hormones[Johnson-2018]. One of these IGRs, Precor, contains methoprene, which mimics juvenile hormone[Johnson-2018]. Consumption of methoprene by the tobacco hornworm creates an increase in the JH function[Beckage-1982]. The tobacco hornworm in the larvae stage “can cause significant damage to tobacco crops” [Byron-2017] and are considered pests. Using IGRs may have the potential to decrease the population of tobacco hornworms and brings to question the possibility of using methoprene to inhibit the larvae from entering the pupae stage. The hypothesis is that increasing the levels of Juvenile Hormone through addition of Precor to food consumed by the caterpillars will cause the larvae in the 4th instar stage to be unable to pupate. 

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of tobacco hornworm caterpillars, all in their 4th instar larvae stages, were used. One group of four caterpillars was the control group, while the treatment group consisted of four caterpillars. Each caterpillar was placed in individual segments of 4 containers divided evenly by a sheet of paper. The control group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of standard food with 10 drops of distilled water. The treatment group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of standard food with 10 drops of Precor. The independent variable was treatment of Precor given to the treatment group instead of water. The caterpillars were stored in the laboratory refrigerator and taken out daily for 8 days to be supplied with 10 grams of food, to be weighed, and to be measured for length. The statistical test used was a two-sample T-Test, and the change in weight and lengths of the control and treatment groups were compared. 

Results:
The control group (3.9±0.56 cm) and treatment group (4.1±0.4 cm) had different average changes in length, with the Precor treatment group slightly longer and with overlapping standard of deviation lines, as depicted in Figure 1. The control group (10.4±2.8 g) and treatment group (11.1±0.7 g) had different average changes in weight, with the Precor treatment group slightly larger and with overlapping standard of deviation lines, as depicted in Figure 2. Overall, the treatment group had higher averages, but were not statistically significant for the change in length or change in weight.

Discussion:
The data was not statistically significant. Therefore, the data cannot effectively support the hypothesis, in which claimed the caterpillars will be unable to grow into a pupa due to an increase in methoprene consumption. However, it may be taken into consideration that two of the four control group caterpillars showed signs of pupating at the end of the experiment through change in color and wetness[Reineke-1980], as depicted in Image 1. Meanwhile, none of the treatment group caterpillars began signs of pupating, despite their larger sizes and weight. This may be because as the caterpillar begin to prepare for pupation, its increase in size slows[Bollenbacher-1981], and the treatment group did not show this quality. Although statistically insignificant, observations of no pupation from the treatment group supports the hypothesis that a treatment of methoprene to a tobacco hornworm will prevent the pupation stage. It may be further tested through observing the caterpillars for an extended period to determine if the treatment group ever reaches pupation[Wolfgang-1986]. Additionally, the amount of methoprene injected into the food may be increased in future experiments to determine if a greater dosage may lead to a more drastic change[Wolfgang-1986].
