Title: The Effects of Light and Dark Environments on Pisum sativun Resource Allocation  

Abstract:
Previous studies have shown that plants placed in dark environments have a decreased root:shoot ratio and, therefore, less resources are allocated to the roots and more resources are allocated to the shoots. The opposite is true for plants placed in light environments. In our experiment, we hypothesized that the root-to-shoot ratio of Pisum sativun placed in the dark environment would have a lower root:shoot ratio than those placed in the light environment. Three trays containing Pisum sativun plants were planted and left exposed to sunlight and other three trays containing Pisum sativun plants were planted and covered with a shade cloth. All of the plants were grown in a greenhouse and watered every other day for two weeks. After two weeks, the lengths of the roots and shoots were measured and a one-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data. It was found that the root:shoot ratio of the plants placed in the light environment was greater than that of the plants placed in the dark environment. According to the statistical analysis, the difference in mean root:shoot ratio was not significent (one-tailed two-sample t_test: t=1.438, d.f.=4, P=0.224). The amount of light provided for the plants in the dark environment may have been sufficient enough for the plant or a geneti

Introduction:
All organisms require nutrients, nitrogen, water, and sunlight in order to survive in an ecological community where both biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) factors coexist. Organism allocate these resources because they are limited. Resource allocation is measured by root-to-shoot ratio. A study done by Van Hees examined the effect shading has on various tree species and found that the root:shoot ratio was reduced with shading for all of the species of trees studied [Van Hees: 2003]. In a similar study done on old-field annual species grown under low levels of light and high levels of nutrients, it was found that less resources were allocated to the roots of these plants under these conditions [McConnaughay: 1999]. Gottschalk's study on the effects of shade on various oak and maple trees' root:shoot ratio concluded that, during the first year, root:shoot ratio is not greatly affected by the amount of light, but during the second year, the root:shoot ratio is affected by light levels in a particular tree species tested [Gottschalk: In our experiment, the effects of light and dark environments on Pisum sativun (pea plants) were examined. The Pisum sativun plants' ability to allocate resources was measured by using the root length to shoot length ratio 2 weeks after the seeds were planted. We hypothesize that the Pisum sativun in the dark environment will have a lower root:shoot ratio than those placed in the light environment since the energy resource from the sun is allocated to the shoots to promote shoot growth. 

Materials and Method:
In order to prepare the soil for planting the peas, loose soil was placed into six trays. They were soaked in water, treated with 50 Ml of growth solution, and allowed to drain in a bin. About 100 to 150 peas were soaked in water before being planted. About 20 to 25 peas were then planted in each tray containing the prepared soil. Three of the six trays were covered with a mesh shade cloth supported by rods tied together. The remaining three trays were left exposed to sunlight. All plants were placed in the greenhouse. The plants were watered every other day for two weeks. After two weeks, the plants were harvested. To measure the length of the roots and shoots, the pea plants were cut where the roots meet the shoot. The length from bottom to the top of the shoot and the length from the top of the root to bottom of the longest root was measured. This was repeated for three plants from each of the six trays so that 9 controll plants, 9 experimental plants, and a total of 18 plants were measured. A one-tailed two-sample t_test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio of the Pisum sativun plants placed in the light environment was greater than that of the Pisum sativun plants placed in the dark environment by 0.139 (Figure 1. t=1.438, d.f.=4, P=0.224). Upon observation after two weeks of growth, the difference in height of the pea plants grown in the light and dark environments was not obvious. The number of plants in each tray were relatively the same.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, stating that the Pisum sativun placed in the light environment will have a lower root:shoot ratio than those placed in the dark environment, was not supported. In our experiment, the plants placed in the light environment had a higher mean root:shoot ratio than those placed in the dark environment, however this difference was found to be insignificent. Therefore, we cannot reject our null hypothesis stating that there will not be a significent difference in mean root:shoot ratio between the plants placed in light and dark environments. Plants allocate their resources based on the lack or excess of necessities provided by the environment they are in. In the case of the plants place in the dark environment, there is a limitation of light. Since the plants are in need of more light, more resources are allocated to the shoots so that more sunlight can be reached. This accounts for the slightly lower mean root:shoot ratio observed in the plants grown in the dark environment. As for the plants placed in the light environment, there is a sufficient amount of the light, water, and nutrients. There is a possibility that the amount of light provided to the plants grown in the light environment was more than the amount required for growth. Therefore, to accommodate the loss of water due to too much light, the plants allocated more resources to the roots in order to get more access to water. This accounts for the slightly higher root:shoot ratio of plants grown in the light environment. In his studies, Van Hees mentions that there is a genetic component to the effects light and dark have on the allocation of resources in different plant species. Van Hees mentions that there are plant species that are shade "tolerant" and "intolerant" [Van Hees: 2003]. He also mentions that there is a relationship between growth rate and root:shoot ratio. Those species with fast growth rates tend to have a lower root:shoot ratio and those with slow growth rates tend to have a higher root:shoot ratio [Van Hees: 2003]. In terms of Pisum sativun used in our experiment, the species unknown tolerance or intolerance and its relatively fast growth rate may have had an effect on the insignificent mean root:shoot ratio difference. McConnaughay found that there is a difference in root:shoot ratio during different phases in growth of a plant. In the early phases of the plant's growth, root:shoot ratio increases in environments with less light [McConnaughay: 1999]. Similarly, Gottschalk mentions that during the early stages of the growth of trees used in the experiment, there was little effect of light on the root:shoot ratio [Gottschalk: 1985]. Since Pisum sativun used in our experiment were measured during its early stages of growth, this accounts for the fact that there is only a slight difference in mean root:shoot ratio between Pisum sativun grown in light and dark environments. Gottschalk also mentions that a possible source of inaccurate data may come from the fact that the shade cloth does not provide uniform amount of shade [Gottschalk: 1985]. In our study, the shade cloth may have posed a similar issue causing more light to reach the plant than intended. This could lead to a higher root:shoot ratio than expected.
