Title: Effects or Precor on Manduca Sexta Development 

Abstract:
IGR’s mimic the effect of JH and can inhibit Manduca Sexta development. To test this, eight larval Manduca sexta were monitored over seven days. Half were given food treated with Precor and the other half’s food was not treated. Due to flukes in the procedures, there was no general trend in the data collected. A statistical test was conducted and the alternate hypothesis was rejected. Because of this, the lab was inconclusive. 


Introduction:
The manduca sexta has a life cycle consisting of eight stages including: egg, first-fifth instar, pupa, and adult moth.The hormones that regulate the insect’s development and molting are Juvenile Hormone and ecdysone.The Juvenile hormone controlls the type of molt, while ecdysterone orchestrates the molt [Riddiford: 2003].  During the first through fourth instar stages, of  the concentration of Juvenile hormone is high, so the instar just molts into another instar. However during the fifth instar stage the concentration of JH drops, so the instar can develop into a pupa and adult. If the concentration of JH is disrupted, then the development of the Manduca is  hindered. Because of this, many scientist use IGR’s (which mimic the effect of JH) to test the effect of different JH concentrations. 
	Hypothesis:
Biological-
-null
If the Manduca sexta consumes food containing Precore, then the growth will not be affected.
-Alternate
If the Manduca sexta consumes food containing Precore, then the weight of the Manduca sexta will be larger than the controll. 
Statistical-
-null
The weight will not be statistically different between the controll group and the treated group.
-Alternate
The weight will be statistically different between the controll group and the treated group. 


Materials and Method:
Select eight laravel Manduca Sexta caterpillars, and divide them into two groups. Collect four tubs provided, and split them in half using a notecard.  Label each side of each tub controll or treatment, and place a caterpillar in each side of all four tubs. For the caterpillars on the side of the tubs labeled controll, prepare 10 grams of food mixed with three drops of water for each controll caterpillar. For the treatment caterpillars, prepare 10 grams mixed with three drops of Precore for each treatment caterpillar. Each day weigh each caterpillar and record it in the lab notebook. Also clean each side of the tub and replenish each food source as described above.
Materials:
-scale
-four tubs with lids
-Manduca Sexta food
-Manduca Sexta caterpillars
-water
-Precor
-incubator
-notebook cards


Results:
Over a period of seven days, all but two caterpillars grew, and caterpillars controll 4 and treatment 2 lost weight. The controll and treatment groups show no significent differences. 

Discussion:
Based on the statistical analysis of the data collected, the null hypothesis was accepted due to the p_value of 0.595 with twelve degrees of freedom. Because the p_value is above 0.05, the results can be interpreted as a result of the randomness of nature, not a result of the Precor IGR. These skewed results are an effect of a misinterpretation of the procedures. The Manduca Sexta were not fed everyday, and their tubs were not cleaned out every time they were massed. This explains the main outliers in the data in which controll caterpillar 2 and treatment caterpillar 4 lost weight. These caterpillars’ food source was not replenished, and they most likely lost weight due to starvation. Several of the caterpillars also broke through the notecard divider and remained on the same side of a caterpillars in a different group. Because of this, some caterpillars received a mixture of treated food and controll food which contributed to the randomness of the results. Without these flukes in the execution of the procedures, the results would most likely be consistent with an experiment produced by Nancy E. Beckage and Lynn M. Riddiford in which the methoprene inhibited the emergence of adult Manduca Sexta and resulted in supernumerary instar. [Beckage 1981]. These previously published studies show that IGR’s can be used as a way of inhibiting the emergence of harmful adult pests in agriculture. Although the recorded data did not support the information mentioned in the introduction, previous studies prove the information aforementioned.
