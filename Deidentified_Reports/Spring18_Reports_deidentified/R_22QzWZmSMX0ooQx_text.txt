Title: No correlation between color of Betta Splendens and intraspecific agonistic behavior 

Abstract:
Betta splendens (betta fish) are known to show signs of aggressive behavior, agonistic behavior, when in the presence of male or female betta fish. In threatening environments, they will display specific movements to show aggression. The behaviors displayed are classified by different levels of aggression and put into two categories: broadside movements and facing movements.  In the experiment conducted, it is being tested whether blue fish are inherently more or less aggressive than red fish. This is being tested by red beta fish exposed to other red betta fish (separated by glass) and blue betta fish exposed to other blue betta fish (separated by glass). By doing so, the number of times aggressive behavioral movements are performed will be recorded and averaged over a series of four trials per each color beta fish. In this experiment only facing movements will be studied, pelvic fin flaring (less aggressive) and branchiostegal membrane flaring (more aggressive). A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the facing movements in both red and blue betta fish. By the end of the experiment, it was concluded that the data supported the hypothesis, there is no correlation between aggression and the color of betta fish when in presence of one another. 

Introduction:
thology is the study of animal behavior. Behavioral studies have been conducted on Betta splendens (Beta fish), also knowns as Siamese fighting fish, to categorize levels of aggression. Originating in southeast Asia, these small fish display levels of no aggression to extreme aggression in the presence of other beta fish. Their intraspecific behavior is measured in categories: broadside and facing movements. The two categories, both broadside and facing, contain sub levels of aggression. The sub-levels determine the type of aggression a betta is displaying: no aggression, moderate aggression, or extreme aggression in the movements they perform with specific body parts. To study beta fish, an experiment involving the intraspecific behavior between red and blue Beta fish was examined in a laboratory setting. To begin the experiment, there was eight blue bettas and eight red betta fish in separate tanks. Two of the eight Beta fish (of the same color), were exposed to each other in a fish tank with a glass separator to avoid physical contact. They were exposed to each other for five-minute intervals. This process was repeating for each pair of eight red beta fish and each pair of eight blue beta fish.  To measure aggression, only the frequency of pelvic fin flaring (moderate aggression) and branchiostegal membrane flaring (extreme aggression) were recorded between paired red beta fish and paired blue beta fish.  The experiment was designed to test if blue beta fish would display more aggression in the presence of another blue betta fish or if red betta fish would display more aggression in the presence of another red betta fish. It was hypothesized that there would be no correlation in the levels of aggression based on the color of beta fish. The results supported the hypothesis. 

Materials and Methods:
The first trial consisted of two beta blue fish in the presence of another. Behavior of blue betta fish was recorded over a span of four five-minute trials per pair of blue betta fish. In between each trial the fish tested were replaced with another pair of blue betta fish. The number of pelvic flair and branchiostegal membrane flaring was counted and recorded. The numbers were then averaged, a composition of all four trials. The same process was repeated with red betta fish. A two-sample t-test was used to statically determine the correlation of paired blue or red betta fish. P-values were calculated for the red and blue betta fish facing movements: frequency of pectoral fin movements and frequency of branchiostegal membrane flaring.

Results:
The data supports the hypothesis of aggression, that there is no correlation between aggression and color. The p-values for the levels of aggression were high. Figure one shows the frequency of pectoral fin movements with a p-value of 0.22. Figure two shows the frequency of brancheological membrane movements with a p-value of 0.16.  Since the p-values are both greater than the significance level, the probability of the experimental outcome is largely due to chance.

Discussion:
The data did support the hypothesis, there is no correlation between color of beta fish and intraspecific aggression. According to the data both p-values were above the significance level, indicating that the experiment results are largely due to random chance. Both Paired red and blue betta fish show no indication of patterned aggression for the duration of the four, five-minute trials. The environment the beta fish were living in may be the reason for this outcome. They were habituated to a laboratory setting and not living in environments that would grant high standards of living. This impacted the betta’s health significantly thus negatively influencing the data collected. While the betta fish tested did not show high levels of aggression in presence of other betta fish, “Siamese fighting fish (Betta Splendens) is well known as an aggressive fish with unique spawning and parental care behavior” (Forsatkar, 2017). 
In an experiment conducted in 2017, male betta fish showed high levels of aggression in the presence of bubble nests, female betta nests. In this experiment gill flaring (high level of aggression) and fin spreading (moderate level of aggression) were studied. It was concluded that in order to protect territory, around the bubble nests, Siamese fighting fish show pattern of aggression towards intruders. This includes aggression towards both sexes. In another experiment, color polymorphism was looked at in teleost fish. In this experiment teleost fishes were observed to “determined that change from one color pattern to the other is rapid, reversible, and corresponds to phenotypic plasticity associated with aggressive behavior” (Besson, 2018). Color of teleost fish showed a correlation to aggression. 
Overall, the experiment conducted on betta fish did support the hypothesis but could be altered by adding territorial influence (bubble nests) or adding a female beta to the experiment. Another option would be, instead of using beta fish use teleost fish to investigate color of fish and aggression.
