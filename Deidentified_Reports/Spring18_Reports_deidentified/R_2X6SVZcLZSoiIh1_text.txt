Title: The Effect of Tetraethylammonium Cl on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Northern Leopard Frog

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to describe the effects of tetraethylammonium Cl on the skeletal muscle. The use of the Northern Leopard Frog, the Rana pipiens, is due to ease of dissection, use, and accessibility. Tetraethylammonium Cl is a potassium blocker that we injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog to measure the difference in time of the contraction and relaxation periods between those that had the chemical and those who did not. We hypothesized an increase in difference of time, however there was no significant, conclusive difference. This is most likely due to a low dosage of the chemical applied.

Introduction:
The organism used in this experiment is the Northern Leopard Frog, scientifically know as the Rana pipiens. It is naturally found in Canada and the United States. It is a slim greenish-brown frog that ranges from five to eleven inches. They have dark spots on their backs and legs and very defined features. The species in use is not important, however it is very easy accessible species to dissect and to test skeletal muscles [Stebbins: 2003].
	The primary function of muscle is for movement, which ranges from a beating heart, to the physical movement of an organism. Of the three types of muscles, cardiac, smooth, and skeletal, skeletal is the voluntary muscle type that is the key contributor in the physical movement of the organism, which is ultimately the dependent variable of this experiment.
	Skeletal muscle consists of hundreds of myofibers, which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. Connective tissue binds the myofibers together to form functional groups [Johnson: 2018]. From largest to most basic unit, skeletal muscles are organized from muscle to myofibers to myofibrils to sarcomere. The sarcomere consists of overlapping bundles of actin and myosin which contrast and expand, allowing for the overall movement of the muscle. 
	It is crucial for the muscular system to be connected to the nervous system, since the nervous system is, in layman’s terms, known as the command center of the body. Because skeletal muscles are voluntary, the somatic nervous system is what controls them. There is an exception for reflexes, however, it can be generalized that the SNS is the primary controller [Brunton: 2011]. The SNS connects the motor cortex of the brain to the various muscles in the body of the organism. 
	Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose axons extend into the muscle then branch out to connect to several individual myofibers [Johnson: 2018]. These points are called neuromuscular junctions which is a chemical synapse, which allows the electrical signal from the axon to transfer to the muscle as a neurotransmitter. 
	More specifically, the electrical nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter specific to muscle contraction, from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Acetylcholine then binds to its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels which generates an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential then spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as the internal storage sites. The calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing the contraction of myosin and actin [Johnson: 2018].
	It is often difficult to detect contractions and expansions in a single myofibril, let alone a single sarcomere. Therefore, changes must be detected on a more macroscopic level: the entire muscle. This mirrors what is occurring on a cellular level [Johnson: 2018]. A myogram is a visual representation of contraction and can be created by attaching the muscle to a force transducer. A myogram has three distinct parts: a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The latent period is the very short time between stimulation and reaction, normally less than 10 milliseconds. In the contraction period, the muscle shortens and once the maximum force is reached, enters the relaxation period which is the muscle elongating again [Johnson: 2018]. 
	As stated, an action potential is needed to relay information from the nervous system to the muscular system. An action potential is an electrical signal that is measured in millivolts and is controlled by the flow of ions (mainly sodium and potassium) in and out of the axon. To begin an action potential, sodium flows into the axon, depolarizing the cell, making it more positive. This travels down the axon, and to ensure that the axon hyperpolarizes back to resting potential, potassium must exit the cell to make the axon more negative. Potassium is important in an action potential because it allows short bursts of electrical signal. This prevents an unnecessarily long signal to be sent. It also prevents information from traveling in an undesired direction. The hyperpolarization of the axon forces a refractory period where there is a slight pause in signals, as for the body to not be overwhelmed with information. In this experiment tetraethylammonium Cl, a potassium channel blocker, was used. Based on this information, it can be hypothesized that the potassium channel blocker will force potassium to stay inside the cell, not allowing the axon to hyperpolarize, ultimately causing longer contractions in the muscle, since the refractory period will be slow to begin.	


Materials and Methods:
	The lab group first prepared the frog legs to be tested. To do this, we removed the skin by means of peeling. There were some difficult places along the knee. To compensate, a simple tug is sufficient. Scissors and tweezers can be used if needed, if the leg is not damaged in any way. We flipped the leg to the ventral side and viewed the cleft at the top of the thigh. The objective is to open the thigh to reveal the nerves, so using our fingers and forceps began to open the muscle via the cleft. However, it is important to not touch the nerve with the metal instruments because this could disrupt its function. It is also important to keep the leg moisturized with electrolyte water. This exposed the sciatic nerve which is the cream-colored strand. Next, we detached the gastrocnemius muscle at the Achilles tendon. The tibialis anterior is the front muscle below the knee, and the gastrocnemius is in the back. We took the scissor tip in between these two muscles to clear out the connective tissue. From here we cut towards the toes and cut the Achilles tendon.
	An 8-inch length of string was cut, and a knot is tied at the achilles junction. A second knot was formed at the other end, so that the strong could be suspended from a stand. The gastrocnemius was suspended at a 90-degree angle while the rest of the leg was flat on the tray. Using pins, we immobilized the femur bone and knee cap by creating x’s over these areas. Once these were set in place, the precision tensioner on the stand was used to create tension on the gastrocnemius so that it was neither too loose or too tight. We inserted our sleeve stimulation probes which were placed on the sciatic nerve. Both black and red sleeves need to be touching the nerve the whole time. The muscle was then prepared, and the experimentation could begin.
	We installed a program called LabScribe which can measure action potentials in both muscles and nerves. We proceeded to fire increasing voltage into the leg using the stimulation probes to find the threshold, and once we did, we added .5 mV to the stimulation and began recording the time of the contraction and refractory periods (when the difference in voltage was 0 from resting potential to resting potential. This ultimately gave us the contracting period of the muscle. Once we recorded three under no condition, we injected 100 mM of tetraethylammonium Cl, let it sit for two minutes so the chemical could integrate with the muscle, and proceeded to record results for three stimulations of the muscle. We repeated this for one more leg and recorded the results. The statistical test that we used to interpret our results was a paired t-test.


Results:
As demonstrated in Figure 1, the average difference between the control and experimental groups is -4.167 milliseconds. The p-value is .912, which is greater than .05, making this data not statistically significant. The pattern observed in the graph, is that there is little discrepancy between control and experimental; there is little change in time it takes for the muscle to complete the contraction and relaxation stages, no matter if it was injected with the potassium blocker or not. 

Discussion:
The data does not support our hypothesis. In fact, it supports quite the opposite because the experimental group had a lower contraction and relaxation time. As explained in the introduction, theoretically when potassium blocker is added to a muscle, the relaxation period should take a longer time because potassium exiting the neuron is ultimately what allows the cell to reach resting potential once more. Based on previous research by Dr. Kathleen Choi, tetraethylammonium Cl inactivates the shaker voltage-gated, potassium ion channels, along the axon at a very rapid rate. There is another K+ channel that is present called the lymphocyte K+ channel. The chemical was concluded to have to minimal effect on the rate of inactivation of this channel. It is also stated in the article that mutations can abolish fast inactivation’s of shaker channels. [Choi: 1991] So, the two possible interpretations of our data from Choi’s article is that we either did not give the lymphocyte K+ channels enough time to get blocked by the tetraethylammonium Cl, or there is some mutation in Rana pipiens that slows the inactivation rates of the shaker channels. 
However, it is possible an error could have been made. Not allowing the chemical to sit long enough would be a critical error. Yet, another possibility is that an incorrect amount of chemical was used. From an article by Dr. Bertil Hille, we should see positive results from this experiment; that is, if the correct dosage is given. Bertil performed a similar experiment and concluded that in low tetraethylammonium Cl concentration, the activity stayed relatively the same. It is quoted, “Tetraethylammonium Cl ion has no effect at 110mM” [Hille: 1967]. Therefore, at 100mM there would also be no effect because it is an even lower concentration. This article concludes that our concentration was not high enough to see positive results. Hille’s article gives a valid explanation as to why the data may be inconclusive in the results about the length of time for the contraction and relaxation periods. It does support the claim that 100mM is not enough to trigger and change in relaxation of the muscle. 
	The results can be taken further with two steps. Firstly, the independent variable can become the concentration of tetraethylammonium to determine the threshold in which the axon is affected by the chemical. Once the threshold is known, a concentration higher than it can become the constant and repeat the original experiment to conclude different results. It would then be the hope that the new data matches with our original hypothesis: the relaxation phase becomes longer. This would give scientists a better understanding about the importance of potassium throughout an action potential and could further lead to medications for hyperactive people or people who experience seizure/spasm-like symptoms.
