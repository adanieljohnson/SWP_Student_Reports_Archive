Title: The Effect of Mycorrhizal Fungi on the Raphanus specie

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effects of mycorrhizal fungi on the resource allocation of a plant. Mycorrhizal fungi are known to have a symbiotic relationship with plants and is beneficial to both organisms. The plant used in the study was the Raphanus specie. Two groups of soil were used in the study, one treated with mycorrhizal while the other was not. The plants were allowed to grow for 2 weeks before they were analyzed. The effect of the mycorrhizal fungi was determined through analyzing the root: shoot ratio in respect of weight and length. The results from the study can be used to understand how other plants develop as between 80% to 90% develop a relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. The hypothesis of the experiment was that the root: shoot ratio would decrease for plants which were treated with mycorrhizal fungi. The result of the study was that the hypothesis was supported.   


Introduction:
In this experiment, the effect of Mycorrhizal fungi upon Raphanus specie (more commonly known as the radish plant) was tested. Mycorrhizal fungi are a part of the fungus kingdom. Mycorrhizae and plants form what is called a symbiotic relationship. A symbiotic relationship is one two organisms interact with each other. (St. John, 2018) There are three types of relationships: commensalism, mutualism, and parasitism. (Gordon, 2018) Commensalism is a relationship in which one organism use the other for survival however it does not have an effect on the other species. Mutualism is where both organisms have a benefit from each other. Parasitism is where one organism uses the other organism to a disadvantage. In the case between a mycorrhizae and plant, the relationship is mutualism. The plant benefits from the relationship as mycorrhizae act as an extension of the root which allows for a more efficient extraction of nutrients from the root. Mycorrhizae benefit from the relationship as the plant allows the fungi a habitat to inhabit and survive in a secure setting. (Gordon, 2018) The mycorrhizae can increase the surface area of roots anywhere from 100 to 1000 times which has a great impact as to how efficiently the plant can extract nutrients from the soil. (Mycorrhizal Applications, 2018) The fungi help greatly in the acquisition of immobile nutrient. Some examples of immobile nutrients which mycorrhizae help extract are phosphorus iron, and nitrogen. (Bolan, 1991) The goal of the experiment was to determine if the mycorrhizal fungi have an effect on the Raphanus specie. The relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and plants have many various effects. Some of the interaction can lead to biodiversity with in plants, productivity, and variability. (van der Heijden et al., 1998) The results from the study can be applied to other plants and scenarios as between 80% to 90% of plants on Earth have a relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. (Lepp, 2018) The relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and the radish plants was analyzed through the root: shoot ratio of two groups of radish plants. One group was placed in a normal soil (control group) and the other was be placed in soil treated with mycorrhizal fungi (experimental group). The ratio will help determine the amount of resources the plant will allocate towards it root or shoots. I predicted that if we introduce mycorrhizal fungi to Raphanus specie, then the plant will see a decrease its root: shoot ratio because the fungi will help the plant extract nutrients from the soil more efficiently. Therefore, the plant will allocate its resources towards growing it shoots rather than the roots leading to a lower root: shoot ratio.    

Materials and Methods:
The experiment consisted of two groups radish plants whose soil was manipulated. The experiment started off with soaking a handful of radish seed in a 100 mL beaker with approximately 85 mL of water for 30 minutes. In the meantime, the containers which would house the plants were prepared. Six containers of soil were prepared. To all the containers, vermiculite (soil) was added 3/4 of the way up. Water was added to all the containers to allow for the soil to saturate. To three of the containers, about a teaspoon of mycorrhizal fungi was added. The mycorrhizae were then mixed into the soil to allow for even distribution. The containers with the mycorrhizae was labeled the experimental group while the containers which did not contain the mycorrhizae was labeled the control group. Next, 50 mL of Miracle Gro was added to all of the containers. In each container, approximately 7-10 holes were made. After the seeds had soaked in the water for 30 minutes, in each of the holes around 5-9 seeds of the radish plant were added. Once the seeds were added, more soil was applied to cover the seeds. The containers were then transferred to a greenhouse where they would stay for the next two weeks. Over the two weeks the plants were watered at least every other day, if not every day. Each container was watered until water would start to flow out of the container. Once the two weeks were up, the plants were then analyzed. 10 plants from each container were extracted and their mass was taken. Once the mass was recorded, the roots and shoots of the plants were separated. This was done by cutting the plants where they changed color at the root/shoot junction. The roots of the plants were weighed and recorded. The mass of the shoots was determined by subtracting the total mass of the plants by the root mass. Next the max root length from the ten plants from each container was taken. The same was done for the max shoot length. The max lengths were recorded. The root: shoot (R: S) ratio was determined for both weight and length. The data was then analyzed through a one-tailed unpaired t-test. 

Results:

The trend observed was that the root: shoot ratio decreased when comparing control groups to experimental groups.  The values depicted were statistically different (T-value= 6.05, degrees freedom=4, p-value=0.004). The error bars in the figure represent one unit of standard deviation.

The trend observed was that the root: shoot ratio for the weight of the plants increased. The values depicted were not statistically different (T-value= 0.815, degrees freedom=4, p-value=0.461). The error bars in the figure represent one unit of standard deviation. 

Discussion:
Based on the data collected and the statistical tests conducted, our hypothesis was supported. The root: shoot ratio for length decreased for plants which were treated with mycorrhizal fungi. The average root: soot ratio was 1.93 in the control group while in the experimental group is was 1.41 (Figure 1). A statistical test was conducted, and the test concluded that the data were significantly different. This portion of the data supported our hypothesis. The root: shoot ratio for weight increased in the experiment group and refuted our hypothesis. The average root: shoot ratio was 0.269 in the control group while in the experimental group it increased to 0.288 (Figure 2). However, when the statistical test was conducted, the data was determined to not be significant different. Therefore, due to the data supporting the hypothesis was supported and the data refuting the hypothesis was insignificant, overall our hypothesis was supported. The reasoning for the root: shoot ratio decreasing in terms of length from the control to experimental group can be explained by the more efficient extraction of nutrients from the soil due to the addition of mycorrhizal in the experimental group. The more efficient intake of nutrients would lead to the plant allocating its towards the shoots rather than its roots. However, in the case of the control group, the plants would have a harder time gaining nutrients than the plants treated with the fungi. This would lead to the plants allocating more resources towards roots which would cause the root: shoot ratio to increase. Even though the root: shoot ratio data for the weight of the plants did not support our hypothesis and were not significantly different, one reason why the ratio increased from the control to the experimental group maybe possible that due to the mycorrhizal being added. Since the mycorrhizal was attaching to the plants root, it could possibly have cause more mass to be added to the roots of the experimental group. The results of this experiment help understand the function of mycorrhizal fungi and how they affect a plant. The fungi help plants extract nutrients more efficiently which allows the plant to allocate its resources to other needs. Research has been conducted which support that mycorrhizal fungi help in the acquisition of nutrients. According to a study by the University of Hohenheim, their research stated, "In mycorrhizal plants the water uptake rate per unit root length and per unit time was about twice as high as in non-mycorrhizal roots". (Kothari, 1990) One way to improve the procedure would to water the plants on a regular rather than inconsistent basis.
