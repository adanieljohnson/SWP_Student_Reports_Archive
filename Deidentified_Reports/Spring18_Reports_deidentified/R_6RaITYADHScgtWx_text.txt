Title: Impact of tetraethyl ammonium chloride blocker on the action potentials of the Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
The Rania pipiens, also known as the northern leopard frog, is native to Canada and the United States. Our controll group was injected with a frog Ringer’s solution. Our experimental group was injected with a potassium blocker called tetraethyl ammonium chloride. Our independent variable was the frog leg not treated with blocker. Our dependent variable was the amount of twitches per leg. We used a pair t_test to find the statistically differences in our data. Our P-value was greater than 0.05; therefore, it was not significent. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
In frog legs, nerve impulses arriving at neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, which opens sodium channels that generate an action potential. The action potential spreads throughout the muscle fiber which stimulates the release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. (Johnson, 2018) Pressure effects on the Ca2+ currents were studied in the Rania pipiens peripheral motor nerves. Pressure effects were stimulated by using ionic currents, Ca2+ currents, and K+ currents at the node and the axon terminal. The K+ current was reduced by withdrawing the recording electrode. (Aviner et al, 2013) Other experiments have been made by determining what other stimuli can generate action potentials in the Rania pipiens leg, such as laser stimulation with infrared heat. Laser-stimulated action potentials in the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens are made using two infrared lasers have be measured. (Jindra et al, 2010) Ionic currents in immature, ovulated Rania pipiens oocytes were studied using a voltage-clamp technique. The K+ current was only present in the youngest oocytes. The K+ current reversed the resting potential and produced an after hyperpolarization at the end of each action potential. (Schlichter, 1989) Our hypothesis is if the Rania pipiens leg is treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. 


Materials and Method:
We examined the effects of the potassium blocker on the Rania pipiens leg. The potassium blocker we used is called tetraethyl ammonium chloride. We looked for twitches caused by action potentials. One leg is the controll group injected with frog Ringer’s solution. One leg is the experimental group which is the leg injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride. The statistical test we used is a pair t_test. We used amplitude to measure the action potentials of each leg as a controll group and as a experimental group by using increments of voltage of 0.3 amps, 0.4 amps, 0.5 amps, 1 amps and 2 amps. We also measured the relaxation period of each action potential. 


Results:
A trend in the intensity of the action potentials of the Rania pipiens leg that were blocked by the tetraethyl ammonium chloride blocker was that the intensity of the experimental group for leg one and leg three were higher than the intensity of the controll group got leg one and leg three. This is inversely related to leg two in which the action potentials were less intense in the experimental group than in the controll group. The length of relaxation periods in the Gastrocnemius muscle in the Rania pipiens leg controlls the amount and the intensity of the action potentials per leg. The mean in regards to relaxation period of the controll group was statistically different than the mean in regards to relaxation of the experimental group (t_stat=1.184, d.f.=14, P-value=0.256). There is not a significent difference between the controll and experimental groups for relaxation period because our calculated P-value is greater than 0.05. 



Discussion:
There was no significent difference in the controll groups and experimental groups because our P-values for amplitude were so high. The p_value was a 0.79. Our results for our experiment did not support our hypothesis which was if the Rania pipiens leg was treated with a potassium blocker, then there will only be one action potential in the leg. The legs treated with the potassium blocker had three to five action potentials throughout the course of our experiment. Experimental leg one and experimental leg three had five action potentials that we were able to measure. Experimental leg two had three action potentials that we were able to measure.  Another way to block potassium in Rania pipiens leg is to use pressure effects by stimulating potassium currents at the node and axon terminal (Aviner et al., 2013). This blocks potassium in the brain of the Rania pipiens which would block potassium directly in the Gastrocnemius muscle of the leg.

Figure 1. The relaxation periods of the controll groups and experimental groups of Rania pipiens legs. The controll groups had longer relaxation periods than the experimental groups. Three adult legs were put in each group. The controll group was soaked in frog Ringer’s solution. The experimental group was injected with tetraethyl ammonium chloride, which is a potassium blocker.
