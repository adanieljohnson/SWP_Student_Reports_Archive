Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to observe the effects of Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator on the growth and life cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. The experiment will be performed by separating eight caterpillars into two groups of four. One group will receive a controll diet while the other is fed the same diet with six drops of Martin’s IGR added to it. Each caterpillar will be fed 10g of food to ensure proper nutrition. Due to the knowledge that JH causes hormonal imbalances in the caterpillars, it is expected that Martin’s IGR would make the caterpillars grow more in a shorter amount of time compared to the controll group due to the mimicking of Juvenile Hormone. The JH mimicking will cause the caterpillars to slow down their life cycle and transition into adults slower. However, it is expected that the caterpillars will grow faster in their larval stage due to the large increase in Juvenile Hormone in their bodies.

Introduction:
The purpose of the lab was to observe the effects of Martin’s IGR on growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. As described by Dr. Reinecke, Manduca sexta caterpillars are multivoltine, meaning it has two or more broods of offspring per year, leaf feeder that grows rapidly up to 10 g in the larval stage and follow a life cycle that includes a larval stage and adult stage[Reinecke: 1980]. The life cycle and the caterpillar’s progression through the it is highly dependent upon hormones, especially Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (E20). JH is a hormone that is essential for the caterpillars to continue in their life cycle and pupate. 20E is a multifunctional hormone in insects but is vital to controll the timing of molting. Dr. Takeda also found that 20E was important in the development and function of the testes, making the hormone also important for the adult stage during reproduction [Takeda: 1972]. Before a caterpillar can pupate and turn into an adult, it must go through the commitment pulse, a phase in life where the caterpillar recognizes it is time to pupate by a having a large drop in JH and an increase in 20E. Martin’s IGR is an insect growth regulator that functions by mimicking the production of Juvenile Hormone in the caterpillars. We hypothesize that by mimicking the production of JH in the caterpillars, Martin’s IGR prevents the caterpillars from entering the commitment pulse and causes the caterpillars to remain in the larval stage. Thus, because Martin’s IGR mimics JH production, the caterpillars should grower heavier and longer faster than the normal rate of growth due to the increase of JH in their system, however they will pupate much later than normal.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in the 4th and 5th instar larval state were used for the lab. The caterpillars were split into two groups of 4 and were provided 10g of pre-made caterpillar food every day for a week. Plastic containers were used to house the caterpillars. Each container would house two caterpillars that were split by a flashcard. These containers would be placed inside an incubator. The caterpillars were only taken out of the incubators when they were to be measured and weighed. The caterpillars were numbered 1-8 for the purpose of the lab. Caterpillars 1-4 would be part of the controll group that would be fed the pre-made caterpillar food treated with six drops of distilled water. Caterpillars 4-8, the experimental group, would be fed the same caterpillar food however their food would be treated with six drops of Martin’s IGR. The food was prepared by weighing out 10 g of food per caterpillar and then adding the treatment to the food. The food was then thoroughly mixed and 10 g were distributed to each caterpillar. Each caterpillar was weighed in grams and measured in centimeters at the start of the experiment and every day until the end of the experiment. Pictures were taken of the caterpillars on the first day of the experiment and on the last day of the experiment to compare size and color. After the results of the lab are collected, an unpaired t_test was used to compare the controll groups and experimental groups and determine if the data was statistically significent. Finally, the significance of the results of the lab were determined based on the 95% confidence interval used.

Results:
In the measurement of average difference in mass, the controll group had an average of 4.3728g  0.4775g while the experimental group had an average of 4.3424g  0.2611g. Thus, the controll group had a higher average but also a higher standard deviation. The p_value for the difference in mass was recorded as 0.9615. The average difference in mass was also calculated to have a t-value of 0.0485 In the measurements of average difference in length of the caterpillars, the controll group reported an average of 5.6220 cm  0.4366 cm and the experimental group had an average of 5.7851cm  0.5143 cm. The average difference in length of the caterpillars was calculated to have a p_value of 0.7963. Finally, the average difference in length was calculated to have a t-value of 0.2593.


Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, the hypothesis was not upheld. It should be noted that not enough time was given for the experiment to test whether or not the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR would pupate or not. According to the data shown above, Martin’s IGR and the increased exposure to JH was not significent and had little to no effect on the mass or length of the of the caterpillars, as shown by the high p_values calculated. The p_value for the difference in mass was recorded as 0.9615. Because the p_value calculated was above the 95% confidence interval, the data was no significent has a high chance it occurred by chance and was not influenced by the experiment. The average difference in length of the caterpillars was calculated to have a p_value of 0.7963. Again, since it was over the 95% confidence interval, the results were deemed to not be significent and likely occurred by chance. Furthermore, the average difference in mass of the caterpillars was 4.4373g  0.4775g for the controll group and 4.3424g  0.2611g for the experimental group. Also, for the average difference in length, the controll group reported an average of 5.6220 cm  0.4366 cm and the experimental group had an average of 5.7851cm  0.5143 cm. Based on these values, the controll groups when compared to the experimental groups had very similar averages and did not differ much even with the range given by the standard deviation. The reason the IGR may not have significently affected the caterpillars is because perhaps not enough time was given for the increase in hormones to have a significent effect on the insects. However, it was noted that by the end of the experiment the caterpillars that were treated with the IGR were slightly discolored compared to those of the controll group. Finally, on Day 5 of recording the length of the caterpillars, the lengths were measured in inches instead of centimeters. Due to this, it is uncertain how exact the measurements are for that day because the units had to be converted. If this experiment was to be repeated, I would observe the caterpillars for longer than a week to fully observe the effects of Martin’s IGR on the life cycle of the caterpillar. This would also allow for the experiment to measure when the caterpillars pupate, a major indicator of how the IGR is affecting the caterpillar.
