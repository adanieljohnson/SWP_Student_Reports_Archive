Title: Increase of plant growth in Vigna radiata under Blue Light Conditions

Abstract:
Our initial goal in this experiment was to determine if there was a significant difference in plant growth under two different light conditions. Considering that most plants are grown under traditional clear light, we hypothesized that blue light would have a significant effect on the size of the plant during the growth process. We set up an experiment using the same type of Vigna radiata for each treatment. We watered both plants with the same amount of water for a two-week period, with the only difference being the color of the film that was draped over each category for their designated light condition. In the end, we found that our results did not support our hypothesis. We seemed to be in the middle of rejecting our null and accepting an alternative hypothesis. The data supported that there was not a significant difference in the overall size of the plants, only that the root: shoot ratio was noticeably higher in the plants that were grown with the normal colorless light. In comparison, the plants under blue light did grow to a slightly larger size than those under clear. 

Introduction:
Plants allocate their resources differently based on a variety of factors, light conditions being a major one. In an article published by the American Journal of Botany, it is stated that light levels have a strong correlation to average plant size, and the rate in which plants sexually reproduce (Pitelka et al. 1980). 

For this lab we tested Vigna radiata, and their resource allocation in different light conditions. We chose this experiment because, a steady energy resource is essential to the growth and survival of a plant. Just like other factors that affect growth, plants are capable of adapting to the availability of resources around them. If there is a low light resource for example, plants are able to make the necessary changes in order to put them in the best position for survival. An article in Ecology noted that in order to maximize plant growth, plants distribute biomass among their various organs to collect the most nutrients, water, light, and carbon dioxide as possible. 
(McConnaughay and Coleman 1999). We hypothesize that the plants grown under clear light will have a lower root to shoot ratio than those grown under blue light. I predict that the blue light condition will serve as a more effective energy resource versus the plants grown under clear light.


Materials and Methods:
This test will be conducted using two categories of Vigna radiata, or mung bean plants. One grown using blue light, and one with traditional clear light. We began by planting seeds for six plants total, three plants for each light condition. After planting our seeds in the soil, and watering them, we then draped blue film over the first set of three, and clear film over the other set. Placing both sets under an unfiltered lamp is sufficient, but a greenhouse is a great alternative. We watered the plants daily for two weeks, with the exception of one day on the weekend. The amount of water for each plant varied depending how dry they appeared, but in general we used the spay nozzle for roughly 10 seconds on each of the 6 plant pots. We used the "mist" setting on the water nozzle to avoid soil being ejected from the pots. Most importantly, after each time that we watered, we recovered the plants with their appropriate film to ensure they were receiving their appropriate light.  After the two-week period, we gathered our six plant pots, and started our measurements. For the plants grown under the blue light condition, we organized 3 groups of 3-6 "individual" plants from each of the 3 pots for a total of 9 groups. We repeated this step for the plants grown under clear light. Next, we measured the mass for each of the groups. We then compiled our data to calculate a mean and standard deviation for all nine groups. Lastly, we used these statistics to test our hypothesis with a two-sample t test along with a bar graph. Our independent variable was the blue and clear light conditions, while the growth of the plants was the dependent variable.

Results:
After the collection our plant masses, we calculated a mean of 2.51333333 g for blue light, along with a standard deviation of 0.30512293. For the clear treatment, the average was 2.495555556 g with a standard deviation of 0.253121256. Using our two-sample t-test​, we also found a p-value of 0.941821. 

Discussion:
According to our results, there was not a significant difference between the mean of plant masses under both light conditions, meaning that the data did not support our hypothesis. The difference was only a few hundredths of a gram, the blue being 2.513333333 grams, and the clear light being 2.495555556 grams. Our graph provides a visual to just how close the means actually were (Figure 1). The two-sample t test we conducted supported this notion with a t-value of 0.07767 grams and a p-value of 0.941821. By our p-value being much larger than 0.05, shows that the growth of the Vigna radiata was directly caused by our treatments, and not merely due to chance. Another article in the American Journal of Botany included a study on the distribution patterns of forest herbs and how they related to light. At the end of the study it showed that light had a significant effect on the results of the experiment (Anderson, Loucks, and Swain, 1969; Silva, 1978). In comparison to our study, we did not see too significant of a difference with growth under our two light treatments, but we did see that light certainly played a huge role in how much both plants grew. With a low source of lighting, it’s likely that the Vigna radiata would have not grown so large, no matter the treatment.
