Title: Lidocaine, a Sodium Channel Blocker, Causes an Increase of the Threshold Stimulus in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Rana pipiens Frog Leg

Abstract:
The mechanism behind muscle contraction greatly depends on voltage gated sodium channels. Motor neurons have axons that innervate muscles and form synapses at neuromuscular junctions on myofibers, the units that make up skeletal muscle. At these neuromuscular junctions, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine that activate sodium channels on the postsynaptic membrane, which later on generate an action potential that leads to the release of calcium ions. This experiment tested how the addition of a sodium channel blocker would impact the threshold stimulus of the Rana pipiens (Gastrocnemius), compared to the threshold stimulus of the muscle before it is subjected to the blocker. The hypothesis suggested that adding the sodium channel blocker to the muscle would increase the threshold stimulus value. The experiment was comprised of ten frog legs, each acting as its own control and treatment group. The threshold stimulus was determined by the data from the electrophysiological system. At the end of the investigation, an average threshold stimulus was calculated for the ten legs before and after they were treated with the sodium blocker. A paired t-test revealed that the addition of a sodium blocker, lidocaine, to the leg muscle significantly affected the the threshold stimulus.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments in milliseconds. Vertebrates and invertebrates are similar in that their skeletal muscle consists of thousands of myofibers, which are bundles of thin actin and myosin filament arranged in orderly fashion. These myofibers are bound together by connective tissue in groups that make up the entire skeletal muscle [Johnson: 2018]. Nerves and muscles work together to cause muscle contraction and movement. This is possible because motor neurons, located in the grey matter of the spinal cord, have axons that extend into a muscle and then branch out to innervate individual myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2018]. When an action potential arrives at this neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released from the motor neuron, passes through the synaptic cleft, and binds to the receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber. This opens sodium channels that generate an action potential in a muscle fiber. Muscle fibers contain T tubules that descend into the muscle fiber cytoplasm. The action potential propagates down the T tubule stimulating the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It is the release of calcium ions that allows the muscles to contract, and for animals to be mobile [Johnson:2018]. In order for muscles to contract, the opening of sodium potentials must propagate an action potential along the muscle fiber into a T tubule. In order for an action potential to be generated, the cell membrane must become depolarized so the action potential can travel down the cell. The action potential is generated when a cell membrane potential (charge difference across the membrane) becomes less negative. An action potential is only generated when the threshold stimulus is met. This is eventually met when positive sodium ions continuously rush into the cell, changing the membrane potential. In this experiment, we want to see test if injecting a frog leg muscle with a sodium channel blocker (lidocaine) will change the frog leg muscle’s threshold stimulus compared to the frog leg muscle not treated. Lidocaine is known to close sodium channels very well, as proved in another experiment. In this experiment, rats were bitten by a scorpion which had venom that caused rapid firing of action potentials leading to death. When injected with lidocaine, the rats were able to survive longer than those bitten and not injected with lidocaine [Al-Shanawani: 2005]. The threshold stimulus is the weakest stimulus that could generate an action potential. This can be measured because the frog leg muscle is attached to a probe that can send electrical signals (via voltage). The voltage that causes the first muscle twitch is considered the threshold stimulus. We are testing the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipens, the Northern Leopard Frog. Rana pipiens are good model organisms for this experiment because their muscle anatomy closely resembles that of a human, and experimental test results can be related back to humans. We hypothesize that the addition of a sodium channel blocker (lidocaine) to the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens frog will increase the threshold stimulus (V) compared to the same frog leg when it is not treated with the sodium channel blocker.

Materials and Methods:
In this laboratory investigation, two frog legs were obtained and dissected by the group for the purpose of experimentation. Each leg was tested for the threshold stimulus before and after the injection of the 25 mM Lidocaine, so each leg could serve as its own control and treatment group. To prepare the leg for experimentation, a certain procedure needed to be followed. First, the skin was pulled off the leg using forceps. The frog leg was continuously moistened with frog Ringer’s solution so the leg could remain ionized and not dry out. Next, the inner thigh muscles were gently separated revealing the sciatic nerve. The nerve was then freed from its surrounding connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. The last step in preparing the specimen involved detaching the gastrocnemius muscle (thigh) at the Achilles tendon, tying a knot at the site of the Achilles incision, and tying that knot to the to the top of the iWorx electrophysiological recorder. Two needle probes were then inserted into the upper and lower regions of the muscle to deliver the voltage. Once the specimen was prepared correctly, each leg was tested to determine the minimum number of volts required to reach the threshold stimulus. This was done by gradually increasing the voltage on the machine until the muscle twitched. This same thing was done to the frog legs after they were both injected with 1 mL of 25mM lidocaine, the sodium channel blocker. A paired t-test was administered to compare the mean of the treatment group after the addition of lidocaine to the control group which was not treated. The paired t-test test was done to see if the data was statistically significant. 

Results:
Because of the complexity of the dissection, the group was only able to obtain two frog legs to test. Therefore, only four data points (voltage required to reach threshold potential) were recorded. To make the statistical test more powerful, our TA provided us with the voltage required to reach threshold potential for eight other frog legs. At the conclusion of the experiment, almost every frog leg after treated with the sodium channel blocker lidocaine had a higher threshold stimulus (volts required for muscle contraction) than the same leg muscle before it was treated. This is proven in the bar graph showing the average threshold stimulus difference between the legs before and after lidocaine was injected (Figure 1).  The only frog leg (out of the 10 total) to not demonstrate this pattern was frog leg two, who threshold stimulus was lower after the addition of the sodium channel blocker. The legs before being treated had an average threshold stimulus at 0.151 +/- 0.11 V, while the legs after being treated with the lidocaine had an average threshold stimulus at 0.362 +/- 0.21 V (Figure 1). A paired t-test showed that the threshold stimulus mean of the legs after they were treated was significantly greater than its mean before treatment (t-sta t= 4.77, df =9, P =0.001).

Discussion:
The initial hypothesis was supported because the p-value that resulted from a paired t-test indicated that the results were significant. A p-value this low indicated that the mean of the treatment group (after injection of lidocaine) and the control group (before the injection of lidocaine) were statistically different. The purpose of this experiment was to observe if injecting a sodium channel blocker in the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens would have a higher threshold stimulus compared to the muscle before injection. The threshold stimulus is the weakest stimulus that could generate an action potential and twitch the muscle. In this lab, the threshold stimulus was determined by the voltage being delivered from the electrophysiological machine to the probes attached to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg [Johnson:18]. The voltage increase that caused the first twitch was representative of the threshold stimulus. It is predicted that the leg after injection of lidocaine will have a higher threshold stimulus than the legs before injection of the sodium channel blocker because of the role sodium plays in generating an action potential. In order for muscles to contract, sodium channels need to be open so they can propagate the electrical signal down a muscle cell. At resting potential, a cell membrane has a potential of around -60 and -70 mV [Johnson:2018]. Sodium ions are positive, so when the channels are open, sodium ions race into the cell, down the electrochemical gradient. This buildup of sodium ions in the cell causes the membrane potential to depolarize (around -55mv), opening more voltage-gated sodium channels as the wave of depolarization reaches them. This is important in muscle cells because an action potential needs to travel down a T-Tubule to help with the release of calcium ions, the reason muscles are able to contract. Lidocaine, the solution injected into the leg of the treatment legs, is a sodium channel blocker. In a muscle cell, if sodium channels are blocked, it is harder for the cell membrane to depolarize, making it harder for muscles to contract. Voltage is the underlying force that causes electrically charged particles to move between two points. In wires, electrical current is carried by electrons. Across cell membranes, electrical current is carried by sodium ions. It makes sense that the leg treated with lidocaine requires more volts to reach the threshold stimulus because if sodium channels are blocked, the ions can’t carry the electrical current required to enter a T-tubule and release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because less sodium ions would be carrying the electrical current, voltage needs to be increased to pick up the slack for the closed sodium channels because the electrical current needed to release the calcium ions can also be carried by the electrons from increasing voltage. It makes sense that the control legs would require less voltage to reach the threshold stimulus because more sodium ions are present in the cell (no sodium blocker) to carry an electrical current. This difference in data shows that lidocaine is a successful sodium channel blocker. 
     This was constant in another experiment involving lidocaine. Scorpion venom toxins act on sodium channels by increasing their release from the voltage gated sodium channels, causing rapid action potentials that increase the release of neurotransmitters [Al-Shanawani: 2005]. This increased release of neurotransmitters causes systems in the body to begin shutting down. Some mice were injected with this venom and were given heavy doses of lidocaine. The control mice were injected with the venom, but did not receive lidocaine. It was determined by the end of the experiment that lidocaine greatly prolonged the survival time of the mice injected with venom by blocking the sodium channels that the venom wanted to attack [Al-Shanawani: 2005]. This is again proving that lidocaine is successful at blocking sodium channels. Overall, the experiment went well. One error in the lab could have been seen in frog leg 2. I believe we may have poked the needle through the muscle, not getting a lot of the lidocaine into the muscle. This could be why the treatment had a lower threshold stimulus than the control. To improve on this experiment, I think exact amounts of lidocaine should be tested against each other to see the effect of different amounts of lidocaine.
