Title: Effects of Acetylcholine of Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
The release of acetylcholine into the synapse of the nerve terminal is vital to the ability of a muscle to release Ca2+ and contract [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment involves the stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve in three different frog legs and how the voltage of the contraction will be effected by an injection of acetylcholine into the muscle. The hypothesis is that the addition of the acetylcholine will successfully increase the voltage of the contraction in comparison to the voltage of the controll group without the acetylcholine. A statistical test was used to analyze the data and found that there was statistically significent evidence that our hypothesis is supported by our data. In conclusion, these results are similar to other studies and they signify the importance of acetylcholine in muscle contraction.


Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are the muscles in the body that allow organisms to move. In order for a muscle to contract, the release of acetylcholine into the synapse is required to trigger the release of Ca2+, and, in turn, this will cause myosin filaments to move and the muscle contracts [Johnson: 2018]. A study done for the National Institute of Medical Research states that, “certain doses of acetylcholine injected arterially produced in denervated muscle ‘a double effect, consisting of an initial, sharply topped contraction, followed by a secondary, slow contracture’” [Brown: 1937]. Furthermore, this indicates acetylcholine’s crucial role in the contraction of muscles. A myogram shows how a muscle moves through the three stages of muscle contraction: latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase [Johnson: 2018]. The latent period is the very brief period between the stimulation and when the muscle contracts, the contraction phase is when the muscle constricts, and the relaxation phase occurs after the muscles go back to their original size [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment will involve the stimulation of the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve in a frog leg. In this experiment, we will be testing three frog legs to see if an injection of acetylcholine changes the voltage at which the muscle contracts. The hypothesis is that the addition of the acetylcholine will cause an increase of acetylcholine in the synapse, and, as a result, will create a contraction at a higher voltage under the same amplitude as the controll group. 


Materials and Method:
The three frog legs will be prepped be revealing the gastrocnemus and nerve, stringing up the leg, and placing sensors into the muscle and nerve for stimulation. We will use the three frog legs and test each under an amplitude of 5 and stimulate each to get three contractions on the myogram to calculate the three voltages. After doing this for each frog leg, we will then inject 0.1 Ml of acetylcholine into the muscle and allow it to get into the system and take effect for a minute before running a stimulation. Then, under the same amplitude, we will test each frog leg with the injected acetylcholine in order to record three contractions and calculate three voltages for each leg. A paired t_test will be used to test if the addition of the acetylcholine did actually increase the voltage of the contraction in the treatment group. 


Results:
All of the voltages for each of the frog legs in the controll group were all relatively small. In comparison with the voltages in the treatment group, the controll group voltages were all significently lower than the three voltages recorded for each individual frog leg in the treatment group (Refer to Figure 1 and 3). The voltages recorded for each group were averaged out and the differences between the treatment and controll groups were calculated and can be seen in Figure 1. The p_value (p = 0.024025) indicates that there is significent evidence to reject the null-hypothesis (Refer to Figure 2).


Discussion:
The goal of the experiment was to be able to determine if injecting frog legs with Acetylcholine would increase the voltage of the contractions of the gastrocnemus muscle by comparing the controll group voltages with the treatment group voltages under the same amplitude. After performing one tailed paired t_test, there is statistically significent evidence that supports the hypothesis that the voltages in the treatment group were higher than the voltages in the controll group. This means that the null hypothesis can be rejected (p = 0.024025). It can be inferenced that the injected Acetylcholine did have an effect on the increased voltage of the contraction of the frog leg. A study in The Japanese Journal of Physiology discusses a study where they found that the action potentials of sympathetic ganglion cells are directly affected by Acetylcholine. These action potentials are what controlls the release of Ca2+ and ultimately leads to the contraction of the muscle fiber [Kuba: 1976]. This suggests the importance of Acetylcholine in the process of muscle contraction.
