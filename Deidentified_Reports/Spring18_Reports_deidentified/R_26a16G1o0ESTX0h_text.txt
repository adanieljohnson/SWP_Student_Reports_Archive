Title: The effect of blocking 20E on growth of Manduca Caterpillars 

Abstract:
This experiment looked into the effects of 20E blokcer, AzaMax on the molting of Manduca Sexta larvae. It is shown by the experiment that the caterpillars that treated with the AzaMax grow smaller than the one not treated with AzaMax, which seems to support the prediction that the caterpillars in experimental groups will not molt. However, it might be caused by food avoidance of the caterpillars.

Introduction:
It is commonly known that hormone regulates the behaviors of insects. A specific kind of hormone, growth hormone, controls the growth of the insect throughout all metamorphosis stages. During the larvae stage of one insect, Juvenile Hormones(JH) and Ecdysone(20E) control the molting of the larvae[Johnson: 2018]. While JH regulates the type of molting, 20E controls the time of molting. In this lab report, 20E is of particular interest, because 20E infusion induces the apolysis and deposition of pupal cuticle, which is a critical step of the metamorphosis of an insect[Nijhout: 1976]. More specifically, in this lab, the effect of blocking the secretion of 20E is studied. And Manduca Sexta caterpillar is used as the experimental subject. It is predicted that the when the secretion of 20E is blocked, the caterpillar will stop molting and stay in the same size.

Materials and Methods:
There were 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars used in experiment. They were divided into 2 groups, control and experimental. The lengths and weights were firstly measured with a ruler and a balance. Each group was then evenly distributed into 2 plastic containers; while each container had an index card in the middle to separate the two caterpillars. After labeling the 4 plastic containers, 10g of food was weighed and provided for each caterpillar; for the caterpillars in experimental groups, their food was stirred with 5 drops of AzaMax, a chemical that contains azadirachtin, which is believed to be a 20E blocker. The 4 containers were put into an incubator. The lengths and weights of each caterpillar were then collected each day of the following week. 


Results:
Visual Observation:
The food in experimental groups haven’t been added or replaced during the whole week, because the caterpillars didn’t eat much of the food. And the experimental caterpillars didn’t poop a lot compared to the other group. 


Discussion:
According to Figs. 1 and 2, the caterpillars all show increases in their lengths while only control groups have shown increases in their weights. In addition, a two-sampled T-Test shows that there is significance difference between the growth of caterpillars given the normal food and the ones treated with the AzaMax. Therefore, the stated hypothesis that the chemical used to block the secretion of 20E restricts the Manduca Manduca caterpillars from growing larger seems to be confirmed. However, there is another possibility that may lead to the same result observed. According to the visual observations, the food prepared for the 4 caterpillars in the experimental groups haven’t been eaten much at the end of the experiment. This indicates that the experimental caterpillars didn’t have enough nutrients for growth compared to the other 4 in the control group. The behavior of food avoidance was studied by R. Bezzar-Bendjazia and his colleagues. They found out that when the Drosophila larvae was treated with azadirachtin during their early stages, their food intakes were significantly decreased. This was due to that the azadirachitin reduced the activity of some larval enzymes while increased the activity of lipase, affecting the insect’s ability to digest food[Bezzar-Bendjazia: 2017].
