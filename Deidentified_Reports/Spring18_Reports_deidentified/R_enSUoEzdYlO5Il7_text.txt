Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca sexta Development (weight)

Abstract:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, are common caterpillars that cause defoliation of plants, affecting the environment when they are in their larvae stage of development. The study addresses the impact of an insect growth hormones, Precor, has on the growth and development of tobacco hornworms during their development in their larvae stage. The study addresses the following question: Does Precor inhibit Manduca sexta weight before caterpillars enter the pupa phase of their holometaboulous life cycle? Groups of caterpillars receiving Precor (experimental group) in their food and some receiving dilute water (control group) in their food were analyzed in order to prove that Precor, a juvenile hormone regulator, effects the development of Manduca sexta. After seven days of weighing the caterpillars a statistical test, T-test, was performed in order to obtain a p-value, showing the statistical significance between the control and experimental means. The test showed if there was a direct correlation between Precor and the weights of the caterpillars in each group. Although it was witnessed that Precor stunted the growth of the Manduca Sexta, the p-value obtained was greater than 0.05 meaning that the data obtained was statistically insignificant. 

Introduction:
The species studied in the experiment are Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta are insects in the order Lepidoptera, which include moths, butterflies, and skippers [1]. They are known as tobacco hornworms, due to their worm-like figure and pointed horn like posterior [2]. Other common names include, hawk moth, sphinx moth, and Carolina sphinx [1]. The average life cycle of Manduca sexta are between nineteen to twenty-three days; however, the timing of the life cycle can change depending on their diet, average daily temperature, and external environment [1]. Manduca sexta go through a holometabolous life cycle, which include four main life cycles; egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult phases [1]. This study will be examining the larvae phase of Manduca sexta, because only during this phase can they cause defoliation of economic important crops in the environment [2]. Juvenile hormone is a hormone found in caterpillars that play a large role in the development and growth of Manduca sexta. The juvenile hormone works to delay metamorphosis throughout the larvae stage of development by blocking the genes in the imaginal discs. These are cells that start the pupa stage of development [2]. Juvenile Hormone is essential to the development of Manduca sexta as they ensure the growth of larvae, while preventing metamorphosis [3]. This study addresses the impact of an insect growth regulator (IGR), Precor, on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae. Precor may inhibit growth of the larvae and prevent further plant and economic damage. Precor— a type of juvenile hormone modulator—will be used to test the effect it has on the weight of Manduca sexta during the time it is in its larvae stage. The null hypothesis states that there is no significant change in the weight of Manduca sexta with differing amounts or Precor. The alternate hypothesis states that there is a significant change in the weight of Manduca sexta with differing amounts or Precor. In this experiment, it will be expected that the null hypothesis will be rejected, while the alternate hypothesis will be accepted. The hypothesis of the experiment is if Manduca sexta are given five drops of Precor, then the experimental group will have a lower weight than the Manduca sexta on the control group on average after seven days. 

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta were obtained and housed in round plastic containers with perforated lids. Each container contained two larvae, one control larvae and one experimental larvae, and were divided in half with an index card. This totaled four plastic containers and a total of four control larvae and four experimental larvae.  Each larva was fed 10 grams of food every day for seven days. The control group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of dilute water using a pipet and spoon to mix. The experimental group was given 10 grams of food mixed with 5 drops of Precor (1:1250 dilution) using a different transfer pipet. The food mixtures were placed on the inside of the containers in a ball like structure, preventing the food from drying out. In addition of the larvae being fed every day, weights were collected every day for seven consecutive days. We further tested the development of Manduca sexta by performing a T-test, which found the p-value, showing the statistical different between the control and experimental means in order to see if our null or alternate hypothesis would be supported or refuted. 

Results:
The results from the data and bar graph depict several general trends. According to the graph and observations it is clear that the control group larvae experienced more growth than the experimental group larvae (Fig. 1). The results are expected as the experimental group was given the IGR, Precor, which has juvenile hormone as its main ingredient, delaying the metamorphosis phase of Manduca sexta. The control group was not given Precor, which did not affect the growth and development of the caterpillars. During the lab, a test was used in order to analyze and compare the differing populations means, the mean of the experimental group and the mean of the control group. More specifically, a t-test was used to find the statistical significance between both populations means. According to our observation the procedure of the experiment appeared to be successful as Precor had a negative impact on the development of Manduca sexta, as the bar of the control group was taller than the experimental group bar on the bar graph (Fig.1); however, after analyzing the data and performing a t-test, the p-value was determined to be 0.0503. The p-value obtained was slightly high, as a p-value over 0.05 implies that the data obtained was statistically insignificant, supporting the null hypothesis [4]. The mean total weight of the control Manduca sexta was 7.47 g+/-0.431 g. The mean total weight of the treatment Manduca sexta was 6.22 g+/-0.926 g, which was not significantly different from the control (p=0.0503, t=2.44), due to the p-value over 0.05.

Discussion:
The result from this study highlights several patterns in the development of Manduca sexta that merit further attention. First of all, the results do not support the hypothesis that if Manduca Sexta are given five drops of Precor, the experimental will have a lower weight than the Manduca on the control group on average. This was due to the fact that the null hypothesis was favored over the alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis was supported because the p-value obtained was 0.0503, and there was a slight overlap between the two error bars on the graph. Since, the p-value found was above 0.05 the data was statistically insignificant [3]. Although the results were not as expected the experiment does indeed demonstrate the effectiveness of Precor on Manduca sexta development during the larval stage of development. The bar graph highlights how the control group caterpillars weighed more on average than the treatment group caterpillars after seven days (Fig.1). Also, showing how Precor was marginally effective, as the experimental group weighed less that the control group on average after seven days. Finally, our observations also highlighted the effectiveness that juvenile hormone has on the delay of metamorphosis on Manduca sexta, as the hormone is the main ingredient in the IGR, Precor, used in the lab. Although, the p-value obtained resulted in statistically insignificant data, the p-value may be considered marginal as it was relatively close to being under 0.05, allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions on the effectiveness of the experiment [4]. A slightly high p-value could have resulted from possible cross contaminations of precor and water during the experiment or due to caterpillars crawling under the note card and eating the other groups food. This was evident as the second caterpillar in the experimental group weighed significantly more than the rest of the experimental group caterpillars, altering the average change in weight between the experimental group caterpillars over 7 days. Using extreme caution and a better divider than a not card could prevent possible contamination of Manduca sexta food. Our results from our experiment highlight a need to research more on the effectiveness of IGR’s on the larvae stage of Manduca sexta, as they are causing significant defoliation of plants, which are crucial for a healthful environment [2].
