Title: Increase in root-shoot length ratio for sand environments on Fagopyrum esculentum 

Abstract:
Environments are constantly changing, and organisms must cope with these changes to survive. Plants have evolved a process called resource allocation to thrive amidst the changing environment. The purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of resource allocation by controllling the different soil environments of the plant Fagopyrum esculentum and measuring the plant's responses by notingroot to shoot lengths of the plant in the different types of soil. We hypothesized that in a sand environment, which is nutrient deprived, the root to shoot length ratios of F. esculentum would be longer than those in the soil environment because the plants could gain more nutrition by investing in a more extensive root network to maximize nutrient acquisition from the sand. The results indicated that there was no statistically significent difference in root to shoot length ratios between the F. esculentum grown in sand and in soil. Therefore it cannot be concluded that different types of soil, specifically the nutrient deprived, cause plants to undergo resource allocation whereby the plant diverts energy to growing longer roots to absorb more nutrients. This newly found knowledge will help the agricultural industry have a better understanding of how to grow plants in sandy landscapes. 

Introduction:
Over time many scientific studies have progressed the knowledge of how plants survive in their changing environments. These studies have supported that plants survive in their environments by a process called resource allocation [Grime, J.P.: 1977]. Resource allocation is defined as the relative amount of two resources that can be acquired for a given expenditure of reserve [Bloom Arnold: 1985]. Plants use resource allocation by diverting energy that is required for one process and using that extra energy to help perform another process that is more beneficial to the plant. An example of this is the following: if the plant is living in an area with some shade and a nutrient poor soil, then the plant will restrict spending energy on forming a cuticle wax layer and put the extra energy towards growing more roots to obtain more nutrients from the soil. In this experiment, we will examine how resource allocation changes in various soil environments affects the plant's growth patterns. 
	The proposed question is whether the effects of resource allocation on plants in sand environments significently differs from soil environments, and the dependent variable is the ratio of root to shoot lengths and weights of the plants. The results to this question are important because they can help the agricultural industry learn how to more efficiently grow crops in sandy landscapes to obtain a better harvest season. Additionally, the data will help scientists predict how future generations of plants such as F. esculentum will respond to new environments, because if the plants die, then they will no longer contribute to providing oxygen that humans need to breathe. The hypothesis states that F. esculentum will have a greater root to shoot ratio in the nutrient-lacking sand environment in relation to those that are grown in the soil landscape because the plants will invest in more roots to maximize nutrient absorption in the sand. 


Materials and Method:
The experiment was performed by means of planting Fagopyrum esculentum in two different types of soil: one type was sand, and the other type was normal soil. The sand was poured in 3 planter's bins up to the ¾ mark, and the same procedure was performed for the soil. After that, approximately 20 seeds were planted in each planter's bin. After the seeds were planted, the three sand planter bins were filled to the top with sand, and the three soil bins were filled to the top with soil. Finally, approximately 20 Ml of liquid fertilizer was poured in each of the six planter bins. Then the planter's bins were placed in a tray and placed in the greenhouse. The plants were watered daily until water was leaking out underneath each of the planter bins. The first step of our data collection was to take three plants out of each of the six bins and wash them in water. Then we cut at the root and shoot junction for each plant, measuring the root and shoot lengths. Then the root lengths were divided by the shoot lengths to get the root to shoot ratios. Finally, a two-sampled t test was calculated with an alpha value of 0.5 to see if the data were significently different. 

Results:
The graph of root to shoot length ratio is seen below (Figure 1). The trends showed that there were higher root to shoot length ratios for Fagopyrum esculentum in the sand environment compared to the soil environment (Table 1, Figure 1). The mean and standard deviation for root to shoot length ratio for soil was 0.44±0.065 mm and for sand it was 0.59±0.097 mm. The means of root to shoot length ratios for sand and for soil were not found to be statistically significent (p=0.097, d.f.=3.46, t=-2.25). 

Discussion:
The graph of root to shoot length ratio is seen below (Figure 1). The trends showed that there were higher root to shoot length ratios for Fagopyrum esculentum in the sand environment compared to the soil environment (Table 1, Figure 1). The mean and standard deviation for root to shoot length ratio for soil was 0.44±0.065 mm and for sand it was 0.59±0.097 mm. The means of root to shoot length ratios for sand and for soil were not found to be statistically significent (p=0.097, d.f.=3.46, t=-2.25). 

Discussion: We hypothesized that in a sand environment, which is nutrient deprived compared to the soil environment, the root to shoot length ratio of Fagopyrum esculentum would be longer than that in the soil environment, assuming that the plants would develop more extensive root networks to maximally obtain nutrients in the sand. The resulting data did not support this hypothesis; the means of root to shoot length ratio for the sand and soil environments were not significently different (Table 1). One explanation for this finding is that the seeds used in conducting the experiment were expired and had mold growing on them. The results may have been different if the seeds had not expired, because they may have grown more and functioned as normal, healthy plant seeds would have. Also, one of the data points collected for the sand environment was an outlier compared to the other data points, potentially affecting the significance of the data. This outlier could have resulted from a design flaw of not getting enough water or sunlight because it was very small in relation to the other data points. A biological explanation for why the data were not significently different is because the plants did not have enough time to grow longer roots in the two-week time span. The short time span was not enough for the plant to reallocate resources with a significent difference. Finally, another biological reason for the observed data is that the seeds were buried too deep in the soil and could not obtain enough sunlight to grow properly. This one experiment may not have provided significent data, but other experiments have been conducted on plant resource allocation as well, and their results support plant plasticity in biomass allocation in response to limiting resources, meaning that they reallocate energy depending on their environmental needs (Coleman John: 1999). 
	In conclusion, the failed significance for root to shoot length ratio can be explained for many reasons, but the data achieved will help in the future to better understand how Fagopyrum esculentum and other plants will respond to their future environments. This along with other studies have concluded that resource allocation is crucial to the plant's survival status in the case of nutrients, because biomass allocation is a major factor in the response of plants to limiting resource supply. This data will help give a better understanding to farmers of how to more efficiently grow crops and how scientists can further prevent the extinction of plants amidst changing environments. With this experiment and future experiments, scientists gain more knowledge on how to allow plants to survive and thrive through a better understanding of the resource allocation process.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1:  Means and standard deviations of root and shoot ratio lengths. In the sand environment, the lengths and root to shoot ratios are greater than those of the soil environment. 

Figure 1: Effect of environment on root to shoot length ratio means.  The root to shoot length ratio is higher for Fagopyrum esculentum in sand environments than in soil environments because plant resource allocation in nutrient poor environments, such as sand, typically causes the roots to grow longer, and the shoots to grow shorter. The error bars represent the standard deviations of the means.
