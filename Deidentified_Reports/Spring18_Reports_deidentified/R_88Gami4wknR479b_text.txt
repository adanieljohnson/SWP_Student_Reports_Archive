Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of the study on Manduca sexta was to determine whether more juvenile hormone would keep the worms smaller compared to those which were not fed the hormone. Our hypothesis stated we believed the hormone would stunt the growth of the worms that were fed it compared to those which were fed only food and water. Maduca sexta is commonly used in these types of studies for its simplicity with certain hormones, in the sense that they have a clear purpose in the worm and manipulating them would be observable. We fed the hornworms every day for eight days replacing the food every day. We used 7 drops of Martins’ IGR (JH) in the experimental group’s food and 7 drops of water in the control group’s food. We found than on average, the experimental group of Manduca sexta were smaller than the control group of hornworms. We had one outlier in the experimental group that grew to be the largest worm which caused our hypothesis to not be supported. 

Introduction:
 Maduca sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera. This group includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. Manduca sexta also have many common names including sphinx moth, hawk moth, tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx. Manduca sexta caterpillars have a life cycle of egg first, then taking 3-5 days to become the first instar larva, then takes 2-3 days to reach 2nd instar larva and another 2-3 days to become a 3rd instar larva. Then 2-3 days to become a 4th instar larva and 4 days to become a 5th instar larva. Finally, it takes 5 days to become a pupa then 19-23 days to become an adult moth. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is found naturally in these insects to ensure growth of the larva while preventing metamorphosis. Juvenile hormones are long chain organic molecules which are made primarily by the corpus allata. The corpus allata is a pair of glands located on each side of the foregut. The hornworms are a good animal to use in this experiment because M. sexta larvae “contain a binding protein which has a high affinity for JH” (Sanburg: 1975). There are many different juvenile hormones, but most act almost the same way. During development, JH “regulates the type of molt” (Johnson: 2016). In adult insects, JH is like the other hormone in horn worms called ecdysterone in it controls multiple functions.  
	We wanted to test the affect the juvenile hormone had on Maduca sexta. By testing this, we could learn the reaction that the horn worms had to being fed more juvenile hormone. We need to learn the types of changes that the worms go through due to juvenile hormone. It is determined that the hormone “exert[s] a repressive effect on the course of development during larval life” that is why it is essential to experiment on the worm while it is still a larva and not yet a pupa (Sanburg: 1975). In our experiment increasing the amount of JH in the hornworms’ diet should lead to smaller worms compared to the control group, so the JH is expected to hinder the growth of those hornworms that are fed more of it. 


Materials and Methods:
Our group used 4 mL of Martin’s IGR (a juvenile hormone analogue which mimics JH but is not actually Manduca JH) with 100 mL of water with 60 mL of food. We separated the six worms into two groups. We put 7 drops of water, roughly 70uL, in amount 10 grams of food for each of 3 control worms. We put 7 drops of the hormone in about 10 grams of food for the other 3 worms. The worms were kept in a controlled environment in a refrigerator type machine at room temperature. We came into the room every day at the same time to feed the worms and monitor their growth. The food was cleaned out and replaced everyday with the same amount of everything. The two-sample t-test was used to compare the control group to the experimental group. 

Results:
We found that on average, the worms that were fed the juvenile hormone were smaller than the control worms. However; JH worm #2 grew to 11.19 grams from 1.02 grams, and was clearly the biggest worm despite being fed the hormone. The average difference between the two groups of worms at the end of the experiment was 2.44 grams. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=1.18, df=4, P=0.302). However; the averages shown is figure 1 were aligning with our hypothesis, but when we ran the test to determine if they were significantly different, the outlier in the experimental group made more of a difference and made the it insignificant. Figure 2 shows the total average of the changes in weight for each group with the standard deviation. 

Discussion:
	Technically, our results did not support our hypothesis due to the fact that the p-value was greater than 0.05. However; without the outlier in the experimental group that grew from 1.02 grams to 11.19 grams, the results would’ve supported our hypothesis since on average the experimental group was smaller than the control group. Ignoring the outlier worm, the experimental group was given more juvenile hormone than the control worms, which slowed the growth of those worms. As mentioned earlier, the addition of the JH regulates the type of mort, and as shown in most of our results, the JH slowed down the worms’ growth. 
	Due to the discrepancies in our data, it would be wise to run another experiment which focuses on the same hypothesis, but with more specific variables. In the next experiment, we could run tests on multiple groups. Our results did not compare well with the results of most other published studies due to the heavy worm (outlier) in our experimental group. However; there has been evidence that “the “JH” produced fluctuates according to the developmental stage of donors” which could mean that the one worm was in a different stage than the other worms (Baker: 2003). On the other hand, our hypothesis does correlate with most other studies that supported that more JH keeps the hornworms smaller than hornworms not fed as much JH.  We could have one control group, one group with 5 drops of JH in their food, and another group with 10 drops of JH in their food. After analyzing the results of that experiment, it would be easier to understand the effect of JH on the worms in different doses. Due to the outlier, other future studies should look at the same experiment with a larger sample size. This could be useful for animals if they need to live in small spaces, perhaps evolutionarily, animals that needed to stay smaller for long periods of their development had higher traces of juvenile hormone in their bodies.
