Title: The Effects of Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to observe the effects of Martin’s Insect Growth Regulator on the growth and life cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. The experiment will be performed by separating eight caterpillars into two groups of four. One group will receive a control diet while the other is fed the same diet with six drops of Martin’s IGR added to it. Each caterpillar will be fed 10g of food to ensure proper nutrition. Due to the knowledge that JH causes hormonal imbalances in the caterpillars, it is expected that Martin’s IGR would make the caterpillars grow more in a shorter amount of time compared to the control group due to the Juvenile Hormone deficiency. The JH deficiency will cause the caterpillars to speed up their life cycle and transition into adults faster.

Introduction:
The purpose of the lab was to observe the effects of Martin’s IGR on growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Martin’s IGR is an insect growth regulator that functions by blocking the production of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the caterpillars. JH is a hormone that is essential for the caterpillars to continue in their life cycle and pupate. The life cycle of the caterpillar is driven by differing ratios of JH and Ecdysterone (20E). 20E is a multifunctional hormone in insects but is vital to control the timing of molting. Before a caterpillar can pupate and turn into an adult, it must go through the commitment pulse, a phase in life where the caterpillar recognizes it is time to pupate by a having a large drop in JH and an increase in 20E. By blocking the production of JH in the caterpillars, Martin’s IGR causes the caterpillars to enter the commitment pulse earlier and causes the caterpillars to develop into adults. Thus, by blocking JH production, the caterpillars should grower heavier and longer faster than the normal rate of growth and they will pupate faster due to the lack of exposure to high levels of JH.

Materials and Methods:
Eight larval stage Manduca sexta caterpillars were used for the lab. The caterpillars were split into two groups of 4 and were provided food every day for a week. Plastic containers were used to house the caterpillars. Each container would house two caterpillars that were split by a flashcard. The caterpillars would be fed pre-made food. Four of the caterpillars would be part of the control group that would be fed the pre-made caterpillar food treated with six drops of water. The experimental group would be fed the same caterpillar food however their food would be treated with six drops of Martin’s IGR. The food was prepared by weighing out 10 g of food per caterpillar and then adding the treatment to the food. The food was then mixed and 10 g were distributed to each caterpillar. Each caterpillar was weighed in grams and measured in centimeters at the start of the experiment and every day until the end of the experiment. Pictures were taken of the caterpillars on the first day of the experiment and on the last day of the experiment to compare size and color.


Results:
In the measurement of average difference in mass, the control group had an average of 8.4675g with a standard deviation of 0.262345192 while the experimental group had an average of 8.2800g with a standard deviation of 0.609644705. Thus, the control group had a higher average. However, the p-value for the difference in mass was recorded as 0.592543, which means the data has a high chance it occurred by chance and was not influenced by the experiment. In the measurements of average difference in length of the caterpillars, the control group reported an average of 3.3 cm with a standard deviation of 0.21602469 and the experimental group had an average of 3.845 with a standard deviation of 0.267145404. The average difference in length of the caterpillars was calculated to have a p-value of 0.019254. This is a significant number and means the data reported in the length of the caterpillars occurred due to some outside factor other than by chance.


Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, only part the hypothesis was upheld. It should be noted that not enough time was given for the experiment to test whether or not the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR would pupate or not. According to the data shown above, Martin’s IGR and the decreased exposure to JH had little to no effect on the mass of the of the caterpillars, as shown by the high p-value recorded and also that the control group had a higher average difference in mass than the experimental group. However, Martin’s IGR did have an effect on the average difference in length of the bugs. The p-value of 0.019254 and the fact that the experimental group had a higher average difference in length than compared to the control group shows that the increase in JH had an impact on the length of the caterpillars. The standard deviations for all the groups were relatively low and remained concentrated around the averages that were used to calculate them. The highest standard deviation belonged to the difference in average mass of the experimental group, which had a standard deviation of 0.609644705. It was also observed that the caterpillars that were treated with the IGR by the end of the experiment were lighter in color than those of the control group. Finally, on Day 5 of recording the length of the caterpillars, the lengths were measured in inches instead of centimeters. Due to this, it is uncertain how exact the measurements are for that day because the units had to be converted.
