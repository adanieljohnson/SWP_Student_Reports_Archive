Title: Manduca sexta and the Suppression of 20-hydroxyecdysone

Abstract:
We conducted a seven-day experiment and in this experiment, we tested Manduca sexta hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) to see how it effects some developmental aspects of the caterpillar. We discovered that the average weights for out experiment and control group were statistically significant, and the experimental group was severely malnourished. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, a type of moth, is a model organism that is often used to study the nervous system [1]. These caterpillars develop in four stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult moth; and development, molting and metamorphosis, are controlled by several hormones in the endocrine system but the most important are the sesquiterpenoid juvenile hormone (JH) and the steroid ecdysone and its active metabolite 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) [2]. This study focused on the function of 20E as it relates to molting. We hypothesized that the blockage of 20E by AzaMax, a natural insecticide placed in the food of the experimental group [3], will cause the caterpillars to not molt; therefore, the caterpillars will be undernourished and not survive into adulthood. 

Materials and Methods:
Materials 
1.	4 round, plastic containers to house the Manduca sexta
2.	4 perforated lids
3.	Index cards and tape to divide each container in half
4.	Manduca sexta food 
5.	Spoon
6.	1 square container to mix the food
7.	Balance
8.	Transfer 
9.	8 Manduca sexta caterpillars

Methods
Creating the Housing Units for the Caterpillars
1.	Divide the round containers by folding each end of an index card about 1 cm. 
2.	Tape to the inside of the container. 
3.	Add food and the caterpillars. 
4.	Label properly.
o	Group name, caterpillar ID, treatment or control, lab section

Feeding the Caterpillars 
1.	Measure 10 g of food for each Manduca that you use
o	If you have 4 experimental caterpillars and 4 controls, (using a CLEAN spoon) weigh 80 g of food in a square container. Be sure to “Zero out” the balance.
2.	Control
o	Weigh 10 g of food for each of your control caterpillars and place in a new container (30-40 g)
o	With a transfer pipet, add 28 drops of distilled water for every 10 g of food. This liquid should match the amount that you are putting in the treatment food.
o	Keeping the food in as big a clump as possible to keep from drying out, place 10 g of food in each control caterpillar home.
3.	Experimental 
o	Weigh 10 g of food for each of your experimental caterpillars and place in a new container (30-40 g)
o	Using a NEW transfer pipet, add 28 drops of 20E for every 10 g of food. Stir well.
o	Keeping the food in as big a clump as possible to keep from drying out, place 10 g of food in each control caterpillar home.
4.	Place the four containers in the incubator and for six consecutive days follow the instructions above to feed the manduca sexta. 


Results:
Our hypothesis was confirmed in this experiment because the controls were significantly bigger in weight than the experimental. The results of the different statistical tests also correlated this data. 

Discussion:
Over the course of the experiment we could visibly see the difference between the control and experimental groups because the controls were so much larger in size. Even though we could not see anything molting, and we assumed it had happened over night in the incubator away from sight, this study still confirmed our hypothesis and showed that the weights of the control and experimental were statistically significant because mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 6.430049, df = 4, P = 0.003008). Also, we had to discard control 2 and experimental 4 because they were outliers that were distorting our data. From our results we concluded that the impediment of 20E is quite detrimental to the health of the manduca sexta because it causes the caterpillar to become undernourished to not make it to adulthood. If trying to replicate it would be beneficial to increase the amount of manduca sexta in the experiment to obtain more accurate results. A future experiment would be to test the blockage of JH and see how that would affect the molting of the caterpillar.
