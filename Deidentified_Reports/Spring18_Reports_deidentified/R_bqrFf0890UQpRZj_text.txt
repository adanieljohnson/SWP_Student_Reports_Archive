Title: Effect of Ecdysone Inhibitor on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to test if inhibiting the hormone ecdysone with Aza Guard in Manduca sexta caterpillars will lead to smaller caterpillars. The molting and increasing of size of Manduca caterpillars are controlled by increasing and decreasing levels of juvenile hormone and ecdysone hormone. This experiment was carried out using eight different Manduca caterpillars that were split into two groups of four, with one of the groups being the control and the other being the experimental group. The control group was fed a Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet mix that mimics what they would normally eat, while the experimental group was fed this GLM diet that was mixed with ten drops of the ecdysone inhibitor Aza Guard. Everyday the caterpillars were weighed and had their food replaced. By the end of the experiment the experimental group was significantly smaller in size than the control group, thus supporting the hypothesis that decreased ecdysone levels lead to smaller caterpillars. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars have a life cycle that lasts about 38-49 days. As larva they go through five instar stages. During these stages ecdysterone causes them to shed their old skin and then grow in mass and size. These instars are controlled by increasing and decreasing levels of juvenile hormone and ecdysone. During the fifth instar a commitment pulse occurs during which juvenile hormone levels drastically decrease. This commitment pulse then allows the caterpillars to start to pupate [Comparative Physiology]. As an adult, the Manduca sexta presents a large problem as a pest to surrounding communities, commonly seen feasting on flowers. Since the level and duration of ecdysone secretion is necessary for determining the size of the caterpillar [Nijhout:2010], in order to control this pest problem, hormones can be used to prevent the caterpillar from pupating. Aza Guard acts as an ecdysone inhibitor. As a result, it is hypothesized that if the caterpillars are fed this hormone inhibitor then they will not undergo as many molts and will in turn be smaller in mass.

Materials and Methods:
To commence this experiment select eight Manduca sexta caterpillars roughly the same size and weight. Next get four plastic containers with perforated lids and divide the containers in half with an index card. Once the containers are set up put one caterpillar on each side of the container so there are two caterpillars per container. Then choose two containers to be the control group and two containers to be the experimental group. Make sure to label the containers and the different experimental groups. Everyday feed each control group ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet mixed with ten drops of distilled water. Correspondingly, feed each experimental caterpillar ten grams of the GLM mix, but mix this food with ten drops of the Aza Guard 12:50 hormone inhibitor. Make sure to clean the wastes and old food out of the containers everyday before feeding the caterpillars. Prior to feeding the caterpillars, make sure to weigh them everyday and record their masses. Keep the caterpillars at 25 degrees celsius with alternating 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark. To analyze the data run a two tailed t-test. In order to compensate for the initial differences in weight between the caterpillars, run the two tailed t-test using the difference between the final and initial weights. 

Results:
As seen in Figure 1, the general trend is that the  control group was larger in size than the experimental group with an average change size of 10.15grams versus the average growth of 1.7625 grams of the control group as seen in Table 1. These values are believed to be statistically significant as the two tailed t-test yielded a very small p-value of 0.0000341. However, there was an outlier in the experimental group that weighed 0.99 grams at the end of the trial period, only 0.07 grams more than its starting weight. This caterpillar, experiment group number 3, gained weight between the first and the second day, but then began to progressively lose weight up through the end of the experiment. By the end of the trial this caterpillar was dead. Between the first and second day of the experiment control groups 2,3,4 and experimental groups 1 and 2 lost between 0.02 to 0.05 grams in weight. However, after day 2 all of the caterpillars, except experimental group 3, continued to gain weight. 

Discussion:
The results from this experiment support the hypothesis that inhibiting ecdysterone will lead to smaller caterpillars. The level and duration of ecdysone secretion is necessary for determining the size of the caterpillar [Nijhout:2010]. Therefore, in order for these caterpillars to molt and correspondingly increase in size, increased levels of ecdysone are required. Another study showed that the molting process of caterpillars is directly controlled by increased levels of a ultraspiracle-2 protein in manduca caterpillars. Ecdysone is important for this process because the increase in this protein is directly dependent upon an increase in ecdysone levels [Riddiford:1999]. By feeding the caterpillars food mixed with Aza Guard 12:50 this ecdysone production was blocked, thus leading to a decrease in ecdysterone levels. As a result, these experimental caterpillars did not go through as many molting processes and correspondingly did not increase in size. At the beginning of the experiment four caterpillars that were from both the experimental group and the control group lost a small amount weight between the first and the second day. This occurrence could simply  be due to experimental error. As the lab carried on there were scales that were removed due to malfunctioning. Therefore, it is possible that the scale used to measure the caterpillars on the first or second day was not functioning properly. On the other hand, it is also possible that the caterpillars lost weight due to stress from a change in environment, and required a window of adjustment. If time was allowed it would be interesting to continue this experiment up until the control group began pupating. This would enable us to observe whether a decrease in ecdysone levels would have caused the experimental group to have delayed or completely inhibited pupation.
