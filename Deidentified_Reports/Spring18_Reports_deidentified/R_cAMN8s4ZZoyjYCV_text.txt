Title: The Effects of the Insect Growth Regulator Precor on Manduca sexta Caterpillar Weight

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are used to target growth hormones in insects to prevent infestations. Juvenile hormone (JH) in insects is one group of growth hormones affected by IGRs, so the growth of an insect will be affected if IGRs are consumed. Altering juvenile hormones in the insects will lead to changes in metamorphosis because JH prevent insects from reaching adulthood. The pest controll Precor is used in this experiment to test the effects of its active ingredient, methoprene, on caterpillar growth. The hornworm caterpillar, known as the Manduca sexta, is broken into controll and treatment groups. The treatment group is given food with Precor mixed into it, while the controll is given food with no Precor. The weight of the caterpillars was documented over a span of seven days. This study analyzed if the caterpillars exposed to Precor would have a mean weight statistically different than the mean weight of the controll group which only had water mixed into the food. After seven days of analysis, it was concluded that the pest controll does not affect growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. The difference in weight from day one to day seven of the mean weights of the controll and treatment groups showed no statistical significance. 

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators are substances that affect the physiological development of insects by targeting growth hormones such as juvenile hormone (JH). IGRs can interfere with or over-activate the production of juvenile hormones in the insects. Juvenile hormones are key hormones in the development and reproduction of insects, and an overproduction of JH caused by IGRs can lead to the inhibition of metamorphosis out of the larval stage [Shinoda: 2016]. The active ingredient in Precor, which is the IGR used in this experiment, is methoprene [Greene: 2005]. Precor was chosen for this experiment because methoprene acts as an IGR which should affect the release of juvenile hormone in the caterpillars, and it is not fatal to insects, for it only prevents maturation. Precor is normally used against moths, beetles, mosquitoes, and on indoor furniture to prevent flea infestations, so for this procedure, Precor will be mixed into the caterpillars' food [DoMyOwn: 2018]. This experiment tests if Precor will be an effective IGR on caterpillars when mixed into their food and if the active ingredient in Precor will be an effective JH. This experiment compares the difference in weight over the seven days of the caterpillars exposed to Precor through food consumption and the caterpillars not exposed to Precor. Manduca sexta caterpillars are used in this test because their life cycle and growth speed are short enough to analyze over seven days. After seven days, the weight difference of the caterpillars exposed to Precor is expected to be statistically different from the weight change of caterpillars not exposed to Precor.

Materials and Method:
The hypothesis was tested by comparing the difference in mean weight of the Manduca caterpillars of day one to day seven from the controll and the treatment groups. There were two groups of caterpillars with four in the controll group and four in the treatment group. The independent variable was the Precor mixed into the food, which is categorical and continuous. The dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillars, which is measurable and continuous. Four containers were used, and a divider was placed in each container so two caterpillars can live separately in each container. In the first and second containers, two caterpillars in the controll group were weighted and placed inside each container. Ten grams of food were mixed with five drops of water for each caterpillar in the controll group. In the third and fourth containers, two caterpillars from the treatment group were weighted placed inside each container. Ten grams of food were mixed with five drops of Precor for each caterpillar in the treatment group. The weight of each caterpillar was taken and recorded into a data table for Day 1. Each Manduca caterpillar was weighed once every day at the same time using a scale. The containers with food and caterpillars were placed in an incubator during the seven days. At the end of the experiment, the data was analyzed using a two-sample t_test to compare the difference in mean weights of the controll group and the treatment group from the beginning of the experiment to at the end. Based on the analysis of the weight change, disparity in weight between the controll and treatment groups as a result of Precor added to food or just water was observed. 

Results:
Figure 1 contains data from the mean weights of the caterpillars over the seven-day experiment for the controll and treatment groups. From Day 1 to Day 7 the mean weights all increased for the controll and treatment groups after a decrease from Day 1 to Day 2. Figure 2 is a chart representing the difference in mean weight of the treatment and controll groups for Day 1 and Day 7. Day 7 mean weights were subtracted from the Day 1 mean weights. A two-sample t_test was run for this experiment to find the P-Value to the difference in mean weight from the beginning and end of the experiment between the two groups. The P-Value is 0.698. The controll group has a higher average change in weight than the treatment group. Error bars are placed in the chart to show the standard deviation of the weights of the caterpillars from each group. The error bars in Figure 2 indicate that there is a substantial variability among the weights for each day, and the weights are more spread out from the mean.    

Discussion:
The final results from this study do not support the research hypothesis because there is no significent difference between the difference in mean weight of the controll group and the difference in mean weight of the treatment group. We fail to reject the null hypothesis on the basis of a P-Value greater than 0.05. The active IGR, methoprene, did not show significent effect on the caterpillars exposed to Precor versus the ones in the controll group who just had water mixed into their food. While completing the experiment, the data could have been different if the caterpillars were fed every day because the treatment group would have received a higher dosage of methoprene. Growth patterns could have shown substantial change with higher levels of methoprene affecting juvenile hormones inside the insects. Based on this study it can be concluded that Precor might not be an effective pest controll on caterpillars by means of exposure through food consumption, since statistically significent weight disparity among the two groups did not occur. A previous study from the Journal of Economic Entomology looked at the effects of synthetic IGRs on insect growth of six different insect species. Methoprene was one of the IGRs used in the experiment, and the results from the study showed that when mixed into food, methoprene prevented multiple species from entering adulthood [Loschiavo: 1976]. The methoprene caused certain "morphogenic malformalities" in the insects and any insects that did reach the larvae stage were abnormally large. The difference in results from that experiment and this one could be from differences in length of time the insects were fed methoprene. The divergent results of this experiment and the 1976 study show that some pest controlls will not be effective on all insects, and certain pesticides might take longer to change the growth patterns of insects.
