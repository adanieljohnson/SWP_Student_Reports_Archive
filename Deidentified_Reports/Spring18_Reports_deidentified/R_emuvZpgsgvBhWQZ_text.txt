Title: Precor and Its Effects on Manduca sexta Caterpillar Growth

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effects of precor on Manduca sexta, tobacco hornworms, were determined. The purpose was to see if the insecticide, precor, would quicken the development of the Manduca sexta caterpillars into pupae because they are considered to be pests as larvae.  Manduca sexta is not considered to be a pest as an adult. Precor is a JH analog, a hormone present in insects that prevents pupation and allows for growth during the larval instars. The experiment consisted of a controll and experimental group. The controll group was fed food soaked in water for seven days, while the experimental group was fed food soaked in a 4Ml precor: 100 Ml water solution for seven days. The masses and lengths of the caterpillars were recorded each day, and their physical appearances were recorded. We hypothesized that the group of worms that were fed food soaked in precor would have a smaller increase in mass and length than the controll group. The hypothesis was not supported, for the p_values for the average increase in mass and length were high. The null hypothesis was supported. There experimental group did not have a significently smaller increase in mass and length than the controll. 


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, is considered to be a pest during the larval stage of its life. Since they are holometabolous, their appearance as adults is vastly different from their appearance as larvae (Johnson, 2018). Their life cycles consist of a larval stage that is composed of 5 larval instars, a pupal stage, and an adult stage. During the larval stage, Manduca sexta has a caterpillar-like appearance. It is a moth during its adult stage. Since Manduca sexta is a pest during its larval stage, we are trying to find an insecticide that can quicken the growth and development of Manduca sexta into a pupa. Manduca sexta feeds on the leaves of tobacco plants and can present problems to tobacco farmers (Byron and Gillett-Kaufman, 2017). As a result, we tested the effects of precor on Manduca sexta caterpillars. In this lab, the effects precor, an insecticide that mimics juvenile hormone, has on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars were determined. Juvenile hormone, or JH, is one of the three main hormones that controll insect development (Johnson, 2018). It is produced in the corpus allata, which is an endocrine gland present in insects (Johnson, 2018). In addition, it prevents pupation and directs growth during Manducan sexta’s larval instars. Different concentrations of JH and Ecdysterone, a hormone that controlls molting in insects, controll the development and timing of molting and pupation in insects (Iris, 1988). High levels of JH are present during the larval stage of Manduca sexta’s life and drop during the latter portion of the larval stage. We tested precor on the Manduca sexta caterpillars by adding it to a group of Manduca sexta caterpillars’ diet. Another group of caterpillars were fed a normal diet, and acted as the controll in this experiment. Since precor is a JH analog, it should be expected that it has the same effects on the Manduca sexta caterpillars as JH. We hypothesize that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are fed food soaked in precor, then they will have a smaller average increase in mass and length than the controll. As a JH analog, precor should cause a smaller increase in mass and length in the experimental group because pupation will be postponed and the larval stage will be lengthened. Therefore, it will not be useful in quickening the growth and development of the caterpillars into pupae. By analyzing the effects of precor on Manduca sexta caterpillars, we can determine whether or not this insecticide could be used to quicken their development. The caterpillars were in their 4th larval instar at the start of the experiment. 


Materials and Method:
In this lab, eight tobacco hornworm caterpillars were divided into two groups of four. One group represented the controll group and the other represented the experimental group. Four plastic, circular containers were obtained and an index card divided each container into two sections. Two caterpillars from the same group were placed in each container. The containers were labeled, experimental or controll, and each caterpillar was numbered. All of the caterpillars were weighed and their lengths were measured. They were then put back into their containers. These values were recorded. Their initial appearances were also recorded. 10 g of food was measured for each caterpillar and placed in both sections of every container. The experimental groups had 3-10 drops of a precor solution added to their food, and the controll group had 3-10 drops of water added to their food. The precor solution was 4 Ml of precor : 100 Ml of water. The containers were then sealed and placed in an incubator, overnight. The incubator maintained a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. The caterpillars were fed for a week, at 6:30 PM. Every night, they were fed, weighed, and they had their length measured. Their appearances were also recorded. The two-sample t_test was the statistical test used. Two, two-sample t_test were used because there were two means compared between two groups, a controll group and an experimental group. The mean increase of mass between the two groups were compared and the mean increase length was compared to the growth of mass and length in the experimental group.


Results:
The p_value for the set that described the average increase in mass was 0.86. During the first three days of the experiment, the mean masses and lengths for the controll and experimental groups were close to each other. There was less than a 0.5 g difference in mass between the masses of the experimental and controll groups for the first three days. The fourth day was the first day that marked an apparent difference between the two groups’ mean masses and lengths. On the fourth day, the controll group of caterpillars were large as well as the experimental caterpillar, E2. On the sixth day, all but two experimental group caterpillars were large and pale green in color. On the seventh day, all of the caterpillars were large, and light green in color. In addition, the mean masses and lengths of the controll and experimental groups were close to one another. The average masses were within 0.5 g of one another and the average lengths were within 0.5 cm of one another. The p_value for the set of data for average increase in length for was 0.97. At the end of the experiment, the average increase in mass for the controll group was 4.63 g and the mean increase in mass for the experimental group was 4.905 g. The average increase in length for the controll group was 3.025 cm, and the average increase in length for the experimental group was 3.0 cm. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis is not supported. According to the results of the experiment, the addition of precor to the diet of the tobacco hornworms does not have the effect that was expected. The hypothesis stated that if the experimental group was fed precor then it would have a smaller increase in growth (mass and length) than the controll group. For the mean masses, the p_value is 0.86, which means that there is no significent difference between the two groups’ means. The average increase in mass for the experimental group is 4.905 g and is 4.63g for the controll group. In addition, the p_value for the mean increase in length between the two groups is 0.97. This means that there was no significent difference between the mean increase in length of the controll and experimental groups. The mean increase in length for the controll group is 3.025 cm and is 3.0 cm for the experimental group. These values are almost identical. Since the p_values are so high, the null hypothesis is supported and there must have been some sort of error within the experiment. Precor is known to mimic JH, so there should have been some difference between the growth of the controll and experimental groups. JH regulates the larval stage and larval growth and a Manduca sexta caterpillar can only become a pupa if its levels drop (Watson and Bollenbacher, 1988). A possible source of error could be that not enough precor was added to the experimental group’s food. As a result, the experimental group of caterpillars grew similar to the controll group. Another source of error could have been that precor solution was too diluted. This would lead to a reduced effect of precor. A way to improve this experiment is to pay more attention to the amount of precor added to the experimental group’s food. A solution with a higher ratio of precor:water could be used too. As a result, a sufficient amount of precor would be added to the tobacco hornworms’ diet. From this experiment, one can understand that precor is not an insecticide that should be used on tobacco hornworms. The group of tobacco hornworms that were fed precor had similar growth to those not fed precor. Both groups remained in larval instars, and no signs of molting were present. Precor would not be useful in reducing the length of the larval stage of Manduca Sexta.
