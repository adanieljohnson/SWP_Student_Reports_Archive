Title: Effects of Potassium Channel Blockers on Muscle Relaxation

Abstract:
This lab focused on the function of the neuromusculoskeletal system in frog legs. The nervous system is the primary means of controlling muscle contraction. The nervous system communicates through the firing of neurons, which relies on specifically timed and concentrated fluctuations in ions in the cell through ion channels. These can set off muscle contractions, which are divided into three subsections; the subsection this experiment was concerned with was the relaxation period. This is due to the proposed relationship between relaxation times and potassium channels, which this experiment aims to manipulate through the administration of a chemical which blocks potassium channels. We hypothesized that this would increase the relaxation times in frog leg muscles after contraction. While this did prove to be a general trend, the results were not statistically significant enough to definitively support this hypothesis.

Introduction:
Nerves are the primary means of controlling muscle movement throughout the body. This is opposed to the other means of intercellular communication in an organism, hormones. The nervous system is preferable  for muscle control because it allows for faster, much more localized responses, and therefore is more fitting for the quick responses needed to the environment that the muscular system provides. The nervous system is composed of a series of neurons, which fire in succession, each releasing a neurotransmitter to the neuron after it signaling whether to change ion concentration to move closer to the action potential or further from it. Once a cell has been hyperpolarized to the threshold, this neuron will fire down the axon. These electric potentials are the result of sodium channels first opening to allow for a large intake of sodium which makes the cell’s electric potential more positive. Subsequently the potassium channels open and allow for a large outflux of potassium ions, which makes the cell’s electric potential more negative, helping to return the ion to its resting state.  Once these signals have been received by the muscle, the muscle will contract. This muscle contraction is divided into three units: a latency period, a contraction period, and a relaxation period. The latency period is the time between the signal and the muscle response. The contraction period is the time of the physical contraction of the muscle. The relaxation period, which this experiment is chiefly concerned with, is the time it takes for the muscle to relax from this contracted state [Johnson: 2018].    In this experiment, a chemical that decreases the permeability of potassium channels, therefore preventing their reuptake into the neuron, will be injected into the frog leg muscle. This leg muscles of this frog species, the Rana pipiens, are a beneficial model because they have been proven to have broad functioning power, and more importantly to be a suitable model for other, and even more sophisticated, muscle systems [Kargo & Rome, 2002]. The introduction of artificial external chemicals effecting neuron firing and transmission is proven to be capable of producing an effect on muscle contraction [Hille, 1968]. As this particular chemical blocks the permeability of potassium ion channels, it’s introduction into the frog leg should force the nerve to remain in a constant state of “firing,” preventing it from returning to its resting state. Therefore, because of the relationship between neuron firing and muscle contraction, we hypothesize that this chemical will prevent the muscle from relaxing as well, significantly increasing the muscle’s relaxation time.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, three different frog legs were used. For each, the skin was removed and muscle dissected so that the top of the sciatic nerve was exposed, and the gastrocnemius muscle could be hooked up by a string to a sensor. This sensor was hooked up to a computer, which allowed for a myogram to be taken of each muscle contraction. These muscle contractions were created artificially through the application of external voltages to the nerve. For each, the length of the relaxation time after a muscle twitch was recorded under normal conditions. Then, a solution was injected into the muscle which contained a chemical which inhibited the permeability of the potassium channels, 100mM tetraethlammonium Cl (TEA Cl). After the muscle had adjusted to this, another muscle twitch was initiated, and the resulting relaxation time recorded. The time lengths of relaxation for before and after this injection were compared with a paired t-test in order to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
The relaxation times of the frogs leg muscles all increased after injection of the potassium channel blocker. However, they increased to various degree. Figure 1 shows the relaxation times before and after injection, providing a visual comparison of this variable difference. 
p-value: 0.1359


Discussion:
This analysis produced a p value of 0.1359. Therefore, these results were not statistically significant enough to prove the hypothesis. However, these results were consistent with the hypothesis, in that for each frog leg, the relaxation time increased after the potassium channel blocker was injected into the muscle. This is a logical result, as potassium ions flow into the axon channel in order to repolarize the neuron when an action potential has been fired [Johnson: 2018]. Other studies studying the effects of increasing potassium channel permeability on muscle relaxation times have consistently shown that that the time decreases, as in muscles relax faster upon increasing permeability [Cook, 1988]. Therefore, if these channels are prevented from functioning and the permeability is decreased, the muscle controlled by that nerve should remain contracted for a longer period of time.  
There were many possible explanations for the insufficiency of the data. For one, all of these experiments were performed on the same tray. The chart clearly demonstrates that the difference in the in the third leg was much less than the other two legs. This suggests that the leg could have been contaminated by the chemicals used in the prior experiments. Additionally, there was a wait time between when the chemical was administered and the second test was done. This was because the muscle was twitching irregularly and uncontrollably on its own when the chemical was initially introduced. However, this wait time was inconsistent between trials, and the difference could have had an effect on how strongly the chemical affected the relaxation time. Additionally, there is evidence that there are significant differences between right and left sciatic nerves in frog legs [Ahmed, Malik, Azeem, & Noushad, 2012]. The legs we experimented on were not only from different frogs, which would create some inconsistency, they also could have been right or left legs, which could have an effect as well. However, due to the lack of statistical significance of the results, further experimentation would need to be done to prove that blocking potassium channels increases the relaxation time of muscle contraction.  This is important because it is integral to understanding the pathway and methodology of muscle contraction, and only by thoroughly comprehending these mechanisms can we begin to manipulate them. Being able to manipulate muscular mechanisms could lead to treatments for many diseases and injuries, if this research was able to be generalized and applied to wider topics.
