Title: Negative Effects of Blocking Ecdysterone on Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The role of hormones in the developmental stages of organisms is a very widely studied topic in scientific research. Manduca sexta caterpillars are a species commonly studied for this purpose because they present clearly the effects of the manipulation of these hormones on the stage of development. This experiment focused on the effects of blocking ecdysterone, an ecdysteroid responsible for the timing of molting. It was predicted that Manduca sexta at the 4th instar period of metamorphosis would not experience significant weight gain when fed an ecdysterone blocking supplement. The study took place over an 8-day period, during which the treatment group was fed a normal Manduca sexta diet supplemented with an insect growth regulator that would block ecdysterone receptors, and the control group was fed a normal diet. The data showed that the caterpillars in the treatment group gained statistically significantly less weight over the course of an eight-day period than those in the control group. These results demonstrate the role of ecdysterone as a signal to stimulate growth in Manduca sexta leading up to the pupal stage of development.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars undergo a 19-23-day metamorphosis period during which the expression of various hormones at different times facilitates the development of the larva into an adult moth. These hormone signals can have either an activation effect, causing a change in the function of the organism, or an organizational effect, changing the arrangement of the body of the insect [Johnson : 2018]. Manduca sexta rely on the presence of two main hormones, Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH), in order to progress from the 4th larva instar stage into adulthood. 20E is secreted by the prothoracic glands, and regulates the timing of molting, and JH, produced in the corpus allata, regulates the type of molt [Johnson : 2018]. A typical Manduca sexta will experience a large increase in 20E production in response to a decrease in JH production towards the end of the 4th instar period, followed immediately by an additional increase in 20E at the start of the 5th instar period, known as the commitment pulse [Johnson : 2018]. The commitment pulse indicates that the organism is ready to pupate, and thus the organism experiences a significant increase in weight leading up to this point. Studies show that exposure of Manduca sexta to hormone-blocking molecules will inhibit the synthesis of certain enzymes that typically facilitate growth during development of the larva [Timmins: 1992]. This experiment focuses on the effect of blocking 20E receptors in Manduca sexta larvae. Specifically, the experiment aims to observe how the absence of the signal typically initiated by the binding of 20E to cell receptors affects the ability of the organism to develop beyond the larva state, measured by the fluctuation in weight over an eight-day period. It can be predicted that when fed a diet supplemented with 20E-inhibiting molecules over an eight-day period, Manduca sexta larvae at the 4th instar period will not undergo significant weight gain.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars at the 4th instar period were weighed and divided into two groups of four. The first four caterpillars were part of the control group, and were fed a normal Manduca caterpillar diet for the duration of the experiment. The additional 4 caterpillars were part of the treatment group and were fed the normal Manduca caterpillar diet supplemented with 0.001M AzaGuard™ Insect Growth Regulator. Two caterpillars were placed in each of four labeled tubs and were separated by an index card. The treatment group was fed once a day for eight days with a diet consisting of 10.0 grams of Manduca sexta food mixed with 10 drops of 0.001 M AzaGuard™ Insect Growth Regulator. The control group was fed once a day for eight days with a diet consisting of 10.0 grams of Manduca sexta food mixed with 10 drops of distilled water. All eight caterpillars were kept in an incubator at constant conditions. The caterpillars were each weighed once per day over the course of eight days, and additional observations were recorded. A two sample T-test was used to determine the significance of the difference in the final weight of the caterpillars of the treatment group and control group.


Results:
The results of the experiment show that the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the treatment group gained more weight over the course of an 8-day period than those in the control group. At the end of an 8-day period, the caterpillars in the treatment group weighed approximately less than half the weight of the caterpillars in the control group, as shown by Figure 1. The average weight gain from day 1 to day 8 was 9.76 grams in the control group, and 3.15 grams in the treatment group, showing that the control caterpillars in the treatment group experienced on average 1/3 of the total weight gain of the control group. The caterpillars in the control group underwent the majority of their weight gain during days 5-8, almost tripling their weights within the 3-day period, whereas the caterpillars in the experimental group experienced only moderate weight gain in the same period, with their weights increasing by approximately 75%. The data shows that caterpillars #6 and #7 both gained weight up until the final 2 days, after which they experienced minor weight loss. The results of a Two-Sample t-Test show that the mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 10.805291, df = 6, P = 3.72E-5).

Discussion:
The results of this experiment support the hypothesis that the treatment group would not undergo significant weight gain. The calculated p-value was 3.72E-5, showing that the results were significant. This result occurred because the organisms in the treatment group did not experience normal hormonal activity during the developmental period preceding the commitment pulse. In a normal Manduca sexta, 20E is released by the prothoracic glands, travels through the bloodstream, and binds to EcR receptors on specific cells [Nijhout : 2014]. This binding signals the cell to begin expressing genes related to storing nutrients in preparation for molting in the pupal stage of metamorphosis, resulting in an increase in body mass of the organism [Nijhout : 2014]. This result was successfully demonstrated by the control group. However, the insect growth regulator, AzaGuard™, introduced into the diet of the Manduca sexta in the treatment group blocked 20E receptors on cell membranes, preventing the cell from receiving the signal to promote growth. As a result, the treatment group did not gain weight to the extent which the control group did, and it can be predicted that these caterpillars would not progress past the commitment pulse and into the pupal stage of development. A similar study done on the development of Manduca sexta shows that a reduction in EcR expression accelerates growth of the caterpillar [Nijhout : 2014]. In the instance of both the blocking and lack of expression of EcR, 20E is unable to carry out its function of signaling growth. Future experiments in which control variables such as temperature, oxygen level, and access to food in the environment are manipulated could provide new data with regards to development of Manduca sexta. Further experiments regarding the manipulation of E20 and JH in Manduca sexta and other insects could provide scientists with a greater understanding of the role that these hormones play in the development of organisms. Information on upstream and downstream effects of the hormones could potentially be applied to alter the behavior of Manduca sexta, and diminish the effects of the pests on their environment.
