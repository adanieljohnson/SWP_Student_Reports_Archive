Title: Precor slows the growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, grows throughout its life cycle until it reaches the adult stage. In this lab, we tested the effect of a juvenile hormone called precor on M. sexta growth. When administered to M. sexta during their final instar larval stage of life, precor can slow the growth of the organism. If precor is added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will have a smaller mass (in grams) compared to the controll caterpillars that had distilled water added to their food. To test this hypothesis, 8 caterpillars were massed and fed as needed (with 10 drops of precor or water added again) for 8 days. We found that the addition of precor to the diet decreased the rate of growth; however, p=0.11 which proves the data could be due to chance. While the hypothesis was rejected, similar studies prove precor serves as an effective pesticide against caterpillars, as it prevents them from reaching the adult stage.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta has a homometabolous life cycle consisting of the following stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The corpus allata secretes juvenile hormone (JH), which prepares M. sexta tissues to develop the organism into the next stage of life. Pesticides that fight against M. sexta often contain JH as it controlls growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the caterpillar [Goodman : 2013]. When JH is absent, the caterpillar metamorphoses into a moth (indicating the adult stage). Precor, a type of JH, is used to test its effect on M. sexta weight. If precor is added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will have a smaller mass (in grams) compared to the controll caterpillars that had distilled water added to their food.

Materials and Method:
To perform this lab, 8 M. sexta were obtained from a biology lab company. 4 were designated as the treatment group and 4 were designated as the controll group. It was important to select caterpillars that did not have a black stripe on their dorsal side as it would indicate the caterpillar is past the commitment pulse. Each caterpillar was placed in one half of a plastic container, with a paper dividing it in half. Perforated lids were placed on top of each container to allow the flow of oxygen. Each caterpillar was fed 10 g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) food. 10 drops of 1: 1250 Precor were added to the treatment group's food, while 10 drops of distilled water were added to the controll group's food. 

Each day (for 8 days total), we weighed each caterpillar and recorded the data. As needed, we fed the caterpillars. When we were not weighing and feeding the caterpillars, we placed them in an incubator set at 22 degrees Celsius (although the temperature fluctuated slightly) to expose them to a controllled environment. 

After collecting our data, we found the average of the treatment group and the average of the controll group and displayed the data in a bar graph containing error bars. Then, we performed a two-sample t_test to determine the probability that our results were due to chance.

Results:
Differences in weight are more pronounced after the third day of testing. Additionally, as the days went on, the controll group ate more while the treatment group ate less. Additionally, the treatment group started losing its vibrant coloring and became more lethargic, especially after the fifth day. 

The average weights (g) were found for the controll and treatment groups, as shown in Figure #1. After completing a two-sample t_test, I found t=1.73, the degrees of freedom=14, and p=0.11. I came to the conclusion that my data is not statistically significent because the value of p is greater than 0.05, meaning there is greater than a 5% probability that the data is due to chance. The standard deviation of the controll group is 4.10 g and the standard deviation of the treatment group is 1.23 g. The standard deviation of the controll group is higher because the values deviate more from the mean and the weight increased more. The standard deviation of the treatment group is smaller because the values do not deviate much from the mean because overall they did not grow much.

Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the average weight of the controll group was smaller than that of the treatment group. However, the null hypothesis could not be rejected as p=0.11. Therefore, I cannot accept my hypothesis, "If precor is added to the treatment caterpillars' food, then they will have a smaller mass (in grams) compared to the controll caterpillars that had distilled water added to their food" because my data is not statistically significent. However, an error may have occurred during testing. If this experiment was to be repeated, extending the length of testing and increasing the number of caterpillars tested could produce more conclusive results.

A similar study was performed in which the active ingredient in precor called methoprene was used to regulate the growth of insects. Their data was statistically significent, proving the hypothesis should have been proven correct. They found that juvenile characteristics last longer when methoprene acts on insects [Harmon : 1995]. When methoprene is not present, the insects can grow until they reach the adult stage. Therefore, pesticides that contain JHs controll the development of pests as they regulate gene transcription [Harmon : 1995]. This proves precor is an effective pesticide against M. sexta when administered in their fifth larval instar stage of life. The hormone prevents the brain from secreting prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which promotes growth and molting [Nijhout : 1974]. In conclusion, precor is effective in slowing the growth of M. sexta, as the treatment groups in both studies had a lower average weight compared to the controll groups.

Figure #1: Average weight of controll and treatment M. sexta - The bar graph shows the average weight (g) for each group over the 8 days of testing. Additionally, the error bars represent +/- a standard deviation (how the data deviates from the mean). The average of the controll group was 4.66 g +/- 4.10 g and the average of the treatment group was 2.04 g +/- 1.23 g.
