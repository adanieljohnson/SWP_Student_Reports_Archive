Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine on Rania Pipiens

Abstract:
Skeletal muscles consist of thousands of myofibers, which ultimately play a role in muscle contraction. The application of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist, which influences ACh receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. If we inject 2 Ml of tubocurarine in the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog legs. Then, based on contractile amplitude will determine whether the nicotinic Ach receptor antagonist inhibits contraction. The results determined that there was a ​significent difference in contractile amplitude. The experiment proved that tubocurarine affects the contractile amplitude in the frog legs, causing a decrease in muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are made of thousands of myofibers, which are fused aggregates of cells. The skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. These neurons contain axons; they are connected to the neuromuscular junction of the myofibers. When the nerve impulses travel through the neuromuscular junction, ACh is released from presynaptic terminal. The Ach binds to the sodium channels and then calcium is released, which makes the muscle contract. Ultimately, allowing muscle contraction to occur. The calcium is eventually taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. [Johnson, 2018] 
In this experiment, we used a species of frog called Rania Pipens. We decided to work with nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist (tubocurarine). The action of tubocurarine has an influence on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction, which has been considered to be one of the classical examples of competitive antagonism. It has been suggested that the effect of tubocurarine could be accounted for entirely by competition with acetylcholine for the acetylcholine receptors on the post-synaptic membrane. The tubocurarine has an influence on the ability of the muscle contractions to occur, probably inhibiting the action or slowing the contraction. [Colqhoun: 1979]
The experiment we conducted involved the application of tubocurarine. If we inject 2Ml of tubocurarine in the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog legs. Then, based on contractile amplitude will determine whether the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist will have an inhibitory response towards the contraction.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we conducted an experiment on three different frog legs. The Rania Pipiens were obtained from a colony. We degloved the frog legs and detached the gastrocnemus muscle with a pair of scissors. A thread was then cut; it was tied tightly to the Achilles tendon. The tendon was attached to the force transducer. We also used pins were placed in​ various areas of the leg to keep it stable throughout the experiment. The Ringer’s solution was used to as necessary to keep the leg moist and in a stable condition. We made sure to expose the sciatic nerve. The proper probes were attached to the nerve to adequately measure muscle contractions.  We used nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist injected 2Ml of it into the muscle of the frog legs, to allow proper distribution of the solution. 
We used a stimulator box that transferred volts through the probes. A myogram was used to record the controll and treatment data. We also used a software called Labscribe3 to record the myograms. When we injected the tubocurarine solution and we waited approx. 5-8 minutes for it to settle into the muscle before conducting the myograms. We conducted 3 myograms for each frog leg. A paired t_test was used from the data of the average of the amplitude of contraction. The paired t_test was used because they both depend on each other (controll and treatment).


Results:
The controll averages of the frog leg based on their contractile amplitude were higher than the treatment averages. The treatment conducted with the tubocurarine on the Rania Pipien, was determined to have a significent difference based on the paired t_test. (t_stat= 5.37, P= 0.00067)


Discussion:
Based on our hypothesis, it has been supported. The amplitude decreased significently in the frog legs treated with tubocurarine. The tubocurarine impacts the ability of ACh ability to bind to its receptors. In this case, the contraction was not inhibited fully, but the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist showed to affect the rate at which the contraction occurred, slowing it down. As seen in Figure 1, the contractile amplitude averages were lower when compared to the amplitude average of the controll. Tubocurarine has this effect because it attaches to acetylcholine receptors on the post-junctional membrane and reduces the amplitude of the end plate potential, causing a decrease in contraction. [Hubbard: 1973] We found no discrepancies throughout the conduction of the experiment. These experiments allowed us to comprehend muscle contractions at the neuromuscular level. From those findings, we can interpret how insects, animals, and humans muscle contractions can be affected by various forms of manipulating substances.
