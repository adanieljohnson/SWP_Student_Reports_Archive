Title: The effect of ecdyserone steroid on the life cycle of Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
This study looks at Manduca sexta caterpillars and their interactions with ecdysterone steroids (specifically 20E), which is the hormone responsible for the timing of the molting of the caterpillar. We used a control group as a basis and an experimental group that was given Azamax (a 20E blocker) and compared the mean growth over the course of seven days of the two groups. The mean of the control group was a growth of 8.4g and the experimental group was 1.3g. Statistical tests showed that this was a significant difference, which indicates that 20E is important in facilitating the molting of a caterpillar and consequently its growth. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an organism that undergoes a biological life cycle that begins with an egg, transitions through five instars of larva, pupates, and finally becomes a moth [Johnson - 2018]. This life cycle is primarily regulated by two major hormones, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone steroids (20E). We will be focusing primarily on 20E, which is the hormone responsible for signaling the time of the molt rather than the type of molt regulated by juvenile hormone [Riddiford - 2003]. 20E regulates timing of the molt by increasing levels prior to the molt, which is especially important in the commitment pulse [Johnson - 2018]. The commitment pulse is a signal to the caterpillar that it is prepared to form a pupa and is characterized by the first drop in juvenile hormone coinciding with a rise in 20E [Weeks - 1986]. Because this rise in 20E is essential in signaling progression to the next stage of the Manduca sexta’s life, we wondered what would happen if the caterpillars were given a 20E blocker, therefore not allowing a spike in 20E. We hypothesized that decreased levels of 20E in the experimental group will cause them not to molt, and therefore they will be smaller than the control group. 


Materials and Methods:
We began by obtaining eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, all roughly the same age and weighing between 0.78g and 1.28g. We weighed the caterpillars to record their initial weight and then placed them each into a circular container divided in half by an index card, with two caterpillars in each container but separated by the barrier. Controls were kept together and experiments were kept together. We weighed 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet for each caterpillar. The control group’s food was mixed with 7 drops of water per 10g and the experiment group’s food was mixed with 7 drops of Azamax (a 20E blocker) per 10g of food. The caterpillars were sealed in their containers and kept in an incubator. For seven consecutive days we removed the caterpillars from their containers and weighed them to record progress and replaced their food with the same formula stated above. The weight gain in each of the groups was put through a two sample t-test to judge differences. Caterpillar Control 2 was determined to be an outlier and was eliminated from statistical tests. 


Results:
The mean growth of the control group over the course of seven days measured in grams was 8.40g, excluding the previously mentioned outlier. The mean growth of the experimental group was 1.30g. The comparison of these are shown in Figure 1. After running a two sample t-test, we concluded that the experimental group was significantly different from the control group (tstat = 6.267, df = 5, p = 0.0015). 


Discussion:
The results did support our hypothesis because as previously stated, our hypothesis was that the caterpillars given Azamax would be significantly smaller than the control group. This was shown by the p-value being 0.0015, which indicates that there is a 0.15% chance that this difference in mean growth would happen by probability alone. Since 20E is being blocked with the chemical, there is no rise that typically characterize the transition into the next life stage, which comes with growth of the organism. Previous studies have shown the importance of 20E and other ecdysteriods in facilitating a transition to the next stage, especially in terms of the commitment pulse [Riddiford - 2003]. As far as the conduction of our study goes, we did have a problem with one control caterpillar not growing in proportion with the others and was a significant outlier in the data, likely due to some prior genetic condition or health problem. We also had one caterpillar escape on the last day, so the final length for experiment #4 was recorded as it was on the sixth day rather than seventh. This study and other related studies show the importance of properly balanced hormones and an efficient endocrine system, which play a role in many parts of functioning and development, including growth. This can be applied to organisms much more complex than the Manduca sexta, such as humans. Humans also have endocrine systems that facilitate functions in the body and information about how hormones work individually and together can strengthen our knowledge about hormone problems in humans and how to treat them.
