Title: Impact of Azamax 20E Hormone Inhibitor on Weight of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Several hormones determine M. sexta growth, the most important of which are juvenile hormone, or JH, and ecdysteroids, or 20 E. Based on the role of 20E in the larval growth of M. sexta caterpillars, we hypothesized that the consumption of a 20E hormone inhibitor in M. sexta caterpillars would result in decreased body weight.  The experimental group of four caterpillars each received 10 g of M. sexta caterpillar food mixed with 3.5 drops of Azamax, a 20E hormone inhibitor. The controll caterpillar food contained 3.5 drops of water. The average weight of the controll group over the course of eight days was not statistically significent in comparison to the experimental group (t_stat = 1.49, d.f. = 14, P = 0.16). In spite of this, the data does have noticeable patterns that could be indicative of the effect of 20E inhibitors on M. sexta caterpillars. Based on this data we concluded that Azamax, a 20E hormone blocker, inhibits the growth of M. sexta caterpillars. Because metamorphosis is categorized by an increase in 20E hormone, the experimental caterpillars were unable to reach their critical weight and molt without the influence of 20E. 


Introduction:
For decades scientists have attempted to limit the growth of pests that destroy commercially successful crops. In the United States, the tobacco hornworm is one of the most common pests that threaten tobacco, peppers, tomatoes, and eggplants  (Dianan: 2006). The tobacco hornworm is a common name for a Manduca sexta in the larval stage. This organism experiences a total of four life stage first as eggs then as larvae and pupa and finally as adult moths (Johnson: 2018). However the M. sexta poses the biggest danger to crops during the final instars of its larva stage, where these large caterpillars, which can weigh as much as 11 grams, rest on the stalks of crops while chewing through the leaves (Dianan: 2006). The larvae stage is divided into 5 separate instars. These instars are separated by periodic molts, during which successively larger cuticles, or outer layers of skin cells, are developed to accommodate larvae growth (Suzuki: 2013). The transformation from the larval stage to the pupa stage is known as metamorphosis, during which the caterpillars must survive off of stored nutrients. If the caterpillar does not have the necessary nutrients to survive the pupa stage, during which it cannot gather food, then the organism will starve (Johnson: 2018). The initiation of metamorphosis begins when the organism has reached a critical weight, which is the minimum weight a M. sexta caterpillar must reach in order to trigger metamorphosis.  However M. sexta growth and development, including molting and metamorphosis is controllled through hormones (Suzuki: 2013). 
Several hormones determine M. sexta growth, the most important of which are juvenile hormone, or JH, and ecdysteroids, or 20 E. During the larval stages JH determines the nature of molts, whereas 20E helps to orchestrate the timing of molts and metamorphosis. Each molt during the larval stage is preceded by a spike in 20E (Riddiford: 2003). However after the caterpillar progressed through the final instar and reaches its critical weight, the organism slows its production of JH, while its production of 20E increases (Suzuki: 2013). Simultaneously genes that are specific to cuticle formation during the larval stage are inhibited. Therefore, when the next cuticle forms it will trigger metamorphosis locking the organism into its adult body size (Riddiford: 2003).
Ecdysteroids are a group of steroid hormones active in mammals, plants, and arthropods. In arthropods ecdysteroids occur in the form of 20-hydroxyecdysone, or 20E. This hormone controlls molting, reproduction, metamorphosis, and diapause (Dianan: 2006). Considering the crucial role of 20E in arthropod development, we wanted to explore the effect of an ecdysteroid inhibitor on the development of M. sexta caterpillars. The Manduca sexta caterpillar is also representative of arthropod development in general, and therefore the ideal test subject for this experiment (Riddiford: 2003).  The caterpillars used were initially about one gram in weight, meaning that they were already in their final instar. Therefore in this experiment we were observing changes in caterpillar body size rather than molting patterns. Based on the role of 20E in the larval growth of M. sexta caterpillars, we hypothesized that the consumption of a 20E hormone inhibitor in M. sexta caterpillars would result in decreased body weight.  


Materials and Method:
	This experiment involved two groups of four caterpillars, each of which was approximately one gram in weight on the first day of testing. Each caterpillar was assigned a number and then weighed, which allowed us to track each organism’s growth over the course of the next week. The controll caterpillars were divided into two separate containers, each of which contained 20 grams of M. sexta caterpillar food mixed with 7 drops of water. Each container was separated into two compartments by an index card, with each side containing one caterpillar and one half of the measured 20 grams of food. The experimental group of four caterpillars were divided up into two similar containers; however, each container contained 20 grams of M. sexta caterpillar food mixed with seven drops of Azamax, a 20E hormone inhibitor. Similarly the two caterpillars in each experimental container were separated by an index card. Ten grams of food were placed on each side of the index card. 
The four containers of caterpillars were stored in an incubator for one week. Each day at 3 PM, the caterpillars were removed from the incubator and then weighed. At this time the containers were emptied of all remaining caterpillar food and waste, and then fresh food was placed in each container.  This allowed us to track the daily growth of each organism for a week and then determine the impact of the 20E hormone blocker on the growth of the experimental caterpillars in comparison to the controll group. The experimental and controll groups were compared using a two-sample t_test.


Results:
The average of the controll group was not statistically significent in comparison to the experimental group (t_stat = 1.49, d.f. = 14, P = 0.16). In spite of this, the data does have noticeable patterns that could be indicative of the effect of 20E inhibitors on M. sexta caterpillars. As indicated in Table 1, the experimental caterpillars were almost half the weight on average of the controll caterpillars. In addition, the groups grew at a similar rate for three days, after which growth in controll caterpillars increased exponentially. However there were small anomalies in the data. For example, on day two the average experimental group weight actually decreased (Table 1). Additionally, Figure 1 indicates that the controll group had a much larger standard deviation on days 3 - 8. This suggests that there was more variation in the weight of controll group. In comparison the experimental group generally had a smaller standard deviation, and therefore there was less variation in the weight on those caterpillars (Figure 1).


Discussion:
Based on this data we concluded that Azamax, a 20E hormone blocker, inhibits the growth of M. sexta caterpillars. Because metamorphosis is categorized by an increase in 20E hormone, the experimental caterpillars were unable to reach their critical weight and molt without the influence of 20E. In comparison the controll caterpillars grew at different rates, but this was most likely due to environmental factors, like how much food they ate daily. In the absence of hormone blockers, nutrition has the largest influence on growth in M. sexta caterpillars. Considering the influence of diet on caterpillar growth, it is also possible that the experimental caterpillars grew less because they consumed less food. If these experimental caterpillars were able to smell the Azamax in their food, they might have eaten less. Additionally, because there was less variation among the caterpillars in the controll group, it is possible that Azamax has a regulatory effect on caterpillar growth, preventing the M. sexta from surpassing a certain weight. 
The M. sexta is a model for insect growth, and therefore this data could be used to predict the effect of 20E blockers on other species. For example, in one experiment researchers found that Azamax had a similar effect on the larval growth and pupation of Spodoptera frugiperda, or the fall armyworm. They noted a significent reduction in weight and a prolonged larval stage in armyworms exposed to Azamax. They also found that Azamax was toxic to some armyworm larvae. However this was dependent upon the concentration of Azamax in their food and the amount of time they were exposed to it (Ansante: 2017). Though none of the caterpillars in our experiment died, the experiment only lasted eight days and ended before metamorphosis. Additionally the caterpillars only consumed 3.5 drops of Azamax per 10 grams of food. Based on the prior study, an increased concentration of Azamax in their food could have killed our experimental caterpillars. In future research there are also different method of exposure to 20E that can be studied. For example, one study used direct contact to expose Diaphorina citri nymphs to Azamax. In this instance direct contact with the 20E blocker resulted in a 67% mortality rate for that organism (Santos: 2015). In the future we can test the impact of 20E on M. sexta caterpillar growth with different method of exposure. 
All of this research could have a notable impact on agriculture and the way we controll pest populations. In the past we have used harmful pesticides to kill the pests that destroy crops. However these pesticides can also harm the environment through contamination of water and soil or biomagnification of the toxin across the food chain. Insecticides like Azamax that manipulate hormones in pests could prove to be a safer alternative to controll pest populations.
