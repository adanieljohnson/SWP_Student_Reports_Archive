Title: Agonistic behaviors in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens

Abstract:
In this study we are studying Siamese fighting Betta fish, Betta splendens, and the effect that size has on the aggression of these fish toward an opponent fish of the same species. We predict that thelarger betta fish will display agonistic behaviors than the smaller betta fish. To test this we took six fish of varying weights and put them in front of the same opponent fish one at a time with only a clear barrier in front of them. We then counted how many tail beats, gill flares, and pelvic fin flickers the experimental fish did. We found that our hypothesis was rejected as there was not any linear trend between the manipulated variable of size/weight and the dependent variable of aggressive behaviors. This means that just because a fish is larger it does not mean that it will exhibit more aggression that a smaller fish.

Introduction:
In this study we are studying Siamese fighting Betta fish, Betta splendens, and the effect that size has on the frequency of certain agonistic behaviors when placed in the same tank as another male betta fish. Betta fish are a good organism to use because they are extremely aggressive towards other male betta fish and it is rather evident when they do engage in these behaviors. [Johnson: 2016] Also, it is relatively easy to handle these fish and transfer them from one tank to another. When placed in the same vicinity as another betta fish, Betta splendens become extremely aggressive and will exhibit two types of intraspecific agonistic behaviors before fighting in order to threaten the other. [Johnson: 2016] One type is what is known as broadside movements which occur when the fish is turning its side towards the opponent. [Johnson: 2016] They include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. [Johnson: 2016] The other type of agonistic behaviors is called facing movements which occur when the fish is facing its opponent. [Johnson: 2016] These include making its pectoral fins erect, spreading its gill covers (opercula), and protruding its branchiostegal membranes under the opercula to create a red mane. [Johnson: 2016] When threatened with these actions a betta fish may ignore it, match it, flee, submit, or escalate the behaviors by making a more aggressive action. [Johnson: 2016] These will generally precede the fighting but we put a clear barrier in between the two fish to prevent this so they can only engage in agonistic behaviors. [Johnson: 2016] We are curious to see if size has a large effect on the intraspecies interactions of Betta fish. For example, in peacocks the individual with the largest feathers and greatest number of eyespots are chosen by the females to mate. [Dakin: 2013] This is because mating with a male with better feathers will increase the likelihood that their offspring will have large feathers as well thus increasing the chance of their progeny mating and passing down their genes. [Dakin: 2013] Size obviously matters in peacocks so we are exploring the effect that it has on betta fish competition and aggression between males. We predict that the larger betta fish will display more aggressive (agonistic) behaviors than the smaller betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
Get six Siamese fighting Betta fish of differing sizes and one opponent Betta fish. Use a net to move the fish and weigh the fishes using a scale and a graduated cylinder with a little water in it. Make sure the fish are not left out of water for too long and that the scale is zeroed with the cylinder and the water on it. Get a large tank and an opaque barrier and then a clear barrier as well. Put the opponent fish one side of the barrier and leave it there for the duration of the experiment; you will not be replacing the opponent fish. Put the smallest fish in with just the clear barrier in between the fishes and count the number of gill spreads, pelvic fin flickering, and tail beats exhibited by the small fish (no need to count them for the opponent fish) for five minutes. Then take the small fish out and back into its original tank and put the opaque barrier in. Wait five minutes for the opponent fish to rest and then put the next fish in, repeating the procedure for the rest of the five fishes. We will be using a regression test to analyze our data.

Results:
In the six fish there was no distinct trend between weight and the aggressive behaviors exhibited as shown through the line in graph 1. For our regression of pelvic fin flickering we had a p value of 0.323 at 4 degrees of freedom and an r-squared value of 0.24. For our regression of tail beats we had a p-value of 0.630 at 4 degrees of freedom and an r-squared value 0.063. For our regression of gill flares we had a p-value of 0.810 at 4 degrees of freedom with a r-squared value of 0.01623. Since our p-values were over 0.05 our results were not significant.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was rejected as there was no distinguishable trend between size and aggression/agonistic behaviors. Our data went so far as to not have any correlation between the two variables as all the fish, for the most part, there were fish both large and small that exhibited the same behavior and there were spikes in the behavior, as shown through figure 1, that were not correlated with size. In figures 1-3 there was a peak in the antagonistic behaviors of the middle weights and several results throughout all antagonistic behaviors and their graphs that did not follow any trend of size being related to number of antagonistic behaviors exhibited. These results lead us to the conclusion that size simply does not matter. As shown through all of the figures it does not matter how large the fish is or how small it is; there is no noticeable trend or relationship between size and aggression. The betta fish that are small and large reflect the same amount of aggression when if size did matter one would have been greater than another. It is possible that the trigger for aggression is something else rather than simple size difference. We did not have a female there so it could have been that without a female the fish saw that it was pointless to fight since it would unnecessarily injure each other without the reward of reproduction being present. Also, the fish did not have the potential to actually engage in physical confrontation (because of the barriers between each other) so they could have also figured it would be smarter to not waste energy on aggressive behaviors when they will not actually fight and save it for when their live is on the line and they can fight. They may also have arose because of habituation. Habituation is defined as being a decline in response to a repeated and constant stimulus. [Johnson: 2016] The opponent fish may have become habituated to the different fish being put opposite it so it no longer exhibited its antagonistic behaviors. [da Silva: 2014] Then because of its unresponsiveness the fish we were studying, especially those toward the later trials, did not have as large (numerically) of a response since they were not challenged as much so therefore they remained rather docile. Another reason the opponent fish may have not been very responsive and thereby caused the experimental betta fish to not exhibit agonistic behaviors is that it may have been tired after being but through several trials over and over so it no longer had the energy to exhibit the aggressive behaviors that could have caused our experimental fish to match or escalate the behaviors. [Dzieweczynski: 2012] One other reason our hypothesis may have not worked is because we neglected to consider the confounding variable of color as we did not pay attention to what colors the fish were when we put them into the tank. The color difference or similarity could have affected the fishes` aggression and impacted our data as we were testing two variables instead of just one because of this error. If we were to repeat the experiment we would definitely make sure the fishes` colors are the same to eliminate color as a confounding variable, trade out the opposite fish so we could eliminate the potential error of habituation and it gets too tired to be aggressive. Something else we could test is the affect that hunger affects aggression by not feeding the experimental fish and seeing the amount of behaviors they exhibit toward the opponent fish.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This graph is representative of the total amounts of agonistic behaviors (gill flares, pelvic fin flickers, and tails beats) for each fish. The greatest amount of behaviors was exhibited by the 2.2 g. fish but there was no linear trend between the weight and the amount of aggressive behaviors. We had a standard deviation between the groups of +/- 23.52.
Figure 2: This graph represents the amount of pelvic fin flickers that each weight had. There was a peak at about 2.25 and an overall low at about 1.56. There was no noticeable or linear trend between the two variables. The average number of pelvice fin flickers was 3.67 and the standard deviation was 2.5.
Figure 3: This graph represents the amount of tail beats each fish had done. The fish with the middle weights seemed to have the greatest number of tail beats while the lightest and heaviest barely had any. Once again there was no linear trend between these two variables. The average number of tail beats was 18 and the standard deviation was 23.23.
Figure 4: This graph represents the number of gill flares that each fish did. The graph had no linear trend between the two variables as the line kept going up and down throughout the plot. The average number of gill flares was 4.17 and the standard deviation between the number of gill flares was 4.07.
