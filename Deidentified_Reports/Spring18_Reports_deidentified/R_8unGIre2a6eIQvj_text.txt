Title: The Impact of Martin’s IGR on the Development of Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
This lab experiment was used to determine the impacts of development on the Manduca sexta caterpillars when they had the mimic Juvenile Hormone, Martin’s IGR, administered to half the sample population. When a holometabolous insect goes through the transition from larva to adult, the timing and type of molting depends on the levels of Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Therefore, my hypothesis was that the Manduca sexta caterpillars who are administered Martin’s IGR through their food will have severely low levels of mass and length in comparison to the control group. To perform this experiment, we would give half the Manduca sexta sample a control diet consisted Manduca Food and distilled water. The experimental group caterpillars would have Manduca food and a diluted Martin’s IGR solution. For the next week mass and length would be recorded, as well as preparing food again. The results of the experiment showed that based on the high p-value, the two groups were not statistically significant. What this means is that in an expanded study with a larger sample group, and extended time can create a more concrete answer.  

Introduction:
Agriculture has a major importance within our society because it provides supply of food for the people of the world and it allows for trade to create economies for other countries. However, obstacles can face farmers in achieving high crop yields for are pests. One pest that could be consider dangerous is the Manduca sexta or commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. The Manduca sexta is a holometabolous insect that populates throughout the United States. During the Manduca sexta’s larval stage, it mostly consumes the solanaceous plant tobacco due to chemicals found in these plants that is vital for the development of its body. However, this can create damaging costs since these insects would defoliate the tobacco (Morgan, 2018). Considering this main problem, the purpose of our study is to investigate the physiology of development of the Manduca sexta, to see if there is any way to efficiently kill the Manduca sexta before it harms the crops. In the physiology of development in the Manduca sexta two hormones are critical in controlling the timing and type of growth an insect develops: Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone is a hormone that regulates the type of molt that the insect experiences, while Ecdysterone focuses on the timing. During the 1st-4th instar phase, the levels of JH are high with low Ecdysterone levels before Juvenile Hormone levels fall drastically when entering the five-instar stage. With this drop of Juvenile Hormone, Ecdysterone levels rises to create a commitment phase which signals the caterpillar the time to pupate is soon. (Johnson, 2018). This information helps question the idea if there is a threshold of Juvenile Hormone where the positive effects can be negated and create harm to the insect. Therefore, in this experiment it was decided to administer Martin’s IGR, a mimic hormone of Juvenile Hormone, into a Manduca sexta caterpillar. The Manduca sexta caterpillar was used because the transition between the larval instar proceed quickly by being in the 5th around 18 days later (Johnson, 2018). My hypothesis for this experiment is that the Manduca sexta caterpillars who are administered Martin’s IGR through their food will have severely low levels of mass, length, and food consumption in comparison to the control group. Pests could eventually evolve where some insecticides where it would make it hard to find around to keep pests at bay. It is important to adopt new effective methods to help plants grow to its highest yield.  

Materials and Methods:
To test out my hypothesis, we designed an experiment with Manduca sexta caterpillars where Martin’s IGR would be incorporated into the diet of some caterpillars to observe the impact of development in each caterpillar. For our experiment, 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were used from Great Lakes Manduca that were in the fourth instar stage in their development cycle. These caterpillars were then divided into two groups: the control group and the experimental group where each group had a diet. The control group’s diet was produced by massing out 40 grams of Manduca food into a container and combing 40 µL of distilled water with the food. The experimental group’s diet was produced by massing 40 grams of Manduca food in a container and combining a dilution of Martin’s IGR. The dilution was created by combining 4mL of Martin’s IGR into 100 mL of distilled water. In addition to making the diets for the groups, we constructed a container for the caterpillars by using a plastic container with an index divider for efficient use of materials and cost. In addition, we labeled the container to identify the caterpillars. We then measured and recorded the length, the mass, and the percentage of food eaten by each caterpillar. After receiving the initial data, each caterpillar was placed into the container with its corresponding label. The food made earlier was then distributed to each caterpillar. For every control group caterpillar, around 10 grams of the control diet food was massed and place alongside the caterpillar. This same process occurred for the experimental group with the experimental food. The caterpillars were then placed in an incubator at 25 ˚C for storage. We would observe the caterpillars each day by recording its mass and length. Food would be made for the caterpillars, and this process lasted for one week. With our data collected, we would use the statistical test two sample t-test between the control and experimental group.

Results:
Based on Figures 1 and 2, the general trend is that in all three measurements, there was a constant growth in both the control and experimental except for one occurrence where the average length in the experimental group decreased. While this provides some detail for the problem, to gain a detailed interpretation of the experiment’s results, a statistical test of two-sample test is applied to our data. From the two-sample statistical test, it is inferred that because no value is close to zero then there is no statistical significance between the experimental and the control group. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis stated that the Manduca sexta caterpillars who are administered Martin’s IGR through their food will have severely low levels of mass and length in comparison to the control group; however, my results did not support my hypothesis. While there is a trend that the mass and the length in the experimental group was lower than the control, this data cannot give a definite answer in saying that the Martin’s IGR was responsible for these results because the p-value of statistically tests were 0.64 and 0.52. Supported data would normally range between 0.05 or less. However, I believe that the reasoning for obtaining these statistically results is that the experiment did not last long enough to see the full impact of accumulating the amount of Martins IGR in the caterpillar system, and that there was not a big enough sample for this testing for definite results. With the use of visual observations, there was a sign that indicated a predominate Juvenile Hormone in the experimental caterpillar’s system by seeing the pale appearance of its cuticle as it grew (Resh 2009). However, in the experiment there where errors that occurred throughout the procedure that influenced the results. One error is that at the very beginning of the experiment, the number 6 experimental caterpillar was able to climb over the index card into the other side of the container. Fortunately, the caterpillar only breached into another caterpillar with the experimental diet. Another possible that could have occurred during lab is that the solution for each food might not have been evenly mixed in the container leaving the amount of solution in the food for each caterpillar harder to determine. A final error that occurred is that on the index card divider, liquid was visible on the card. This means that the hormone or water in the food would have been absorbed by card making it inaccessible for the caterpillar and impacting our measurements. In addition to fixing these errors, I believe that there can be improvements on the experimental design to determine if there is a threshold for Juvenile Hormone where the costs outweigh the benefits. The first improvement would be to extend the time of collect data until the pupate phase of the caterpillars because this could allow us to see if there are any other physical changes besides the color of the cuticle. Another idea to extend the study is to use various concentrations of Martin’s IGR to find the best possible solution to either kill or grow Manduca sexta caterpillars. While our results did not bring us closer to knowing if Martin’s IGR could be effective as an insecticide or promoting growth, this experiment did provide emphasis on the importance of hormones in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta.
