Title: The Presence of Clay in Soil Increases Root to Shoot Length Ratio and Branching in Avena Sativa

Abstract:
Plants allocate their resources toward doing whatever they need to do to survive. In Avena Sativa (further referred to as Oat plants), we see this in how they allocate their resources toward growing longer and more complex root branching patterns in order to obtain water in different soil conditions. When the presence of clay increases in soil, Oat plants increase their root lengths in comparison to their shoots, and they also increase the amount of branching on their roots in order to more efficiently remove water molecules from clay molecules. In soil with better drainage conditions and nutrients, like Vermiculite, the Oak plants do not need to allocate as many resources to growing these complex roots. 


Introduction:
As a result of the fact that plants are unable to physically move themselves from one place to another, they have various resource limitations. In order to survive, they engage in a process called resource allocation that allows them to take limited resources such as sunlight and water, and dedicate them toward specific processes. With that said, plants have to be really good at obtaining resources from the environment and assigning them to specific plant functions, like growth, defense, or reproduction. This causes phenotypic differences between plants. 
	Water is one of the most important resources to plants because it (along with carbon dioxide) is an essential ingredient for photosynthesis, which is how plants obtain solar energy and create their food. Plants have adaptation strategies for adjusting to different water availabilities (Allyson Williams, 2018). 
In different soil types, water can become more or less available to the roots of a plant. For example, in sandy soil, which has good water drainage, and cannot hold large amounts of water. For this reason, this type of soil often loses nutrients with the water that drains off of it, and some plants do not have what they need. Clay on the other hand, holds water well, but because the particles are so small, they tend to stick to the water and stick to each other, making the plants have to work extra hard to penetrate the soil and reach the water. In addition to that, clay particles are negatively charged, and therefore, attract water molecules. This is another reason some plants have a hard time obtaining the water they need in this type of soil. Vermiculite is a mineral that is commonly put in potting soils because it promotes aeration of the soil and proper water drainage (“Horticultural Uses of Perlite and Vermiculite”). 
Based on information on different types of soils, we wanted to understand how soil properties could affect water availability to plants, and to access how the plants would respond to this availability. I predicted that Oat plants growing in a Vermiculite and clay soil mixture would respond by allocating their resources toward growing roots to be able to reach the water and that as a result, the roots would be longer and have a more complex branching pattern than Oat plants growing in only Vermiculite soil. I hypothesized that Oat plants growing in a Vermiculite and clay mixture would, on average, have a larger root to shoot ratio than plants growing in Vermiculite. I also hypothesized that there would be more branching on Oat plants growing in the Vermiculite and clay mixture compared to Oat plants growing in Vermiculite. 


Materials and Method:
As a result of the fact that Oat plants are fairly cheap and resilient and that they are relatively easy to remove from soil in order to be studied, I chose Oat plants as my test species. 
To test my hypothesis, I conducted an experiment in order to compare the phenotypes of plants growing in two different soil conditions: Clay and Vermiculite and just Vermiculite. I obtained six small pots and filled of them generously with Vermiculite soil. In the other three pots, I placed a half Vermiculite and half clay mixture. On the first day, I placed a hand.f.ul of Oak plant seeds in each of the six pots. After placing the pots in a large tray and placing the tray in a greenhouse, I sprayed all of the pots with water until water dripped from the bottom. I watered the plants each day for a two weeks. After the end of the two weeks, I removed the plants from the soil and took the following measurements: Total mass of the plants in each individual pot, the mass of the roots of each pot individually, the mass of the shoot in each pot individually, the length of the shoots for the plants in each pot individually, the length of the roots for each pot, and number of branches on each root. I recorded all of these measurements and took averages for each category. For root and shoot length, I calculated ratios. I did the same thing for root to shoot mass. I also calculated the standard deviations for the root to shoot length ratio, for the root to shoot mass ratio, and for the branching data. I created two graphs: One depicting the differences in root to shoot length between the clay and Vermiculite and the Vermiculite soil treatments and one depicting the differences in branching between the clay and Vermiculite and the Vermiculite soil treatments.



Results:
I focused on the data related to differences in root to shoot ratio for the two different soil treatments and also on how the soil treatments affected the amount of branches each plant root had. We took averages for each pot for two soil treatments. 
Based on the graph above, I can conclude that the Oat plants that were treated with the Vermiculite and clay had a higher root to shoot ratio than the Oat plants that were treated with Vermiculite. The overall average root to shoot length ratio for the Vermiculite treatment was 0.882 cm. with a standard deviation of 0.145 cm. The average root to shoot length ratio for Vermiculite and clay soil treatment was 1.539 cm. with a standard deviation of 0.094 cm. This shows that the plays growing in Vermiculite and clay had longer roots than those growing in Vermiculite. 
Based on the graph above, I can conclude that the Oat plants that were treated with the Vermiculite and clay had a higher number of branches than the Oat plants that were treated with Vermiculite. The overall average amount of branches for the Vermiculite treatment was 2.600 cm. with a standard deviation of 0.115 cm. The average number of branches for Vermiculite and clay soil treatment was 4.000 cm. with a standard deviation of 0.400 cm. This shows that the plays growing in Vermiculite and clay had more branches than those growing in Vermiculite. 
Conducting a Student T-test revealed a p_value of 0.0015 for the comparison between root to shoot length between the plants in the Vermiculite and clay mixture and the plants in the Vermiculite alone. The Student T-Test resulted in a p_value of 0.015 for the comparison between the average number of branches in the Vermiculite and clay mixture and the plants in the Vermiculite alone. Based on the fact each of these values is significent, I am able to reject my null hypothesis that soil type has no effect on root to shoot ratio and branching complexity. 


Discussion:
Our data showed that the Oat plants that were treated with the Vermiculite and clay had a higher root to shoot ratio than the Oat plants that were treated with Vermiculite and that the overall average root to shoot length ratio for the Vermiculite treatment was 0.882 cm. The average root to shoot length ratio for Vermiculite and clay soil treatment was much higher at 1.539 cm. Given the way that ratios are calculated, a higher ratio value for root to shoot length would constitute a higher root length in comparison to shoot length. Since the Oat plants with Vermiculite and clay had a higher root to shoot ratio than the plants with only Vermiculite, I can conclude that the clay caused the plants to allocate their resources toward growing longer roots.
	Our data also showed that the Oat plants that were treated with the Vermiculite and clay had a higher amount branching than the Oat plants that were treated with Vermiculite and that the overall average root to shoot length ratio for the Vermiculite treatment was 2.600 cm. while the average root to shoot length ratio for Vermiculite and clay soil treatment was much higher at 4.000 cm. Since the Oat plants with Vermiculite and clay had, on average, a higher number of branches than the plants with only Vermiculite, I can conclude that the clay caused the plants to allocate their resources toward growing more branches in their roots. 
	Both of these sets of data together suggest that my hypothesis was supported and that plays growing in clay allocate their resources toward growing more efficient roots in order to obtain more resources, like water. Since clay particles are negatively charged, they attract water molecules (because water is polar and is attracted to pretty much anything with a charge). This makes it harder for plants to pull water off of the clay particles and causes the plants to have to allocate their resources toward trying to make it easier for their roots to pull the water molecules away from the clay particles so that the roots can absorb the water and use the water for the process of photosynthesis which is how plants make their food. 
	Some plants grow well in waterlogged and compact, soil with low aeration. Various species of trees found in Utah, like Alnus glutinosa, Alnus tenuifolia, and Taxodium distichum, are a testament to this (Wagner, 2015). In doing some research, I found some studies that countered my findings. One asserted that plants growing in clay conditions tend to have shorter and less complex root systems because it is hard for them to get the plants’ roots to penetrate the tiny clay particles that tend to stick together and form large clumps in the prescience of water (Bengough, 2005). A plausible explanation for this may be this applies to plants that are grown solely in clay and not in a soil mixture that is only half clay like in our experiment. In a replicate experiment I may test in three groups instead of two: one with Vermiculite, one with half Vermiculite and half clay, and one with just clay. This would give me another controll to compare to and allow me to test whether or not the roots of Oak plants growing in clay would have significently shorter and less complex root branching than both plants growing in Vermiculite and plants growing in a Vermiculite and clay mixture. I may also venture to test more than one variety of plants because based on that fact that some plants grow very well in clay, different plant species may respond differently to varying soil conditions.
