Title: Resource allocation in Vigna radiata grown under green and white light yield

Abstract:
This experiment was performed to find the differences in resource allocation in mung beans (Vigna radiata) grown in different environments. Specifically, whether plants grown under green light would grow larger shoots than plants grown under white light. The results show that plants grown under white light have a higher root:shoot (R:S) ratio, which is a measure of how large the shoots are compared to the roots. This follows the hypothesis, and makes sense, because plants cannot absorb green light as readily as they can white light. Therefore, plants living under green light would have to produce larger leaves to capitalize on the little light that remains. 


Introduction:
The purpose of the experiment is to see the difference in growth between plants growing under white light and those under green light. These variables were chosen to partially simulate plants living on the forest floor and plants living in a sunny area. The plants growing under white light will likely devote fewer resources to leaves, because the light that they can use is more abundant [Wang 2013]. They will also likely have fewer restrictions on their growth, so they will probably be larger. This is because plants use red and blue light in the process of photosynthesis, but green light is mostly reflected, so it is not used by the plant. If a plant has access only to green light, it follows that it would reflect most of it an absorb a very limited amount of light. This would mean a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis, which plants use to produce the sugars that make up their structure. 



Materials and Methods:
In the experiment, Mung Beans (Vigna radiata) were used. The species was chosen for its resilience and speed of growth. Two planing trays were prepared, each with three pots full of seeds. The two trays were covered in a plastic film, the films being identical except for the color: one was green tinted, the other clear. The plants were placed in a greenhouse,  watered daily, and left to grow for two weeks. Then, random plants were selected, five from each pot, giving each tray a sample of 15 plants. The plants were cleaned, weighed, and their lengths were measured. The roots were cut off and weighed and measured as well. The measurements were used to find the overall measurements of the plants, but also to find the root:shoot ratio. This number can indicate how many resources the plant is using to perform its necessary functions. 


Results:
The experiment found that plants grown under green light were of comparable total mass and length (table 1), but had differences when it came to root:shoot ratios (figures 1 and 2).  The R:S ratio by length for the two samples had a P-value of 0.6275, which exceeds the standard 0.05. This means that the two samples are statistically different, with the mean for white light exceeding that of green light by an average of 0.0736 centimeters. For R:S ratio by mass, the P-value was 0.1835, again showing statistical difference, with the mean for white light exceeding that of green, this time by an average of 0.699 grams. 

Discussion:
The results show that the plants growing in green light focus more of their resources on shoot growth than on root growth. Shoots, which comprise a stem and a cotyledon, or “seed leaf”, are the part of the young plant that captures light [Conn, 2017]. If a plant living under green light isn’t producing enough energy through photosynthesis, it must produce larger leaves, or in this case shoots, to compensate. This leads the the effect seen in the experiment: the plants growing under white light have normal R:S ratios because they have plenty of light, but those growing under green light must produce more shoots. This aligns with the hypothesis, that the plants growing under white light would devote fewer resources to leaves.
