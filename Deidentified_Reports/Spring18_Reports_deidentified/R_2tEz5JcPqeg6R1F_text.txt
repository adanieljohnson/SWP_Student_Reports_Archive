Title: Lidocaine’s Effect on Muscle Contractions in the Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Muscle contractions depend on action potentials to release acetylcholine which causes the opening of sodium channels in order to depolarize the muscle cell, which leads to an action potential which causes muscle contraction. Our experiment analyzed the change in force of muscle contraction as well as length of latent period before and after the injection of lidocaine. By injecting Rania pipiens legs with lidocaine (a sodium channel blocker), we observed that there is a decrease in force of muscle contraction. Although our data was not statistically supported, our observations suggest that lidocaine does in fact decrease the force of muscle contractions. 

Introduction:
Our experiment utilized Rania pipiens legs in order to observe muscle contractions. Muscle contractions are stimulated by action potentials traveling along an axon to the neuromuscular junction. A first action potential is generated that releases acetylcholine into the post synaptic membrane, which allows potassium and sodium channels to open which generates a second action potential that runs through the muscle fibers. This causes the release of calcium ions, which encourages the myosin thick filaments to pull actin thin filaments, which shortens the muscle. When calcium ions return to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, this allows the muscle to relax. Lidocaine is a synthetic compound commonly used as an anesthetic. It closes sodium channels in the neurons of the muscle fibers, preventing the muscle cells from depolarizing so there is no action potential to stimulate muscle contraction. We used myograms to record the force of contraction and length of latent periods. We hypothesized that lidocaine will block sodium channels in the muscle cell and nerve, therefore there is less depolarization, which leads to a smaller action potential resulting in a smaller contraction. 

Materials and Method:
We used two Rania pipiens legs and pulled back the skin exposing the gastrocnemus muscle and separated it until we had access to the sciatic nerve. We attached the muscle by a string to the transducer which is connected to the computer to record myograms. After, we attached a pair of electrodes to the sciatic nerve and stimulated it at different voltages in order to find the threshold (in mV) in each leg. Then we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.1 Ml of lidocaine as well as added a drop to the sciatic nerve. After waiting for a five minute period post-injection, a threshold stimuli was applied to the nerve and three myograms were recorded again. A muscle contraction has three states; a latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. We measured amplitude of contraction as well as length of latent period. The data was analyzed with a paired t_test comparing amplitudes of contraction with and without lidocaine. (P-value= 0.21).

Results:
Once each frog leg had been injected with lidocaine at threshold stimulus, the force of contraction became smaller and the latent period became longer in both instances. Muscle contractions with lidocaine had smaller contractions averaging at 0.290.15V which was about 0.39V smaller than the gastrocnemus muscle contraction without lidocaine averaging at 0.68 0.03V(paired t_test, P-value= 0.21). The latent periods of both frog legs were extended by 50ms after the injection of lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. 

Discussion:
We hypothesized that injection of lidocaine into the muscle would block sodium channels in the muscle and nerve, therefore leading to less depolarization in the cell, which leads to a smaller action potential, resulting in a smaller contraction. Although our results were not statistically supported, our observations suggested this was indeed the case. In both frog legs, the amplitude of the force of contraction became smaller after lidocaine was injected. The muscle contractions with lidocaine had smaller amplitudes than the muscle contractions without lidocaine. Although there was a difference in amplitudes, the paired t_test did not suggest that the data was statistically significent. Also, the length of the latent period during muscle contraction was extended after injection of lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle compared to the muscle contractions without lidocaine. This suggests that lidocaine slows reaction times, forcing the muscle to become more lethargic and slower to contract. Another study compared the strength of action potentials in guinea pig ventricular cells after having been injected lidocaine. At low (therapeutic) doses, lidocaine induced a small reduction in action potential duration and contraction but had no effect on transient depolarizations or, under voltage-clamp conditions, on the transient inward currents [Mitchell, 1988]. This experiment aligns with ours and supports our hypothesis, suggesting that small doses of lidocaine lessen action potentials, which in turn leads to smaller muscle contractions. Our observations suggest that lidocaine has an effect on the force of contraction due to sodium channel blockage, but our hypothesis is not statistically supported.
