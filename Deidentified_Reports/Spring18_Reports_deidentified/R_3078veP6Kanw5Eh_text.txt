Title: The Lack of Effect on Mung Bean (Vigna Radiata) Growth Allocation in the Presence of Hydrogen Peroxide

Abstract:
Root-to-shoot ratios are a way to measure growth allocation. The ratio is calculated by dividing the biomass of the root by the biomass of the shoot. Root-to-shoot ratios change based on limiting resources and environmental conditions that affect plant behavior based on nutrient availability. Essentially, this helps to assess the overall health of a plant. The effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on Vigna Radiata (mung beans) were examined in environments both with and without H2O2, the latter only containing water (H2O). Hydrogen peroxide is known to support plant health overall and serves as an anti-fungal agent. To begin the experiment, six pots were separated into two treatment groups, with three pots receiving H2O2 and three pots only receiving H2O. The first week both treatment groups only received H2O to ensure that germination was occurring, and the second week only one treatment group received H2O2. The results did not support the hypothesis. According to the data there is no effect of H2O2 on mung beans. 

Introduction:
The behavior of hydrogen peroxide for many physiological processes in plants has been recorded as being a promotor during root growth and formation in hypocotyl cuttings (Li, 2017). Plants act different based on their environment. When limited resources arise, such as water, plants will respond by allocating to their new environment. Biomass allocation can be calculated using root-to-shoot ratios. Generally, root-to-shoot ratios increase when there is a nutrient deficiency and moisture stress conditions. Limited resources to below-ground environments usually lead to a higher root-to-shoot ratio. It is to be expected that the root-to-shoot ratio for plants living in environments induced with H2O2 will have a higher ratio for both weight and length than plants living in an environment without H2O2 present. In this experiment, Vigna Radiata were used to test the difference in root-to-shoot ratios of length and weight of plants that grew in the presence of and not in the presence of H2O2. The hypothesis is that the presence of hydrogen peroxide will increase the root-to-shoot ratio of plants grown in the stressful environment of H2O2. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted over a two-week period. During week one all six pots between both of the two treatment groups only received water every day to ensure successful germination. After week one, treatment group two (only three pots of plants) received 10mm of H2O2 every other day instead of H2O for a week. The other treatment group with the remaining 3 pots received 50mm of H2O every day. Both treatment groups were kept inside a greenhouse.  First, mung bean seeds were planted. A solution containing 10mm of H2O2 and water was created and stored in the greenhouse to be used throughout week two of the experiment. After mung bean seeds were planted both treatment groups were placed into the greenhouse. After two weeks, the pots were removed from the greenhouse and data from each pot was recorded. Data was collected for each of the following variables: weight of plant (g), weight of roots (g), weight of shoots (g), weight root-to-shoot ratio (g), root length of plant (mm), shoot length of plant (mm), length root-to-shoot ratio of plant (mm). After all the data was collected, the average statistic for each treatment group was calculated from the three pots in the treatment group. Then, the p_value was calculated for the length root-to-shoot ratio and the weight root-to-shoot ratio using a two-sample t_test.

Results:
There was not a statistically significent difference in the root-to-shoot ratios between the two treatment groups. Figure one shows the lack of statistically proven relationship. Length root-to-shoot ratios had a p_value of 0.051 and weight root-to-shoot ratios had a p_value of 0.75. Since the p_values are both greater than the significance level, the probability of the experimental outcome is largely due to chance. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis of root-to-shoot ratios increasing in both weight and length of mung bean plant growth. According to the data both length and weight root-to-shoot ratio p_values were above the significance level, indicating that the experiment results are largely due to random chance. Mung beans show no response to increased growth and weight when in the presence of the H2O2 environment. There is excessive variation in the three-pot average and may be the reason that the data is not statistically proven. The H2O2 in the experiment did not act as an anti-fungal agent, even though it is commonly known to. Instead there was fungus surrounding a variety of roots among the mung beans. In another experiment, however, it has been proven that acidic agents influence the weight and growth of mung beans (Castellanos-Barriga, 2017). 

The results collected in this experiment were different than those found in an experiment in which acid seaweed liquid extracts affected the growth of mung beans. Acid seaweed liquid extracts, at a low concentration of 0.2%, increased mung bean seed germination rates. Root-to-shoot length and weight ratios showed an increase when in the presence of acid extract at this concentration (Castellanos-Barriga, 2017). It is possible that the concentration of H2O2 in this experiment was not high enough or that mung beans do not react to H2O2 but would react in an environment treated with an acidic concentration.
