Title: Blockage of 20E Hormone in Manduca sexta Larva Inhibits Progression into Adulthood

Abstract:
The hormone ecdysterone (20E) in the Manduca sexta organism initiates insect growth and development into the final larval stages. This study examines the effects of azadirachtin, a 20E inhibitor, on Manduca sexta growth during the third and fourth larval stages. Over the course of 8 days, four M. sexta were fed caterpillar food with water and four M. sexta were fed caterpillar food containing Azamax, a commercially sold azadirachtin-containing solution. The insects were weighed every day, and their overall weight changes were compared after 8 days. The treatment group had an average weight gain of 0.33 grams, while the controll group had an average weight gain of 5.17 grams. This was most likely due to the treatment group's blockage of 20E, causing an inability to grow, thus stunting development into the next instar period. The controll group, however, had normal 20E levels, and was able to advance and increase in size and weight.

Introduction:
The Tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a member of the Lepidoptera Order, which consists of all moths, butterflies, and skippers (1). The organism gets its name from its reputation as a garden pest of many commercial crops, like tobacco, tomato, and pepper. It is found throughout the United States but is most numerous in the southeast (2). Although a problem for agriculture, the insect has become popular in laboratory studies as it serves as a model organism for hormone function and the endocrine system of insects. Three main hormones regulate the growth and development of M. sexta: Brain hormone (BH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile hormone (JH) (1). While all three play an important role in the insect's life cycle, this study will only be focusing on the effects of the 20E hormone. Ecdysterone is produced in the prothoracic glands and is used to initiate and regulate molting and metamorphosis from the larval to the pupal stage (1). An initial increase in 20E concentration during the fourth larval instar causes a decrease in JH levels and initiates the final transition into the final instar and eventually the cuticle formation and development into a moth (1). The organic molecule azadirachtin is naturally found in the neem tree and is structurally similar to ecdysterone. The similarities cause azadirachtin to serve as a 20E-inhitor, blocking the production and release of the hormone. Depending on when it is consumed by the insect, it can also act as a feeding deterrent (4). In this experiment, Azamax, a commercially sold solution containing azadirachtin, will be administered via food to M. sexta in the third and fourth larval instars. If the Manduca sexta larva are fed Azamax for one week, then their growth and development will be stunted, not allowing the insects to increase in weight a significent amount.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta in the third and/or fourth instar were selected and divided evenly into a controll and treatment group (four caterpillars in each group). Four round plastic containers were divided in half with a notecard, and the top was perforated to allow the insects to breathe. For the controll group, a total of 40g of caterpillar food was measured. Next, 10 drops of deionized water were pipetted into the food to prevent it from drying. The food was then stirred with a spoon and divided into four equal parts of 10g each and placed in the subsequent sections of the plastic containers holding the controll M. sexta. The treatment group was also given a total of 40g of caterpillar food but treated with 10 drops of a 4% dilution of Azamax. The food was then stirred and divided into four equal parts of 10g, and then placed in the corresponding halves of the treatment group containers. The caterpillars were first weighed in grams, and then placed in the containers and stored at 23°C in a light/dark cycle incubator. Approximately every 24 hours, the M. sexta were weighed, given new food with the same preparation as above, and had their containers cleaned of any leftover food. This process was repeated for 8 days, and the change overall change in weight was calculated for each M. sexta. A two-sample t_test was then conducted comparing the controll and treatment groups.

Results:
The controll group significently increased in weight over the course of the experiment, with the average change in weight equaling 5.17 grams, while the treatment group experienced very little weight gain with the average only 0.33 grams. This is seen in figure 1 and also means the controll M. sexta gained an average of 15.7 times more weight than the treatment caterpillars. Furthermore, two caterpillars in the controll group showed signs of molting during the experiment, while no caterpillars in the treatment group did so. The controll caterpillars also all noticeably increased in length, while the treatment M. sexta appeared to remain about the same length. On the final day of the experiment, the controll caterpillars had all consumed almost all their food and one notecard divider showed signs of bite marks. The treatment caterpillars all still had more food remaining. The mean of the controll group was statistically different from that of the treatment group (t_stat = 13.66,   d.f. = 6, P = 9.56x10-6).

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported by the data from this experiment. It stated that the Manduca sexta given Azamax should not see significent weight increases, which did occur. Azamax contains azadirachtin, a molecule that acts as an ecdysterone blocker (4). This hormone is necessary for Manduca sexta to develop past the fourth and fifth instar and pupate into an adult moth, as it first triggers a decrease in the concentration of juvenile hormone prompting the insect to molt into its fifth larval stage. Another spike in 20E at this point results in pupation (1). Because the treatment group was consuming azadirachtin, the initial spike in 20E levels was impossible and the caterpillars remained in their current larval stage. No hormonal signal was produced, inhibiting the insect from entering its final instar periods, which explains why the treatment group saw very little increase in weight. The controll group, however, experienced a normal spike in 20E and were able to grow and develop into the next larval stages (1). This was further supported by the observation of two of the four controll M. sexta molting. Manduca sexta in nature are an agricultural pest as larva. This study evidenced that inhibiting the 20E hormone limits growth and might also decrease the amount of food consumed by the larva. Further testing should focus on the earliest larval stages azadirachtin can stunt the growth of M. sexta. This would allow for greater pest controll of the Tobacco Hornworm. Future studies should also focus on the toxicity of azadirachtin to other organisms, especially humans. Some tests did show minimal toxicity to rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs, although a significent increase in rat infertility was observed (4). These experiments could prove whether or not azadirachtin would make for a viable insecticide against Manduca sexta.

Effect of Azadirachtin on weight of Manduca sexta larva. The treatment group was fed caterpillar food with Azamax, a 20E hormone inhibitor, while the controll group was fed caterpillar food with water. Four M. sexta in the third and fourth larval instar period were placed in each group and fed each day for 8 days. Weights were measured using a scale. Each bar is the mean change in weight of the 4 caterpillars in the controll and the 4 caterpillars in the treatment group after 8 days; error bars are ± 5%.
