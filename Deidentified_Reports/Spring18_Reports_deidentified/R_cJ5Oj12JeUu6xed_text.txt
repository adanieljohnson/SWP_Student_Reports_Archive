Title: Effects of 20E Blocker on Manduca Sexta Endocrine System

Abstract:
Azadirachtin, the active ingredient in Azamax, works as a PTTH blocker and, thus, an inhibitor to the production and release of ecdysone, a hormone necessary for maturation in the Manduca sexta. Tobacco hornworms were fed a diet treated with azadirachtin and compared to a controll group in order to observe what effects, if any, the allelochemical had on the caterpillars’ growth and development. The experiment was designed to test our predictions that the Azamax diet would prevent the Manduca sexta from properly maturing. Contrary to previous studies performed testing the relation between azadirachtin and Manduca sexta development, our averaged values of length, width, and amount of food eaten for the controll group yielded means that were not statistically different from the length, width, and amount of food eaten means for the treatment group. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing the two-sample t_test.

Introduction:
Integral to the anatomical structure and functioning of various life forms, hormones enable vertebrates and insects to controll various facets of their physiology, i.e. growth, development, and behaviors. Commonly associated with puberty and regulation of the maturation process, hormones allow for an organism to appropriately respond and adapt to its environment utilizing a form of hormone-based signaling associated with the organism’s endocrine system. Sent from the brain as a chemical signal in response to some input from the body, the hormone signaling triggers output signals that controll the organism’s growth and development, behaviors, and physiology. These output signals, in turn, can generate either an activation effect, which changes function, or an organizational effect, which changes body arrangement. Organizational effects, in particular, often result in structural and systemic changes within the organism as a byproduct of that organism’s growth and development (Johnson: 2018). One case study performed in 1985 under U. Schlüter researched the effects of azadirachtin, the active ingredient in Azamax, on the Manduca sexta tobacco hornworm and found that increasing injection doses of the allelochemical over the ending phases of the larvae stage and beginning of pupation resulted in an increased likelihood of defective pupations and, in the higher dosages, development inhibition (Schlüter: 1985). The Manduca sexta of the Order Lepidoptera is one such insect whose maturation process relies on hormone-based signaling to trigger organizational effects within the body, making it an ideal model organism to study the effects of the unbalancing of hormones on maturation and development. As a holometabolous organism, the Manduca sexta undergoes major reorganization of its physiological structure during its pupal metamorphosis, or the transformation of the final larvae into its adult stage. Manduca sexta development relies predominantly on three hormones - prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH) - with its transition from larvae to pupa mainly involving the interaction between 20E and JH. Towards the end of the 4th and into the 5th larval instar period occurs a drop in JH levels, which precedingly were fairly high, such that this drop occurs simultaneously with a slight rise in 20E. Termed the commitment pulse, this rise in 20E indicates a sufficient size and nutrient storage for the caterpillar to begin pupating, triggering a release in PTTH that then results in the release of more 20E (Johnson: 2018). Since the Schlüter case study relied on injection of azadirachtin for observation of physiological response, we plan on studying the effects of azadirachtin on the Manduca sexta through digestive intake by incorporating Azamax into the caterpillar diet. In doing so, we plan on observing whether or not the independent variable of the quantity of Azamax present has any effect on the maturation process of the Manduca sexta, which will be measured through the dependent variables of the caterpillars’ length (mm), weight (g), and amount of food eaten (%) over the course of 7 days. With the addition of Azamax to the artificial diet of the treatment group, we expect azadirachtin to act as an ecdysone blocker that will, similar to the Schlüter case study, result in the defective maturation and, ultimately, pupation inhibition of the treatment Manduca sexta.

Materials and Method:
Wearing latex gloves due to the handling of live Manduca sexta, eight caterpillars were selected and separated into two groups of four. One group was labeled controll while the other was labeled the treatment group. Individually, we weighed the caterpillars one by one on a digital scale and recorded in grams the weight of each larvae for Day 1. This was followed by a measurement of the length of each caterpillar in millimeters for Day 1, which was recorded alongside their respective weights. We then prepared the rearing containers by taking 4 microwavable translucent deli containers and placing an index card divider in each, separating the containers into 2 equal halves. Afterwards, we labeled each half with our group name, caterpillar ID number, treatment or controll, and our lab section. Controls #1/#2 and #3/#4 were paired together in their respective containers, as well as Treatments #1/#2 and #3/#4. We then prepared the controll food, weighing 40g of food and dividing into 4 10g clumps, one for each controll caterpillar. Each clump was treated with 6 drops of water through a disposable pipet, and one clump was placed in every controll container half. This was followed by the preparation of the treatment food, similarly weighing 10g for each caterpillar. Using a new disposable pipet, we treated each clump with 6 drops of the 1: 1250 Azamax solution and place one clump in each of the 4 treatment homes. The caterpillars were then placed in an incubator. Every day for the next week, this process of recording the weight and length of each caterpillar was repeated, along with the weighing and recording of the amount of food remaining in each individual caterpillar. We also photographed each caterpillar for documentation every day. With the weight of how much food remained for each caterpillar, we calculated the amount of food eaten by subtracting weight of food remaining from 10 and multiplying by 10 to get a percentage. After recording the weight, length, and amount of food eaten of each caterpillar, we disposed of the leftover food along with any feces and prepared new food for each caterpillar. Repeating this process over the course of the next 7 days, we averaged the weight, length, and amount of food eaten for the treatment caterpillars by day, and also averaged the weight, length, and amount of food eaten for the controll caterpillars by day. Using these means, we found the standard deviation for each dependent variable for every day, the values of which were used in our two-sample t_test in order to compare the controll group to the treatment group.

Results:
Figure 1. Average of length of controll group Manduca sexta (blue) compared to average length of treatment group Manduca sexta (orange). 4 caterpillars were placed in each group and incubated for 1 week. Control caterpillars had no observed abnormalities before experiment and were fed artificial diet with only water added. Treatment caterpillars had no observed abnormalities before experiment and were fed artificial diet treated with 1: 1250 Azamax. Each point is mean length of 4 caterpillars from each treatment or controll group, one point per group for each day of the experiment; error bars are ±1 s.d.

In order to test how ingestion of azadirachtin, the active ingredient in Azamax, would affect the maturation of the Manduca sexta, a group of controll caterpillars were reared for comparing with a group of treatment caterpillars, which were fed the same diet as the controll group, only treated with 1: 1250 Azamax solution instead of water. Pertaining to the size of the caterpillars, the length of the caterpillars, both controll and treatment, experienced a trend of decline during the course of the week, as shown in Figure 1. A peak in the length of the caterpillars appears to have taken place on February 10 for the treatment group and February 11 for the controll group. While the average length of the caterpillars exhibited a slight upward trend in the first 2 days for both groups, the overall pattern of length looking at the days in succession as they appear in Figure 2 displays a primarily downward trend. The controll group began the week with an average length of 60.25 mm, ending with an average length of 56.25 mm. This difference in starting and ending values for length is not as considerable as the difference for the treatment group, which began at an average length of 70.00 mm and ended at an average length of 46.75 mm.

Each point is mean length of 4 caterpillars from each treatment or controll group, one point per group for each day of the experiment; error bars are ±1 s.d.

Concerning the change in weight of the controll and treatment groups, as shown in Figure 2, the treatment group experienced a downward trend in average weight of the caterpillars, whereas the controll group exhibited no significent change in weight from the beginning of the experiment to the end, starting at an average weight of 4.500 g and ending with an average weight of 4.706 g. The controll group experienced a slight and steady increase in weight until after February 11 when the averaged weight of the controll group caterpillars began to decline proportionally to the weight at which it had risen in the first 3 days. The treatment group, in comparison, displayed a slight rise in weight on the first day before steadily declining throughout the rest of the experiment, beginning with an average weight of 5.675 g and ending with an average weight of 3.265 g.
Similar to the trend in average caterpillar length, the amount of food eaten by the caterpillars of both the treatment and the controll groups displayed an overall downward pattern from the beginning of the week to the end, as shown in Figure 3. While both groups experienced a slight rise of food eaten on February 13, the overall trend of amount food eaten was one of decline. The controll group began with an average amount food eaten of 55.00% and ended with an average percent of 16.13%, whereas the treatment group also began with an average amount food eaten of 52.50% and ended with a percent of 17.48.

Same controll and treatment caterpillars from Figure 1. Each point is mean length of 4 caterpillars from each treatment or controll group, one point per group for each day of the experiment; error bars are ±1 s.d.

Using a two-sample t_test to compare the mean of our controll group to the mean of our treatment group, we found that the mean of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group for length (t_stat = 0.70, d.f. = 14, P = 0.493), weight (t_stat = 2.03, d.f. = 14, P = 0.062), or amount of food eaten (t_stat = 0.81, d.f. = 12, P = 0.434). All of our dependent variables resulted in a P-value greater than the common 95% confidence interval (P = 0.05 or less), which means that we are unable to reject the null hypothesis and that for all of the dependent variables, there was no statistically significent difference between our controll group and our treatment group.

Discussion:
The results of our experiment essentially indicate that while there appears to be some negative correlational interaction between the dietary intaking of azadirachtin and the weight of the treatment caterpillar, the statistical values of our two-sample t_test point convey that there is no statistically significent difference between the controll group mean and the treatment group mean for any of the variables of weight, length, or amount food eaten. This essentially leads us to accepting the null hypothesis and rejecting our own hypothesis formulated before the experiment that the ingestion of an ecdysone blocker such as Azamax would inhibit the development and maturation of the Manduca sexta, such that we must accept that the differences in means between the controll group and the treatment group length, weight, and amount of food eaten variables were not within our common significance interval of P = 0.05 and, thus, were not statistically different. Looking at the data, the similar decline trend in all three dependent variable categories may have more to do with the fact that the caterpillars we chose were nearing the end of their 5th larval instar phase and were readying themselves to begin pupation than the introduction of Azamax to the treatment group’s diet, especially considering Treatment #3 did begin to pupate. The signaling of pupation in the Manduca sexta revolves around the simultaneous drop in JH and rise in ecdysone, however, one reason that our results did not indicate a blockage of ecdysone is that we likely did not use enough of the Azamax, or a high enough concentration of it, for the azadirachtin to effectively block the ecdysone hormones. Our results may also be an indication of the fact that ecdysone blockage is not caused by a direct action of azadirachtin, but, rather, is a cascade effect triggered by brain activation that then targets and blocks the tissue that produces PTTH, the hormone that induces synthesis and release of ecdysone (Mordue: 2010). In feeding only 6 drops of Azamax per 10 g of food to each treatment caterpillar, we may not have treated them with enough azadirachtin for the brain to trigger the PTTH blocker, meaning that if PTTH could still be produced, even if in lesser amounts, than ecdysone could still be released and development and maturation would still be able to occur. While Mordue’s reference to other case studies implies that insects treated with azadirachtin possess a deficiency in PTTH release, so long as PTTH is still present, ecdysone will still be able to be produced and released. One error in this experiment, thus, would be the fact that we did not treat the treatment food with enough Azamax, a quantity that could be increased for a repeat performance of this experiment. Similarly, there were a few times where the note cards utilized as dividers for the containers were not substantial enough to keep the caterpillars from breaking through the barrier, an instance that occurred with both Control #3/#4 and Treatment #1/#2. Though this may not have any significent bearings on statistical values, seeing as how our results likely come from experimental design error, it still points out design flaw that can be amended for experiment repeat. To determine the exact cause of these results, a repeat experiment utilizing more Azamax in the treatment diet and stronger reinforcements as container dividers are necessary for an effective repeated study. Thus, while according to previous case studies azadirachtin has an inhibiting effect on Manduca sexta maturation, our experiment concluded that there is no statistically significent difference between the group of Manduca sexta treated with a diet of Azamax and the group treated a controll diet.
