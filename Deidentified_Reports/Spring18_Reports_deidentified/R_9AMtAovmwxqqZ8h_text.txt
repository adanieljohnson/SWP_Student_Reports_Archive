Title: Effect of Juvenile Growth Hormone in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta caterpillars was tested. If there is an increase in juvenile hormone, then Manduca Sexta growth will be stunted and molting will stop. The independent variable was if the diet consisted of added juvenile hormone in the form of Azaguard or if the diet was normal. The dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillars. The results showed that the controll group had constant growth; while, the treatment group had stagnant growth. Despite the results of the statistical test, the data trends provide evidence for the conclusion that juvenile hormone does affect the growth cycle. Thus, the experiment illustrated that juvenile hormone increases do affect the growth of Manduca Sexta as the treatment group showed little to no development. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, or more commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms, are the main focus of this lab. Tobacco hornworms were specifically used in this experiment because of the short timing of the molts in between larvae stages. Each molt between the instar stages is approximately two to three days. These caterpillars were used to determine the effect of varying levels of juvenile hormone (JH) in the growth stages. The two main growth hormones in Manduca Sexta are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone (20E), and both work together to ensure the caterpillar properly grows and molts. The Manduca Sexta has a growth cycle of five instar larvae stages, a pupa stage, and an adult stage that approximately 39 days. During the larvae stages, JH occupies higher levels than 20E. Based on previous studies, it is shown that the levels of juvenile hormone decrease near the fifth instar growth stage [Kiguchi: 1978]. This decrease is due to the fact that there is an increase in 20E so that the caterpillar can develop into a pupa, and move on to the adult stages. Moreover, an increase in JH during the fifth instar larvae stage prevents the molt of the Manduca Sexta into a pupa [Zhou: 1998]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine how juvenile hormone affects the growth of a caterpillar as it moves through its lifecycle. More specifically, will the increase in juvenile hormone allow the Manduca Sexta to move from the larva stages to the adult stages? The independent variable is whether the caterpillar obtains a normal diet or a diet infused with ten percent Azaguard. Azaguard is a chemical that contains juvenile hormone. The dependent variable is the weight of each caterpillar. With increased exposure to the juvenile hormone, in the form of Azaguard, in Manduca Sexta, it is expected that the Manduca Sexta will remain in the younger stages of development. 


Materials and Method:
First, the experimenters obtained eight Manduca Sexta larvae and weighed each one. Each caterpillar was approximately one gram and were reared in similar conditions at room temperature. Then, four containers and four perforated lids were acquired, and an index card was placed in the middle of each container. One side of the container is the controll group with normal food diet and the other side is the treatment group with ten percent Azaguard incorporated in the food. To measure out the normal food diet, 40 grams of food was weighed out and 40 drops of water was added. Out of this 40 grams, ten grams was added to each of the four controll groups. To measure out the treatment food diet, 40 grams of food was weighed out and four drops of Azaguard was added. As with the controll group, ten grams out of the 40 grams was added to each of the four treatment groups. One caterpillar was added to each of the sections. An error in the method was not switching out the food every day data was collected. Thus, the caterpillars did not gain as much weight as the would have if they had received more food. In order to collect data, an experimenter went each day to weigh each caterpillar, and recorded the data. The hypothesis was tested by using the weights of the caterpillars in order to see if the juvenile hormone caused a change in the sizes of Manduca Sexta.

Results:
After the experiment, it was found that an increase in juvenile hormone does affect the growth stages in Manduca Sexta. In the data, it can be seen that the experimental group weighed significently less and had less of an increase in weight over time compared to the controll group. The results above show that Manduca Sexta are affected by an increase in juvenile hormone. The first table and graph serve as a comparison of weight in between the controll and treatment groups. From this, it can be seen that the caterpillars in the controll group had consistent growth, while the treatment group caterpillars barely grew. The second set of tables and graphs show the average weight of the caterpillars over time. This graph shows that the controll group grew at a constant rate throughout time, while the treatment group showed little to no growth or the same time period. Thus, indicating that an increase in juvenile hormone does affect the life cycle of Manduca Sexta. 
The two sample T-test is conducted using Table 1. The average weights of the caterpillars in the controll and treatment groups was used. 
Hypotheses: 
	Null Hypothesis- There is no significent difference in Manduca Sexta weight between the controll group diet and the treatment group diet.
	Alternative Hypothesis- There is a significent difference in Manduca Sexta weight between the controll group diet and the treatment group diet. 
p_value= 0.186203
Significance Conclusion:
	Since the p_value is greater than the alpha level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and fail to accept the alternative hypothesis. Thus, there is no evidence that there is a significent difference in Manduca Sexta weight between the controll group diet and the treatment group diet. 
	The results of the statistical test can be due to a variety of errors. One main error that most likely caused this result is that the caterpillars were not fed new food everyday. Thus, the caterpillars did not gain the necessary weight needed to continue the growth process involving molting and metamorphosis. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. Another error is that there was some space in between the index card and the bottom of the container. Thus, some of the food may have slipped in between the controll and treatment sections contaminating the food, leading to some skew in the data. 
	General trends in the data showed show that the controll group had a constant increase in weight over time. The caterpillars grew normally as they had normal levels of JH. The treatment group, however, showed little growth as the weight was mostly stable throughout the experiment. 




Discussion:
The results supported the hypothesis because the addition of juvenile hormone in the Manduca Sexta displayed a decrease or stagnancy in growth. The reason for this occurring biologically is that the addition of juvenile hormone caused the caterpillars to stop molting. The molting process stopped because in order to move to the next developmental stage in the life cycle the caterpillar must have low levels of JH and high levels of 20E. Moreover, the high amounts of JH stopped the caterpillar from developing large enough to pupate. The results in this experiment are similar to the findings of previous studies as it shows that juvenile hormone levels in Tobacco Hornworms does matter when it comes to growth and development. Other published studies found that an increase in JH levels does, indeed, prevent the molt of the caterpillars [Zhou: 1998]. This increases our understanding of the world as this information can be helpful to farmers and other industries that need pest controll. With this study, people can develop effective method in controllling pests like adult moths that develop from Manduca Sexta. In conclusion, Manduca Sexta growth and development is affected by the increase in juvenile hormone as it results in the prevention of molting and metamorphosis.
