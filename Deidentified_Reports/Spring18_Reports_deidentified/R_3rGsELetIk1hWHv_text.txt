Title: The Effects of Potassium Ion Blockers on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to compare the differences between an untreated Rania Pipiens' leg versus legs treated with a potassium ion channel blocker. The differences were recorded by using electrical stimuli with set frequencies. We hypothesized that the treated legs would have a longer contractile period and the muscle would reach tetany at a lower frequency. This hypothesis was reached due to the potassium ions not being able to exit the cells after depolarization. This was done by using three different frog legs and recording the contractile periods and the frequency at which tetany was reached and repeating the process after the three legs were injected with the potassium ion blocker. The results concluded that the treated legs had longer contractile periods and reached tetany at a lower frequency.

Introduction:
The sciatic nerve runs through the leg of the organism and is in charge of most of the contractions and relaxations that occur in the leg muscles. Electrical stimuli directly to this nerve will cause contraction. When there is repeated stimulation with varying frequencies the leg will vary in the time of contraction periods. When the frequency increases, there will be a lack of ATP so the muscle will not be able to relax, resulting in tetany and continuous contraction until the stimulation ends.  When there is a shift of sodium ions entering the neuron and potassium ions leave, the sciatic nerve fires messages through action potentials. The cell then becomes depolarized and causes depolarization down the axon. This then results in depolarization of the axon terminals. This is then followed by repolarization which consist of the sodium ions leaving the cell and the potassium ions return to the cell. Due to the depolarization of the axon terminal, calcium channels open and there is an increased concentration of calcium inside the axon terminals. This then results in a release of a neurotransmitter - acetylcholine. When this is released into the synaptic gap the muscle cells respond by a calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium then binds to troponin which causes a conformation change and then exposes myosin-binding sites on the actin. Contraction of the muscle happens when the myosin heads bind to the actin. If potassium channels are never opened, the potassium ions would not be able to leave the cells after depolarization. The myogram records the latent, contraction, and relaxation period. The latent period is a short time lapse right before the start of contraction. The contraction phase is when the muscles shorten due to a chemical release. Once the contraction reaches its maximum, the muscle enters the relaxation phase. This is when the muscle lengthens. The time period of both the contraction and relaxation phase varies. [Johnson: 2018] In this experiment, a potassium blocker will be injected into the frog leg before stimulation. We hypothesize that using a potassium channel blocker will increase the contractile period with repeated stimulus at a set frequency and the muscle will reach tetany at a lower frequency.

Materials and Method:
The experiment started by obtaining a frog leg and removing the skin. The sciatic nerve was then exposed and the gastrocnemus muscle was detached from the distal end of the leg. A piece of string was then tied around the detached end of the muscle and tied up to a stand to have the muscle off the table and stretched. The rest of the leg was then pinned down in the dissection tray and the probes were inserted into the muscle. The software was then adjusted to an amplitude of 0.44 V, the pulses to 1, and the frequency to 1 Hz. These variables stayed the same for all of the three leg tests. Then with the same untreated leg, the frequency was increased until tetany was present and that frequency was recorded. Next, 1 Ml of the 100mM tetraethylammonium solution (potassium channel blocker) was injected into the top, middle, and bottom parts of the gastrocnemus. After a 2 minute waiting period to allow the muscle to stop twitching, the stimulus was fired again with the original settings and the contractile period was recorded. As with the untreated leg, the frequency was then increased until tetany was present and the value was recorded. These steps were then repeated with two more legs. After the data was collected, a paired t_test was conducted.

Results:
The untreated legs required 17 Hz of frequency on average to induce tetany while the treated legs required approximately 10 Hz. The untreated legs had an average contractile time of 258.33 ms. The treated legs had an average contractile time of 736.67 ms. The paired t_test resulted in a value of 0.0182. Figure 1 pictured below shows the average contractile time for both the untreated and treated legs in milliseconds. Figure 2 pictured below shows the average frequency when tetany was induced for both the untreated and treated legs.

Discussion:
The results concluded that the untreated frog legs had shorter contractile times and tetany was reached at lower frequencies and the treated legs had longer contractile times and tetany was reached at higher frequencies. Since there was a significent difference between the untreated and treated legs, our null hypothesis was rejected. The t_test is a confirmation for this since it was at a value of 0.0182, which is less than 0.05 which indicates the statistical significance. This could point to supporting the hypothesis since the potassium channels closed from the injection and the nerve was not able to go back to its resting potential. This resulted in a longer contraction period which causes the muscle to fatigue with less stimulation. Although these results support the hypothesis, the outcome may have been reached by other factors. Since the same frog leg was tested and reached tetany and then treated again, the leg could have been tired already from a lack of ATP, which would result in a need of lesser stimulation to reach tetany once again. In future experiments, a way to confirm the findings would be to use two frog legs from the same frog and test one untreated and the other treated. Ideally, the treated leg would have the same amount of ATP as the untreated leg and the findings would be more accurate.  This experiment is related to a study done on patients with a genetic mutation which causes the potassium channels to remain closed. When these patients undergo long periods of exercise, they experience imbalance as well as ataxia. [Jen, Yue, Nelson, Yu, Litt, Nutt, Baloh: 1999] This study relates this experiment to humans by showing that when potassium channels are blocked there are negative effects.
