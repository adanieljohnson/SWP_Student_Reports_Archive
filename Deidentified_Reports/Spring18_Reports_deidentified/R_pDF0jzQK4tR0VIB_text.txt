Title: The effect of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin on PKA activity in Physarum 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin on protein kinase A activity in Physarum through chemotaxis. Protein kinase A activity affects the behavior of Physarum to the initial stimulus. If physarum is exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP, an activator of PKA, it will cause an increase in positive chemotaxis while physarum exposed to curcumin will result in an increase in negative chemotaxis. This was measured by placing physarum in three different agar plates (no chemical, saturated with dibutyryl-cAMP, or curcumin) with oat flakes next to the organism. All of the plates with dibutyryl-cAMP showed positive chemotaxis while all of the plates exposed to curcumin showed negative chemotaxis. The hypothesis is partially supported as the dibutyryl-cAMP significently increased PKA activity while the curcumin did not, which is supported by a two-sample t_test. 


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium that undergoes mass mitosis. Physarum use many of the same signal transduction pathways as human cells, but it easier to grow, handle, and observe physarum. Physarum allows the observation of several cell-level processes, like chemotaxis, without the use of a microscope. Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus. Physarum undergo two types of chemotaxis, positive and negative. Positive chemotaxis would cause the organism to respond to the chemical stimulus by crawling toward the source while the opposite would occur for negative chemotaxis. In order to sense and respond to its environment, Physarum relies on signal transduction pathways. One of the major transduction pathways it uses is the cAMP mediated pathway. This is a G-protein coupled pathway relies on the activation of the second messenger cAMP through the activation of a G-protein. cAMP then activates an enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates several different enzymes, which can lead to varying inhibition or activation depending on the specific enzyme. PKA and the other proteins it activates is what determines the behavior of the organism to the initial external or internal stimulus. 
	There are many chemicals that can alter various key factors in this pathway. For this experiment, the effect of dibutyrl-cAMP and curcumin on PKA was tested. Dibutyryl-cAMP is a chemical that activates PKA while curcumin inhibits PKA. In a study conducted by Derlacz and colleagues, the effect of protein kinase ck2 on plasmodia of Physarum was tested (Derlacz et al., 1998). They found that dibutyryl-cAMP elevated the activity of PKA by 4-5 units compared to the controll after four hours. In a different study the effects of the effects of curcumin on a PKA mechanism in Dictyostelium discoideum, a simple eukaryotic amoeba, was observed (Swatson et al., 2017). It was found that catalytic activity of PKA decreased as the dose of curcumin increased by 2.5 mg/l intervals (Swatson et al., 2017). From the information about the cAMP pathway and the experimental results, we hypothesized that exposure of the physarum to the activator, dibutyryl-cAMP, will increase the PKA activity causing the sample to grow towards the food source, while exposure to the inhibitor, curcumin, will inhibit PKA activity causing the sample to grow away from the food. 


Materials and Method:
The treatment 2% agar plates were soaked for 10 minutes in a solution of 1Ml dibutryl-cAMP (or 1Ml curcumin) with 19 Ml of dH2O. The plates were drained and cut, each plate containing two small squares. After each set of plates, the spatula used to make squares were sterilized using an alcohol lamp. In each plate, physarum were placed in one square while the oat flakes, the food source, were placed in the other. Each plate was taped, covered with aluminum foil and then placed in an incubator for 24 hours. The amount/direction of growth and was recorded and tested using a two-sample t_test. 


Results:
In all of the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP the physarum showed positive chemotaxis, while all of the plates exposed to curcumin the physarum showed negative chemotaxis. A difference between the two treatments is the standard deviations. In the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP there was a low standard deviation of 2.52 while in the plates exposed to curcumin there was a standard deviation of 10.69 (see Figure 1). The lower standard deviation indicates that there was less variability in the amount of growth between each of the dibutyryl-cAMP plates compared to the curcumin plates. After running a two-sample t_test, the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP showed a statistically significent increase in growth toward food (t_stat =4.8346, d.f. = 4, p = 0.0084). However, in the plates exposed to curcumin, there was not a statistically significent decrease in growth away food (t_stat = 0.9064, d.f.= 4, p = 0.1293). It also important to note that two of the controll plates did not show any growth.







Discussion:
It was hypothesized that physarum exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP would cause an increase in positive chemotaxis will the physarum exposed to curcumin would cause an increase in negative chemotaxis. This hypothesis is partially supported, as there was found to be a statistically significent increase in growth toward the food in the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP. The latter part of the hypothesis was not supported as there was not a statistically significent decrease in growth. A possible explanation of the statistically insignificent results of the curcumin is the size and structure. In a previous study by Reddy and Aggarwal, the effect of curcumin was tested on six different protein kinases in tumor cells (Reddy and Aggarwal, 1994). It was found that after being exposed to 0.01 mM curcumin PHk was the only protein kinase that was completely inhibited while other kinases like PKA, which was inhibited by 10%, were only partially inhibited. It was concluded that PHK possibly had the greatest inhibition due to its large size and multiple regulatory units, which could also explain why curcumin did not have a statistically significent decrease on PKA activity in the physarum (Reddy and Aggarwal, 1994). However, it is also important to examine the grave effect of the controll plates. Not only did two of the controll plates not grow, but the one that did exhibit growth appeared to grow away from the food source. This completely skewed the statistical tests because if you run a two-sample t_test with the one controll plate as positive it produces these results for dibutyryl-cAMP (t_stat =2.86, d.f.= 4, p = 0.046) and curcumin (t_stat = 3.5745, d.f.= 4, p = 0.0233), which ultimately fully supports the hypothesis. It is possible that this issue with the controll resulted from an old physarum sample causing defects in their responses to specific stimuli. To expand upon this lab, different dilutions of each chemical could be tested to see how the specific concentration affects chemotaxis in Physarum.

Figure 2. This bar graph shows the average distance the physarum crawled after being exposed to either no chemical, dibutyryl-cAMP, or curcumin. Two of the controll plates did not show any movement resulting in a low average. A two-sample t_test was run which found a statistically significent increase in growth toward food in the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP (t_stat =4.8346, d.f. = 4, p = 0.0084), while there was not a statistically significent decrease in growth toward food in the plates exposed to curcumin (t_stat = 0.9064, d.f.= 4, p = 0.1293).
