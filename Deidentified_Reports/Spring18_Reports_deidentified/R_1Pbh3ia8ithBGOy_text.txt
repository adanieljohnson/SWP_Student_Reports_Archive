Title: The Influence of Shelter on Agonistic Behaviors of Betta Fish

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effect shelter has on the frequency of red mane displays from Betta fish. I hypothesized that Betta fish would display red mane more often in an environment without a shelter than an environment with a shelter. To conduct this experiment, my lab group used three different Betta fish in order to have three replicates of the experiment. We placed the Betta fish in a tank that physically and visually separated the fish. Then we would remove the visual barrier between two of the fish and record how many times they displayed their red mane over the course of five minutes and recorded the results. We then repeated these steps in an environment with a shelter. The hypothesis was statistically supported due to the fact that the P value was less than 0.05. the data gathered from the experiment showed that Betta fish displayed red mane more often without a shelter than with one which also supported 

Introduction:
In this experiment my group and I designed an experiment to test the effect shelter has on the frequency Betta fish, or Betta splendins, display agnostic, or aggressive, behavior.  These aggressive behaviors are a feature of animal behavior that can be interpreted as a means for the animal to gain information on the others fighting ability or as a way to signal aggressive motivation in the perpetrator [Arnot: 2016]. Betta fish are a naturally aggressive species, made even more so by their domestication which made them retain their bright fighting colors at rest. This experiment was designed to specifically test the agnostic behavior of red mane in Betta splendins. Red mane is a type of facing movement in which the Betta fish will extend its branchiostegal membranes, located underneath the opercula, in order to create the appearance of a red mane to threaten other fish.  I hypothesize that Betta fish with access to shelter will demonstrate less aggressive behavior than those with no access to shelter. This lab is important because it allows us to test how Betta fish will react to different stimuli and environments. This knowledge can be applied to designing aquariums or fish tanks. It is important to know what species get along and their agnostic behaviors in order to not place any organism in a potentially dangerous environment.

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, we placed three male Betta fish in a tank that had both a physical and visual barrier between the fish. Next, we removed the visual barrier between fish one and fish two and counted how many times the red mane was extended in both fish over the course of 5 minutes. We then replaced the visual barrier and gave both fish a five minute rest. We then, repeated this process with fish one and three interacting, and then with fish two and fish three interacting and recorded the results. Next, we placed a shelter inside fish one and fish two's tanks and allowed them a minute to habituate to their new environments. The shelter's used were a skull and a bridge that allowed the fish to swim either in or under them. We then removed the visual barrier between fish one and two and counted how many times red mane was displayed by both fish and recorded the results. We repeated this process again with fish one and three and fish two and three and recorded all of the results. The data we calculated included the the mean value of the number of times that red mane was displayed in the fish with a shelter present and without a shelter present and their standard deviations. We used a one-tailed paired T-test to determine if the difference between the means of the frequency of red mane were statistically significent.

Results:
The mean value for the number of times red mane was displayed in environments without shelter was 9.00 ± 7.77 (Fig.1). The mean value of the number of times red made was displayed in environments containing a shelter was 3.17 ± 3.39 (Fig. 1). The mean number of times red mane was displayed in the Betta fish without shelter was significently greater than its mean with shelter (t_stat = 2.44, d.f. = 5, P = 0.03). When observing the fish visually interacting with one another, it was clear that fish one and fish two were the more aggressive fish, due to the fact that they displayed a large amount of red mane over the five minutes they saw each other. Fish number three failed to exhibit any red mane in any of the tests. Changing the environment did not affect the lack of agnostic behaviors of fish three. During the five minutes in which the fish visually interacted with each other, fish number three would look in the wrong direction for the majority of the allotted time. In a few trials, fish number three was looking directly at either fish one or fish three but failed to display red mane or any other agnostic behaviors, such as broadside movements or any other facing movements. In all cases, fishes number one and two would display red mane towards each other. But when placed in tanks with shelters, fish one and two did not display red mane as frequently as they did without a shelter. They used their shelters, either swimming in or around them. It is important to note that the shelter's caused the fish to have less space which could possibly have visually impaired their sight in the small tank.

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that Betta fish with access to a shelter will exhibit less aggressive behaviors than those with no access to shelter was statistically supported by this experiment.  This is due to my P-value from the paired T-test being P ≤ 0.05. The raw data from this experiment also supports the hypothesis that Betta fish without a shelter are more aggressive than Betta fish with a shelter. This experiment had a very high standard deviation most likely due to the fact that fish number three exhibited no red mane, no matter the situation. If this experiment were to be replicated with three active fish, that all exhibited responses, it is possible that it would be a smaller standard deviation. One possible explanation to the reason in which fish three displayed no agnostic behaviors is due to the possibility that it was blind and was, therefore, not able see the bright fighting colors of the other Betta fish or its red mane. A more realistic explanation as to why this fish exhibited no aggressive intraspecific behaviors is due to the fact that it habituated to its existence as a lab fish and therefore, no longer felt threatened by the sudden exposure to other fish. A final possible explanation for this fish's behavior is the fact that when two Betta fish first meet each other, the agnostic display begins right away. But, after one fish has given up, they begin to explore, feed, and do other things in their environment [Simpson: 1968]. This could explain why, in every instance in which fish one or fish two was paired with fish three, red mane was displayed less often. Fish three has already shown submission to the other fish from the start, and therefore, the other does not feel the need to exhibit its aggression to threaten the fish three. The frequency of red mane between fish one and two, both with and without shelter, was much more than between either fish one or two and fish three.  It is also important to note that the movements of Betta fish are dependent on their environment which is a reason that the agnostic displays decreased when the Betta fish had a shelter placed in their environment [Simpson: 1968]. A possible source of error in this experiment is the fish we choose to use. Betta fish, as a species, were a good choice because of their wide range of agnostic behaviors, but the individual fish we choose, such as fish three, was not a good pick because it elicited no response to anything. Had we switched out fish three for a more active fish, we may have received better results. This experiment was relevant because it lends valuable insight to agnostic animal behavior. For example, knowing how certain fish react to each other is important information to have when creating artificial environments such as aquariums.
