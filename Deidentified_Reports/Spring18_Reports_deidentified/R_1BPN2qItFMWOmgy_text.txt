Title: The effects of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle in a frog leg

Abstract:
Frog legs have an easily visible gastrocnemus muscle. In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle was exposed on three frog legs. Each frog leg was placed on a dissecting pan and the muscle was attached to a transducer with probes to allow for firing of a shock. The threshold, point of most reaction, of the frog leg was discovered for each frog leg. Then, three myograms was recorded for three shocks to the muscle and the amplitude from the latent period, at rest, to the contraction phase of each myogram was recorded. Then, 0.1 Ml of caffeine was injected directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and the amplitude from the latent period to the contraction phase of the myogram was recorded for three myograms. The hypothesis states that injecting caffeine directly into the gastrocnemus muscle will result in uncontrolllable contractions of the muscle and the hypothesis was accepted. After analyzing the data and understanding that the three frog legs experienced chemically induced tetany, the hypothesis is proven correct as the frog legs experienced the chemically induced tetany as a result of uncontrolllable contractions. 


Introduction:
In both vertebrates and invertebrate’s skeletal muscles consist of thousands of myofibers. Myofibers are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. These individual myofibers are baound together by connective tissue forming functional groups. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into the muscles and stimulate several individual myofibers, at points called the neuromuscular junctions. A processs known as excitation-contracting coupling allows the nerves to stimulate muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. This process allows an action potential to reach the  caneuromuscular junction and acetylcholine neurotransmitter is released into the muscle fibers. This large depolarization stimulates the release of calcium, allowing the muscles to contract with the use of ATP. Since it is difficult to record the contraction of a single myofiber, a myogram is recorded to monitor what is happening at the macroscopic level of the entire muscle. The myogram is recorded by attaching the muscle to a force transducer, a sensor measuring force, and then we can record force generated over time. Within a single muscle twitch, a myogram has three different stages. The first stage is the latent stage, the time of the start of stimulation till contraction begins. The second stage is the contraction phase, where contraction begins and reaches it’s peak. The last stage is the relaxation phase, the part where the contraction phase goes back down to a relaxed state. Both the second and third stages lengths differ between various muscles [Johnson: 2018].
Caffeine is a chemical that blocks the reuptake of calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to continuous contraction [Konishi & Kurihara: 1987]. The hypothesis is that injecting caffeine directly into the gastrocnemus muscle will result in uncontrolllable contractions of the muscle.


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were collected and placed on a dissecting pan. The skin of the frog legs was removed to expose the gastrocnemus muscle. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended from a transducer and the other parts of the leg were pinned in place on the dissecting pan. The exposed frog leg was kept moist by continuously pouring Ringer’s solution on the leg. 3 myograms were recorded for the controll condition with no caffeine injected. Then, 0.1 Ml of caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog. 3 myograms were then recorded for the caffeine injected frog leg. The same process was repeated with the two other frog legs and data was recorded from the computer program, LabScribe. 


Results:
A normal temporal pattern contraction occurred with the controll group (no caffeine) frog legs. Once injected with caffeine, the three frog legs experienced chemically induced tetany and the muscle did not undergo temporal pattern contraction. (t_stat= 10.657, p value= 0.009)


Discussion:
The three frog legs experienced chemically induced tetany after injection of caffeine. This occurred because the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle will not allow for the reuptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to an uncontrolllable contraction of the muscle which then leads the muscle to reach tetany faster. Since the muscle performed chemically induced tetany when injected with caffeine the hypothesis was accepted.
