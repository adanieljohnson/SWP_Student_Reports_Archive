Title: The Significant Effect of Clay on Resource Allocation to Roots in Avena sativa

Abstract:
The purpose of this report is to determine the effect of clay mixed with vermiculite soil on the development of Avena sativa. We hypothesized that oats grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay would have a significantly higher root to shoot ratio as well as more branching in roots compared to oats grown in only vermiculite soil due to resources shifting to roots to acquire more nutrients from the soil. The experiment was performed by growing six pots of oats over two weeks and watering every day. One group (control) was placed in vermiculite soil, and the second group (experimental) was grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay. After the two weeks, we recorded root to shoot ratios and branching in roots of five plants from each of the six pots. The results revealed that oats grown in soil mixed with clay had a significantly higher root to shoot ratio for length and a significantly higher number of branching in roots, but no significance in the root to shoot ratio for mass. Overall, the results prove that clay does affect resource allocation in the growth of oat plants. These results are important in understanding the effects of clay in soil, the role of the environment and resource allocation in oat growth, and in conducting further agricultural experiments.

Introduction:
The goal of this study is to determine the effect of clay mixed with vermiculite soil on the growth of Avena sativa over the course of two weeks. An important concept to understand, critical for this study, is resource allocation. This process refers to where resources are acquired during plant growth and where energy is being sent to maximize resources. Resource allocation is fundamental to plant development, yield formation and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress [Ruan: 2013]. We specifically looked at how the roots and shoots of our plants developed. The shoot includes the leaves and stems of the plants, essential for photosynthesis and support. The roots’ job is absorption of nutrients from soil. Resources for leaves include solar energy and carbon dioxide from the air, while the nutrients absorbed by roots include water and molecules like nitrogen, sulfur, potassium, and phosphorus [Johnson: 2018]. The distribution and utilization of resource are overall controlled by concerted actions of membrane-transport proteins and/or metabolic enzymes of cell types located in strategic positions within the plant body [Ruan: 2013]. In our study, we used Avena sativa because they are easy to grow, especially in conditions that could be controlled, like the greenhouse and a watering schedule, and do not require special care to germinate [Munoz: 2012]. We will study how the oat plants’ root to shoot ratios will be affected by the mixture of clay in vermiculite soil, to determine how clay affects resource allocation in oats. Certain properties of clay should be analyzed. Looking at only the clay versus the vermiculite soil, the clay particles are denser and harder compared to the loose and airy vermiculite soil. Therefore, the mixture of soil and clay we made was a combination of loose and dense parts. Clay soils are typically too sticky when wet, but too hard when dry to cultivate [Crouse: 2018]. Clay particles are also easily aligned and can compact, especially when wet. This compaction inhibits the movement of water, gases, and roots; therefore, compacted soils containing clay have less infiltration and more restricted root growth [Crouse: 2018]. Based on this information, we predicted that clay will be an obstacle to root absorption of nutrients and resources will shift to the roots of oats grown in the soil and clay mixture. Therefore, we hypothesized that the root to shoot ratios and branching in the roots will be significantly higher in plants grown in the vermiculite soil and clay mixture.

Materials and Methods:
Avena sativa seeds were used for research of resource allocation in different growing environments. Three pots were set up for each environment for a total of six pots. We placed only vermiculite soil in three pots (control group), and a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay in the other three pots (experimental group). Then, about fifty oat seeds were placed in each pot and they were not fully covered by the soil or soil and clay mixture. We labelled the pots and took them to the greenhouse. Each pot was watered until water dripped from the bottom. The plants were watered every day for two weeks. When the two weeks were over, we measured five plants from each group for root length, shoot length, total mass, root mass, shoot mass, and branching. From these, we formulated root to shoot ratios for length and mass and the number of branching. We calculated averages for each environment and for each measurement, shown in Figures 1-3. We then used a two sample T-test to calculate p-values to determine significance.

Results:
The average root to shoot ratio for length in only soil was 0.882 ± 0.145, and in soil and clay was 1.539 ± 0.0937. Using a two sample T-test, we calculated 4 degrees of freedom, a t-value of 6.59, and a p-value=0.00274. A two sample T-test was used in the following comparisons as well. The average root to shoot ratio for mass in only soil was 1.571 ± 0.181, and in soil and clay was 1.599 ± 0.0848 (df=4, t-value = 0.246, p-value = 0.818). The average branching in only soil was 2.667 ± 0.115, and in soil and clay was 4 ± 0.4 (df = 4, t-value = 5.55, p-value = 0.00517).

Discussion:
Based on the results, there was a significant difference in the root to shoot ratio for length (p-value = 0.00274) and in the number of branching (p-value = 0.00517) between oat plants in the two different environments. This means the root to shoot ratio for length in oat plants grown in soil and clay was significantly higher than plants grown in only soil. The roots therefore needed more energy of the oats grown in soil and clay, in order to push through the clay and retrieve more nutrients from its environment. The number of branching was also significantly higher in the soil and clay environment, which supports our hypothesis in that more resources were allocated to the roots for more growth reaching out in the soil for nutrients. However, there was not a significant difference, higher or lower, between the root to shoot ratio for mass in the two environments (p-value = 0.818). This could be because even though there was more branching and longer roots in the oats grown in soil and clay, the roots were thinner than the shorter and less spread roots of the oats grown in only soil. This would make the root to shoot ratios for mass similar in the two environments. Most of the data does support our hypothesis, which stated that plants grown in a mixture of vermiculite soil and clay will have significantly higher root to shoot ratios (resource allocation to the roots) than plants grown in only vermiculite soil. Even though our hypothesis was incorrect in predicting the result of the root to shoot ratio for mass, our results prove that overall, the soil with clay proved to be a difficult material for the roots to absorb nutrients, which is why the root to shoot ratio for length and number of root branching was greater in the group of plants grown in the mix of soil and clay. Overall, this proves that a difference in soil will cause oat plants to change their resource allocation pattern to better survive in their environment. This study is important because allocation of resources to fitness-enhancing activities is a major theme in plant evolutionary ecology [Lovett-Doust: 1989]. Further experiments could study different percentages of clay in the vermiculite soil, or different species of plants in the clay and vermiculite soil mixture. This experiment could be expanded for studies in agricultural production as well. Knowing the effects of certain soil on plants is important to know how to cultivate an agricultural product most efficiently. Certain clay soils could in fact be a source of plant nutrients when the soil degrades, and new possibilities for predicting those beneficial properties are important in agriculture [Newman: 2017]. Another future study could focus on how to make unfit soils, like this clay and vermiculite soil mixture, more nutritious and durable for plants that grown in it. Agricultural intensification today is placing pressure on soil health, resulting in soil health degradation. In response to this problem, one group studied how soil microbial communities can be exploited as a biomarker for monitoring soil health under global change [Trivedi: 2016]. Overall, this study is important in understanding the effect clay has in vermiculite soil and for further studies in clay soil or agricultural implications.
