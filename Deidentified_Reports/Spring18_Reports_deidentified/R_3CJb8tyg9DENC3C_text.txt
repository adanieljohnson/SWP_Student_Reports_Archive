Title: Frog legs: Nerve and Muscle performance 

Abstract:
The focal point of this experiment was to obsverve the length of the contractile and relaxation phases of the gastrocnemus and sciatic nerve.  The goal of this experiment was to test if AchE inhibitor would increase the contractile phase of the gastroniemieus muscle in the leg of a frog species called Rania pipiens.  This chemical will be used throughout this experiment to effectively controll the length of the contractile and relaxation phases of  the frog leg muscles. The hypothesis for this experiment is that if the amount  of acetylcholine is increased ,due to the AcheE inhibitor, the muscle will not be able to relax and will remain contracted for a longer period of time.The effect of the AchE inhibitor will be prevent actylcholine from existing the postsynaptic cleft , therefore prolonging the length of the contraction. The myograms of the contraction from three gastrocnemus muscles were recorded with and without the injected acetylcholinesterase blocker solution. We found  that before treatment the twitch duration was shorter. Additionlly, we noticed that the acetylcholine , in the 2nd frog leg, effected the threshold value the most in comparison to the other frog legs. In addition after the introduction of the acetylcholinesterase blocker the twitches were longer while bef

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles in invertebrates and vertebrates consist of hundreds and thousands of fused aggregates of cells. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. Motor neurons extend into the muscle and innervate individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. The arrival of nerve impulse at neuromuscular junctions trigger the release of acetylcholine. This leads to a series of cascading operations that eventually lead to the contraction, the shortening, of a muscle. This experiment will focus on phases of muscle contraction and relaxation in specific muscles in a frog leg. The frog leg is used to display the basic units of neuromuscular controll. This experiment will controll the amount of acetylcholine in the postsynaptic cleft by utilizing an acetylcholinesterase blocker. Acetylcholinesterase blocker will be used throughout this experiment to effectively controll the contractile and relaxation phases of  the frog leg muscles. The effect of the acetylcholinesterase blocker will be inhibited, therefore prolonging the length of the contraction. The hypothesis for this experiment is that the use of the AchE inhibitor will increase the amount  of acetylcholine in the postsynaptic cleft is increased , preventing the muscle from relaxing and will remain contracted for a longer period of  time. The specific muscle that is being manipulated is the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve.


Materials and Method:
Five frog legs of Rania pipiens were used in this experiment. The skin and tight muscles were removed to expose the gastrocnemus muscle  and the sciatic nerve of each leg. Frog Ringer solution was frequently applied  to keep the muscle and nerve tissues moist . Then,two stimulation electrodes connected , to the iWorx myogram reader, were attached to  the sciatic nerve. The data for the threshold, the average contractile length and the average amplitude was collected . The  LabScribe program was used to collect the  myograms  of the 3 gastrocnemus muscles  before and after the injectedion of .01 Ml acetylcholinesterase blocker solution.


Results:
 Before the AchE in inhibitor treatment the twitch duration was shorter. The strongest effect of AchE inhibitor in the threshold of contraction was noticedaffected in the second tested muscle. In addition after the introduction of the acetylcholinesterase blocker the twitches were longer while before the introduction of the drug the twitches were longer.This can be seen in the data through the means of the threshold constistently where the mean with legs before injectionwas .128 on avaerage while after injection it was .36. So, we have an additional 3 frog added to our data and after analysis of their data found that on average before treatment the amplitude of the twitches were  larger in  comparison to the treatment group. In addition the twitch duration after treatment increased as well. 

Discussion:
Acetylcholinesterase blocker prevented the acetylcholine from exiting the postsynaptic cell cleft. Therefore this allows the prolongation of muscle contraction. However in our specific experiment,for each gastrocnemus muscle the length of the contractile phase decreased after the inoculation of  AchE inhibitor. Which could mean the relaxation period was affected with the injection of the chemical
