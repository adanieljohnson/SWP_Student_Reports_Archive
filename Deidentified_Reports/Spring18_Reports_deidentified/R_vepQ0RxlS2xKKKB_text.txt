Title: How Lidocaine Limits Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The Northern Leopard Frog, or Rania pipiens, is an ideal organism to run experiments involving muscle on. This is because the Rania pipiens comes close to humans physiologically in certain aspects, its leg having a gastrocnemus muscle and a sciatic nerve as ours do. Aside from this, the leg of the Rania pipiens also contracts in a similar fashion that the human leg does. Once dissected and properly set up on the lab’s iWorx electrophysiological recorder, the experiment on thresholds can begin. This experiment aims to solve the hypothesis that Lidocaine, as a sodium blocker, will block contraction. This will cause the treated legs to have a smaller amplitude than non-treated legs. Lidocaine is a sodium blocker that is used as anesthesia in surgeries such as facial ones performed by dermatologist and many others. The experiment resulted in the leg, pre-injection, having a higher amplitude than the leg post-injection. On average, leg 1 had an amplitude threshold of 1.32 volts and post-injection had an average amplitude of 0.812 volts. Leg 2 had an average amplitude threshold of 0.08 pre-injection and 0.3 post-injection. The experiment was successful in proving that sodium blockers such as Lidocaine can block muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, the organism that will be used is the Northern Leopard Frog, or scientifically known as the Rania pipiens. The Northern Leopard Frog, as can be inferred from its name, can be found in areas of the United States such as Minnesota, Wisconsin, and South Dakota (Merrell 1968). The frogs have leg muscles that are very similar to humans, as they have a gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve. This resemblance allows us to experiment on things such as muscle contraction. Muscle contraction is activated through nerve impulses, which arrive at neuromuscular junctions and release acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds with its receptor on the muscle fiber’s membrane which opens sodium channels that activate an action potential. This action potential releases calcium through stimulation which is what activates muscle contraction (Johnson 2016). However, as can be deduced, sodium plays a large role in muscle contraction. What if sodium were to be blocked? Sodium blockers such as Lidocaine exist. Lidocaine is primarily used for anesthesia, as it has been used in plenty of surgeries and successfully reduces patient discomfort (Fosko 1998). This is more than likely because sodium channels were not able to open, thus preventing calcium from releasing and producing any reaction from the muscle. On the Rania pipiens, this can be measured using the iWorx electrophysiological recorder. The iWorx electrophysiological recorder will measure latency, contraction, and relaxation. The iWorx electrophysiological recorder can display this information in myograms, which are a measurement of muscular contractions. This can be used to measure the threshold needed to get a reaction from the frog legs in threshold amplitude. If Lidocaine were to be applied to the legs of the Rania pipiens, it could be hypothesized that as a sodium blocker, contraction will be blocked, therefore causing treated legs to have a smaller amplitude than non-treated legs. 

Materials and Method:
At the beginning of the experiment, two frog legs are retrieved. The legs were then set down on a tray and prepped, which entailed skinning and separating the leg into the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve. The iWorx software was then set up on a group member’s laptop and the iWorx electrophysiological recorder was then prepped and had two pieces of silver thread attached to the needle portions of it, in order to put on the frog legs to stimulate them. The first frog leg was then stimulated multiple times until the maximum and minimum threshold were found. The maximum and minimum threshold were found at certain voltages which were also recorded. Eight minutes were waited before the next step. Lidocaine was then injected into the frog leg, and this process was repeated. After this, the same process was repeated with the second frog leg. The data was recorded into the lab notebooks into separate tables. After this, the data was used to run a paired t_test. 

Results:
The test that was run on this experiment was a paired T-test. The test helped conclude that the degrees of freedom are 9, the t-value is 2.853969 and that the P-value is 0.018966. A trend that was observed is that the controll group consistently maintained a higher threshold as opposed to the treatment group. It was observed that the treatment group required more stimulation.

Since the muscle in the second leg died, this data consists of borrowed data from another group that performed the same experiment. The amplitudes of leg one pre and post treatment were taken and then added up for the average amplitude once again. 


Discussion:
The results of the experiment support the hypothesis that Lidocaine, as a sodium blocker, will block contraction, therefore causing treated legs to have a smaller amplitude than non-treated legs. The figures and tables show that the legs, pre-injection of Lidocaine, required a higher amplitude than after being injected with lidocaine. This is significent because this proves that by blocking sodium, action potentials will not be able to be activated. The muscle still contracted, but more stimulation was needed. What this means for humans is that Lidocaine can be studied more extensively and developed into a better anesthesia, as it is already an efficient anesthesia. The only error that occurs in the experiment is that the second frog leg stopped responding and the group did not realize when. However, in conjunction with another group performing the experiment with the same chemical, we were able to borrow their data on their second leg and make our results work with that. The next step in this experiment may be to try a larger dose of Lidocaine on the frogs to see if the threshold amplitude will be even lower or if there will even be a response. A calcium blocker may be used as well to see a variation of response from our results. Since this hypothesis was proven true, it can be concluded that muscle contraction is stinted when sodium is antagonized (Fosko 74).

Figure 1: The averages of the thresholds are being compared with standard deviation bars in this chart. The comparison is being made between the average threshold in the controll group and the average threshold in the treatment group. The controll group is displaying a larger amplitude than the treatment group. The treatment group was exposed to a 25Mm concentration of Lidocaine.
