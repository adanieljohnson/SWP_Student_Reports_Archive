Title: Manduca sexta: Blocking 20E slows Pupation and Molting

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars are holometabolous insects that rely on juvenile and 20E hormones to controll their maturation and pupation process into full grown adults. This study shows how inhibiting the 20E hormone prevents the caterpillar from molting into an adult. Eight caterpillars were selected and separated equally into a controll and experimental group. The experimental group was administered a drug to inhibit the 20E hormone. Then, the weights of the caterpillars were charted across a seven-day span. A 2 sample T-test was run to analyze the results. The test showed the P-value as being .000823. Our hypothesis stated that the experimental group which received the 20E inhibitor, Azamax, would on average have significently less weight gain than those of the controll group. Our P-Value supported our hypothesis. Due to the 20E inhibitor we saw a significent difference in the weight of the controll group verses the experimental group. The caterpillars in the experimental group showed decreased weight gain because the 20E hormone prevented the pupation process and therefore the growth and weight of the caterpillar.  While the controll group received a placebo and continued to grow, pupate, and mature accordingly. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars are holometabolous insects that feed on tobacco plants. The caterpillars molt through four stages of metamorphosis. The first stage is an egg, the second stage is the larval stage which is known as the feeding stage. The third stages is pupal stage and finally the caterpillars molt into an adult and can finally reproduce (Byron, Gillett-Kaufman). There are two main hormones that controll the molting and maturation process in Manduca sexta. The first hormone is Juvenile hormone, which controlls whether the larva will molt into another instar or into an adult. The second hormone is 20E, which controlls when the larva will molt (Johnson: 2018). Previous studies show that any interference with these hormones will either interrupt the entire molting process or cause abnormal development at inappropriate life stages (Smagghe: 1999). The experiment conducted by Smagghe showed that when ecdysone was inhibited, the effects of the hormones were significently decreased, causing the molting process to change. Since ecdysone controlls what the insect molts into, inhibiting this hormone caused drastic changes in the molting process and the insect never reached adulthood (Smagghe: 1999). In this experiment however, we looked at the effects inhibiting the hormone 20E would have on the Manduca sexta caterpillars and specifically how it affected their pupation process. We used the insecticide, Azadirachitin (Azamax) to inhibit the production of 20E hormone in the caterpillars. According to the results collected by Smagghe and the knowledge 20E hormone is pivotal in the timing of a caterpillar’s molt, we hypothesize that by inhibiting the production of 20E hormone, the caterpillars will be unable molt into the next larval stage and therefore inhibiting the amount of weight they are able to gain through growth into an adult. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we started with eight Manduca sexta caterpillars around the fourth larval stage (instar). We separated them into two groups of four. One group received a treatment of a 20E inhibitor, Azadirachitin. While, the other group of four received a water placebo. The treatment group was served a ratio of 4% dilution of azadirachitin which was mixed into their food and then separated evenly into four containers. While the controll group received 4% of water mixed into their food and then also evenly separated. Next, we took the initial weight of each caterpillar for a base. We measured each of the caterpillar’s weight as a basis of maturation and monitored them across a seven day period. We took the average changes of each caterpillar’s weight across the seven days and ran a 2 sample T-test to compare the average weight of our controll and experimental groups and find the P-value, overall average weight change for each group, and the standard deviations for both the controll and experimental group. 

Results:
Figure one shows the average change in weight for the controll group (1) vs the average change in weight for the treatment group (2) charted over a seven-day period. The T-test results show that the P-Value = .000823. The average weight change for the controll group was 4.025 g with a standard deviation of 1.118. The average weight change for the experimental group was .365 g with a standard deviation of .386. According to the graph the average change of weight for the controll group was greater than the average weight gain of the experimental group that received the 20E inhibitor. We observed that throughout the week the controll group’s weight continued to increase while the experimental group’s weight remained relatively stable. 

Discussion:
The 2-Sample T-test showed that on average, the controll group had gained more weight than the experimental group over the course of seven days. Smagghe proved that by inhibiting ecdysone, insects are unable to molt properly into an adult (Smagghe: 1999). However, 20E hormone is also involved in the molting process of insects (Johnson: 2018). Based on our results we observed that the experimental group, who received the Azadirachitin treatment, had gained less weight than the controll group who received the placebo. The P-value of .00823 proves that inhibiting 20E hormone also inhibits the pupation process, prevents weight gain, and therfore prevents the caterpillar from molting into and adult. The controll group did not receive Azadirachitin and therefore continued to gain weight and molt at a normal rate for Manduca sexta caterpillars. The experimental group received Azadirachitin that inhibited 20E hormone and prevented the caterpillar from gaining weight and molting.  The difference in weight gain between the two is due to Azadirachitin actively inhibiting 20E hormone. As we hypothesized, the absence of the 20E hormone inhibited the molting process of the caterpillars and prevented it from growth and pupation. During its larval stages, Manduca sexta caterpillars are known as pests because they feed on the upper leaves of tobacco plants. This causes serious damage to the tobacco plants (Byron, Gillett-Kaufman: 2017). By inhibiting 20E hormone, the caterpillars will not be able to molt into an adult and will stay in the larval stages, remaining pests to the tobacco plants. Each stage in metamorphosis requires a different job for the caterpillar. In the larval stage, the caterpillar is solely focused on finding food and in the adult stage, the caterpillar can reproduce (Byron, Gillett-Kaufman: 2017). If we restrict the production of 20E or inhibit it, the caterpillar will be unable to molt into and adult and therefore it will be unable to reproduce. This will reduce the population of Manduca sexta caterpillars and in turn reduce the number of pests destroying tobacco crops.
