Title: The Effect of Mate Coloration on Female Betta Fish (betta splendins) Behavior

Abstract:
Female betta fish (betta splendins) select mates based on size, aggressiveness, coloration, and other factors. It was hypothesized that female betta fish would exhibit more behaviors indicating attraction to male fish of similar coloration as opposed to dissimilar coloration. This experiment divided a fish tank into regions, and the time the female fish spent near each of two male fish of different colorations was recorded. Overall, the data did not support the hypothesis that female fish were more attracted to male fish of similar coloration. However, statistical analysis did show that female fish were overall more attracted to beige male fish. This could be due to compounding factors such as size and aggression of the male fish, or beige males could be more attractive to females than other phenotypes.

Introduction:
Betta fish (betta splendins) exhibit certain behaviors that can be analyzed in courting and mating rituals. Female betta fish are the more selective sex [Clotfelter, 2006]. When selecting a mate, female betta fish use cues such as mate size, vigor, fin size, movement, and coloration [Brownell, 2014]. Male betta fish meanwhile will attack a female in order to determine her fitness for breeding [Brownell, 2014]. Males will display their aggression through certain behaviors such as tail flashing, tail beating, and operculum flashing. 
This experiment focuses on the effect of coloration on mate selection by female betta fish. It is hypothesized that female betta fish will be more attracted to male fish of similar color rather than dissimilar color. Fish shoals (social aggregations) are often created solely on the basis of coloration [Peichel, 2004]. Members of a shoal are often very similar in phenotype, and are positively biased toward that phenotype. This is probably due to learned behavior from the group of fish they were raised with [Peichel, 2004]. This hypothesis assumes that this bias transfers to mating preference.

Materials and Method:
A 35cm long fish tank was divided into equal sections, each 11cm. Two 1cm thick, clear dividers were used to physically separate the beta fish. Opaque barriers were also placed to prohibit habitiation before experimentation. The middle section contained the female betta fish. This section was divided into three regions, numbered 1, 2, and 3 from right to left. Region 2 was deemed the neutral area for the female betta fish. A male betta fish of similar color was placed in section 3, and a male betta fish of dissimilar color was placed in section 1. When the opaque barriers were lifted, the time the female betta fish spent in each region was timed. A one-tailed t_test was run to compare time spent in section 1, near the fish of dissimilar color, viruses section 3, near the fish of similar color. Betta fish were used due to their visible and quantifiable behaviors associated with intraspecific interaction.

Results:
The overall data revealed no visible trend in time spent near similarly colored fish and dissimilarly colored fish. A t_test comparing the times had a p_value of 0.27. This is more than alpha, 0.05, and is therefore not significent. 

However, trends became visible when the data was divided by the color of the female fish. When analyzing the time distributions of only the beige female fish, it was clear the female fish spent more time in the region closest to the male fish of similar color. The t_test revealed a p_value of 0.0008, which is less than 0.05, and therefore statistically significent.

The opposite seemed to be true for red females. Red females on average spent more time closer to male fish of dissimilar color. However, only two data points with red female fish were collected, so no t_test could be run on the data.




Discussion:
The hypothesis that female fish would spend more time near male fish of similar coloration was not supported by the data, as shown in Figure 1. Instead, the data show that both red and beige female fish spent more time in the region closest to the beige colored males. This could be the result of several options.
	The first option is that the beige males used had other traits that caused the female fish to spend more time closer to them. This could include size and aggression. In the first trial with a red female fish, it was noted that the female fish was much closer in size to the beige male than the other red male. However, it is unlikely that size was the primary factor as in trial five the female fish was closer in size to the red male than the beige male, but still spent 112 seconds with near the beige male as opposed to 8 seconds near the red male. It should be noted that the female in trial 5 did spend much more time in the neutral area than any other trial; 154 seconds compared to the next longest time of 84 seconds. This suggests that size is a compounding factor in mate selection in betta fish.
This could have contributed to the female fish spending more time near the dissimilarly colored male as opposed to the similarly colored male. It could also have been possible that beige males were more or less aggressive than the red and blue fish, as aggression is a known factor in mate selection [Clotfelter, 2006]. Further studies could study aggression levels of male fish and its effect on the attraction of female fish.
	It could also be possible that the beige fish’s coloration made them more attractive to the female fish. Further studies are needed to assess if the reason the female fish in this experiment were more attracted to the beige male fish because of the male’s coloration or if compounding factors such as size and aggression created this outcome.
