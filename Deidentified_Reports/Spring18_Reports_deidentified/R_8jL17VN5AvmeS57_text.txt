Title: The Physical Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a type of caterpillar which experienced hormonal changes by variations in hormone concentration in their diets. In this lab, we decided to test hormonal changes by manipulating the diets of 4 of Manduca sexta caterpillars with a growth hormone, a Juvenile Hormone mimic called Precor, in order to see if changing hormone levels in their consumed food would affect their physical well being and development. We hypothesized that 5 drops of Precor in the diets of 4 Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in a large growth by mass with the most healthy overall appearance as opposed to the other half of the caterpillars which were not subjected to the JH mimic. In order to properly test this theory in the most effective manner, we took a simple organism with various steps in its life cycle and manipulated the type of food it was given, which resulted in notable physical differences. In conclusion, our null hypothesis was not supported. Our results depicted a final higher average value by mass of the caterpillars who were not subjected to the JH mimic hormone as opposed to those caterpillars which were. This disproved our original thought that an increase in hormone levels would directly impact and proportionally increase the physical characteristics of an organism.



Introduction:
Biological and physical development of organisms from a young state is vital to how they will grow into mature organisms and be able to survive in their environments. The ability for organisms to develop and grow healthily is often the result of endocrine controll [Grunert: 2015]. Endocrine is simply relating to hormone secreting glands or other secretion of products directly into the blood which, in turn, tells us that hormones are influential in development [Oxford Dictionary: 2018]. In turn, hormonal effects directly correlate with the life cycles of organisms. Furthermore, the hormonal effects in certain types of food consumed can also demonstrate these effects on the physical development of organisms. The Manduca sexta caterpillar was beneficial to use in an experiment testing hormonal effects on growth cycles because this caterpillar has a multi-stage life cycle, which included instar larva before maturing into a pupa and then into a moth [Johnson: 2018]. The entire life cycle can take approximately 19-23 days with physical changes occurring within 7 days [Johnson 2018]. Because this time frame was so short, the Manduca sexta caterpillar proved to be beneficial to use in this experiment because the observations did not require much time in order to be concluded, and also because this type of caterpillar had various phases in its life cycle which provided more accurate results when testing the hormonal effects on stage development.
 
Thus, we hypothesized that 5 drops of the Juvenile Hormone mimic Precor into the diets of half of our Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in a large growth by mass with the most healthy overall appearance as opposed to the other half of the caterpillars which were not subjected to the JH mimic.


Materials and Method:
The hypothesis was tested by taking a total of 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and dividing them up into groups of 4, giving us two groups of controll caterpillars who would be fed a normal diet consisting of 100 g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) and two other groups which would be consuming 5 drops of precor in their GML diet. These 2 groups were then divided up again into groups “1A, 1B, 2A, 2B,” and so forth. This allowed us to gain accurate measurements because the caterpillars were divided up into smaller groups which made it easier to focus on their specific weights and physical properties. The caterpillars weighed between 1.5-2.0g before the experiment began. The caterpillars were consecutively fed approximately 10g of food every day for 7 days straight, both for the caterpillars eating the 5 drops of Precor mixed with GLM and for the controll caterpillars eating the GLM with 5 drops of water. When the caterpillars were not being fed or their measurements were not being taken, they spent their time in an incubator which maintained at a temperature of 25 degrees and experienced a 12 hr dark and 12 hr light cycle everyday. After the 7 days, the final weights and physical descriptions of the caterpillars were concluded. We used a two sample, two tailed t_test for our statistical test to compare the group of controll average mass changes (g) to the group of experimental average mass changes (g).


Results:
A general trend I visualized was actually that the controll group increased in physical size and development which lacked the Precor mixed within the diet as opposed to the group of caterpillars which consumed the Precor diet. This made us reject our null hypothesis. From our statistical test, the values we collected made the data easier to understand. Our values from this 2 sample t_test resulted in a p_value of 0.309g which is not statistically significent at any alpha level, and an average mass controll group change of 9.04g which varied from the average mass change of the experimental group with a value of 6.10g. The standard deviation of the average mass controll group change was 0.347g, demonstrating that it did not vary as much as compared to the standard deviation value of the experimental group of 4.816g. These two groups tested were statistically different from one another.



Discussion:
In conclusion, the experiment produced results that did not align with our null hypothesis. Our hypothesis was not supported and resulted in observations which did not match our original ideas. In figure 1, it is clear to see that there seemed to be a source of error in the value of the experimental average masses. This could have resulted from the caterpillar’s original weight being too small before the lab was conducted, or the caterpillar simply did not eat enough food for the Precor to be effective. Another possible source of error is that the Precor was not adequately distributed throughout the GML diet, resulting in the caterpillars not being able to consume the growth hormone at all. The results I saw from the 2 sample t_test, like the large difference between the average weights of the controll group (9.04g) and the experimental group (6.10g) and the difference in standard deviation (0.347g for controll group and 4.816g for experimental) , allowed me to draw the conclusion that the controll group most likely ate more of the diet than the experimental. From our results, it looks like the addition of a growth hormone did not increase the sizes at all. If anything, it appeared the controll group grew larger without the growth hormone. This is incorrect based on previous studies which proved that there is a direct correlation to growth hormone in food sources and the physical development and well-being of the Manduca sexta caterpillars and, in turn, contributed to a larger average weight for those caterpillars which consumed the diet affected by the growth hormone [Grunert: 2015]. The next logical step for this study is definately to repeat it and perhaps try different organisms besides caterpillars in order to have a wider range of observations to draw conclusions from. Furthermore, our hypothesis was not supported because the caterpillars which were subjected to the Precor diet weighed less in terms of mass as opposed to the controll group of caterpillars which were not exposed to the growth hormone.

Figure 1. Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Average Weight of Caterpillar. This graph demonstrates the major data involved with this lab. It shows the average masses collected daily of the Manduca sexta caterpillars when they were consuming the GML diet with 5 drops of Precor added to their food, as well as the masses of the controll group even though they were not subjected to Precor levels. This figure also exhibits the large standard error deviations the experimental group experienced, depicting these values were not close to the mean. The results are inclusive, and there is an error that occurred in the lab.
