Title: The Effect of Green Light Wavelength on Shoot Length of Raphanus raphanistrum 

Abstract:
In this study, two different wavelength spectrums were used to evaluate the resource allocation of Raphanus raphanistrum. This experiment was modeled after the amount of light received by plants in the canopy versus the understory of an environment. To create these conditions, a clear filter paper tent was placed over the control plants and a green filter paper tent was placed over the experimental plants. It was hypothesized that the radish plants under the green filter paper would allocate more of their energy toward shoot growth to minimize their limitation of sunlight. After two weeks, results indicated a statistically significant difference in shoot length in the control versus the experimental plants which ultimately determined that green light wavelength promotes plant growth.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is a vital function of plants that allows them to distribute their resources, including CO2, water, nutrients, and complex materials including proteins, sugars, and defensive chemicals. This function allows plants to enhance their overall fitness and maximize their ability to reproduce [Bazzaz: 1997]. For example, if a plant is not receiving many nutrients from the soil it may allocate its energy into growing longer roots. The longer roots will allow the plant to extract more of these integral nutrients and prevent this resource limitation of low nutrient soil from affecting its fitness. 
This experiment was designed to look at the resource allocation of plants in the canopy versus the understory of an environment. Canopy plants tower over other plants and therefore receive the most sunlight. Plants in the understory are shaded by those in the canopy and receive less sunlight. Plants absorb light in the 700 nm to 400 nm wavelength range. This range is called photosynthetically-active radiation. Chlorophyll a absorbs blue-violet light while chlorophyll b absorbs red-blue light. Both chlorophyll types reflect green light. This is why leaves, the main sites of photosynthesis, appear green [Hohmann-Marriott: 2011]. 
For this experiment, we used radish plants or Raphanus raphanistrum as they are easy to cultivate and grow quickly in containers [Stagnari: 2018]. To mimic canopy and understory conditions, we placed three pots under clear filter paper. These plants receive the full spectrum of sunlight: high energy blue-violet wavelengths as well as low energy red-orange wavelengths. We then placed three pots under green filter paper meaning they receive a shorter spectrum of light with less energy. We hypothesized that the experimental plants under the green filter paper would try to minimize their resource limitation of sunlight by growing longer shoots than the plants under clear filter paper in order to obtain more energy. This hypothesis could then be extended to explore the nature of resource allocation in the canopy and understory. We measured the progress of the control and experimental groups in a controlled environment over the span of two weeks. A one tailed t-test was used to check if our findings were statistically significant.  


Materials and Methods:
Methods: 
Three pots were labelled “Control” and three pots “Experimental”. Each pot was filled with soil, approximately 50 radish seeds, and 50 mL of Miracle-Gro plant food. The three experimental pots were placed in one tray and the three control pots in another. The plants were watered until the tray dripped to ensure all pots contained the maximum amount of water the soil can carry. Using wooden rods, tape, and filter paper, tents were created to provide different light rays to the two sets of plants.  The tent made of clear filter paper was placed over the tray with the control pots and the tent made of green filter paper was placed over the tray with the experimental pots. The plants were watered to maximum capacity, as explained before, once a day for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, root weight and length as well as shoot weight and length of five plants were measured from each pot. These values were then averaged into pot average then an ultimate average of all three pot averages from each group was found and recorded. A one-tailed two sample T-test was used to test if our findings were statistically significant.


Results:
The data shows that the experimental plants had an average shoot length of 117.2 mm while the control plants had an average shoot length of 100.2 mm as seen in Figure 1. The average shoot length of the experimental group is longer than that of the control group. To evaluate the significance of these results a one-tailed T test was performed. The T-test showed that the average shoot length of the experimental group was statistically significantly different than that of the control group (t-stat = 3.26854, df = 28, P = 0.001431).

Discussion:
The results support our alternative hypothesis that the experimental plants would have longer shoots than those of the control plants. We reject the null hypothesis that the experimental and control groups show no difference in their shoot lengths. A study conducted on lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa) studied the growth and photosynthesis levels of the plants under green LED lights. The lights used had a peak wavelength of 510 nm rather than high energy wavelengths in the 600-700 nm range. The study showed that the green lighting promoted both the growth and photosynthesis of these plants [Johkan 2012]. These results support the data we obtained from the radish plants. 
To improve upon this experiment, we could have averaged over five plants from each plot to obtain more data. To expand upon the idea of shorter wavelengths promoting shoot growth, we could study plants in the actual understory-canopy environment we attempted to mimic. This would be more difficult to control as many factors including: insects, human activity, etc could affect the growth of the plants.
