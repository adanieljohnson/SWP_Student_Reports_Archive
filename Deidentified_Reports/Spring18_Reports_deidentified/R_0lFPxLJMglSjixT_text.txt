Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca Sexta's Weight

Abstract:
In this lab, we tested whether the increase of Juvenile Hormone in a caterpillar's diet increased the weight of that caterpillar.  In our experimental group, we fed four different caterpillars food mixed with .41 Ml of 4.1% precor, a chemical that elicits the same response as JH.  In our controll group, we fed four different caterpillars the same food without any precor.  We came in every day for 7 days to record the caterpillar's weights.  We found that the increase of JH in a caterpillar's diet does increase the weight of the caterpillar. This is relevant because JH determines the timing of growth and molt in caterpillars that determine their life span. 

Introduction:
Hormones have a direct controll on the development and growth of insects [Johnson: 2016].  One type of hormone, Juvenile hormone, or JH, controlls the type of molt of an insect, defining whether or not the insect reaches full maturity [Kiguchi: 1978].  JH is ordered as a non-toxic insect growth regulator that causes abnormalities, harming insect survival [Johnson: 2016].   Juvenile Hormone has a big part in the processes of metamorphosis and reproduction in all forms of insects, but particularly in the manduca sexta insect species [Satyanarayana: 1994].  This species has a bright green appearance and horn-like structure on the posterior segment of their bodies and grow about 80 mm [Johnson:2016].  They experience a sequence of larval molting and metamorphosis regulated by the JH hormone.  The construction of the mold depends on the levels of JH [Nijhout: 1974].  Furthermore, JH also regulates color morphs and casted differentiation [Kiguchi: 1978].  We are testing whether or not the JH analog will increase the caterpillar's weight.  We hypothesize that the increase of JH in the caterpillar's diet will increase the weight of the caterpillar. 

Materials and Method:
First, we divided 8 caterpillars into the controll and experimental groups, each group containing 4 caterpillars. Our controll group was the caterpillars that did not have JH added to their diet.  The experimental group was the caterpillars with .41 Ml of 4.1 precor into their diets.  We weighed the caterpillars before feeding them and then came into the lab each day to weigh the caterpillars for seven days. In the controll group, we mixed 10 droplets of water from a pipette with their everyday food.  In the treatment group, we mixed 10 droplets of precor from a pipette with their everyday food.  Our dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillar.  The independent variable was whether we fed the caterpillar precor or not.  We ran a two-sample t_test on the change of weight of the controll and the treatment groups. 

Results:
The caterpillars in the experimental group became more swollen and bigger in size. Overall, the experimental group gained more weight than the controll group.  The standard deviation of the controll group was 0.72.  The standard deviation of the treatment group was 0.32.  The T-value was 1.1.  The d.f. was 6.  The P-value was 0.315

Discussion:
Because the P value was > 0.05, the results were not significent, causing the hypothesis to be a null one.  Even though the caterpillars gained more weight in the treatment group, it was not enough to prove that their excess weight gain was directly from adding the precor.  In future studies, we could increase the amount of precor in the treatment group's diet to see if that brings about a larger change.  This is relevant because hormones, particularly JH, have a huge impact on the development of growth and development in insects [Johnson:2016].  Having said that, we can conjecture that a possible reason for the rejection of the hypothesis was that not enough precor was added to the treatment group for a successful outcome.
