Title: Photosynthetic Activity and Absorbance of DCPIP in Beta vulgaris and Stellaris medias leaves in response to herbicide Duiron and varying wavelengths of light 

Abstract:
This study examines the effect of different wavelengths of light, 640 nm and 470nm, and the effect of herbicide Duiron on the rate of photosynthesis activity in Beta vulgaris and Stellaris media leaves. The overall effects are measured using Hill Reactions to quantify the change in absorbance based on the reduction of electron acceptor DCPIP using a spectrometer. It is hypothesized that If chard and chickweed are exposed to lights with wavelengths of 640 or 470nm, photosynthetic rates will be elevated, as well as samples exposed to normal light and containing Diuron will show decreased levels of photosynthetic activity. This experiment resulted in significent findings for chickweed samples under 640nm lights after 30 minutes, but insignificent findings for all other comparisons between wavelengths, leaves, and herbicides. This means that and increased sample size of leaves is needed to see significance or a greater intensity of light is necessary to effect rate of photosynthesis. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis involves a process that starts by capturing energy from the sun in the form of photons, stores that energy in the form of covalent bonds and a redox potential, uses the energy to create a chemical gradient across a bilayer, and eventually releases the energy by glycolysis and respiration. The light dependent reactions of photosynthesis generate the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. In photosystem II, energy from absorbed photons of light cause electrons to leave the chlorophyll (reaction center) and move to the high energy electron carrier, plastiquinone.  The Hill Reaction shows that the oxidized chlorophyll indirectly stimulated cleavage of water to produce oxygen and established that the photoproduction of oxygen by chloroplasts is independent of carbon dioxide assimilation [Arnon: 1971].  The Hill Reaction can be quantified by adding an alternative electron acceptor to a sample of isolated chloroplasts.  One specific electron alternative acceptor is DCPIP.  An experiment performed by West and Hill suggested that DCPIP accepts hydrogen equivalents at a site near primary photochemical step and is reduced near to plastiquinone [West et al: 1967].  In its oxidized form, DCPIP is an aromatic ring, appears blue, and optimally absorbs light at 600 nm.  When reduced, DCPIP’s conjugated bonds make it appear colorless.  
 Photosynthesis can be affected by many different environmental factors, ranging from amount of sunlight, wavelength of light, amount and concentration of herbicide present, and specific types of leaves performing the photosynthesis.  Duiron, a common herbicide, has been shown to greatly decrease the rate of photosynthesis activity, and thereby decrease the presence of weed populations in Alfalfa fields [McClellan, Schweers: 1999]. Previous articles show that different wavelengths of light produce different levels of photosynthetic activity.  Arnon showed that photosystem II operated best at a wavelength of less than 700 nm in green plants [Arnon: 1971].  Recent studies have shown that light-emitting diode (LED) technologies present an enormous potential for improving plant growth and making practices more sustainable.  Red LEDs are efficient and match the maximum absorption peak (650-665nm) [Darko et al: 2014].  In another study performed by Muneer et al, it was determined that blue LEDs promoted plant growth by controllling the integrity of chloroplast proteins [Muneer et al: 2014]. 
This experiment attempts to utilize the Hill reaction and reduction of DCPIP to quantify photosynthetic reduction activity under various light wavelengths in Beta vulgaris (chard) and Stellaria media (chickweed).  Previous experiments that utilize the Hill reaction have used spinach because it lacks specificity for a cofactor [Avron: 1960].  Chard shows the same lack of specificity, which makes it a good candidate for this experiment [Avron: 1960].  The chloroplasts of both chickweed and chard are also easily isolated.
It is hypothesized that if samples of Beta vulgaris, and Stellaris media are exposed to lights with wavelengths of 640 or 470 nanometers, photosynthetic rates will be elevated.   It is also hypothesized that samples exposed to normal light and containing Diuron will show decreased levels of photosynthetic activity.

Materials and Method:
A mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and a 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were packed into crushed ice to cool, while the large central veins from 4 medium-sized Stellaris media leaves were removed and the leaves were washed and dried. The Stellaris media leaves were added to the cooled mortar along with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), and they were grinded to a thick paste, adding an additional10 Ml of grinding buffer to the slurry before straining the mixture through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.
200 μl of the filtered liquid was transferred into a microtubule labeled “Sample of A”, and stored on ice, with the remaining green liquid transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun with a centrifuge at 200 times gravity for three minutes at 4oC. The supernatant poured out of the tube marked “A” went into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B.” 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 Ml tube marked “B” was removed and placed it in a micro tube labeled “Sample of B,” and stored it on ice. The 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension was then spun with a centrifuge at 1,000 times gravity for 10 minutes at 4oC. Again, the supernatant was then poured into a clean 50 Ml tube marked “C.” adding 20 Ml of grinding buffer was to the pellet and suspending it by by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. 200 μl of this re-suspended pellet was then transferred into a micro tube labeled “Sample of B Pellet,” and stored it on ice. 200 μl from tube “C” was removed and place it into a micro tube labeled “Sample of C”, & stored it on ice the on ice. This was then repeated for the Beta vulgaris leaves.
Once the samples A, B, B with pellet, and C for both the Beta vulgaris leaves and the Stellaris media leaves had been collected, they were each analyzed for the amount of chloroplast each sample contained. B with pellet was found to have the highest amount of chloroplast and was used in the second part of the experiment.
Then 31 test tubes were acquired, the first blank tube containing 8Ml of water and 2Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), the next twenty-four tubes each contained 6Ml of water, 2 Ml 130mM DCPIP, and 2Ml of the reaction buffer, serving at the test tubes for the light conditions, and the final six tubes contained 5Ml of water, 2Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1Ml of Diuron. Excluding the blank, nine of each of the tubes for the light condition and three of the tubes with Diuron received 100 μl of enriched chloroplasts from the “B with pellets” prepared earlier from Stellaris media leaves, and the other tubes received 100 μl of enriched chloroplasts from Beta vulgaris leaves. Each tube was immediately mixed after the addition of chloroplasts and transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes for an initial absorbance reading. The samples were then each placed in their corresponding light conditions, the six tubes without chloroplasts, six tubes with only chloroplasts, and six tubes with Diuron were placed in normal light, three tubes from either type of leaf. The next six were placed under a 640-wavelength light bulb and the last six were placed under a 470-wavelength lightbulb and left to react. Absorbance values were retaken every ten minutes for a total of thirty minutes. The percent change in absorbance was calculated using the equation, absorbance at time 0 minus absorbance at time “n,” all divided by absorbance at time 0, and then multiplied by 100. The tests were compared using a two-tailed t_test. 


Results:
Generally, photosynthetic rates appeared to increase the most in samples treated with 640nm light (red light).  Photosynthetic rates were lowest when Diuron was present.  Two-tailed t_tests were performed to determine if there was a significent difference (p&lt;0.05) between the photosynthetic rates of different treatments.  Each treatment was compared to the sample under normal light and values recorded for 640nm and 470nm were compared to each other.
In the chickweed samples displayed in figure 1, the 640 nm lights significently increased the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t(4)=7.96, p&lt;0.05; p=0.001). The 470 nm lights also appeared to increase photosynthetic rates in comparison to the normal treatment.  However, these differences were not significent at 10 minutes (t(4)=3.11, p&gt;0.05;p=0.52), 20 minutes (t(4)0.703, p&gt;0.05; p=0.57), or 30 minutes (t(4) =1.508, p&gt;0.05; p=0.205).  The photosynthetic rates of the 640 and 470 treatments were not statistically different from each other at 10 minutes (t(4)=0.703, p&gt;0.05; p=0.52), 20 minutes (t(4)=0.72, p&gt;0.05; p=0.51), or 30 (t(4) =0.7, p&gt;0.05; p=0.522) minutes.  
In the chard samples displayed in figure 2, the 640 nm lights seemed to increase photosynthetic rates while the 470 nm light appeared to have a very little effect on rate.  The photosynthetic rates under normal light exceeded the rates observed under the 470 nm light. Despite the differences in absorbance, there was not a significent difference in rate between 640 nm and normal light at 10 minutes (t(4)=1.07, p&gt;0.05; p=0.34), 20 minutes (t(4) =0.31, p&gt;0.05; p=0.766), or at 30 minutes (t(4) =0.557, p&gt;0.05; p=0.606).  The differences in absorbance between the 470 nm treatment and normal light were also not significent at 10 minutes (t(4) =2.33, p&gt;0.05; p=0.08), 20 minutes (t(4) =2.15, p&gt;0.05; p=0.097), or 30 minutes (t(4) =1.59, p&gt;0.05; p=0.185), nor were the rates observed in 640 nm and 470 nm statistically different from each other at 10 minutes (t(4)=1.63, p&gt;0.05; p=0.171), 20 minutes (t(4) =1.85, p&gt;0.05; p=0.136), or 30 minutes (t(4) =1.99, p&gt;0.05; p=0.117).

Discussion:
The null hypothesis that photosynthetic rates remains the same when Beta vulgaris and Stellaris media are exposed to lights with wavelength of 640nm or 470nm was accepted. While a p_value of 0.0013 at 30 minutes suggests a significent difference in photosynthetic rate of chickweed samples under 640nm lights compared to under normal light, the p_value for difference between chard samples under 640nm lights and under normal lights is not statistically significent.  For samples under 470nm light, neither species showed a significent difference from samples under normal light, and while the p_value for the chard samples at 470nm was close to critical value of 0.05, there is little effect on absorbance and percentage change of DCPIP absorbance was close to 0% throughout the experiment akin to samples without chloroplasts or with Diuron.  The discordance of the result and hypothesis could due to small sample size. Each treatment group only contained three replicates, so the result may be sensitive to natural variances among experiment subjects. The chard 470nm light group had extremely abnormal response to treatment which could due to unqualified samples. If there were more samples in each treatment group, a significance in difference between 640nm or 470nm light with normal light may have occurred. Furthermore, the 470nm and 640nm light treatment groups may have been affected by normal light, since they were not completely sealed in colored containers or isolated.  The lack of significent data may also be due to a low chloroplast density in the pellet resuspension.  In the future, it may be imperative to check the chloroplast density of a given sample before proceeding.  
	Additionally, the null hypothesis that there is no difference in photosynthetic activity between samples with or without Durion is accepted. The p_value is significent between samples under normal light without Diuron and with Diuron for chickweed 10 minutes (0.003) and 20 minutes ( 0.015), but there is no statistically significent difference between absorbance percent change in other data. For both chard and chickweed, neither p_value was statistically significent, meaning there was no significent change in photosynthetic activity. This discordance with the initial prediction is also due to small sample size and natural variance in subjects influences result.  This lack of significent data may also be due to a low chloroplast density in the pellet resuspension.
	Further experimentation using the same treatments should include larger sample sizes; 30 replicates per treatment group for instance. Under such circumstances, a more precise result can be obtained and the experiment will be less influenced by samples’ natural variances. The same experiment should be performed using sealed containers for 470nm light and 640nm light treatments to prevent influence from normal light.
	On a planet with an ever-growing population and increasing demand for food, it is important to find sustainable practices that promote optimal plant growth.  This experiment shows that using LED lights of wavelengths near 640nm (red LEDs) may promote optimal growth.  These results partially support the findings of Darko et al.  In addition to manipulating light wavelengths to optimize growth, further studies should observe the effects of light intensity.  A study performed by Hesketh et al with single maize leaves discovered that increasing light saturation increases photosynthetic rates [Hesketh: 1963].  Darko et al also mention that plants exposed to intensified light develop short- and long-term response mechanisms to reduce stress effects (like metabolic shifts and better repairing mechanisms) [Darko et al: 2104].  In order to truly understand optimization of photosynthetic rates via the Hill reaction, further experimentation should be performed.  Research concerning the effects of LEDs on photosynthetic rates should continue to be explored.
