Title: The minimum threshold of gastrocnemius muscle contraction in a Rana pipiens is decreased by the injection of Lanthanum Chloride

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine how lanthanum chloride would affect the minimum threshold of a muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens frog. Knowing that lanthanum chloride usually acts as a calcium channel blocker and that the presence calcium ions were needed for skeletal muscle contraction, we hypothesized that that if we block the calcium channels with 1mM of Lanthanum Chloride, then it will require a larger stimulus to produce a muscle contraction and the minimum threshold value will increase. However, this hypothesis didn’t account for the potential effects that this specific concentration of the Lanthanum Chloride might have on the calcium channels and our evidence that we collected did not support our hypothesis. We collected evidence by comparing the amplitudes of the muscle contraction at the minimum threshold values before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride and did this on three different Rana pipiens legs. The results that we found concluded that average minimum contraction threshold decreased after the injection of the Lanthanum Chloride; we had a P-value of 0.048. 


Introduction:
In this lab, we will be studying the muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle in a Rana pipiens frog. We will specifically we looking at the effect that blocking the calcium channels, by injecting 1 µM of lanthanum chloride has on the threshold of the muscle contraction. In a study done on newborn chicks, Lanthanum Chloride was found to inhibit the calcium binding to the brain synaptosomal membrane [Basu: 1982]. These findings lead us to believe that Lanthanum Chloride will similarly block the calcium channels in skeletal muscles. To understand the effect that blocking calcium channels will have on the measured voltage of the muscle contraction, it’s essential to understand how muscle contraction works. Muscle contraction begins when action potentials arrives at the neuromuscular junction and the depolarization of the neuron causes acetylcholine to be released from the presynaptic nerve terminal and bind to its receptor, thus causing the post-synaptic membrane to generate an action potential that travels down the t-tubules. When the action potential travels down a t-tubule, the DHP receptor protein is activated and calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When calcium ions diffuse into the sarcoplasm, they bind to troponin and this binding causes a conformation change that allows troponin to push tropomyosin out of the way, exposing the actin-myosin binding site. Myosin heads bind to actin at the binding site and when they do so the heads bend. This bend in the myosin heads exerts a small force that pulls the actin filaments in. The actin filaments slide in, causing the sarcomere to shorten and the muscle to contract. Knowing this, if the calcium channels are blocked by the injection of lanthanum chloride, then calcium can’t bind to troponin, troponin can’t move tropomyosin out of the way of the actin-myosin binding site, and then no cross bridges can be formed and a contraction will not occur. With this knowledge of the role of calcium in muscle contraction, we hypothesize that if we block the calcium channels with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, then it will require a larger stimulus to produce a muscle contraction and the minimum threshold value will increase.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment designed to test how Lanthanum Chloride will effect the minimum threshold of a muscle contraction, we obtained 3 frog legs from the same Rana Pipiers frog. The first step was remove the skin off the frog-leg and gently separate the gastrocnemius muscle and a portion of the Achilles tendon from the rest of the leg. We positioned the muscle in a verticle 90 degree angle to expose the sciatic nerve. Once the sciatic nerve is exposed, we laid the nerve across two metal wires that were attached to the end of a positive and negative probe. The probes were attached to a high voltage stimulator and this stimulator will be connected to a program on our computers called LabScribe that will pick up and record the stimuli. We are first interested in finding the minimum threshold of the frog leg before any chemical is injected; we will use this value as our control variable. To do this, we will adjust the amplitude of the stimulus until we see a twitch in the frog muscle and see a myogram appear on our screen; this will signify that a muscle contraction occurred. The lowest stimulus that we see a twitch occur is what we will record as our minimum threshold and we will repeat finding this threshold 3 times and use the average of the 3 trials to improve our accuracy. Once we have found the minimum threshold as our baseline, we will use a syringe to inject 1 μM of Lanthanum Chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle. Once the chemical is injected, we must wait between 6-10 minutes for the chemical to spread throughout the muscle before we apply another stimulus. We will then repeat the process of finding a minimum threshold and record the smallest amplitude that we see a twitch (once again finding this threshold 3 times and taking the average). We will repeat the entirety of this process again on the other 2 legs. Once we have found the minimum threshold before and after the injection of lanthanum chloride on 3 frog legs, we will find the average of each threshold and preform a paired t-test to compare the minimum threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle contraction of a Rana pipiers frog before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride.

Results:
After running a paired T-Test, we found that there was a statistically significant difference between the mean minimum contraction threshold before and after the injection of Lanthanum Chloride (t-stat = 4.378, df = 2, P = 0.0484). However, we were just barely able to reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference between paired observations is zero because 0.0484 is just barely less than our alpha value of 0.05; this is something to keep in mind when later discussing and analyzing the results of the data. As shown in Figure1, the average minimum contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle before the injection of Lanthanum chloride was 0.134 +/- 0.053 volts. This means that before the injection, the lowest possible stimulus that the muscle will contract at is a stimulus to the sciatic nerve of 0.134 volts (on average). On the other hand, the average minimum contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of Lanthanum chloride was 0.0707 +/- 0.078 volts. The average difference of the threshold before and after the injection is .0629 +/- 0.0248. As we can see, the average minimum contraction threshold decreased after the injection of the Lanthanum Chloride, meaning that a smaller stimulus was needed to create a contraction.  One thing to be warry of in our results is that the standard deviation of  the “after injection” data group is larger than the mean itself. This means that the variation in the data points is greater than the mean, thus why we see the standard error bar go into the negative values in Figure1. 


Discussion:
Our experiment results do not support our hypothesis that that if we block the calcium channels with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, then the minimum threshold will increase. When we injected the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens frog with 1 µM of Lanthanum Chloride, the average minimum threshold decreased and this decrease proved to be statistically significant. One possible reason for the decrease in minimum threshold may be due to the concentration of Lanthanum Chloride that me used (1 µM). A study published in BioMetals scientific Journal in 2000, looked at the effect that Lanthanum Chloride had on the plasma membrane activities of rice seedling roots. In this experiment, the activity of Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase was increased in the presence of 60 µM of Lanthanum Chloride but Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase activity decreased dramatically when 80 µM of Lanthanum chloride were present, proving that when Lanthanum chloride concentration is above a certain level, it has reverse effects [Zheng: 2000]. In muscle contraction, Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase sequesters Ca2+ into the Sarcoplasmic reticulum which induces and maintains muscle relaxation. For this reason, we can see why if Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase activity is increased by lower concentration of Lanthanum Chloride, then the muscle more likely to stay in a relaxed state and it will take a larger stimulus to induce muscle contraction. On the reverse side, if higher concentrations of Lanthanum Chloride are present, then Ca2+-adenosine triphosphatase will be less active, the muscle will not need as much stimulus to create a contraction, and the minimum threshold of the muscle contraction will be lower. It is possible that this is what happened in our experiment. Even though 1 µM does not seem like a high concentration, it is possible that in relation to the skeletal muscle cells in a Rana pipiens frog, this is a high concentration and the high concentration of lanthanum chloride had a reverse effect on muscle contraction than we had expected. This experiment was not considered when we started our experiment and made our hypothesis. We thought that the calcium channels in skeletal muscles would be effected in a similar way as they were in the baby chicks experiment in which Lanthanum Chloride was found to inhibit the calcium binding to the brain synaptosomal membrane [Basu: 1982].  To test of this explanation to our findings is correct, we would need to run the experiment again with lower concentrations of lanthanum chloride and see if this change caused the minimum threshold of muscle contraction to be higher. 
	Aside from this possible explanation of our results, our statistics are worth looking at as well. Our P-value was 0.048 with is very close to being greater than or equal to our alpha of .05. If our P-value had just been .002 higher, then we would have failed to reject the null and concluded that the injection of lanthanum chloride had no statistically significant effect on the minimum threshold of muscle contraction. While this would not have aligned with our hypothesis either, it would have told us that out test was not statistically significant and maybe we should re-try it on different subjects.
