Title: Growth Experiment with the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment involved the use of the Manduca sexta and how specific hormones can either inhibit or promote their growth. The specific chemical that we used for testing is Azamax and that is an inhibitor of the hormone 20E. We hypothesized that after the introduction of Azamax to the treatment group, the caterpillar would no longer be able yo molt. Our hypothesis was supported as seen through the data. Azamax inhibited 20E, the hormone, preventing a significant amount of growth in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. This was done due to the Azamax’s ability to prevent molting. This result was acquired through a meticulous set of steps. Which were We used a total of 8 Manduca sexta larva and there are 4 larvae being used for the control group that is fed with regular food ( as per the Manduca feeding experiement food instructions). The experimental group, comprised of the remaining 4 caterpillars, was fed the same food with an exception of the added 15 drops of Azamax per 10 grams of food  For the control we used an equal amount of droplets but instead of Azamax we used distilled water. In order to create an efficient experiment each caterpillar was separated by index cards in each containers. In addition to this the caterpillars were separated in groups.

Introduction:
This experiment will involve the use of the Manduca sexta and how specific hormones can either inhibit or promote their growth. The life cycle to the Manduca sexta is broken up into several stages, which are caused by the activation and inhibition of two specific hormones . The stages in which this insect undergoes are the egg,1st instar larva, 2nd instar larva,3rd instar larva, 4th instar larva, 5th instar larva, pupa and the adult moth. Each drastic change in the Manduca’s physiology is called the molting process. The molting process is activated by the ecdysterone hormone. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting. While the juvenile hormone , during the development, regulates the type of molt that occurs. In the 5th larval stage, the amount of JH that is secreted drastically decreases and the commitment pulse is released. This commitment pulse indicates that the caterpillar is large enough to pupate. In this specific experiment Azamax, an inhibitor of 20E, will be used to test if it will inhibit the growth of the Manduca sexta. In laboratory reared Manduca, there is evidence to suggest that speciﬁcity for a given host plant is not inherited but rather is inﬂuenced by the act of feeding on that plant during the early stages of larval development (Mechaber and Hildebrand 2000). Larvae raised on an artiﬁcial diet were much more accepting of a non-host plant compared to those raised on a traditional solanaceous plant (Flowers and Yamimoto 1982). Based on this acquired knowledge we have hypothesized that the Azamax will prevent the Manduca in the treatment group from molting and therefore preventing them from acquiring any significant growth.



Materials and Methods:
We used a total of 8 Manduca sexta larva and there are 4 larvae being used for the control group that is fed with regular food ( as per the Manduca feeding experiement food instructions). The experimental group, comprised of the remaining 4 caterpillars, was fed the same food with an exception of the added 15 drops of Azamax per 10 grams of food . While the control group was given 10 grams of food per caterpillar however, instead of Azamax droplets the food was dropped with 15 drops of water per 10 grams of food. To prevent an unequal number of droplets in any case the food was mixed in aliquots of 40 grams for both the experimental and control group. The droplets of water and Azamax were added to these separately mixed 40 grams and then 10 grams for each caterpillar was measured post-mixing of the caterpillar food. Then the weights and lengths of the Manduca were measured throughout the experiement that lasted 7 days .In addition to this some visual observations were taken throughout the 7 day period as well. In order to create an efficient experiment each caterpillar was separated by index cards in each containers. In addition to this the caterpillars were separated into experimental and control groups and then they were given individual numbers and letters. Finally the caterpillars were put into an incubator.




Results:
Based on these average as seen in the image the Manduca sexta appeared to grow steadily throughout the experiment however, this information does not consider the raw data. It was only the control group that grew steadily throughout the entirety of the experiement. Whereas the treatment group managed to remain within the range of 1-5 grams. Once the experimental group reached the optimum weight of 5.2grams and 8.2inches, the caterpillar began to shrink.  



Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported as seen through the data. Azamax inhibited 20E, the hormone, preventing a significant amount of growth in the experimental group in comparison to the control group. This was done due to the Azamax’s ability to prevent molting. A possible place of error could have occurred during the process of food preparation. The Manduca sexta had to be fed twice by two different people so food measurements could have been slightly skewed as well as the hormone droplets. I don’t believe these errors were monumental, more so microscopic differences. Other than the introduction of the Azamax to the caterpillars diets, I can’t confidently state there was another reason for the stunt in growth in the Manduca. However, there is an abnormality in the data, the Manduca in the experimental group only grew about an additional 4 grams from their original weigh in before they began to loose weight and length. Our experiment can have some agricultural applications as well. This could help farmers prevent the possible growth and outbreak issues of these insects by stunting their growth.
