Title: The Effects of an Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs from Rana pipiens   

Abstract:
In this study, an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor was investigated by studying how it affects muscle contraction. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (ACh) must break down acetylcholine resulting in muscle relaxation. It was expected that the inhibitor would increase the amplitude and lower the threshold of the contractions of gastrocnemius muscle. In this experiment, current was sent through 3 frog legs via the sciatic nerve to find the amplitude and threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle. After being used as the control, the three legs were used as the experimental group and were injected by AChE inhibitor. The amplitudes and thresholds were measured and compared against the control group data.  
 It was found that the gastrocnemius muscle injected with AChE inhibitor contraction had lower amplitude and higher a threshold. Statistical analysis found that the response to the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle after the injection of AChE inhibitor did not vary significantly from the normal contraction process.


Introduction:
A neuromuscular junction is a chemical synapse where there is contact between a motor neurons and muscle fibers. For muscle contraction to occur, an action potential must first reach the neuron’s axon terminal. The action potential opens Ca2+ voltage gated channels, allowing Ca2+  to rush into the axon terminal. Then the Ca2+ ions fuse into vesicles causing the vesicle to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and spill their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicles contain neurotransmitters; the neurotransmitter responsible for muscle contraction is acetylcholine (ACh). When ACh is released into the synaptic cleft, it binds to an ACh receptor which activates cation channels which allow Na1+ to flood into the postsynaptic membrane leading to depolarization and an action potential. The action potential activates the t-tubal which changes the shape of a DHP receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum which releases Ca2+ needed for muscle contraction. While this is occurring, the ACh in the synaptic cleft is being split into acetate and choline due to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The acetate diffuses out while the choline is transported back into the axon terminal to be used to make ACh. Enough breaking down and reabsorption will cause the muscle to stop contracting [Sadava: 2017].
An AChE inhibitor inhibits the AChE which keeps the ACh released by the vesicles stay in the synaptic cleft. Due to not being able to break down ACh, the ACh accumulates in the synaptic cleft forcing the muscle to continue to contract thus leading to constant firing of action potentials in the muscle [Johnson:2018].
It was predicted that after being injected and applied with the AChE inhibitor, the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog will have contractions with higher amplitudes and lower thresholds. If constantly stimulated, tetanus will occur, eventually leading to fatigue.  


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs from Rana pipiens. After each leg was skinned and degloved, the sciatic nerve was dissected till it was visible. The nerve is located between the gastrocnemius and the peroneus muscle in the leg; the nerve looks like a white string. After separating the gastrocnemius and the peroneus muscle by gently running scissor between them, the achilles tendon, was cut; it is connected to gastrocnemius muscle is at frogs valency of an ankle. Next, a string was attached to the end of the achilles tendon; the gastrocnemius muscle should still be connected to the tendon. The other side of the string was attached to a transducer, thus suspening it in the air,which measures the muscles tension and contraction. Then, two electrodes were placed directly on the sciatic nerve; the electrodes can not touch each other. In this setup, the frog leg was pinned down into place to ensure it does not move out of place during the contraction. For the control group, the contractions of the muscle were measured using a myogram using the program LabScribe3. The threshold and amplitude of each contraction was measured and recorded for each leg. For the test group, 0.1mL of AChE inhibitor was injected via a syringe into each leg after the legs were used for the control group. Before stimulating, three minutes were allotted for the chemical to be absorbed by the legs. Next, the thresholds and amplitudes were recorded and measured via LabScribe3. A two sample T test was run to determine and analyze the significance of the data collected. The P value for figure 1. was 0.81. and was 0.61 for figure 2. For data to statistically relevant data, the P value must be lower than 0.05 therefore are data is not statistically significant. The frog legs, dissection tray, transducer and dissection tools were all provided by the lab.


Results:
We found that in normal muscle that the mean amplitude of contraction was equal to 0.019土0.02V  (n=3) and that mean threshold occurred at 0.087土0.074V (n=3).  In muscle treated with 0.1mL of AChE inhibitor, the amplitude decreased by 18.96% (0.016土0.014V p=0.81, two sample T test) and the threshold increased by 27.80% (0.12土0.072V p=0.61, two sample T test).


Discussion:
Despite what was predicted, the recorded contractions of the gastrocnemius muscle containing the AChE inhibitor had lower amplitudes and higher thresholds [Johnson: 2017].The decrease in amplitude may have been due to a reporting and reading error. When analyzing the myogram from LabScribe 3, summation may have not been accounted for.  Not accounting for where the starting threshold is would dramatically alter the recorded results. If the threshold was not accounted for properly, it is possible that recorded amplitude would read lower than original despite being higher in reality.  The increase in threshold may have occurred due to not waiting long enough for the axon of the nerve to recover and rest. During the refractory period, the threshold increases because more stimulation is needed than normal to overcome the threshold. Because the neuron was stimulated while in its refractory period, the threshold found is larger than expected due to the ion channel gates not having recovered yet.  Since the P values for both figure 1 and figure 2 were greater than 0.05, the data collected in this lab is not statistically relevant. Therefore, it cannot be conclusively concluded that AChE inhibitor make gastrocnemius muscle contraction have lower amplitude and higher a threshold.
