Title: The Effect of Salinity on Avena sativa Root to Shoot Weight Ratios

Abstract:
Plants utilize the allocation of resources in order to maintain internal stability. The purpose of this lab was to determine how plants allocate resources in high nutrient concentrated environments. In lab, the ability of Avena sativa to allocate resources in a high salt ion concentration was tested by comparing the root to shoot weight ratios in four experimental replicates, given 1.3g/l NaCl solution, and four controll replicates, given water for fourteen days. The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.696, d.f.=8, P=0.505). This could be due to a high photosynthetic activity by the Avena sativa.

Introduction:
Plant environment determines the allocation of energy and metabolic resources in order to maintain homeostasis. In lab the ability of Avena sativa, plants commonly known as Oats, ability to maintain homeostasis through the allocation of resources in a salt water environment was tested. Avena sativa was tested because the organism is able to grow within a short period of time. This was tested by comparing an experimental group, resourced with a saline solution, and a controll group resourced with water. Plants select ions to either use or exclude by controllling the root uptake through the xylem and transport of ions in leaves. Potassium, nitrates, and phosphates are commonly absorbed through in plants to promote photosynthetic growth. High concentrations of salt lead to stalling root growth [Parida & Das: 2005]. In addition, the controll of ions in order to relieve salt stress results in increased water retention to balance the concentration with plant cells [Parida & Das: 2005]. Therefore, it can be determined that Avena sativa, in a salt water environment, will retain water and have heavier roots in order to maintain homeostasis. It was hypothesized that there would be a significent difference between the root to shoot weight ratios of the controll, water, and experimental group, saline solution.

Materials and Method:
First, the Avena sativa seeds were potted with 50Ml of Miracle Grow. Then, every day for two weeks 100Ml of 1.3g/l NaCl solution was poured into two pots of Avena sativa, the experimental group, and 100Ml of water was poured into two pots of Avena sativa, the controll group. After two weeks, each whole Avena sativa replicate weight was measured in grams. The roots and shoot of each replicate were separated their weights were measured in grams. The root to shoot weight ratios were determined for each replicate. The average value of the root to shoot weight ratios were determined for the experimental and controll replicates. Two-sample t_test was used to analyze the statistical difference between the experimental and controll groups.

Results:
The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.696, d.f.=8, P=0.505). The controll group had a greater root to shoot weight ratio compared to the experimental group, as seen in Figure 1. The controll group had an average root to shoot weight ratio of 0.4340.093. Whereas, the experimental group had a root to shoot weight ratio of 0.3840.130. The experimental group has more standard deviation compared to the controll group meaning there is more variation among replicates in the experimental group, as seen in Figure 1. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the p_value was greater than 0.05 in the statistical analysis comparing the controll and experimental group. Therefore, there is no significent difference between the root to shoot weight ratios of the controll and experimental groups. This can be explained by the ineffectiveness of salinity on physiological characteristics in the plant Alhagi pseufoalhagi. There was no effect of the physiological characteristics due to high salinity concentrations because there was increase carbon dioxide activity and stomatal conductance which resulted in photosynthetic activity, producing more biomass [Kurban, et al: 2012]. There was no difference in the root to shoot weight ratio, but the pant had grown in biomass because of the ion uptake [Kurban, et al: 2012]. The experiment explained that salinity had promoted the root uptake of potassium and salt ions, not affected calcium and magnesium ions, and created a deficiency of calcium in the Alhagi pseufoalhagi. This means that salinity affects the root uptake of some nutrients, but not all. The allocation of these ions in reaction to a salty environment resulted in growth of the plant weight, instead of inhibiting plant growth. Limitations of the experiment using Alhagi pseufoalhagi are that the experiment looked at growth over a period of thirty days compared to our experiment which only looked at the growth after fourteen days. Therefore, it would be more effective for future experiments to last longer than fourteen days. Recognizing how plants react to high nutrient concentrations can help determine where salt tolerant plants can be planted and vice versa. The effect of salinity on plant resource allocation is important in improving crop productivity in environments with high nutrient ion concentration.

Figure Legends: 
This figure shows a comparison between the root to shoot weight ratio of the controll and experimental group. The average root to shoot weight ratio of the controll group was 0.4340.093. The average root to shoot ratio weight of the experimental group was 0.3840.130. There was no significent difference between the mean root to shoot weight ratios of the controll and experimental groups (t_stat=0.696, d.f.=8, P=0.505).
