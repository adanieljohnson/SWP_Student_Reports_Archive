Title: Caterpillar Mass

Abstract:
The objective of this lab was to see the effect of growth hormones in Manduca Sexta. We predicted that using the Azguard solution, there would be a significent difference in weight over 7 days. We thought this would happen because the moth commitment pulse is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018]. We fed the M. Sexta caterpillars, measured their weight as well as their length. We also observed their color and if they pupated for a week. For one group, we dropped water on the caterpillar food and in the other group, we dropped the Azguard solution to test its effect on the M. Sexta. In our results, most of the specimens decreased in mass.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths and skippers [Johnson 2018]. Also known as the tobacco hornworm, Manduca Sexta grows into a tobacco hawk moth in its adult stage and solely thrives in the Americas. They are known for their short life cycle and inn labs, they rely on an artificial diet, one we used for this experiment. For the experiment, we fed the M. Sexta caterpillars and measured them for a week. For one group, we dropped water on the caterpillar food and in the other group, we dropped the Azguard solution to test its effect on the M. Sexta. We predicted that using the Azguard solution, there would be a significent difference in weight over 7 days.

Materials and Method:
Our materials in this experiment included 4 round, plastic containers, 4 lids with breathing holes for those containers, caterpillar food, a spoon, a balance, another container to mix the food, transfer pipets, the reagent (in this case, Azguard) index cards and tape. We separated the 8 caterpillars into two groups, the controll group and the treatment group. Each group had 4 containers and 2 caterpillars were placed in each container. We placed the caterpillar food in container and weighed .8 grams on the balance with zeroing it out first and we stirred the food using the spoon. We weighed 10 grams of food for each caterpillar for both controll and experimental group. For the controll group, we dropped 10 drops of water for the caterpillars in the controll group, using a pipet. For the treatment group, we dropped 10 drops of 1: 1250 Azguard solution along with the water mixture for the caterpillars in the treatment group, using another pipet. We labelled the index cards with the caterpillar number, lab section, group name, and whether it was treatment or controll on both sides and taped them inside each container. We would visit the caterpillars for a week and we would feed them the same amount of food. We would also measure their weight, length, color and if they pupated. We would record the data in our notebooks and we would take turns visiting the caterpillars.

Results:
Figure 1 shows the mass of Manduca Sexta for 7 days.  From we can tell from the graph in Figure 1 that specimen 1 had the largest mass with a t_statistic of 0.545 and a p_value of 4.08. Many of the specimens had decreased in mass as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1. The reason why we got our data was because some of our caterpillar food was dry and some of it was wet in the containers along with 200 grams of food lying inside.

Discussion:
In our experiment, we were seeing if there are changes from the controll group to the test group. We saw a decrease in mass of the caterpillars. The Manduca Sexta is an example of a holometaboulous life cycle, a cycle in which the adult looks nothing like the larvae and has stages to go through. All moths and butterflies (Order Lepidoptera) honey bees, waps, and ants (Order Hymenoptera), flies (Order Diptera), and beetles (Order Copleoptera) have homotabolous cycles [Johnson 2018]. Our hypothesis was supported because there was a significent difference in weight. The reason why we got our data was because some of our caterpillar food was dry and some of it was wet in the containers along with 200 grams of food lying inside. The next step we would take would be to repeat the process again to be sure.
