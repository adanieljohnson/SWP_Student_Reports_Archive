Title: Chemotactic effects of glucose and glycine on [Physarum polycephalum]

Abstract:
The objective of this study was to investigate the relational effects of glucose and glycine on the chemotaxis of the slime mold [Physarum polycephalum]. Chemotaxis in Physarum polycephalum has been widely studied due to its use for studying cytoplasmic streaming, signaling, and how these play a role in chemotaxis movement [DeLacyCostello: 2013]. When placed in equal proximity to both glucose and glycine, we hypothesized that the Physarum polycephalum would move more towards the glucose than the glycine. Three water-agar petri dishes were prepared with a glucose sample to the left of a Physarum polycephalum sample, and a glycine sample to the right of the same Physarum polycephalum sample. After incubating the three plates for 48 hours, the distance traveled by the Physarum polycephalum, and the direction (towards glucose, glycine, or neither) was measured. The average distance traveled towards glucose was 0 mm (s.d. = 0 mm), and the average distance traveled towards glycine was 41 mm (s.d. = 0 mm). After data analysis, our hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
This study tested the chemotaxis response of Physarum polycephalum to glucose and the amino acid glycine. Physarum polycephalum is “a true acellular slime mold that belongs to the species of order Physarales,” and its chemotaxis behavior, defined as the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus, has been widely studied as a model organism for cell signaling (DeLacyCostello: 2013). This is because “. . .Physarum has a very extensive system for signal detection and processing [for a single-celled organism]” (Schaap: 2015). “The molecular complexity of this signaling system is comparable to, and in some respects exceeds, that of higher animals, making Physarum a good model organism for the analysis of how living cells interact with their environment” (Schaap: 2015). A study by DeLacyCostello and Adamatzky states that “the first studies on chemoattractants and their effect on Physarum polycephalum can be traced back over 100 years,” resulting in a vast amount of primary literature that examines the different chemoattractants and chemorepellants of Physarum polycephalum (DeLacyCostello: 2013). Certain studies have looked at the two molecules that will be tested in this study, and have found the respective chemotaxis strengths of glucose and glycine. A study by Kincaid and Mansour found that glucose is a strong chemoattractant of Physarum polycephalum, and that it promotes Physarum polycephalum growth. This same study found that glycine is a strong chemoattractant of Physarum polycephalum, and that it is considered “essential for growth” (Kincaid: 1978). Glucose is a strong chemoattractant most likely because its chair conformation is more stable than other, less strong sugar chemoattractants (Kincaid: 1978). Additionally, glucose supports growth due to its role as a carbohydrate and source of carbon for the Physarum polycephalum (Johnson: 2016). Amino acids as a group vary in their chemotaxis strength, and glycine is grouped in the category of highest chemoattractants (Kincaid: 1978). The same study by Kincaid and Mansour found that glycine is “essential for growth” of the Physarum polycephalum (Kincaid: 1978). A different study found that “Deletion of glycine permitted growth at only 25% of the optimal rate [in Physarum polycephalum],” affirming that glycine does in fact play a major role in Physarum polycephalum growth (Daniel: 1963). Despite both glucose and glycine being necessary for growth, the study by Kincaid and Mansour also revealed that the chemoattractant strength of sugars and amino acids was not directly related to the nutritional use of the substances (Kincaid: 1978). The study speculated that “ amino acid chemotaxis may be . . . dependent, or reflecting specific metabolic or nutritional states,” and that “carbohydrate chemotaxis may involve a sensory component which recognizes specific structural features of sugars” (Kincaid: 1978). Because nutrition appears to have little or no effect on chemotaxis movement, we formed the hypothesis based on previous literature, which stated that glucose exhibited stronger chemoattractive forces than glycine (Kincaid: 1978). Since we compared the chemotaxis response of Physarum to glucose and glycine in the same proximity, and glucose is a stronger chemoattractant, we hypothesize that Physarum polycephalum will exhibit more movement towards glucose than towards glycine. Glycine and glucose are the two independent variables in this study, and the distance traveled (and direction) by the Physarum polycephalum is the dependent variable.


Materials and Methods:
This study obtained three petri dishes with a gel water-agar solution, one dish with Physarum polycephalum, one dish with glucose, and one dish with glycine (prepared by soaking water-agar with liquid glycine for 10 minutes). Using sterilized forceps and spatula, we cut three 1cm x 1cm cubes out of each individual water-agar petri dish, and dispose of the cubes. Each cube was 1 cm apart. Next, we used sterilized forceps and a spatula to cut 3 1cm x 1cm cubes out of the glucose petri dish, 3 1cm x 1cm cubes out of the glycine petri dish, and 3 1cm by 1cm cubes out of the Physarum polycephalum dish. One cube of glucose was added to the empty space on the far left of each individual water-agar dish, one cube of Physarum polycephalum to the empty space in the middle of each water-agar dish, and one glycine cube to the empty space on the far right of each water-agar dish. The three petri dishes were wrapped completely in foil so that no light can enter. We labeled the petri dishes and placed them in an incubator, at 37 degrees F for approximately 48 hours. We returned to measure the distance traveled (in mm) by the Physarum polycephalum and the direction in which it traveled. This was completed using a millimeter ruler, measuring from the center of the Physarum block to the leading strand of the Physarum. We planned to run a two-sample, one-tailed t-test to test our hypothesis that the Physarum polycephalum would move more towards the glucose than the glycine, considering p &lt; 0.05 to be significant. The mean distance traveled in each three petri dishes were averaged and then used for the  t-test. Any outliers were removed from the data analysis, and were calculated using the Grubb’s test. 


Results:
The average distance traveled by the Physarum polycephalum towards the glucose was 0 mm, with a standard deviation of 0 mm. With the average distance traveled by the Physarum polycephalum towards the glycine, we had to remove an outlier from the third plate, which exhibited 0 mm movement towards the glycine. After removing the outlier, the averaged distance traveled towards the glycine was 41 mm, with a standard deviation of 0 mm. Because there was no standard deviation in either of the groups, a t-test could not be run. 


Discussion:
The data collected did not support the hypothesis that the Physarum polycephalum would move more towards the glucose than the glycine. This is because our data suggested that the Physarum polycephalum moved more towards the glycine (avg. 41 mm) than the glucose (avg. 0 mm), which contradicts our hypothesis. It is necessary to address the absence of a p-value derived from the t-test. Because there was no standard deviation in either of our two data groups, a t-test could not be run and a p-value not calculated. A standard deviation of 0 typically suggests solid data, despite a small sample size. In addition to not supporting our original hypothesis, our data did not support the countless studies like those by DeLacyCostello and Adamatzky which supported glucose being a stronger chemoattractive strength than glycine (DeLacyCostello: 2013). The first explanation for our data would have to take into account our testing the chemotaxis of glucose and glycine in the same environment. The primary literature that supported higher chemoattractance of glucose tested glucose and Physarum by themselves. Since glycine was in the same proximity as glucose, it is possible that glycine had some effect on glucose that partially or fully inhibited its chemoattractant properties. Primary literature yields little information on interactions between glucose and glycine in the specifications of our study, inviting further investigation of the interactions of the substances. In a replication of this study, there are many improvements to be made that have the potential to yield informative results. Firstly, it is possible that the concentration of glycine was much higher than the concentration of glucose in the 1cm x 1cm cubes placed adjacent to the Physarum polycephalum cube. This would be attributed to the process by which we prepared the glycine solution – soaking the water-agar directly in glycine for 10 minutes prior to conducting the study. In future replications of similar studies, it would be necessary to test several different, known concentrations of glycine and glucose to explore how the Physarum chemotaxis changes with different concentrations. Additionally, it would be necessary to increase our number of petri dishes to increase our data’s validity. Although this study’s hypothesis was not supported, it would be interesting to examine other relationships between chemoattractants using Physarum polycephalum. Such studies could reveal whether or not chemoattractance strength depends on the presence of other, nearby chemoattractants, and how the Physarum polycephalum responds biologically under such circumstances.

Figure Legends: 
Figure Legends: Figure 1 shows the average distance migrated by the Physarum polycephalum towards the glucose and glycine respectively. The average distance migrated towards the glucose was 0 mm and the standard deviation 0 mm. The average distance migrated towards the glycine was 27 mm and the standard deviation was 24 mm. The error bars represent the standard deviations. Overall trends were that there was no movement towards glucose in any of the three petri dishes, and strong movement towards glycine in two of the three petri dishes.
