Title: A comparison of the photosynthetic activity in spinach (sun-favoring) and fern (shade-favoring) leaves  

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a necessary process for plants and involves the capture of sunlight in order to use energy. The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of leaves absorb light to make O2, which is released, as well as glucose that is then used or stored for energy. It begins with light dependent reactions in PSII, therefore photons of light must be present. The absorption of light then causes the excitation and transfer of electrons with the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient, & ATP synthesis. In this experiment, spinach & fern leaves were compared using Hill reactions during which the amount of photosynthetic activity was determined. DCPIP was used to examine the percent change in light absorption & measure rate of photosynthesis. The results showed that the spinach had a higher percent change in photosynthetic reduction & thus more photosynthetic activity. The experiment proved to have significent results that supported the hypothesis, because plants that prefer to grow in light are more efficient in absorbing light in PSII & have higher photosynthetic potentials. The results supported light as a key factor that affects photosynthesis, especially the activity of PSII, & the internal structure of leaves also affects the ability to conduct more photosynthetic activity.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture and use energy from sunlight, using CO2 and H2O to produce glucose, H2O and O2. In photosynthesis, there are redox reactions in which electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain to other complexes. The complexes pump protons across the bilayer to create a gradient with the energy from the electron transfer, and the gradient causes the synthesis of ATP. The light dependent reactions of photosynthesis are especially important for creating the proton gradient and ATP synthesis. The reaction begins with energy from light triggering electrons to move to plastiquinone from chlorophyll in PSII, and then reduced plastiquinone transferring electrons to cytochrome b6f and then plastocyanin. Then in PSI, energy from light excites electrons of chlorophyll which travel to NADP+ to make NADPH. These electrons that leave chlorophyll in PSI are then replaced by those from PSII. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis because they absorb solar radiation in their chlorophyll molecules to begin the light dependent reactions in the photosystems. A Hill reaction with DCPIP is also important to the experiment in order to examine the electron transfer reactions in the chloroplasts to measure photosynthetic activity and determine if factors affected the redox reactions necessary for photosynthesis. DCPIP is an important reagent for the assays because it acts as an electron acceptor and changes color from dark blue to clear when reduced, in order to show reduction reactions in photosynthesis to display photosynthetic activity (Johnson: 2016). 
The purpose of this lab is to compare photosynthetic activity of spinach and fern leaves, and to determine if the rates of photosynthesis are decreased in plants that prefer the shade rather than sunlight. The spinach plant thrives in abundant sunlight, while the fern prefers to exist in shaded areas.  The organisms used in the experiment are spinach, because it has a high yield of chloroplast and its photosynthetic activity prospers in ample sunlight, and fern leaves, because its photosynthetic activity thrives in shade. We expected that the spinach would have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern leaves because even though the fern prospers in the shade, the light favoring spinach would acquire constant energy from available sunlight and be able to begin photosynthesis with PSII more readily. The fern leaves would be better at absorbing light at lower levels, however the spinach would have more energy in general from the absorption of strong light and would have a higher rate of photosynthesis (Spilatro: 1998).  Further research on the topic of comparing sun plants and shade plants determined that an increased internal leaf area and greater number of chloroplasts in sun plants causes a generally higher photosynthetic rate, as well as having smaller, thicker leaves that have more developed mesophyll regions which contain chloroplasts (Novel: 1976). This research led us to hypothesize that the spinach leaves would have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern leaves, as they would have more chloroplasts and more activity in PSII because of the energy from more sunlight. 


Materials and Method:
The two organisms used in this experiment were spinach, Spinacia oleracea and a species of fern, a member of the monilophytes group. The spinach was provided by the laboratory and stored in a refrigerator at temperatures between 0 and 8°C, and the fern plant was obtained by extracting five branches of leaves from a shaded fern plant, housed indoors at room temperature. We first packed a mortar and pestle, beaker (150-250Ml size) and three 50Ml centrifuge tube in ice to cool. The central veins were removed from four of the spinach leaves, and the leaves and a total of 20Ml cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) were grinded into a paste with the chilled mortar and pestle. The leaf slurry was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. During this time, the fern leaves were also cut into smaller fragments and then grinded with a total of 20Ml cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) with another mortar and pestle, and the leaf slurry was strained though three layers of cheesecloth into an additional chilled beaker. Once these steps were completed for each, 200 μl of the filtered liquid of spinach and fern leaves were transferred into separate microtubules and chilled in the ice bath. The remainder of both liquids were then separately placed in centrifuge tubes labeled and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4oC. Then both of the supernatants of the first sample centrifuged liquid were transferred into separate, second chilled centrifuge tubes and centrifuged again at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was then removed from each of the second samples and the pellet was suspended by adding 20Ml of grinding buffer solution and mixed. 200 μl of the resuspended pellet for both the spinach and fern samples were transferred to microtubes and stored on ice. Next, each sample of the pellet were examined for chloroplast density on hemocytometer under a microscope in order to compare the differing amounts of chloroplasts. Since the pellet sample of the fern sample was found to be much more dilute in comparison to that of the spinach, the spinach sample was diluted by adding 100 μl spinach sample and diluted with 700 μl of water during the assay. In contrast, 800 μl of the fern sample was added during the assay, without dilution. In order to complete the assay Hill reaction next, 13 test tubes were labeled and filled with reaction mixtures. The reaction mixtures consisted of one blank tube with 8Ml water and 2Ml reaction buffer, three tubes without chloroplasts with 6Ml water, 2Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), three tubes with spinach chloroplasts (diluted) and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer, and then three tubes with fern chloroplasts and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer. The tubes were mixed after the addition of chloroplasts and then transferred into 10 different spectrophotometer cuvettes that were then measured for absorbance at 600nm. The samples were then placed under the white grow light, an artificial light source of equal intensity level appropriate for photosynthesis that resembles sunlight, for 10 minutes and measured for absorbance again, and this step was repeated 3 times for a total of 30 minutes sitting under light. A statistical two sample t_test was then used in order to examine the results of percent change of the two organisms (% change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%).


Results:
The trend displayed by the data shows that the percent changes in absorbance between 0 and 30 minutes of time had passed were highest with the spinach leaf samples, at an average of 57.1%, followed by the fern leaves at an average of 11.6%, and then the samples with no chloroplasts had an average of 0.298%, as they were expected to have little to no change at all. The spinach leaves also had the highest standard deviation value, at about 12.5, while the standard deviation for the fern leaves was much lower at 1.35. The two-sample t_test determined that the results were statistically significent, with degrees of freedom of 4, t_stat of 6.234155 and p_value of 0.003373

Discussion:
The results displayed by this experiment support the hypothesis that the spinach, the sun-favoring organism, would show a higher rate of photosynthesis than the fern, which favors shade. This was found to be the case because the data, as displayed in Figure 1, shows an impressive percent change for the spinach, at 57%, compared to the 12.5% change for the fern over the 30-minute time period. In a similar study that compared the photosynthetic rates of sun versus shade leaves of Hyptis emoryi, the results showed that shade leaves are able to absorb light like sun plants because their leaves generally have larger surface area which helps to intercept photons of light and capture the light energy even when light isn’t especially abundant (Novel: 1976). However, the results also showed that sun plants have generally thicker leaves with smaller surface area, but a thicker mesophyll region that lowers the liquid phase resistance of CO2 when there is abundant sun, and thus leads to higher photosynthetic rates (Novel: 1976). Other research on leaf form and photosynthesis also supports the data found in our experiment that the sun-favoring plant would have a higher rate of photosynthesis, as their data showed that leaves that have the most photosynthetic potential are those in abundant light conditions, like spinach, that have the features of light-favoring leaves including horizontal, thick leaves and more equal number of stomata. In comparison, leaves that prefer less light, like the fern, that have thin leaves, no palisade cells and stomata only on one side, have lower potentials for photosynthesis (Smith: 1997). This is in line with our data, as the fern leaves had much lower amounts of photosynthetic activity during the 30 minutes, even though we took measures to make the chloroplast amounts even; likely because the fern has a lower potential for photosynthesis in light. This is likely the case because the increase in the number of photons of light absorbed in the photosystems during light dependent reactions is greater for the sun-favoring plant, and therefore more of its electrons would be excited and used in the electron transport chain during the redox reactions of photosynthesis. 
The experiment ultimately was supported by the hypothesis; however, some sources of error might have affected the experiment. For example, the age of the plants and chloroplasts could have affected the experiment in a negative fashion, as aging causes a loss of chlorophyll and thus degeneration of chloroplasts (Cran: 1973). The ages of both organisms were unknown, but the fern was harvested from an aged indoor plant that was likely older than the fresh spinach. Furthermore, a future experiment that could compliment this one would be to examine if the specific type of white light used in this experiment may not excite the fern as much as the spinach in general, and if there may be another type of light that would have a different effect on the organisms. The white grow light may have had a comparable level of light as natural sun for the sun-favoring spinach plant, but the indoor fern plant may have not been excited by it because it is not accustomed to this level and type of light at all. Research on this matter shows evidence that shade-favoring plants that are not used to strong sunlight can actually be damaged by the high light intensity, and thus their photosynthetic activity would be diminished. In the study the sun-favoring plants actually showed an increase in photosynthetic activity with this saturation of high light intensity (Gauhl: 1975). Ultimately, this experiment examined the differences between the photosynthetic activity of organisms that thrive in different types of conditions, and the cellular factors that contribute to why. This experiment supported many other sources of data that have proven that sun-favoring plants display a higher photosynthetic rate than shade-favoring plants, and display the importance of understanding photosynthetic reactions at the cellular level.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The graph displays the average percent change for the fern, spinach and “no chloroplast” samples, measured at 30 minutes of time from the start. The change in absorbance during the 30 minutes was obviously most significent with the spinach, with about a 57% mean change, compared to about 12% mean change in the fern leaves. The standard deviation bars show the biggest variation for the spinach as well. The two plant samples are also compared to the samples with no chloroplast, which expectedly had an extremely minimal change. The two-sample t_test provided a p_value of 0.003373.
