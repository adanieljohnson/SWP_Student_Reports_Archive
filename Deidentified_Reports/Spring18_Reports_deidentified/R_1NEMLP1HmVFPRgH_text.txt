Title: Salt Water Increases the Root to Shoot Ratio of Vigna Radiata (Mung Beans)

Abstract:
To allocate the resources a plant requires, like carbon and nitrogen, mung bean plants germinate certain ways depending on their environment to effectively and efficiently do so. We measured mung beans root to shoot ratio when their seeds were grown in two different conditions: salt water and tap water. We predicted that salt, which affects the plants ability to obtain the resources because it induces osmotic stress by limiting absorption of water, will cause the mung bean roots to grow larger and longer so they have a greater chance of effectively obtain the resources it needs to grow while under salt stress. This large growth in the roots will only occur in the short term, as the plant will show signs of death because the salt is affecting the plants ability to absorb water and nutrients. In our experiment, we watered these mung bean plants with the appropriate type of water for two weeks and then measured the length and weight of their roots and shoots to see if there was a difference between the way the plants grew in the two different conditions. Our results show that there was a difference in the plants that grew in the salt conditions, as their roots were longer and heavier to obtain the resources it needs.

Introduction:
When surviving and growing it its environment, plants must interact not only with environmental stimuli, but also stimuli coming from non-living sources, such as temperature, soil type, etc. (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Plant interactions revolve around obtaining essential resources such as sunlight, nitrogen, or water (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Each species’ pattern of resource allocation is genetically determined, but it is not completely fixed (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Therefore, plants can modify their typical allocation pattern somewhat to allow them to adapt to variety of conditions (Johnson, A.D. 2006). Salinity is a problem for plants as saline conditions are known to suppress plant growth (Parida and Das 2005). Salinity induces osmotic stress by limiting absorption of water from the soil (Mayak et al., 2004). Therefore, plants ted to struggle to obtain the nutrients they require in saline conditions.
In this experiment, we test the ability of mung beans to cope with its environment and to change its growth patterns to more effectively obtain the resources it needs to survive. Because salt hinders plants ability to obtain nutrients from the soil, we expected the plant to grow larger roots to create more opportunity to obtain the resources it needs in the two weeks we conduct the experiment, as it is affected by the salt.

Materials and Method:
We first filled six dishes with soil. Next, we added around 50 mung beans to each dish to ensure enough plants grew to conduct our experiment. We then labelled three dishes “salt” and the other three with “no salt.” We poured about 500 Ml of regular tap water into the three dishes labelled “no salt.” We poured 500 Ml of a salt concentration that was 1.3 g/liter into the three dishes labelled “salt.” Next, we poured 50 Ml of miracle grow in each of the six dishes. We then watered all of the dishes with the appropriate water type once a day for two weeks to stimulate their growth equally. At the end of two weeks, we measured the length and weight of the roots and shoots of three mung bean plants from each of the dishes of mung beans.


Results:
Mung Bean plants responded to salt by increasing the size of their roots. Root to shoot ratio was higher in both the weight (Figure 1) and the length (Figure 2) of mung bean plants. However, when we averaged all the trials of salt and all the trials of no salt, we conducted a two-sample t_test that found that p value was greater than .05, therefore, there was not a significent difference (t = 1.48, d.f. = 2.47, p &gt; .05). General trends do show that the roots did grow larger and longer in salt water conditions compared to that of regular water conditions.

Discussion:
The results supported my hypothesis of mung beans having a greater root to shoot ratio in the salt water condition. The mung bean plants adapted and grew larger roots because the salt was blocking their ability to obtain the nutrients it required. This type of adaptation to salinity is accompanied by accumulation of organic osmotically active compounds called osmolytes (Greenway and Munns, 1980; Hoque et al., 2007). This phenomenon, known as osmotic adjustment (OA) and is considered to be an important component of salinity tolerance mechanisms in plants (Neocleous and Vasilakakis, 2007). The plants utilized their energy towards expanding its root network to compensate for the lack of nutrients it was obtaining in hopes of obtaining more with a greater network. The plant adapted to its environment and changed its growth pattern to allocate its resources appropriately. Though there a difference is present between the plants that grew in the salt conditions and those that did not (as shown in Figure 1 & 2), the p_value is above .05, which means there was not a significent difference. This could be due to the fact that we did not run enough trials or the fact that the averages of the roots were simply just not significently different enough. There was a small error in the experiment. In trial 1 for the salt condition, the plant had noticeably wimpier and smaller roots and shoots in general due to the fact that it was shaded and overcrowded by the other plants. Also, we noticed that the leaves of all of the salt plants were very wimpy, which verified our theory that the mung beans were going to start showing signs of death because they were not getting enough nutrients growing in saltwater. Because of the salt induced osmotic stress, the roots were not effectively transporting nutrients to the leaves, therefore, they started to die. If we were to continue this experiment, the plants most likely would have died completely from the salt water and the plants growing in the normal water would have survived. This would be a good hypothesis and design for a future experiment. Overall, plants are able to adapt to their environment when allocating their resources, which is shown by the mung bean plants in the salt water conditions.
