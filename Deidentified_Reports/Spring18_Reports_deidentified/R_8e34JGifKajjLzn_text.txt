Title: Effect of concentration of Juvenile Hormone on weight of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to test the effects of Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Based on previous research, we determined the concentration of the Precor (JH) hormone that we would add to the caterpillar food, and hypothesized that this concentration of the hormone would cause the weight of Manduca sexta to decrease. We set up 4 caterpillars in this group with their food and also had 4 controll caterpillars whose food contained distilled water. After weighing the caterpillars each day for 8 days and running statistical tests on the data, it was concluded that our hypothesis was not supported and that the concentration of JH that we chose did not cause the caterpillars to decrease in weight. 


Introduction:
Juvenile Hormone is one of the hormones that insects require for development. JH is produced by the corpus allata and is necessary for the insect to move through its five larval stages (Johnson). JH regulates the development and reproduction of Manduca sexta, and is necessary in a small concentration in order for the insect to survive (El-Sheikh et al.). In this experiment, we will be testing the effect of a specific concentration of JH on the pupation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. This caterpillar has five larval stages prior to pupation. JH levels are the highest in Manduca sexta at the beginning larval stages and are at their lowest during the commitment pulse. According to previous research, Manduca sexta caterpillars are sensitive to concentrations of JH at concentrations as low as 2 x  μg (Fain and Riddiford). The pupation of a Manduca sexta caterpillar is dependent on the weight of that caterpillar, and JH impacts the weight.


Materials and Method:
Divide 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars (aged 1-2 weeks) into 2 groups of 4. Place caterpillars into plastic containers that are divided into two sections with a taped-down index card. Place one caterpillar in each section so that you have 4 plastic containers, 2 controll and 2 experimental. For the controll group, mix 10mg of food with 0.15Ml of distilled water for each caterpillar. For the experimental group, mix 10mg of food with 0.15Ml of 4% concentration Precor hormone for each caterpillar. Keep each of the 4 containers in the same conditions of 25° C and 12 hour light/12 hour dark schedule. Ensure that the air holes in the containers stay uncovered. Record the weight of each of the caterpillars each day for 8 days. Run a 2 sample one-tail T-test on this data. This statistical test should be done because there are two samples of data; a controll group and an experimental group, and it was hypothesized that the experimental group’s weight would decrease specifically, so a one-tail test should be conducted. 


Results:
The controll group had an average weight gain of 1.30g over the course of the experiment, and the experimental group had an average weight gain of 1.42g. After conducting the T-test, the P value was found to be 0.857, which indicates that the data was not statistically significent.  

Figure 1 shows the average weights of both the controll group and the experimental group on day 1 and the new weight averages on day 8. This figure shows that both groups increased in average weight over the course of this experiment and that there was not a significent difference in ending weight between the experimental and controll group. One of our controll group caterpillars decreased in weight, which accounts for the large margin of error on the controll group day 8 set of data. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the addition of 0.15Ml of 4% concentration Precor to the food of Manduca sexta was not supported because both the controll and experimental groups gained weight over the course of the experiment. We predicted that the addition of the hormone would cause weight to decrease, and not only did the weight of the experimental group increase, but it increased at a very similar rate to the controll group. Because the p value was 0.857, the difference between the two sets of data was not statistically significent. This indicates that the addition of this concentration (0.15Ml of 4%) of Precor did not specifically influence weight of the caterpillars. 
The fact that our hypothesis was not supported could have been due to the specific concentration of hormone that we used. This experiment should be repeated with larger amounts of caterpillars to account for random error among different caterpillars that could cause weight changes that went against the trend. In addition, this experiment should be repeated with many different concentrations of Precor in order to determine at exactly what concentration weight begins to decrease and at what concentration weight begins to increase.
