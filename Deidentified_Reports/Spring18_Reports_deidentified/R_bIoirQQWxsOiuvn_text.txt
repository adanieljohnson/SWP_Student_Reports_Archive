Title: The Effect of Tubocurarine (An Acetylcholine Antagonist) on Amplitudes of Muscle Contractions

Abstract:
Muscle contractions and nerve contractions are extremely complex events that occur due to multiple compounds and ions being released, and triggering other ions and compounds to release. An extremely important compound that needs to be released and bound for a muscle contraction to occur is acetylcholine. To test the effects acetylcholine has on muscle contractions, specifically that of the Lithobates pipien, we tested three L. pipien legs. We ran three contractions on each of these legs, measuring the threshold amplitudes, then injected 2mL of tubocurarine, an acetylcholine antagonist, into the legs and ran three more contractions once again measuring the threshold amplitudes. We predicted that when treated with tubocurarine, the frog legs would have a smaller threshold amplitude than when untreated. Myograms were run for contractions, and using two sample T-tests, it was found that our hypothesis was supported.

Introduction:
L. pipien are better known as Northern leopard frogs, and are native to swamps in North America. The legs of L. pipien are extremely muscular and consist of several muscles including the gastrocnemius muscle, and several nerves including the sciatic nerve [Johnson: 2018]. A normal muscular contraction has three major parts: the latent period, the contraction period, and the relaxation period. A contraction begins with an action potential traveling down a nerve and arrives at the neuromuscular junction. The depolarization of the neuron then causes the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal [Johnson: 2018]. When acetylcholine binds on the membrane of the muscle fiber sodium channels open, triggering an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential then spreads all the way down the fiber which stimulates the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of the calcium ions then causes a contraction of the muscle fiber. Then, reuptake of the calcium ions occur, allowing the muscle to fall into the relaxation state. All of the steps to a muscle and nerve contraction are crucial, and with a single ion or step being inhibited or changed the entire contraction may fail [Johnson: 2018].
An extremely crucial chemical to a successful muscle contraction is acetylcholine. Without acetylcholine sodium channels would not be able to open, and no action potential in the muscle fiber could be triggered leading to contractions [Geeves and Holmes: 2005]. To find out important information about a muscle contraction, a myogram can be used. A myogram is a device that uses small wires that are placed on a main nerve to measure the length of a contraction and the strength of a contraction (the amplitude). A smaller amplitude and a shorter contraction length typically means a less strong contraction. With all of this known information about muscle contractions, we wondered if an acetylcholine antagonist would inhibit a muscle contraction. An acetylcholine antagonist inhibits the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle fiber, for this lab we used tobocurine for this purpose [Pedersen and Cohen: 1990]. We predicted that L. pipien that are treated with tubocurarine would have their muscle contractions inhibited, and therefore would have a smaller threshold amplitude than the L. pipien legs that are untreated.


Materials and Methods:
Three L. pipien legs were acquired and prepped for experimenting by removing the skin. The legs then had their gastrocnemius muscle separated carefully from the bone and cut at the very top of the Achilles tendon. The top of the thigh was then carefully peeled back to reveal the sciatic nerve. A string was then tied to the Achilles tendon in order to be hung on a metal rung so that the sciatic nerve could be easily accessed. The myogram was then set up, placing the two wires on the sciatic nerve, a few centimeters apart. The described setup for the legs can be seen in figure 1.
 A threshold was then established by running a contraction at slightly higher pulse amplitudes. The threshold was established to be .2 volts. This was then multiplied by 125% to ensure that a full contraction would be seen, and the tests were then run at .25 volts. Each leg then had three contractions run on them, and an amplitude was recorded each time. Next, 2mL of tubocurarine was injected into the leg using a syringe. The legs were left for five minutes in order to allow the tubocurarine to take effect. Then three new contractions were run, and the amplitudes were recorded. These steps were then repeated on the two remaining L. pipien legs. Then the results were analyzed using two-tailed T tests. If the results of the T-tests had a P value of .05(5%) or below they were determined to be significant, while if they had a P value of above .05(5%) they were determined to be insignificant.


Results:
As can be seen in figure 2, the average amplitude of the first untreated L. pipien leg was 0.06±0.0017 volts, and the average amplitude of the tubocurarine treated L. pipien leg was 0.0163±0.00058 volts.
As can be seen in figure 3, the average amplitude of the first untreated L. pipien leg was 0.278±0.022 volts, and the average amplitude of the tubocurarine treated L. pipien leg was 0.126±0.0046 volts.
As can be seen in figure 4, the average amplitude of the first untreated L. pipien leg was 0.08±0.0035 volts, and the average amplitude of the tubocurarine treated L. pipien leg was 0.0117±0.00115 volts.

Discussion:
When it came to our experimental results, we found that tubocurarine had a significant effect on all three of the L. pipien legs’ ability to contract fully (Figure 2; P=0.0004, Figure 3; P=0.0045, and Figure 4; P=0.00045). These results supported our hypothesis that the tubocurarine treatment would result in a smaller threshold amplitude than the control. We believe that our lab was completed with accuracy, and that there were no major sources of error. In the future, this lab could be altered to inject more than 2mL of tubocurarine, or more time could be waited for the acetylcholine antagonist to set in before contractions were run. These changes could allow for data to be even stronger, however they are not necessary to receive positive data [Maruki, Izaki, Akema, and Nomura: 2003]. While this experiment was fairly simple, the results could lead to future long term uses. Over stimulated muscles, or muscles that are over contracted can lead to pain or tetanus. Tetanus is caused by over contracted muscles that leads to immense pain, muscle spasms, and if left untreated, possible death [Hassel, 2013]. While inhibiting all muscles in the body from contracting would lead to heart failures, breathing failures, and death, small localized does of a muscle contraction inhibitor could relax a muscle that is dangerously contracted. For this reason, our findings of the function of tubocurarine could make it a feasible way to cure tetanus by relaxing the muscles in the body.
