Title: Effects of Artificial Hormones on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones conduct many physiological patterns in insects. Growth hormones are needed in order for insects to develop and morph. Throughout this experiment, we observed the growth patterns of controll and experimental groups of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In the experimental group, we used a juvenile hormone to inhibit the growth and development of the caterpillar. We found that due to the JH, the experimental insects were unable to move on to the next stage in life, that being the pupal stage. All in all, our results show that artificial hormones can affect the natural processes in an organism.

Introduction:
All physiological activities within living beings are conducted by the organism's hormones. Specifically, in pupal insects such as the Manduca Sexta, the life cycles of the insect are initiated and conducted by growth hormones. In order for the insect to proceed into adulthood, specific hormones are required to be released/inhibited to allow this to happen. Juvenile hormones are responsible for the regulation of development, reproduction, etc. in the life cycle. In this experiment, we will manipulate the hormone levels in the caterpillar by mixing a juvenile hormone, Precor, with the experimental group's food. Our independent variable was the treatment given to the experimental groups, which lead to the results in the weight, or the dependent variable.

When exposed to a sufficient concentration of an insect growth hormone (IGR), in our case we used Precor, a juvenile hormone (JH), the caterpillars' growth rates will decrease and they will be prevented from reaching adulthood. The caterpillars will remain in the growth stage in life. 

Biological null hypothesis: An IGR that alters JH will not cause an abnormality in Manduca sexta maturation.

Biological alternate hypothesis: An IGR that alters JH will cause an inhibition in Manduca sexta growth.

Statistical null hypothesis: A significent difference (p < 0.05) will be found in the treatment group.

Statistical alternate hypothesis: No significent statistical difference (p > 0.05) will be found in the treatment group.



Materials and Method:
Materials
"	4 round, plastic containers to hold the caterpillars throughout the week
"	4 perforated lids
"	4 index cards and tape (for dividing the round containers)
"	Manduca food
"	Spoon
"	Balance
"	Transfer pipets
"	Water
"	Reagent (Precor)


Method

1.	In order to put two caterpillars in each container, fold both ends of each index card so the card fits to divide the inside of the plastic container. Tape the ends to the inner edge of the container to hold it in place.
2.	Label each container with your group name, lab section, TA, caterpillar ID. Be sure to identify each caterpillar as a controll group or treatment group.
3.	Measure 10 grams of food for each Manduca caterpillar (80 grams in total) and set aside.
4.	Stir the food.
5.	For the controll, you will weigh a single portion of food (10 grams) and set aside in another container. 
6.	Using the transfer pipet, add 5 drops of water to the portion and stir well. (The amount of water you are adding should be the same as the amount of Precor going into the treatment food.)
7.	Using the spoon, you will put a portion of food (10 grams) in each controll caterpillar home. 
a.	In order to keep it moist, you should make sure that the food is compact when in the home.
8.	Repeat steps 5-7 until you have placed food in each of the controll groups' homes. 
9.	When preparing the treatment food, you will follow steps like 5-9. However, when the time comes to add the liquid, you will use 5 drops of Precor per caterpillar instead of water.
10.	Clean up.
a.	Put the lids back on the homes and put the caterpillars in the incubator. 
b.	Throw trash away.
c.	Close Precor containers.
d.	Put food back in the fridge.
e.	Wash up reusable items (spoons, containers, glassware i.e.) in the sink. 
f.	Feed each caterpillar with the same formula at the same time every day. Be sure to empty the homes of feces before you add the food.


Results:
When compared to the controll group, the average weight (in grams) of the treatment group is less than the controll group. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the treatment group (t-value: 0.365078, degrees of freedom: 12, P-value: 0.7214060)

Discussion:
We can infer from the direct observations that a small amount of the hormone increases growth. The results support the alternate hypothesis, which states "an IGR that alters JH will cause an inhibition in Manduca sexta growth." We can conclude that the hormone does have a negative effect on insect growth. Moreover, the daily intake of JH prevented the caterpillars from being able to move on to the next stage in life, that being the pupal stage.
