Title: Manduca Sexta Treated with Excess Juvenile Hormone 

Abstract:
During this experiment, we wanted to know the effects of increasing Juvenile Hormone in 4th and 5th instar larvae. We predicted that increasing the levels of JH in in 4th and 5th stage larvae, will cause the larvae to be unable to pupate and become adults. Instead, they would remain in the 5th instar stage until death. We tested this hypothesis on 8 Manduca Sexta larvae. Four larvae were in the control group while the other four larvae were in the treatment group. We fed each larva with 10g of food. The control caterpillars received 10 drops of water per 10 grams of food while the treatment caterpillars received 10 drops of a JH agonist called Precor per 10 grams of food. We weighed and measured the caterpillars each day. 

On average, the treatment caterpillars gained more weight and grew longer over the course of eight days. We accepted our hypothesis because two of our control caterpillars appeared to be in the beginning states of pupation while none of our treatment caterpillars started to pupate. Before pupation, larvae lose weight and since the control caterpillars, on average were smaller, they were beginning to pupate. 


Introduction:
The development of the Manduca Sexta larvae is governed by two specific hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). In order for larvae to become fully developed adults, they must go through five instar stages and the pupa stage, which occurs right before adulthood. To enter into a new stage, the larvae must molt. The Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molt the larvae will undergo while Ecdysterone regulates the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2018]. JH is usually present during larval life to allow growth of the larvae and the progression from one larval stage to the next until the larvae can pupate [Riddiford: 2003]. Therefore, JH and 20E work together during the larvae's development. The absolute concentrations of the two hormones, the concentration ratio of the two hormones and the insect's specific developmental stage determine the effects of the two hormones [Johnson: 2018]. 

In regard to Juvenile Hormone, levels stay fairly high until the 5th instar stage. Near the end of the 4th instar stage, JH begins to drop and when JH begins to drop there is a large increase in 20E [Johnson: 2018]. During the 5th instar stage, JH levels drop very low, and there is a small rise in 20E which is when the commitment pulse occurs [Johnson: 2018]. The commitment pulse occurs when the larvae is large enough and has stored enough nutrients to pupate and eventually become an adult [Johnson: 2018]. During pupation and adulthood, JH levels are very low while 20E levels are very high. 

Since JH levels are very low during the 5th instar stage and during pupation, will increasing levels of JH inhibit pupation? Our hypothesis states that increasing levels of JH in 4th and 5th stage larvae, will cause the larvae to be unable to pupate and become an adult. We predict the larvae will stay in the 5th instar stage until death. 


Materials and Methods:
There were eight larvae that must be divided into two equal groups: the control group and the treatment group. Each larva in the control group received 10g of food with 10 drops of water. Each larva in the treatment group received 10g of food with 10 drops of Precor (the JH agonist). All eight of the larvae were fed every other day but weighed and measured each day and the data was recorded. 

All of the larvae were stored in containers in an incubator. The containers were divided with index cards. The four control caterpillars were stored in two of the containers divided by an index card while the four treatment caterpillars were stored in the other two containers divided by an index card.


Results:
Figure 1 suggests that on average, the treatment caterpillars gained more weight than the control caterpillars. The average weight gain on the treatment caterpillars is 11.13 ± 0.69g while the average weight gain of the control caterpillars is 10.37 ± 2.82g. The mean weight gain of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment group (t-stat = 0.52, df = 6, P = 0.61). Similarly, the treatment caterpillars grew longer than the control caterpillars, but the average length increase of the control Manduca sexta caterpillars and the average length increase of the treatment caterpillars were very similar (t-stat = 0.53, df = 6, P = 0.62). 

Discussion:
According to our data, on average, the treatment caterpillars gained more weight over the course of 8 days and grew longer than the control caterpillars. Right before caterpillars pupate, they lose weight and that could be why our treatment caterpillars gained more weight than the control caterpillars on average. Animal 1 and animal 2 seemed to be in the beginning stages of pupation. They were turning yellow and lost weight towards the end of the week. Since they were about to pupate they were about to become adults. This supports our hypothesis because none of the treatment caterpillars appeared to be in the beginning stages of pupation. According to the statistics, the mean weight gain and length increase of the control group were not statistically significantly different than the mean weight gain and length increase of the treatment group. This means that it is likely the results occurred by chance as opposed to the treatment having an effect on the larvae. 

According to other studies, larvae pupation was affected when a JH agonist was given in very high concentrations (concentrations that are greater than 1ppm) [Riddiford 1991]. According to this study, if we had given the treatment larvae a higher concentration of the Precor, we may have obtained different results. We only treated the larvae with 1% of Precor because we gave them 10 drops per 10 grams of food. 

In conclusion, we support our hypothesis because our treatment caterpillars did not show any signs of pupation, but we could have given our treatment caterpillars a higher concentration of JH agonist and we would have been able to see if they died or remained in the 5th instar stage.
