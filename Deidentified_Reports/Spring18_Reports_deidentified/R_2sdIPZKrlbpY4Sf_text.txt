Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on Rana pipiens Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius muscle

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to see the effects of lidocaine, a known sodium channel blocker, and its effects on the minimal threshold amplitude of the Rana pipien legs. The legs were dissected to isolate the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle. The muscle was injected with 0.1mL of Lidocaine , and then stimulated with electric pulses and observed visually. Three Rana pipien legs were used in this experiment. From the results collected, there was a significant difference between the threshold amplitude of the legs untreated with lidocaine (control group) and the legs treated with lidocaine (treatment group). After a paired t-test, the P-value was 0.019, meaning there was a significant difference between the treated and untreated legs. The treated legs had higher amplitude threshold than the untreated. 



Introduction:
Invertebrates and vertebrates rely on the neuromuscular system for rapid intracellular communication. To properly comprehend the overall effects of these observations, it must be noted that skeletal muscles are composed of hundreds to thousands of myofibers, which are a cylinder-shaped, multinucleated, and fused cell. Myofibers are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups. Nerve impulses reach the neuromuscular junction causing acetylcholine(ACh) to be released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. The action potential travels down the muscle fiber causing Ca2+ to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, an internal storage unit site. [Johnson:2018] The release of calcium ions causes for muscle fibers to contract, causing the muscle fibers to shorten. [Johnson:2018] Rana pipiens were used due to them being relatively easy to prepare for dissection. The muscle will be injected with a known sodium channel blocker, Lidocaine, typically causing muscle paralysis.  In a previous experiment that observed the interactions of Lidocaine and calcium by Saito et al, it was recognized that a significant portion, about 60% of sodium channels are opened in a resting state but when lidocaine is injected into the muscle, the number of sodium channels decrease. [Saito et al 1984] Due to this occurrence, the lack of sodium channels opening when injected with lidocaine inhibits the release of an action potential which is necessary for calcium ions to be released for there to be a muscle contraction. We wanted to see the effects of Lidocaine on the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle minimal threshold twitch, which is the least amount of voltage needed to see a visible twitch like the movement of the muscle and electromyogram, a visual representation of muscle contraction. More energy will be needed to reach a minimal twitch threshold amplitude after being injected with lidocaine, due to it blocking sodium channels, which are necessary for an action potential to travel down the muscle fiber. If action potentials are limited then there will be no releasing of Ca2+ ions, which activate the contractile mechanism of the leg. So, the volts input will increase after lidocaine is injected due to the muscle not being able to contract. This experiment will be conducted by using three Rana pipien legs, connecting them to the stimulating device that releases electrical currents. As a group, we infer that the minimum threshold amplitude of the Rana pipiens will increase in voltage after the lidocaine is injected.

Materials and Methods:
While wearing vinyl gloves, three Rana pipien legs were collected and placed on a dissecting pan. The skin was removed by pulling from the top of the leg and pulling down towards the foot. The frog was then placed on the dissecting pan and moistened with Ringer’s solution. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle was cut close to the Achilles tendon with a pair of forceps.  A thread was tied to the recently cut muscle and hung from a force transducer. After this it was kept in Ringer’s fluid to avoid dryness of the leg. The sciatic nerve was then exposed after cutting minimally into the upper thigh of the Rana pipien. The muscle is then pinned down in a tent-like fashion on the dissecting tray. Pinning the sciatic nerve is to be avoided to not damage the nerve. The muscle that was tied onto the hanging device is to be adjust to a 90-degree angle with the rest of the leg is pinned down on the tray. The device that releases electrical impulses, IWX/2, its forceps will be places underneath the sciatic nerve. The device was then connected to a laptop and to the iWorx program. The stimulus amplitude was then increased. There was an increase and decrease in pulse amplitude to see where the minimum amplitude where there was a visible twitch and on the electromyogram. Then 0.1 mL of lidocaine was injected into the muscle of the Rana pipiens. Eight minutes elapsed before the muscle was stimulated again. The same procedure was repeated as before. Each leg went through this process to determine the minimum amplitude threshold. To calculate our statistical data, we used a paired t-test. 

Results:
After the Rana pipiens legs were treated with lidocaine, there was a significant difference between the threshold amplitudes, P-value was 0.019, which is lower than the 95% confidence interval. (P=0.05 or less). There were drastic differences in the means of the control and treatment group. The control group without lidocaine mean was 0.0803V±0.005. The treatment group with lidocaine mean was 0.250±0.037. The degrees of freedom were 3 from the data collected. The paired t-test= 3.26. 

Discussion:
We accept our hypothesis, the Rana pipien legs that were treated with Lidocaine, increasingly need higher frequency amplitudes to observe a visible twitch. Lidocaine is a known sodium blocker, and from a previous experiment by Wang et al, it was recognized that lidocaine is more repressive, meaning that it blocks more sodium channels making it more difficult to contract than purer forms of sodium blocker such as TTX and A-803467. [Wang et al:2015] They studied lidocaine and the two other regional anesthetics to see which one blocked the most nerves. In their discussion, they mentioned that lidocaine might also inhibit potassium and calcium channels from functioning too, causing it to be more effective anesthetic. When sodium channels are blocked action potentials are not generated, therefore leading calcium ions not to be released. Calcium ions are responsible for triggering muscle contraction.  It should be also noted that it to significantly more energy to cause the treated Rana pipiens legs to twitch. Due to muscles relying on action potentials to trigger Ca2+ ions to be released to cause muscle contraction, it was inevitable that lidocaine would not have affected the twitch amplitude of the treated Rana pipien legs. [Johnson:2018]. This experiment helps us understand the how muscle contraction works in another species for us, as students, to understand muscle contraction in humans.
