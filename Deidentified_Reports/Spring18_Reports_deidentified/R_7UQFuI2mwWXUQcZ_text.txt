Title: Pisum sativum Exposed to Increased Salinity Display No Significant Change in Root: Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
Resource allocation plays an important role in plant survival and fitness. We decided to investigate how higher levels of salinity affect the root: shoot ratios of Pisum sativum, or field peas, and hypothesized that exposure to greater salinity would result in different root: shoot ratios. Two control groups received 100 mL of pH 7 water every day, while two treatment groups received 100 mL of 1.3 g/L salt water every day, with all other variables kept constant. Two weeks later, we calculated the root: shoot ratios for mass and length for four replicates from each group. We analyzed our results using a two-tailed-two-sample t-test. In regard to both the mass and the length ratios, there was no statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups. However, salt stress has been shown to negatively impact overall plant growth, which may become an increasingly pressing issue as sea levels continue to rise.

Introduction:
Plants allocate resources differently depending on what is available in their environments; their ability to do so affects their survival and fitness. Plants must interact with abiotic and biotic factors to obtain sunlight, nitrogen, and water [Johnson: 2018]. The availability of vital resources like these impacts the root: shoot ratio of plants [Johnson 2018]. We decided to determine how salinity affects the root: shoot ratio of field peas and believe that plants will allocate their resources differently when exposed to higher levels of salinity, thereby resulting in different root: shoot ratios. Pisum sativum was a good model organism for this experiment, because they grow quickly in artificial settings. In a similar study on three bean cultivars, increased salinity inhibited cell division and enlargement in the growing point, which decreased plant growth overall [Kaymakahova: 2009]. This information is important and relevant in agriculture. It may influence farmers who live near oceans and other high-salinity environments in the way that they choose to plant their crops in order to achieve the highest possible levels of success.

Materials and Methods:
We tested our biological hypothesis on field peas. There were two treatment groups and two control groups. The two control groups both received 100 mL of pH 7 water every day. The two treatment groups both received 100 mL of 1.3 g/L salt water every day. All other variables were kept constant. After two weeks, we separated out 4 replicates from the control group and 4 from the experimental group. Each replicate was one plant. We weighed each replicate in grams, separated the roots from the shoots, and then weighed root and shoot mass separately in grams. We measured root and shoot lengths for each replicate in centimeters, as well. We then used these measurements to calculate root: shoot ratios for mass and length. The statistical test we used to analyze our results was a two-tailed-two-sample t-test. The categorical variable we tested was salt water versus no salt water, and the numerical variable we tested was the root: shoot ratios of the plants.

Results:
We did not observe any immediate differences in appearance between the control and experimental groups. For root: shoot mass ratios, the mean for the control group was 0.72 ± 0.05, and the mean for the experimental group was 0.49 ± 0.11. For root: shoot length ratios, the mean for the control group was 0.72 ± 0.10, and the mean for the experimental group was 0.75 ± 0.15. We used a two-tailed-two-sample t-test to test for differences between the two groups. As shown in Figure 1, there was neither a statistically significant difference between the means of the two groups in regard to root: shoot mass ratios (t-stat = 0.81, df = 6, p = 0.448), nor in regard to root: shoot length ratios (t-stat = 0.36, df = 6, p = 0.730). Therefore, root: shoot ratios were not affected by increased salinity in this case. 

Discussion:
We hypothesized that the pea plants would allocate their resources differently when exposed to higher levels of salinity, which would result in different root: shoot ratios. However, our hypothesis was not supported by the data. The relevant biological mechanism in this case is salt stress. Increased salinity levels have been shown to reduce cell division and expansion in plants [Carillo: 2011]. This means that growth would have been inhibited in both the roots and shoots of the plants, resulting in very little change in root: shoot ratios between the control and experimental groups. In order for the ratios to change, either the roots or shoots would have needed to change drastically, but because both were restricted by salt stress, the ratios did not change significantly. In the future, we could repeat this procedure to verify our results. In addition, if we decided to complete a new version of this experiment, it would be intriguing to test how varying salt concentrations impact plant resource allocation and growth using multiple experimental groups. Overall, as sea levels continue to rise, it will become increasingly important that farmers take salt stress into account when planting their crops, because although salinity does not cause a statistically significant change in root: shoot ratios, it does reduce productivity and yield [Carillo: 2011].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Effect of increased salinity on the root: shoot ratios of pea plants. The control groups both received 100 mL of pH 7 water every day. The two treatment groups both received 100 mL of 1.3 g/L salt water every day. Root: shoot ratios were calculated for mass and length after two weeks. Each bar represents the mean root: shoot ratio of 4 replicates; error bars represent two standard deviations of the mean.
