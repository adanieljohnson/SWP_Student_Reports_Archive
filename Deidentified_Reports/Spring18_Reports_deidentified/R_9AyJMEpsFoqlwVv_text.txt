Title: Effects of Precor on Developing Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
By injecting the Manduca sexta caterpillar with Precor, a substance mimicking juvenile hormone, we tested whether Precor would prevent Manduca sexta from molting. Using eight caterpillars, half treatment, and half controll, we hypothesized that those that were fed Precor would not molt and therefore Precor would serve as a valid insecticide in the modern world. Unfortunately, due to some unforeseen experimental errors, like the caterpillars crossing borders, we were not able to accurately measure the growth of the Manduca sexta, and the controll group never reached growth for molting because it was not fed daily food. Because we were not able to gather accurate data, the experiment provided no conclusive result as to whether Precor prevents molting.    

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar, commonly called the tobacco hornworm, has an egg, larva, pupa, pre-pupa and adult stage. It lives for thirty to fifty days [Berkley: 2016]. The larva is large; therefore, it functions as a model organism often used by neurobiologists. One could measure changes in Manduca sexta by feeding it certain foods that mimick the effect of hormones under a controllled condition. Juvenile Hormone (JH), secreted through Corpus Allata, regulates the type of molt [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysterone, 20E (20-hydroxyecdysterone), is a hormone secreted through the Prothoracic Gland which regulates timing of molting within an insect (Johnson, 2018). Through a controllled and treatment group, the effects of JH and 20E on Manduca sexta caterpillars can be monitored and recorded with the independent variable consisting of the Precor and dependent variable: the weight. We decided to study the effect of Precor, which mimics JH, and monitor the results to see if it can be used in the modern agricultural world.  We monitored the effect of JH on the caterpillars and hypothesized that if we feed Manduca sexta caterpillars food containing JH in their current larva stage, then the caterpillars will not reach their pupa stage (or molt at all), because they won't be able to form a cuticle. 

Materials and Method:
Eight instar caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups, treatment, and controll. They were then placed in their own living space, half a tub. A flash card served as a divider separating the tubs, one side labeled “controll” and the “treatment.” The treatment groups were fed 10g of Manduca sexta food with four drops of Precor each day for seven days, mimicking the effects of JH. The controll group was fed Manduca Sexta food with no Precor supplement. Based on a scheduled rotation, a different lab partner measured the weight of the caterpillars in grams each day for 7 days. Each day, the weight was measured roughly at the same hour (+/- one hour.) A simple t_test compared the results of the caterpillars fed Precor (treatment) to those fed with normal food (controll). Using the t_test containing the weight values of Maduca sexta, we were able to obtain a standard deviation and mean for both the controll and treatment groups. We accurately represented our data through a graph displaying the mean of the difference in Manduca growth from day one to day seven. This therefore does not analyze individual caterpillars, but the average of the treatment and controll caterpillars as a whole. 


Materials
-	Four round, plastic containers for the Manduca sexta homes 
-	Four perforated lids
-	Index cards and tape (for dividing the round containers)
-	Food (in fridge)
-	Spoon
-	Square container
-	Balance
-	Transfer pipes
-	Reagent (Precor)


Results:
   As depicted by figure 2, the controll group grew slightly larger than the treatment group with a mean of 4.4g instead of 3.2g. There is no general trend between controll and treatment with relatively equal means. Both P values given in the t-Test (figure 3) include 0.108138 and 0.216275; since both are higher than 0.05, they imply no statistical significance, with a ten and twenty percent chance of the experiment being due to random chance. The standard deviations from figure 1, 0.93 for controll and 1.21 for treatment, also serve to the conclusion that there is no general trend.


Discussion:
Both the controll and treatment caterpillars grew exponentially from an average growth of about 4.4g in the controll group and 3.2 in the treatment group (figure 1), regardless of their food. The original hypothesis was not supported since the controll caterpillars, the ones that were not fed Precor, never molted, and the difference in growth according to figure 2 was minimal (1.2g). The Maduca sexta experienced ample time to molt (7 days) and having been given no added 20E or JH, should have molted [Riddiford: 2003]. They instead weighed slightly more than the treatment as depicted by figure 1 but not enough the reach the molting stage [Beetz, 2008]. We know that the original hypothesis was not supported also because of the P values in the test consisting of 0.11 and 0.21. These both are too high and therefore imply no statistical significance, with and eighty and ninety percent chance of the experiment being due to random chance. The original experimental plan consisted of daily feeding of both controll and treatment groups; however, due to class confusion, the Manduca sexta caterpillars were not fed each day—a key error in the experiment. The outcome supports the null hypothesis, indicating no molting of the controll group. Another error in our experiment consists of the larva crossing the flashcard barrier; therefore; there could potentially have been a miscalculation in the weight. No molting occurred anyway, so this was not so significent of a difference. Despite the lack of consistency and technical errors ultimately leading to an invalid experiment, one can understand that juvenile hormone, which regulates the type of molt, can be applied to worldly examples, such as insecticides. This would prevent the spread of unwanted insects by forcing them to molt at an earlier stage in life.
