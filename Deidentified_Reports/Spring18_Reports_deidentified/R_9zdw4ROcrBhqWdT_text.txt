Title: The Effects of Azamax on 20E Hormone in Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
Ecdysone (20E) is the main hormone involved in the regulation of the time of molting for insects such as Manduca sexta, an insect that feeds on foliage in its pupal phases. Insecticides such as Azamax have been utilized to stifle insect activity and growth.  Containing 1.2% of Azadirachtin, an antifeedant and insect growth regulator (IRG)-- Azamax controls pests such as Manduca sexta through growth disruption and starvation.   If Manduca sexta is exposed to Azamax, then the growth and development of the insect would be inhibited. Through our experiment using a control group and an Azamax treated group, we noted each of the caterpillars weights everyday for a week.  While all of the caterpillars looked and weighed relatively the same at the beginning of the week, their final weight and activity levels were very different.  The weight of the control group nearly tripled that of the treated group, with an average weight of  8.33g +/- .71 for the control group, and 1.16g +/- .92 for the Azamax treated group, ultimately supporting our hypothesis that Azamax would block 20E, inhibiting the treated group’s growth and development into its pupal phase.  


Introduction:
Insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and emergence of adults are controlled mainly by the hormones Ecdysone (20E) and the Juvenile Hormone (JH).  20E and JH are steroid hormones secreted by prothoracic glands and regulate timing of molting and control additional functions in adult insects.  JH regulates the type of molt, whereas 20E regulates the timing of molting.  Insects need both of these hormones in order to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca sexta, a type of moth that passes through 5 larval stages and a pupa phase before becoming an adult.  Commonly viewed as a pest, it would be beneficial to determine what stifles their growth and activity.  It is important to understand and regulate their growth patterns and factors that could possibly inhibit their growth and transition into adulthood [Johnson: 2018].  Azadirachtin is a chemical that has been used in the past as it exhibits bactericidal, fungicidal, and insecticidal properties, including insect growth and regulating qualities.  It is structurally similar to insect hormones “ecdysone,” thus interfering with the with the synthesis of the insect molting hormone [Khater: 2012].  These biopesticides have been shown to help prevent the discarding of thousands of pesticides and will provide a safe environment for surrounding wildlife [Khater: 2012].  Azamax is a natural insecticide that contains 1.2% of Azadirachtin, controlling pests through starvation and growth disruption.  Similar to Azamax, protease inhibitor is a substance that breaks down protease, thereby inhibiting the replication and growth of certain cells that are key to insect development [Thomas: 1995].  In an experiment similar to our own, it was discovered that through the use of protease inhibitor, the insects growth and development ceased, prompting physical activity to decline and ultimately decreased the amount of plant damage caused by these pests [Thomas: 1995]. This knowledge leads us to our hypothesis that if the Manduca sexta is exposed to Azamax, then 20E will be inhibited and growth and development of the insect would be inhibited because the Azadirachtin would block 20E and prolong the time of molting. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, we gathered 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars in the 4th instar larvae stage and divided them into 2 groups: our control and our treatment groups.  We placed each caterpillar in a clear plastic container and provided each group with a different diet.  For the control group, we gave each of the four caterpillars 10g of food and mixed in 7 drops of distilled water with a concentration of .041 mL per drop. For the treatment group, we gave each of the four caterpillars 10g of food mixed with 7 drops of Azamax with a concentration of .041 mL per drop.  After putting each caterpillar in its allotted container and giving it its specified food, we put them in the incubator.   We then came in every evening for 7 days to record the weight of each of the caterpillars.  We also used a two-sample t-test.  


Results:
At the beginning of the week, all of the caterpillars looked relatively the same in regards to their shape and size.  However, as the week progressed, the control group grew and developed at a much faster rate compared to that of the treated group.  The weights of the control group nearly doubled between days 5 and 6, continuing to grow and increase in activity, moving around and climbing the container during this period.  The treated group, however, maintained almost their original size and exhibited little activity and movement as the week progressed.  The total change in weight for the treated group averaged 1.16g with a standard deviation of 0.92, compared to the controlled group with a total change in weight averaging at 8.33g and a standard deviation of 0.71.    


Discussion:
This experiment supported my hypothesis that when exposed to Azamax, the growth and development of Manduca sexta will be inhibited. Azamax serves as a blocking element to Ecdysone, the hormone that regulates the timing of molting, which proves to be very critical to the development of the insect.  The blocking of 20E does not allow the caterpillar to develop properly, ultimately affecting its transition into adulthood.  Insects need both JH and 20E, and if either of these hormones were to eliminated, the insect would die.  If given a larger dosage of Azamax, it is reasonable to conclude that the insect would die due to the absence of 20E, but future tests would be necessary in proving this assumption.  Insecticides such as Azamax are important to note as Manduca sexta and a variety of other insects cause feeding damage on a wide variety of crops.  Scientists have done a variety of similar experiments in hopes of discovering an effective method of protecting plants against pests [Thomas: 1995].  Similar to an experiment done with protease inhibitor in plants, we noticed a decrease in activity in the insects that had been introduced to an insecticide [Thomas: 1995].  Protease inhibitor is a substance that breaks down protease, thereby inhibiting the replication and growth of certain cells that are key to insect development [Thomas: 1995].  Similar to Azamax, protease inhibitor reduced the developmental rate of insects, decreasing physical activity and productivity [Thomas: 1995].  It has been commonly seen that with the over-expression of an insecticide such as protease inhibitor or Amazax, the overall amount of plant damage may decrease [Thomas: 1995].  While it is better to have Manduca sexta in its adult phase rather one in its pupal phase, it ultimately would be beneficial to have them terminated [Thomas: 1995].  It is critical that pests such as Manduca sexta are monitored, as their feeding habits ruin crops and plants in their pupal phases.

The p-value is <.00001, the two groups are statistically different from one another. n=4.  The change in weight of the control group is almost triple the change in weight of the Azamax treated group.  The average of the Treated group is 1.16g +/- 0.92,and the average of the control group is 8.33g +/- 0.71.
