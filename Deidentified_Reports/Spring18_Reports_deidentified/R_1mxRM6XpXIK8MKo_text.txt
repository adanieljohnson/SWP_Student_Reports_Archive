Title: Light has no effect on the Root Shoot ratio of the Pisum sativum plants

Abstract:
Plants require essential elements in order to grow and be healthy. When plants are not getting the essentials, they can allocate their resources to either make their shoots longer or roots longer in order to get the essentials.  The health of a plant can be determined by the root to shoot ratio. A higher ratio means that the plants has to allocate their resources to its roots in order to gain nutrients. While a lower number means the plant allocates it resources to the shoots. This experiment focused on the root shoot ratio of the Pisum sativum plants in two different lights. Three pots were placed in a greenhouse and the three other pots were placed under a covering in a greenhouse. It was predicted that the plants grown under the covering would have a lower root shoot ratio due to needing to allocate their resources to the shoots in order to compensate for the light it is not receiving.  The plants grew for two weeks and the roots and shoots were measured and calculated. An unpaired T-test was run. The data did not support the initial hypothesis. There was not a  significant difference in the root to shoot ratios of the plants grown in the light compared to the plants grew in the dark.


Introduction:
Plants are living organisms that need essential elements in order to grow. Plants need water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and nutrients to grow. If a plant does not get one of these essential needs, the plant will allocate resources in order to ensure they can perform photosynthesis. The root shoot ratio of a plant can be used to tell if the plant is healthy and where it is allocating its resources to. The goal of this lab is to see how the root shoot ratio differs in Pisum sativum grown in open light and Pisum sativum grown under a covering to block some light.  One of the essential needs of a plant is sunlight which is crucial for photosynthesis in plants. Plants use light in photosynthesis to synthesize food for the plant. According to Berendse shading of plants causes the plant to allocate its resources to the stem and leaves[Berendse:2008]. Plants will also allocate their resources to the shoots in order to obtain carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.  Plants in reduced light will not allocate their resources to the root biomass as there is limited light a plant can get below ground[Mcconnaughay:1999]. When a plant have to allocate their resources to the shoots it causes the root:shoot ratio to be smaller since shoots is in the denominator of the ratio.   It is hypothesized that the plants grown under the covering will have a lower root shoot ratio because the plant needs to allocate its’ resources to the leaves and stem of the plant so it can get as much light as possible in order to do photosynthesis.


Materials and Methods:
Pisum sativum seeds were planted and were allowed to grow for two weeks in vermiculite soil with 1X Miracle Grow. Three pots of the planted Pisum sativum seeds were grown in open light in the greenhouse. While three pots were grown under a shade in the same greenhouse.  The Pisum sativum plants were watered every other day. After the two-week growth period, the plants were taken out of the vermiculite. The roots and the shoots were separated. Five roots and shoots were chosen at random. The roots were then measured in millimeters. The same was done with the shoots. The root shoot ratio was calculated and a two-sample T-test was ran, with an alpha value of 0.05

Results:
The root shoot ratio was higher for the plants grown in light but after a two sample T-test was ran it was determined that the data was not significant ( figure 1).  The mean for the root shoot ratio grown in light was 0.7759721373 with a standard deviation of 0.1404707835 and the mean of the plants that were grown under a covering was 0.6366400304 with a standard deviation of 0.09407561174. The T-test showed that the data was not significant, t=1.438024,df=4, and P= 0.223809, as the P value obtained  is higher than 0.05.  


Discussion:
Since the data was not significant, the data did not support the hypothesis. With a P-value at 0.223809 it is not close to the ideal P-value of 0.05. This does not support that plants allocate their resources to their shoots when light is reduced.  According to Ericksson, light has not effect on the root shoot ratio[Ericsson:1995]. ven though leaves are part of the root shoot ratio it does not add enough to the root shoot ratio in order to make the ratio smaller and support the initial hypothesis. This  makes sense why the data was not significant and did not support the initial hypothesis.  Also according to Yokawa, roots have light receptors that affects their growth [Yokawa:2012].  If roots can grow with minimal light, it makes sense that the root shoot ratio was not significantly different. For the future, one set of plants can be grown in total darkness to get rid of any light that can reach the root’s light receptors.
