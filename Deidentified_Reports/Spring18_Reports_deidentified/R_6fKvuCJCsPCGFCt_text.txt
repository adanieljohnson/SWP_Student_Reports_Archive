Title: The Effect of Increased Juvenile Hormone on the Structural Development of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) and its development into an adult moth is regulated by two hormones: ecdysterone and juvenile hormone (JH). JH regulates the type of molt the insect sheds after each stage of their five instar larval phases, and low JH during the fifth instar larval phase indicates the caterpillar is large enough to enter the pupa phase and become an adult moth. It was hypothesized that increased JH would decrease the growth of the caterpillar in the 4th instar larva by weight and length. This experiment utilized the Martin’s insect growth regulator (IGR), which is an artificial form of JH. There was a controll group and a treatment group; each group of caterpillars received food every other day, yet the treatment group’s food was induced with Martin’s IGR, while that of the controll group was mixed with water. The results indicated that during this larva instar, there is no significent difference between the growth of caterpillars and IGR-induced caterpillars, except with respect to their coloration and presence of black pigmentation on the cuticle. Therefore, Martin’s IGR inhibits the black pigmentation of the cuticle and causes the caterpillar to discolor into a pale blue-green, which indicates that IGR has morphogenetic effects with respect to pigmentation.

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta), part of the family Sphingidae, is a pest of many plants and crops, especially tobacco plants, hence the name of the organism [Byron: 2017]. The life cycle of the Manduca sexta includes five instar larval stages and one pupa stage—an immature form of an insect in between larva and adult stage—after metamorphosis: the transition from a worm-like larval stage to the pupa stage [Johnson: 2018]. The instar larval growth and metamorphosis are regulated by two hormones: the juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysterone, a steroid hormone, is released from the prothoracic glands and regulates the timing of the molt of the insect [Johnson: 2018]. The juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allata and regulates the type of molt that the insect sheds during the larval instar stages [Johnson: 2018]. Five instar larval phases are needed in order for the insect to continue to molt when the exoskeleton is not large enough for the developing caterpillar [Johnson: 2018]. In the 5th instar larval stage, the juvenile hormone is not emitted with little ecdysterone in order to signal the commitment pulse, which indicates that the caterpillar is developed enough physically to produce a normal sized moth and therefore enter the pupa phase [Johnson: 2018]. Since the hormones, especially JH, dictate the growth and molting of the caterpillar, alterations in these hormones in the Manduca sexta may affect development. 
	This experiment investigates the effects of insect growth regulators (IGRs) on larval development of Manduca sexta. The IGR used is Martin’s IGR, which is an artificial form of the juvenile hormone that inhibits the advancement of larvae to the adult stage and often used in insecticides. It is known that there is a period of sensitivity to JH in Manduca sexta, therefore if the hormone is introduced over a longer period of time, it is more effective in its inhibition because it can be metabolized more slowly [Riddiford 1972]. Martin’s IGR is introduced through food in the experiment, since the food is constantly being eaten in order to increase the effectiveness of the inhibition of growth and development. Therefore, it is hypothesized that increased JH—Martin’s IGR—during the 4th larval instar will cause a decrease in the growth of the larvae Manduca sexta by both length and weight. 

Materials and Method:
Firstly, eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were provided for the experiment. There were two groups with four caterpillars each: a controll group and a treatment group. Four plastic containers—holding only the caterpillars and their food—were used to create a habitat for the caterpillars; there were two caterpillars in each container which was divided by a notecard that labeled each caterpillar by number and controll or treatment association. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator at room temperature of 25˚C for seven days. Every caterpillar received 10 grams of Manduca sexta food, which was provided for the experiment, every other day. Therefore, the caterpillars received food four times. Martin’s IGR was introduced into the food of only the four caterpillars in the treatment group, and 6 drops of the IGR were mixed into the 10 grams of food each time. The controll group received 6 drops of water in their food each time fed in order to parallel the moisture of the food that the treatment group received with the liquid IGR. Each day, each individual caterpillar was measured for length (cm) and weight (g), the percent of the food that was eaten was estimated by comparison between all the caterpillars food quantities, and the coloration for each insect was recorded. A Two-sample t_test—a statistical test that compares the means of the controll group and the experimental group—was then used for each component measured (length and mass) in order to evaluate the effect of the IGR on the development of the Manduca sexta from day 0 to day 7. 

Results:
Overall, the length and mass gained over 7 days of the treatment group was only marginally different than that of the controll group (Figure 1, 2). With respect to the P-values of the differences in both length and mass of the caterpillars from day 0 and day 7, P = 0.72 and P = 0.23 respectively, there is no significance in the data (Figure 1, 2). The controllled and treated caterpillars both grew at a rate very similar to each other with respect to mass and length, and both groups continuously ate the same portion of their food—this percentage never differed by more than 13%, which was on day 2 (Table 1). Therefore, there were no structural, developmental measurements recorded that drastically differed between the controll and treatment groups. However, there was a different coloration on day 4 in the IGR-treated caterpillars compared to the controllled caterpillars: the caterpillars no longer possessed the brighter blue-green pigment (Table 1). In addition, on day 7 the IGR-treated caterpillars do not possess the black pigmentation on their cuticle, yet every one of the controllled caterpillars exhibit the black pigments down the length of their insect body (Figure 3). 

Discussion:
The insignificance of the measurements of length and mass between the controll group and the IGR-induced group, which was identified in the p_values calculated from the data in Figures 1 and 2, indicates that the hypothesis was not supported with respect to the data indicating that Martin’s IGR does not inhibit the structural development of the Manduca sexta during the 4th instar larval stage. However, the presence of the black pigmentation on the cuticle of solely the controll group indicates that the IGR has an effect on the coloration of the larvae. A previous study showed that JH does inhibit the black pigmentation of the larvae cuticle and effects the pigmentation of the larva—becoming a more gray-green color, specified as a pale-blue in Table 1, than the brighter blue-green color—which indicates that JH has morphogenetic effects [Truman: 1972]. Therefore, the results in this experiment are supported in that Martin’s IGR, an artificial form of the juvenile hormone, alters the metamorphosis or development of the larva through inhibiting the cuticle melanization, which is a process that occurs during the “critical period of the molting cycle” of the larva stages [Truman: 1972].
However, JH can restrict the physical growth and development of the Manduca sexta as well, according to other experiments, though it is not proven in this specific experiment. Manduca sexta are sensitive to JH—meaning the organism is more easily affected by growth inhibitors—for a certain window during their lifecycle at the onset of adult development, which occurs directly before the pupal stage [Riddiford 1972]. This window must be during the commitment pulse of the 5th larval stage, when levels of JH are low and the organism is ready to pupate. The organisms used in the experiment were in their 4th instar larva phase, approximately a 4 day stage, on day 0, and the 5th instar larva phase is 5 days; therefore, by day 7 the caterpillars were only 3 days into the 5th instar larva stage and may had not reached the time of the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, based on the age of larva, the data does not showcase this true structural inhibition of growth by increased JH, because the larva were not in their most sensitive window to the hormone. 
	If the experiment were to be reproduced, the caterpillars would need to start closer to the beginning of their 5th instar phase, because very near the commitment pulse is when the organism is most sensitive to the JH [Riddiford 1972]. In addition, in order to see a greater effect of Martin’s IGR on development, the organisms could be served food induced with the hormone every day in larger doses, so that the organisms come into contact with the hormone more consistently [Riddiford 1972]. 
	Overall, Martin’s IGR does cause a discoloration in the larva of the Manduca sexta. Therefore, a next step for another experiment would be to investigate how this discoloration induced by JH occurs.

Table 1. Daily Growth Measurements and Observations of the Manduca sexta Taken Over 7 Day Period
Figure 1: Manduca sexta difference in length from day 0 to day 7 is shown for both the controll group and the treatment group. The mean of the controll group (3.42 ± 0.434) was not statistically significently different than that of the treatment group (3.31 ± 0.375)  [two-sample t_test: t_stat = 0.37, d.f. = 6, P = 0.72].  Error bars represent ± one standard deviation.
Figure 2: Manduca sexta difference in mass from day 0 to day 7 is shown for the controll group and the treatment group. Since the P-value is greater than 0.05, the mean of the controll group (7.90 ± 0.956) was not statistically significently different than that of the treatment group (7.08 ± 0.796) [two-sample t_test: t_stat = 1.33, d.f. = 6, P = 0.23]. Error bars represent ± one standard deviation.
Figure 3: The controll group and the treatment group are pictured in the photograph, taken on day 7, on the left and right side, respectively. The four treated caterpillars are a lighter, paler blue compared to the bright blue-green of the controll group. The black pigmentation of the cuticle—the little black lines down the length of the larval body—is only present on the controll caterpillars.
