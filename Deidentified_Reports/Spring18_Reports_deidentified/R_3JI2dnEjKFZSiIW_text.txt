Title: Calcium Channel Blocker has little Effect on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The nervous system sends electron signals to muscles and results in muscle contraction. Calcium ions are important in this process as they bind to vesicle and release acetylcholine (ACh) and bind to troponin and expose myosin binding sites on actin filaments. In this experiment, we want to know how the absence of calcium ion would result in a neuron-muscle interaction. We blocked calcium channels in Rania Pipiens Gastrocnemius muscles with lanthanum chloride solution. We compared the minimum amplitude to the threshold before and after the injection of calcium channel blocker. Our hypothesis is that if the calcium channel is blocked, the twitch threshold would be significently higher. We ran a paired t_test to find out if a significent difference exists. The p_value is 0.7743, which is greater than 0.05, indicating there is no significent difference. Thus, our hypothesis is not supported. The red leg syndrome in the subject pool and chemical feature of lanthanum chloride might lead to this result. In the future, we would repeat this experiment in a healthy subject population with other kinds of calcium blockers at different concentration levels. 

Introduction:
Rania Pipien is a kind of northern leopard frog. In this experiment, we used Gastrocnemius muscle from Rania Pipien to study the function of Calcium in muscle nerve system. This study can help understanding the roles of different chemicals play in animal neuron system. Nerve system encodes, process and store information from the internal and external environment of organisms.  In the interaction between neuron and muscle, the afferent nervous system carries information to the central nervous system and the brain whereas the efferent nervous system sends information from Central Nervous System to muscles to process movement. Neurons transmit information through electron signals [Sadava: 2017]. A sodium-potassium pump locates in the membrane keeps the membrane potential negative at resting membrane potential. When there is a signal, the voltage-gated sodium channel would open and depolarize the cell membrane. If the voltage of cell membrane reaches a threshold, and action potential would be carried out by the opening of additional voltage-gated sodium channel. Action potential travels along axons and arrives at neuromuscular junction, a synapse between neurons and skeletal muscle cells [Sadava: 2017]. The depolarization of cell membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channel to open and allows calcium ions to enter and attach to vesicles. Vesicles fuse with presynaptic membrane and release acetylcholine (ACh). ACh molecules bind to receptors on postsynaptic membrane and open sodium channels to depolarize the membrane and transmit action potential. Action potential travels down t-tubules and causes change in conformation of DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor, releasing calcium ions stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions bind to troponin and expose myosin binding sites on actin filaments. The muscle thus contracts [Sadava: 2017]. In this process, calcium ions are involved in two key parts, the release of ACh and the and exposure of myosin binding sites. In this experiment, we want to explore calcium's role in neuron-muscle interaction. We wander the how the absence of calcium ions would affect the firing of neural signals and the muscle movement. We used gastrocnemus muscles and sciatic nerves from frog legs to study this process. Lanthanum chloride can alter intracellular calcium concentration [Yang: 2013]. The lanthanide ions block calcium ion-permeable​ channels [Halaszovich: 2000].Thus, we are going to use Lanthanum chloride as calcium channel blocker in this experiment. Our hypothesis is that if the calcium channel is blocked, the twitch threshold would be significently higher.

Materials and Method:
We collected the minimum amplitude to reach threshold from frog legs before and after the application of Lanthanum chloride. We separated gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg. We rinsed the frog leg with frog ringer solution to keep the tissue moisturized. We attached the frog leg to the IXTA stimulator. We used the iWorx EP units to record muscle movements and measure key parameters. We stimulated the exposed nerve with electron signals and recorded resulting electron signal in gastrocnemus muscle. We started with a group of 5 stimulations at 0.0 v amplitude and increased by 0.1v every time until we observed twitches in frog legs. We recorded the minimum amplitude to reach threshold for each frog leg in the controll group. Then, we injected 1Ml of 1mM Lanthanum chloride solution to each frog leg and waited ten minutes before we repeated the stimulation. We compared the minimum amplitude required to reach the threshold in the controll group and treatment group with paired t_test. If the resulting p_value is smaller than 0.05, there exists a significent difference between the twitch threshold in the controll group and the treatment group. If the twitch threshold in treatment group is significently higher than the controll group, our hypothesis is supported. 

Results:
The average twitch threshold in the controll group is 0.1475 V (+/- 0.0653). The average amplitude to threshold in the treatment group is 0.1575 V (+/- 0.1021). The data is referred in figure 1. In the paired t_test, the resulting p_value is 0.7743. Because the p_value is greater than 0.05, there exists no significent difference in the twitch threshold in the controll group and treatment group.

Discussion:
The statistic test shows that there exists no significent difference between the twitch threshold between the controll group and the treatment group. Thus, our hypothesis that if the calcium channel is blocked, the twitch threshold would be significently higher is not supported by this experiment. There are two possible reasons that would lead to this result. First, the frog population we selected for this experiment is affected by "red leg syndrome". It is attributed to infection of bacterium Aero- monas hydrophila. This disease led to a high death rate and a decrease in number of samples. This also decreases the activity level of frogs which are infected [Pessier: 2017]. Second, calcium channel blocker chemicals can be inefficient. Most blockers are efficient in blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels and blocking synaptic transmission. But they are inefficient in in blocking voltage-dependent calcium spikes and the calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization [Taube: 1986]. Thus, when we injected lanthanum chloride into the muscle, some calcium channels are completely not affected. These calcium channels would function normally as long as there existed a signal. And, according to further research, the chemical we used might not be efficient enough in blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels and blocking synaptic transmission, where the signals come from, because the concentration of Lanthanum chloride reported needed for block of TRP3 channels varies in various expression systems [Halaszovich: 2000]. That means we might use a wrong expression system to decide the chemical concentration. A more concentrated chemical should be used in order to result in a significent difference in twitch threshold by blocking calcium channels. The chemical we injected might fail to function as a calcium blocker in the treatment group because of these two reasons. In the future, we should repeat the experiment on a healthy grog population. We need to use different kinds of calcium blockers and repeat the experiment with different concentration to avoid inefficiency of chemicals.
