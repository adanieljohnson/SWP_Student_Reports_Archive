Title: The Effect of Size on Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta splendins 

Abstract:
not done

Introduction:
Betta splendins or Siamese fighting fish change in color and aggression when in the presence of other fish. These displays are called agnostic behaviors and are composed of two different types of movements: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are when the side of the fish is facing the opponent and includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing. Facing movements are when a fish is facing its opponent head on and includes erect pectoral fins, gill spreading, and a red mane. 
This experiment was designed to look at the correlation between size of Betta splendins and their aggression. It was hypothesized that larger male betta fish would display more agnostic behaviors than smaller male betta fish. We focused on tail beating and pelvic fin flickering, both broadside movements and gill flaring, a facing movement. Pelvic fin flickering is a less aggressive behavior where the fish moves its pelvic fin located under the fish vertically opposite of the opponent. Tail beating is a more aggressive behavior and very pronounced. This is when the fish makes sudden movements with its back or caudal fin. Gill flaring is another pronounced movement displaying aggression. The fish will spread the skin located over its gills called the operculum creating a circular shape around its face to appear more threatening.   


Materials and Method:
A tank was divided into two sections using a clear and opaque barrier. An opponent betta fish was kept constant through the experiment on one side of the tank. The other betta fish would be placed on the other side of the divider. After five minutes with the opaque barrier between the fish to allow them to become acclimated to their environment and rest, the barrier was removed. A timer was started for five minutes and the number of tail beatings, pelvic fin flickers, and gill flares were noted in the non-opponent fish. After the five minutes, the fish was taken out of the tank and weighed. This method was repeated with six different fish varying in size. With this data, linear regressions were conducted for each behavior to test if our findings were statistically significent. 


Results:
The R^2 value for the line regression of pelvic fin flickering versus weight of fish was .092, for tail beating the R^2 value was .004, and for gill flares the R^2 value was .581. The data for each behavior did not create a clear trend line. 

Discussion:
Our results were not statistically significent and do not support our alternative hypothesis. The line  regressions for each behavior show very weak correlations. Our R^2 values for each behavior were: .092, .004, and .581. The only behavior that exhibited some kind of trend related to size was gill flaring, but .581 is still not very close to 1 which indicates a strong trend. Looking at the graphs, the data points are very scattered and no trend can be determined. 
To improve upon this experiment we could have run several more trials, controllled for color of fish, or maybe allowed the fish to rest for longer than five minutes to avoid being tired or habituated.
