Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Blocker on the Physiological Development of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The morphogenetic changes in insects are primarily controlled by three hormones:  prothoracicotropic hormone, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormones. This experiment aims to investigate the effects of ecdysterone on the physiological development of Manduca sexta larvae by mixing the daily food supply with AzaMax, which contains azadirachtin (an insect growth regulator that inhibits the release of ecdysterone), and measuring the length (mm), weight (g), and amount of food eaten (%). Hypothetically, the treatment group will cease to secrete ecdysterone, which means none of the treatment sample will pupate. Two sample t-test has shown that all three data sets for the treatment group are not statistically significant different than that of the control group.  The effects of ecdysterone on M. sexta are discussed and has shown that the interaction between ecdysterone and azadirachtin still affect the growth development of M. sexta to some extent. 

Introduction:
Insects control their physiological development and maturation process through hormonal and neural signaling. For insects, metamorphosis is the radical transition from larval stage to pupa, then adult. Studies have shown that the three main hormones that affect the insect’s growth development are: 1) Prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), 2) Ecdysterone, and 3) Juvenile   hormone (JH) [Rountree: 1986; Kenneth: 1971]. 
	During the growth development of an insect, ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting while juvenile hormone regulates the types of molting. Manduca sexta, the subject specie used in this experiment, normally have five larval stages and is chosen to be the subject specie in this experiment because of its short life cycle, easily-raised characteristics, and the large larvae size which makes it relatively easy to observe.  At the end of its fourth instar, the juvenile hormone level drops dramatically. On the other hand, the concentration of ecdysterone begins to increase. During the fifth instar, juvenile hormone remains low while there is a small increase in ecdysterone called the commitment pulse and is the first time in M. sexta caterpillar’s life to have low juvenile hormone and high ecdysterone. The levels of the two hormones signal the caterpillar to enter the pupal stage and, eventually, becomes an adult [Johnson: 2016; Riddiford: 2003].  
	Since the hormones can control the maturation process of the insects, they (and their analogs) can be used as insecticides. These insect growth regulators (IGR) can affect the hormonal levels of PTTH, ecdysterone, or juvenile hormone and indirectly disturb the normal morphogenetic changes in the insects. One plant-derived IGR, juvabione, can effectively prevent linden bug (Pyrrhocoris apterus L.) from maturation and decrease the egg hatch rates. These abnormalities eventually lead the insects to death [Tunaz: 2004].
        	Following the similar logic, altering another growth control hormone might also get similar results: causing abnormalities in insects’ physiology and disturbing the growth development. Thus, this experiment focuses on the effects of blocking the production of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone is one of the ecdysteroids secreted by the prothoracic glands that regulates the molting in insects.  The most common form of ecdysteroids is 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which is the product of ecdysone being oxidized in the peripheral tissues [Nakagawa: 2016].   
	In this experiment, an ecdysterone inhibitor (AzaMax) is added to the food supply which will be given to the experimental group caterpillars daily. AzaMax is a natural insecticide; its active ingredient is azadirachtin -- an antifeedant and IGR [Santos: 2015]. AzaMax can affect the pests in ways such as starvation and growth disruption. This experiment mainly focuses on its impact on M. sexta caterpillars’ physiological development. Since AzaMax can ideally prevent the small rise of ecdysterone level in M. sexta, which prevents the commitment pulse to occur, thus, with this IGR being added to the treatment group’s diet, the hypothesis of this experiment is that the Manduca sexta caterpillars which consume the diet with AzaMax would not pupate; instead, they would enter another stage of instar.


Materials and Methods:
Caterpillar selection
        	Selected eight 11 – 12-day year old Manduca sexta caterpillars and divided them into two groups: one control and one treatment (experimental group).
Food Preparation
        	Measured 10g of food for each Manduca sexta caterpillar used (which was a total of 80g for this experiment). Divided the 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups: one control group and one experimental group. For the control group, weighed 10g of food for each of the caterpillars and placed the food in a new clean container. Added 6 drops of distilled water per 10g of food with a pipette (which was a total of 24 drops of distilled water). Kept the food in as a big clump. Then, weighed and placed 10g of food in each control caterpillar home. For the experimental group, AzaMax (an ecdysterone blocker) was added to the food. The dilution ratio for AzaMax was 1:1250. With a pipette, 6 drops of AzaMax per 10g of food (which was a total of 24 drops) were added to the food. The food was then distributed to each caterpillar home, 10g for each. 
 
Making homes/containers for caterpillars
In order to make a home for each caterpillar, the round containers were divided by placing one index card (with both ends folded and taped to the side of the container) inside the containers to create two rooms. Then, put food (in a clump) and Manduca sexta caterpillars in the homes. One caterpillar in one room; two caterpillars from the same group were put in the same container but different rooms. Label the outside of the container with group name, lab section, caterpillar ID, and treatment or control. Containers were then stored in an incubator.
Daily tasks
        	Each day, the weight (g) and length (mm) of all the Manduca sexta caterpillars were measured and recorded. The mass of the remaining food was also weighted to calculate the amount of food eaten (%) by the caterpillars. Containers were cleaned with soap and index cards were replaced if needed (for instance, a caterpillar made a hole through the card.) Food was remade and placed back to the containers. Observations were recorded; photos were taken before the food was removed and after the new food was placed. Containers were put back to the incubator.
 
Clean up
Put the food back to fridge. Washed the spoon, food-making box, and other equipment used in the experiment with soap. Dried the lab area with paper towels.

Statistical Test
	First, the average length, weight, and the amount of food eaten for control and treatment group were calculated, thus resulting two data sets for each day: one is the mean for control, the other for the treatment. After calculating the everyday mean data, two-sample t-test was performed for each independent variable, which gave the p-values for the mean length, weight, and the amount of food.


Results:
The p-values for all three independent variables were statistically insignificant (length: 0.493, weight: 0.062, and the amount of food: 0.434). The average length of the treatment group was higher than the control group before Feb. 11th; however, the treatment group became shorter than the control group after Feb. 11th and continued to be shorter until the end of the experiment. In general, both groups display a decreasing trend after Feb. 11th. Although the general trend of length data is decreasing in the control group. Control #1 and #2 actually became longer from Feb. 8th to Feb. 11th and started to decline on Feb. 12th. The length of control #4 fluctuated between 55 mm and 45 mm. As shown in Figure 2. D, Control #3 molted on the last day of experiment, Feb. 15th. Control #3's length decreased throughout the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, Control #3 was the longest in the control group, but it became the shortest among the two groups (70 mm on Feb. 8th; 37 mm on Feb. 15th). Control #3 was the only sample that molted in both groups. Treatment #3 seemed to be in pupal stage on Feb. 15th.



Discussion:
The mean length of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.70, df = 14, P = 0.493).  However, as shown in Figure 1., AzaMax still had effects on the treatment group and one observable impact is length. Both groups generally display a decreasing trend after Feb. 11th, thus does the normal food supply also affect the growth development of the control group which shorten the caterpillars?
As shown in Figure 2.D, Control #3 molted. Molting is a normal process for samples in the control group since their hormonal levels were not affected. There are two mechanisms involved in this process: critical weight mechanism and size-dependent mechanism. Critical weight mechanism happens when the larva reaches a critical weight, the brain will trigger metamorphosis. Size-dependent mechanism (which is independent of the brain) remains elusive in current research, but it is known that under poor growth conditions, larvae may never attain the critical weight but molt regardless. One condition in the environment that affects the body size is oxygen level. [Callier: 2011]. Although our designed containers had tiny holes all over the lid, being kept in an incubator with a lot of other same containers may significantly decrease the oxygen level and worsen the growth condition. Size-dependent mechanism explains why Control #3 molted even it was the shortest and lightest among the eight samples. Moreover, since both control and treatment groups were kept in the same environment, both groups may have experienced the same oxygen shortage issue. Which explains why although the food was eaten every day, the body weight and length did not increase as supposed, rather they decreased. With that being said, length data for the treatment group may also be affected by the oxygen level of the living environment. And since the treatment group ingested AzaMax, which contains azadirachtin, their lengths were smaller than the control, and the decreasing slope was bigger than the control.
Another dependent variable being measured in this experiment is the weight of each sample. Two sample t-test has shown that the mean weight of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.03, df = 14, P = 0.062). Also, the mean amount of food eaten of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.81, df = 12, P = 0.434). All three data sets of the control group have shown to be not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group. Thus, does that mean AzaMax has no effect on M. sexta? Or does inhibiting ecdysterone has no significant effect on M. sexta?
In fact, Gilbert (2010) has stated, "Manduca sexta in the presence of azadirachtin [the active ingredient in AzaMax] and PTTH will produce and release normal levels of ecdysone” (pp. 193). This information implies that AzaMax might not have an impact on M. sexta’s ecdysterone level. However, Mordue (2000) has shown different results: if azadirachtin is injected before ecdysterone releases, the release of ecdysterone is entirely blocked; if injected at the start of ecdysterone release, the ecdysterone peak is delayed and the larva will die before pupating; if injected at the peak of the release, the molting process continues, but the insect will die afterward due to air deficiency. In addition, Gilbert (2000) points out that in the 5th instar of M. sexta, azadirachtin causes supernumerary molts by extending the JH peak into the critical period for larval rather than pupal cycle (p.194). This shows that azadirachtin affects not only ecdysterone but also juvenile hormones, and it has a more complex mechanism than we expected. Further research is suggested to directly measure the hormonal levels of the samples and, preferably, inject the reagent into the samples to eliminate any possible confounding variables.
Treatment #3 entered pupal cycle might because it was in its 5th instar and its ecdysterone level was at the peak, thus azadirachtin could not block the release of ecdysterone. Another evidence that supports this inference (treatment #3 was in its 5th instar) is that it was the longest and second heaviest of the two groups. However, we do not know the later development of treatment #3 since the experiment had ended. Thus, further research should extend the experimental time to gather more data.
In addition, the effects of AzaMax might be affected due to the unexpected situation happened during the experiment -- on Feb. 10th, Control #3 made a hole through the note card and entered Control #4’s home; on Feb. 10th, a hole was made on the note card which separated Treatment #1 and Treatment #2; on Feb. 11th, a hole was made on the notecard that separated Treatment #1 and Treatment #2. Due to these interferences, the amount of food eaten data for these groups might be invalid due to the possible visit to other sample’s home and may had consumed the other sample’s food.
We suspected that some portion of the food in Control #4’s home was eaten by Control #3. Thus, the recorded amount of food eaten on Fed. 10th for both caterpillars might be invalid. 
The hypothesis of this experiment is that the Manduca sexta caterpillars which consume the diet with AzaMax would not pupate; instead, they would enter another stage of instar. None of the treatment samples had molted, but one pupated. The result rejects the hypothesis and supports the null hypothesis.
