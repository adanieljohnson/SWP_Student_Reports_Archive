Title: The Effects of Watering Triticum aestivum with a 4.0 pH Solution that Simulates the pH of Acid Rain

Abstract:
The presence of acid rain in a particular area causes harmful effects on an environment such as depleting nutrients and leaching harmful substances from the soil. Plants that are exposed to low-nutrient soil typically develop longer roots to obtain nutrients over a larger area. Because of this, this experiment hypothesized that plants exposed to acid rain would have longer roots, and a larger root to shoot ratio. Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) seeds were grown for a two week period. A controll group was watered daily with water while the experimental (acid rain) group was watered daily with a solution with a pH of 4 (which is similar to the average pH of acid rain). Results found that the root to shoot ratio was higher in the controll group, which differed from the hypothesis. A t_test finalized that these results were not significent enough to conclude that wheat watered with a pH of 4 will have smaller root to shoot ratios. After the experiment, it was found that depletion of the soil due to acid rain is usually a long-term effect, so results of soil exposed to a pH 4 solution for two weeks would not show differences from the controll group of wheat. 

Introduction:
Acid rain has become a common phenomena due to the high amount of pollutants in the air. Pollutants such as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides are emitted from industrial factories and power generating plants where they then mix with water in the air to form strong acids. [McGee: 1997] Once they have mixed with water, they are precipitated along with rain, snow, and hail. The average acidity of acid rain varies from a pH of 4.0 to 4.4 [McGee: 1997]. This pH level can be harmful to the environment. Acid rain can affect plants and their environment by leaching aluminum (which can harm plants) from the soil and also removing necessary minerals and nutrients that are needed for growth [Zheng: 2012].
	Plants that typically grow in low-nutrient soil will have longer roots in comparison to plants that grow in soil with plenty of nutrients. Roots usually grow longer in low-nutrient soil in order to obtain more nutrients through a larger space and surface area [Atwell: 1999]. This also means that these plants will have a larger root to shoot ratio. Acid rain has a tendency to create unhealthy soil for plant growth due to the removal of needed nutrients and the leaching of harmful metals. The soil is then a harsher environment due to acid rain than it was before acid rain, and the allocation of nutrients becomes more difficult. Since acid rain has a tendency of creating a poor-nutrient soil, plants that are watered with a solution that has the same pH of acid rain will have longer roots in order to obtain nutrients in the soil, and will also have a higher root to shoot ratio. This experiment will test this hypothesis to discover if there is a correlation between acidity and poor-nutrient soil. 


Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, two groups of plants were grown and watered with two solutions that had a different pH. After results were finalized, a one-tailed t_test was used to compare the two groups of plants watered with either tap water of a solution of pH 4. This experiment requires wheat (Triticum aestivum) seeds, water, pH 4 solution, vermiculite, six pots, Miracle-Gro, scissors, scale, ruler, container for separating plants, and a bowl. First, six pots must be labeled (three are ‘controll’ and three are ‘pH 4’) in order to differentiate between plants. All pots are filled to the top with vermiculite, then Miracle-Gro is added and they are drenched with water. Seeds that were sitting in a bowl of water are placed into each pot (50-100 seeds per pot), and then they are placed in a greenhouse to grow for two weeks. All plants were watered daily until water dripped through the bottom of the pot. The group labelled ‘controll’ was watered with tap water, while the ‘pH 4’ group was watered with a diluted solution of an acid to a pH of 4. After two weeks, the plants were removed from the soil one at a time. Five plants from each pot were weighed, and then cut apart where the root and shoot met. Then, each root and shoot was weighed and measured. In this experiment, the amount of sunlight, temperature, and soil type (vermiculite) were controllled. While the pH of water was the independent variable, the root to shoot ratio (R:S) was the dependent variable, since it was measured in order to find the results. 


Results:
Figure 1. The graph shows the calculated averages of the root to shoot ratios of the controll plants and the pH 4 group plants, along with their standard deviations through error bars. On average, the root to shoot ratio was higher in the controll group than in the pH 4 group.
Table 1. The P-value that was found through the one-sample t_test is much higher than the expected P-value, which means that there is not a significent difference between the root to shoot ratios of the two experimental groups. 

Discussion:
The results showed that the average root to shoot ratio was larger in the controll group than in the pH 4 group. However, this was only by a very small number. Since the results were very close together, a t_test was used to determine if the results were significent enough to conclude that the root to shoot ratios of the controll group were higher. The P-value that was found was much higher than what would be expected, which means that there is no significance to the results of the root to shoot ratio being higher in the controll group than in the pH 4 group. The hypothesis stated that the root to shoot ratio would be higher in the pH 4 group plants because the roots would be longer because of less nutrients in the soil. The averages of the root to shoot ratios showed that this hypothesis was incorrect, and then the one-sample t_test further concluded that the null hypothesis better supports this data.  
	Since these results differed from the stated hypothesis, there must be another explanation to why the root to shoot ratios between the two groups were so close. This first seemed that it could have been a result of mold that was growing on the top of the soil of the plants. However, this was the same in each pot, so it would act like a controll that did not differ between groups. This experiment did fail to recognize an important factor of the effect of acid rain on soil. Low-nutrient soil is more of a long-term effect of acid rain, and many other studies with significent results are done over a few years or generations to understand the adaptations for allocation [Bååth: 1984]. The pH 4 solution was only present in the vermiculite for two weeks, so it did not have enough time to create a low-nutrient soil environment. If this experiment were repeated, it would be best to allow the soil to be exposed to a lower pH solution for a long period of time before planting the seeds so that the solution would have time to deplete the soil of its nutrients. It would even be beneficial to collect soil samples from places where acid rain is common, so that the plants would be grown in soil where acid rain had naturally occurred, and the results found would be more similar to what would be found outside of the lab. 
	In general, plants will adapt to poor soil environments by having longer roots for nutrient uptake. If the low pH of acid rain causes poor-nutrient soil, a soil that is constantly treated with a low pH solution should have poor soil over time. The plants that grow in that soil would then most likely have longer roots than plants whose soil (and plants) were not exposed to acid rain. The ideas that this experiment deals with are important to science as there is an increasing amount of acid rain due to factories and the burning of fossil fuels. It is important to discover the effect that this is having on plants (especially crops and forests) so that people can see what long term changes are occuring in the environment due to acid rain.
