Title: Effects of Murky Water and Clear Water on Betta Fish Behavior

Abstract:
   The main objective of this experiment was to test the levels of aggression in male Betta fish in murky water versus clear water. For the experiment we used three male Betta fish or Betta Splendins. Our group wanted to see what would happen to the agnostic behaviors of the fish in murky water and clear water during six, five-minute intervals. If the Betta fish are in murky water, I predict that they will display less agnostic behaviors than in the clear water, as they will not be able to see each other very clearly. We had three controll sets where the fish saw each other in the clear water and three experimental sets where the fish saw each other in murky water. Male 1 saw Male 2, Male 2 saw Male 3, and Male 1 saw Male 3, in both types of water, and assigned each facing and broadside behavior certain points as a part of a point system. The average points for clear and murky water had a p_value of .053 (t-value: 2.82, d.f.: 2). The hypothesis was supported, and the betta fish on average displayed more aggressive, agnostic behaviors in the clear water than in the murky water. 

Introduction:
   Ethology is the study of animal behavior and it helps us understand the physiological purposes for an organism's behaviors and how they have been shaped by evolution. A fish that has very physical and visual traits of aggression is the Betta fish or, Betta Splendins. At rest, the Betta fish (wild males), can be a dull, greyish brown, but when they become excited by the presence of another male, they flare their gills and fins, and change the color to an intense blue or red. In the presence of their own species, their colorful displays and attacks are classified as agnostic behaviors. The two main intraspecific behaviors are facing and broadside movements, with a Betta showing its "red mane" being the most aggressive facing behavior. The Betta fish's natural habitat is heavily vegetated marshes and slow moving streams, where is still performs its intraspecific behaviors. Betta fish in a previous lab were very aggressive towards each other especially when they were put in the same clear water tank, which included many red manes and arched backs. Although the fish were socially isolated at times, this has been shown to initially decrease levels of aggression in adult Betta fish [Verbook:2007]. My team and I want to use this information to see what will happen to the levels of aggression and agnostic behaviors when the fish are put into murky water (their natural habitat) instead of clear water. If the Betta fish are in murky water, I predict that they will display less agnostic behaviors than in the clear water, as they will not be able to see each other very clearly.  

Materials and Method:
   Most importantly, we used three male Betta fish, two tanks filled with water, four non-clear dividing partitions, potting soil, a timer, and a fish scooper. The three fish, labeled Male 1, Male 2, and Male 3 all started off in the clear water to get controll sets. The red Betta was Male 1, the blue Betta was Male 2, and the pink Betta was Male 3. In my group we had one spotter for all three fish for the six total sets of observation that occurred, so they can call out the behaviors while the others recorded the numbers. In each observation there was a point system which was organized into facing and broadside displays, in increasing order of aggression. 
For facing movements, erect pelvic fins scored 1 point, spread gill covers scored 2 points, and a red mane scored 3 points. For the broadside display point system, pelvic fin flickering scored 1 point, tail beating scored 2 points, and tail flashing scored 3 points. The points were added up and averaged after each set. (The 1-tailed, paired t_test was run on the averages of the sets.) The first three sets of observation occurred in the clear water, with Male 1 seeing Male 2 from behind a see-through glass barrier. The second set was between Male 2 and Male 3, and the third set was between Male 1 and Male 3. All the sets were timed for five minutes and after each set, the fish had five minutes of rest, (we placed the non-see through barrier between them again), between viewings of the other male fish so that the data would not be skewed due to fish exhaustion. In each set, the observer only paid attention to one fish at a time so that they could be clearly focused on. In set 1, Male 1 was observed and in set 2, Male 2 was observed, and in set 3, Male 3 was observed. This also occurred for the fish in the second half of the experiment in the murky water. After the first three sets, the three Betta fish were all moved to the murky water tank and were habituated for five minutes before the fourth through sixth sets were conducted. Once the five-minute habituation period was over, the same processes were used in the murky as in the clear water when observing the fish interactions. To test my hypothesis, I utilized a 1-tailed, paired t_test.


Results:
The controll group or clear water group had an average of 29.3 ± 15.5 points, which decreased to 3 ± 2.65 points in the experimental group with murky water [t-value: 2.8, d.f.: 2, p_value: .053]. The trend in Figure 1 is that the average number of aggression points decreased from clear water to murky water. 

Discussion:
   The null hypothesis that the Betta fish should be aggressive no matter what kind of water they are in, was rejected and my hypothesis was supported. The male Betta fish when they are in clear water displayed more aggressive behaviors than when they were put in the murky water tank. Due to the test and the numbers, the fish were barely more aggressive in the clear water than in the murky water. This could be due to artificial selection in that the fish are used to clear "pet shop" conditions and are not used to their native, intended environments of a heavily vegetated marsh or slow-moving streams which are filled with algae and dirt, making it more difficult to see. The Betta fish have the necessary adaptations to display intraspecific behaviors in clear water or murky water. The fish we used have never been in something like marsh water, until our experiment. Naturally, the next logical step in this experiment would be to remove the glass partition dividing the fish in the murky water as their eyesight is has been observed as not being perfect, and to give the fish more time to find each other instead of the average five minutes. To aid the Betta fish's poor eyesight from afar, they have chemical sensors which allow them to detect smells as well as vibrations in the water. The murky water could have blocked their sight and the glass partition could have made detecting vibrations in the water even harder [Verbeek:2007]. In a larger context, this shows how certain behaviors in organisms, even though they may be expected outside of their natural context, can differ greatly when they are raised in laboratory/tank conditions. Some organisms may be best studied in their natural habitat versus in a lab setting so that a scientist can obtain the clearest results.
