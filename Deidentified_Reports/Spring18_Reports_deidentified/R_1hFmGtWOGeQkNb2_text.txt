Title: Rania pipien: Lidocaine’s effects on overall muscle contraction and Action Potential

Abstract:
In this study, we will be studying the effects of lidocaine, a sodium channel inhibitor, on overall muscle contraction and action potential in the specimen the Rania pipien. Lidocaine inhibits muscle contraction by not allowing the release of calcium in the cell, therefore blocking action potentials from firing. If Rania pipien legs are injected with Lidocaine, then muscle contraction and the amount of action potentials that fire will also decrease. We found that if Rania pipien legs are injected with lidocaine, then the voltage of muscle contraction decreases due to the cells inability to depolarize. Therefore, in the presence of a sodium inhibitor, muscle contraction and action potentials decrease. 


Introduction:
In this study, we will be studying nerve and muscle contraction in Rania pipien frog legs. Nerves give organisms the ability to respond to stimuli: both internal and external. Skeletal muscles are comprised of bundled up myofibrils. These Skeletal muscles are then controllled by motor neurons that function as a result of the gray matter located on the spinal cord. At neurotransmitter junctions, axons of motor neurons extend into the skeletal muscles. Branching of neurons into skeletal muscles aloe for fast reactive muscles. Sodium channels allow for depolarization of the cell, which in turn, causes calcium to be release and action potentials to fire.  Never impulses that reach the neurotransmitter junctions cause the release of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ebashi: 1968]. We will be examining the effects of muscle contraction of Rania pipen legs if sodium channels are inhibited by a solution called Lidocaine. Our independent variable is the amount of lidocaine, while our dependent variable is amount of muscle contraction. If lidocaine inhibits the production of sodium by sodium channels, sodium channels will not open as readily, therefore inhibiting muscle contraction. 


Materials and Method:
We started our experiment by receiving two Rania pipen legs. Degloving the legs, we removed all the skin from Rania pipen. We then carefully exposed the sciatic nerve by pulling slightly on the thigh. Needing some extra leverage, we used sterile wipes and forceps to better hold the thigh. Then pulling slightly we detached the gastrocnemus. Tying string to the base of the gastrocnemus, we then strung it up and stuck two probes into the muscle. Applying different levels of current through a force transducer and recording the amount of muscle contraction, we recorded the threshold of contraction. Afterword’s we then injected the gastrocnemus with a 1Ml solution of 25 mM Lidocaine and waited five minutes to allow the lidocaine to permeate the gastrocnemus. We then applied the same threshold of stimulus and recorded the amount of muscle contraction. We then used a two-paired t test to compare our results of muscle contraction pre injection and post injection. 


Results:
In both frog legs, my group was able to detect a large decrease in muscle contraction after an injection of Lidocaine. To be exact, in our first Rania pipen frog leg, we had a contraction with an amplitude of .2213+/- .0146 volts without lidocaine. After the lidocaine injection, contraction dropped to an average of .09 +/- .0151 volts. Even more dramatic results characterized our second Rania pipien frog leg: pre injection contractions could be detected at.638+/- .0062 volts, while post injection contractions were detected at .013+/-.001 volts. Together, we had an average of .423 volts of contraction pre injection between the two frogs, and .051 volts of contraction post injection. We ran a two paired T test that revealed we had a P value of 0.018 and a T value of 3.421. 


Discussion:
Any P value below .05 indicates a significent change from controll to experimental group, indicating a successful hypothesis.  Because we have a P value that does reach below this range, we can deduce that our experiment was in fact successful. In both Rania pipen legs, contraction and reaction to stimuli’s decreased post Lidocaine injection. This further proves that muscle contraction was inhibited as a result of sodium channel inhibition. Because of the sodium channel inhibition, calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the cell was not released, and the cell was not able to depolarize and cause action potential. Another study similar to ours was conducted and found similar results: Tetsuya Kai found that in the presence of lidocaine muscle contractions of frog legs slowed or stopped [Tetsuya: 1993]. He contributes this to the fact that if sodium channels are blocked, the cell won’t depolarize, so no action potentials will be produced and calcium won't be released. The next logical step would be to see if a larger amount of lidocaine was injected into the Rania pipen frog leg, would it stop muscle contraction and action potential all together. Perhaps another factor of the experiment that could be altered to increase the success of the experiment would be to allow for a larger amount of time between injection of the lidocaine and permeation of the muscle.
