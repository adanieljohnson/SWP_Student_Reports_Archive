Title: The effects of sunlight and shade on the length and weight of the root to shoot ratio of buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum sp.)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of sunlight and shade on the length and weight of the Root:Shoot ratios of buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum sp.). Sunlight is an essential resource that plants need to acquire. If this resource availability is limited, if the plants are growing in the shade, then they will allocate more of their energy to growing their shoots in order to maximize their sunlight absorption. We predicted that buckwheat plants growing in the shade would have a bigger length and weight Root:Shoot ratio compared to the buckwheat plants grown in the sun. To test this, we weighed and measured the roots and shoots of buckwheat plants grown in both the sun and the shade in order to calculate their Root:Shoot ratios. Our results for the length Root:Shoot ratio did not support our hypothesis (t-stat=0.216, df=10, P=0.417). However our results for the weight Root:Shoot ratio did support our hypothesis, as the weight Root:Shoot ratio was significantly bigger for the plants grown in the shade, compared to the plants grown in the sun (t-stat=2.168, df=10, P=0.0277). We can therefore say that buckwheat plants grown in the shade will have a bigger weight Root:Shoot ratio compared to buckwheat plants grown in the sun.

Introduction:
The phenotypic variation in buckwheat plants, specifically their Root:Shoot ratio for length and weight, can help us to understand their specific resource allocation in response to sunlight, which is an abiotic factor [Johnson: 2018]. Resource allocation refers to how the plant allocates its resources among its roots, shoots, and leaves. Plants need to acquire sunlight which is an essential resource. If resource availability is limited for a plant, for example if they are growing in the shade, then they must use resource allocation to ensure their survival. Individual plants can modify their typical allocation pattern to allow them to adapt to the abiotic conditions, this is called allocation plasticity [Johnson: 2018]. Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organ of the plant, the stems support the shot and lift the leaves so that they can obtain sunlight, the roots anchor the plant and also absorb nutrients from the soil. Studying resource allocation in domestic plants, such as buckwheat, is useful because it means we can be more effective in growing these plants in the future. We will gain a better understanding of what resources are essential for each plant, and the ways that they allocate these resources. 

In this experiment we will be examining the phenotypic variation of buckwheat plants that have been grown in a greenhouse. Specifically, we will be measuring the lengths and weights of the roots and shoots of buckwheat. Half of our buckwheat have been grown in full sunlight, while the other half have been grown in shade. For the buckwheat growing in the shade, sunlight is a limited resource. As a result these plants will expend more energy growing their shoots to help them to obtain maximum sunlight. In an experiment by Reich it was discovered that plants growing in low light conditions allocate more energy to growing stems, and allocate less energy to growing roots, this resulting in longer shoots and shorter roots. The opposite was observed in high light conditions [Reich: 1998]. A separate study concluded that the length and number of roots was smaller in the shaded treatment group, compared to the sunlight group [Hebert: 2000]. We therefore predict that the length and weight of Root:Shoot ratio will be bigger for plants that have grown in the shade, compared to those plants that have grown in direct sunlight. 

Materials and Methods:
We pulled buckwheat plants grown in sunlight out of their trays and separated their roots. We washed the roots before weighing and measuring (to the nearest mm) each of the 6 individual sunlight plants. Then we separated the roots from the shoots. We measured and weighed the shoots and roots of each individual sunlight plant. We then calculated the length and weight of Root:Shoot ratio for each individual plant. 

We then repeated these methods for the 6 buckwheat plants grown in 70% shade. 

Statistical Test: 
Once results were recorded for all 6 sunlight replicates and all 6 shade replicates, we used a two sample paired t-test to analyze our data. We used a two sample paired t-test because our hypothesis predicts that the Root:Shoot ratio will be statistically bigger for buckwheat grown in the shade compared to buckwheat grown in direct sunlight. 

Results:
Looking at Figure #1 we can see that the average length Root:Shoot ratio of the shade buckwheat is slightly bigger than that of the sun buckwheat (t-stat=0.216, df=10, P=0.417). From Figure #2 we can see that the average weight Root:Shoot ratio of the shade buckwheat is bigger than that of the sun buckwheat (t-stat=2.168, df=10, P=0.0277). Sun plants had a s.d. of 0.223 and a mean of 0.635. Shade plants had a s.d. of 0.337 and a mean of 0.671. Looking at both figures we can also see that the difference between the weight Root:Shoot ratio of sun buckwheat and shade buckwheat is larger than in the length ratios. The Root:Shoot ratios were on average bigger for length than for weight (Figure #1 and Figure #2). 

Discussion:
Our statistical results for length do not show that shade Root:Shoot ratio is significantly bigger than sun Root:Shoot ratio. However our statistical results for weight do show that the shade Root:Shoot ratio is significantly bigger than the sun Root:Shoot ratio. Therefore our hypothesis that weight Root:Shoot ratio would be bigger for buckwheat grown in the shade, rather than in the sun, is supported. Plants that are grown in the shade have less access to sunlight, therefore they must allocate more of their energy to growing longer shoots in order to obtain maximum sunlight. As a result plants growing lower light intensity will have a larger shoot mass, compared to their root mass [White: 1937]. One potential reason why the weight Root:Shoot ratio was statistically significant, but the length Root:Shoot ratio was not statistically significant could be due to resource allocation in the leaves of the plants. Having less access to sunlight means the plants will allocate more energy to growing longer shoots, as well as growing larger leaves [Canham C: 1988]. This could explain why the shoot mass was larger than the root mass, but the shoot length alone was not longer than the root length. 

Our results match the results of several other previous studies done on resource allocation in plants grown in different light intensities. A study from Hebert found that the length and weight of roots was smaller in plants grown in shaded environments, relative to the length and number of their shoots. This is due to the fact that the plant is struggling to obtain sunlight, so it is allocating more of its energy into growing its shoots. As a result the plant group that was grown in the shade had bigger Root:Shoot ratios than the plant group grown in the sun [Hebert: 2000]. 

If we were to do this experiment again, I would like to put the shade group of plants in an environment with an even lower light intensity. I think that in this experiment our shade environment could have been darker. Placing our shade group in a lower light intensity environment could result in a bigger difference in the length and weight Root:Shoot ratios between the shade and sun groups. If the shade plants were exposed to even less sunlight, as a result they may allocate even more of their resources to growing longer shoots in an attempt to maximize their sunlight absorption. 

This experiment was useful because it provided information about resource allocation in buckwheat plants. This information is helpful because it means we can be more effective in growing buckwheat plants in the future. Knowing the effect of light on buckwheat resource allocation allows us to specifically choose what environments we use to cultivate buckwheat plants. Knowing that buckwheat plants have allocation plasticity means that we can still grow buckwheat in environments where certain resources may be limited, for example in areas with limited sunlight, nutrients or water.
