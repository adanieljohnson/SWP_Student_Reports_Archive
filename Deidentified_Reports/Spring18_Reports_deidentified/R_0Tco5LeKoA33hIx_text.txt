Title: Effect of Light on Plant Allocation on The Growth of Radish (Raphahus Sativus) Plants 

Abstract:
Plants adapt to their environment and allocate their resources to maximize growth and survival potential. Our study analyzes the effect of light on the growth on plants. I hypothesized that the plants in the shade condition would grow taller in order to obtain the limiting resource of light, resulting in a smaller root to shoot ratio. We grew two pots of radishes in a sunny condition and two pots in a shady condition for two weeks. Then we measured the root to shoot weight and height. The results showed that these ratios were smaller in all given instances for that of the shady condition. My hypothesis was supported, but through a two sample one tailed t test, the results proved insignificant. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is important in organisms across any given environment because it allows them to adapt to the resources that are present. The main sources of nutrients for plants are solar energy and co2, which come in from the shoots/leaves and nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur, which are taken up from the soil through the roots. These resources are then harnessed for new growth and storage of leaves, stems, and roots. 
In this lab, we will be looking at the effect of light on radish plant (Raphahus Sativus) resource allocation which will be observable in the form of the weight and height root to shoot ratio. This is something that is genetically predisposed, but there can be phenotypic plasticity in response to different environments. The limiting resource is what determines the growth rate of the given feature that the organism chooses to put its resources into. I hypothesis that in the shade condition, the root to shoot ratio will be smaller than that of the sunny condition because the plant will grow tall in order to obtain light. This biological concept is important because plants are able to respond to their environment and allocate their resources to maximize their chances of survival. 
Similarly to our study, in Marcelis and Hooijdonk’s experiment on the effect of salinity on growth, water use, and nutrient use in radish plants. Through his study we can see that the small leaf area high salinity was related to a reduced specific leaf area and increased root to shoot weight ratio (Marcelis and Hooijdonk 1999). This shows that in this given environment the plant allocates its resources to its roots where it will take up the high salinity from the soil to obtain a sufficient amount of nutrients. They highlighted that plant growth was optimal from 2-4 dsm-1. This experiment, along with ours, is important because it shows how the same plant in different environments, whether it be light or salinity, adapt and change to the surroundings, finding their ideal status with resource allocation. 


Materials and Methods:
We planted 2 pots of radish plants, watering them everyday. One pot was placed in a sunny condition, while the other was placed under a shade cloth to provide a shady environment. After allowing them to grow for two weeks, we carefully took the plants out from the soil, making sure to get all the way down to the whole root. To ease this process, water may be used to separate the soil from the plant. Next, we measured the weight and length of the whole stem and proceeded to measure the weight and length of the root and shoot. This process was repeated three times, for each given condition: light and shade. The independent variable will be the amount of light (shade v sun), while the dependent variable will be the root to shoot ratio. Given that my hypothesis suggested that the mean of the shade root to shoot ratio would be smaller, using excel, we employed a two sample one tailed t-test, comparing the means of the two conditions in order to interpret the significance of our data. 


Results:
As seen in figures 1 and 2, the root to shoot weight and height ratio was higher in all given replicates for the light condition. As seen in the tables, the mean ratio of the three plants tested that grew in the shade for weight was 0.0572, while it was 0.3636 for that of height. On the other hand, the standard deviation of the root to shoot ratio, which shows the variation from the mean, for weight was 0.0241 and for height it was 0.0597. In the shade, the average root height was 38 and the standard deviation of the three replicates was 9.534. For the shoot, the mean was 103.667 and the standard deviation was 9.609. In the light condition, the average root height was 50.334 and the standard deviation was 7.506. For the shoot, the mean was 106.334 and the standard deviation was 10.970. Given the results from the statistical test with a p value 0.1209, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and do not have enough significant evidence to conclude that the true means between the shade and light conditions differ. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was supported that in shade the plant would grow high above the soil in order to obtain the limiting resource of light. This was shown in a low root to shoot ratio, which signifies more allocation to the shoots. On the other hand, a large root to shoot ratio would be defined by a larger amount of allocation to the roots. 
It was interesting to observe over the two weeks of plant growth that the plants (reference photo 1) grew more sideways rather than up, in particular those in the shaded condition. At first I inferred that this was due to some factor of our watering process, which I assumed pushed the plants away from their normal upward growth pattern. Then I thought that this was due to the shoots being thin and weak and that they were not getting the necessary support from the shoot. This would go along with the reasoning behind my hypothesis. Through further analyzation, I think that this phenomenon is caused by the effect of the shade cloth, which forced the plants to grow out toward the light. At the same time, this was observed in the light condition plants but to a lesser extent, so I conclude that multiple factors were at play. In our shade condition, etiolation was observed. This is defined as when lack of light leads a plant to elongate its shoot, resulting in a weakening of the plant support. In Eldridge, Hill, Bebbington, Meatyard’s experiment analyzing the effect of light on ivy plant leaves, those in the shade were observed to have thinner leaves with a larger surface area. This is a form of resource allocation that plants adapt to in order to maximize their resource intake potential. When sun is a limiting resource, the plant will evenly distribute their chloroplast in a thin layer to maximize photosynthesis. Other observations can be seen in the table below (Table 3). (Eldridge, Hill, Bebbington, Meatyard)
In another given example with radishes , this same biological phenomenon, resource allocation, can also be seen not only in amount of resources a given environment provides but also type of resource provided. Bouchard, Harmon, Markham, Vandefifer observed length, weight, and leaf count in order to determine that MiracleGrow is the most productive solution over rain, tap, and fish water. They suggest that this type of water led to the greatest amount of growth due to the large amount of nutrients like nitrogen, chloride, and carbon (Bouchard, Harmon, Markham, Vandefifer 2007).
This information is important in a larger context because plants are very good at adapting to their surrounding. They are unable to maximize their potential in all given areas, but they must choose how to react to their environment and allocate their resources effectively and efficiently. Although the data supported my hypothesis, the results proved insignificant. Our two sample one tailed t test provided a p value of 0.12093, which is greater than the significance. In the future, in order to obtain potentially more significant results we could lengthen the duration of the study and increase the population size.
