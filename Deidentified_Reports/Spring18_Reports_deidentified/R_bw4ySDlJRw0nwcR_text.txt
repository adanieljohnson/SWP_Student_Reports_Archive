Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the length of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, has many developmental stages throughout it's growth cycle. The Manduca sexta Caterpillars' 48-56 day life cycle is influenced by two main hormones, Juvenille Hormones and ecdysteroids. Specifically, JH determines the type of molting a larvae goes through in its life cycle. In this lab, the effect of an increase in JH, through added IGR in the caterpillars food, was observed to see its influence on length. It was predicted that the presence of IGR in the caterpillars food would result in a greater average length of the treatment group compared to the controll group. It was concluded that there is no relationship between increased JH levels and length. Through a 2-sample T test, it was found that the P-value was 0.762445, which is greater then 0.05 which concludes that this study was not statistically significent. A way that this study could have been improved would have been through a greater concentration of IGR and a greater sample of caterpillars. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm, growth and life cycle are influenced by two main hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysteroids. Their growth cycle is about 48-56 days and entails an egg phase, 5 instar phases of larvae, a pupa phase, and finally adulthood [Johnson: 2018]. The presence of ecdysteroids controlls the timing of molting, while JH controlls the type of molting. JH is produced in the corpus alta, while ecdysteroids is secreted by the prothoracic glands [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, the levels of JH were manipulated in order to see its effect on the Manduca sexta's gowth and specifically its length. The JH was manipulated in the form of IGR, or Insect Growth Hormone, a commonly used pesticide. IGR inhibits certain hormones and affects "physiological regulatory processes" in order to controll the progression of growth and maturity in an insect [Johnson: 2018]. Manipulating the JH hormone allows one to view the effects of hormone levels on development and growth. According to a previous study, manipulating the JH hormone in a Manduca sexta can cause changes in the growth of the caterpillar because JH is critical in the caterpillars' ability to "size-sense" [Hatem: 2015]. This ability allows the caterpillar's body to determine when it is time to either release JH to inhibit the prothoracicotropic hormone/PTTH (which releases ecdysteroids and encourage pupation) or clear JH from the body and allow the release of PTTH based on the stage the caterpillar is in [Hatem:2015]. It also allows for a better understanding of the relationship between "developmental timing and growth rate" [Hatem: 2015]. It was hypothesized that if 4 Manduca sexta in the 4th instar phase were fed food with manipulated JH levels (in the form of Martin's IGR), then they would have stunted growth and be shorter compared to the Manduca sextas that are fed normal food. When JH levels decrease in the caterpillar, it signals that the caterpillar is ready to pupate and become an adult size moth [Johnson: 2018]. This led to the belief that increasing JH would prevent the signal for the caterpillar to grow into adulthood, causing it to continually molt and maintain its larvae size. 

Materials and Method:
Eight 4th instar Manduca sexta caterpillars were divided into two groups of four and each labeled a number 1-8. One group was designated for treatment, and the other was used for the controll group. The caterpillars were separated by a notecard in order to keep them from eating eachother's food. Caterpillars 1-4 were labeled the controll group as seen in Figure 2 and 3. They were then each fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with 10 added drops of water every day for 8 days as seen in figure 4. Caterpillars 5-8 were labeled the treatment group. They were then each fed 10 grams with 10 drops of Marvin's IGR (which contained a 1: 1250 chemical ratio) each day for 8 days as seen in figure 4. Every day the caterpillars were removed from the incubator (which was set to 23C) and measured using a ruler (measuring by centimeters), these measurements were then recorded onto a data table. Then, their food was changed; the same amounts of grams and drops of IGR or water were consistent throughout the 8 days. The caterpillars were then returned to the incubator after each feeding and measurement. Both the treatment and controll group were under the same conditions of temperature and light. The treatment and controll groups lengths were then compared. The statistical test used was a 2 sample T-test.

Results:
The degree of freedom was 3, the t-value was 0.330958, and the P-value was 0.762445, which is greater than 0.05. The treatment group had more variation in its average growth, while the controll had a steadier growth rate. In figure 1, it is clear that there was not a significent difference between the average lengths as there is not a substantial difference between the average lengths/height of the bars. The controll group and treatment group were not very statistically different. Both the controll and treatment, on average, had a general trend of increasing length as the 8 days passed. The treatment had a slightly higher average growth among its caterpillars. Throughout the 8 days, it was observed that the controll group was more dark/black lines on their body while the treatment group seemed to maintain an all blue.

Discussion:
From the results, the conclusion can be made that the manipulation of the Juvenile Hormone, through Marvin's IGR, does not make a significent difference on the length of the Manduca sexta Caterpillars. Since the p_value was greater than 0.05 it can be concluded that the data is not statistically significent. Our hypothesis was rejected as there was no direct link between the increase of JH and a stunted length when comparing the treatment and controll groups. It is seen in Figure 1 that there was close to no variation between the growth/length of the Manduca sextas caterpillars. The growth was consistently similar between both the controll and treatment groups; both groups had an outlier that failed to grow and eventually died. It can be concluded that an increased amount of JH does not predict a smaller length. According to Hatem, "JH acts to protect larvae from nutritional disturbances" but "the final body size of a Manduca Sexta is influenced by the time between the critical weight attainment and the ecdysteroids" [Hatem: 2015]. The JH is not a determinant of the length of the Manduca Sexta, but instead protects the larvae when it is growing. In a previously conducted study, feeding JH-deficient larvae rapamycin caused the larvae to significently increase the peak size [Hatem: 2015] . These results were different then our results because our caterpillars were not JH-deficient. When adding JH to the JH-deficient larvae, the JH helped protect the larvae from its nutritional disturbance (the normal low JH), returning its JH levels to normal to allow a normal growth cycle and eventually adulthood. In our lab, since the caterpillars were not JH deficient, the increase in JH did not have the same protective and beneficial effects, it instead did not cause a change in the lengths of the caterpillars. It can be concluded that JH is not the direct cause of stunted growth in healthy caterpillars but can help stimulate a normal growth cycle for unhealthy caterpillars, while ecdysteroid and critical weight are greater determinants of size. An alternate explanation to our data, was that the sample size was too low to be able to find a statistically significent relationship between the length and the JH. In a future repetition of this study, the sample size should be greater. Another modification that could be made is a greater concentration of IGR in the food. Overall, it can be concluded that JH increase does not lead to a decrease length among Manduca sexta.
