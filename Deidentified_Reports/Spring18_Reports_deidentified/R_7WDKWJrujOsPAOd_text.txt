Title: Injecting Caffeine into Gastrocnemius of a Rania pipiens Causes a Prolonged Contraction Period Length

Abstract:
The nervous system uses chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters in order to cause changes in the body, and one of these changes is muscle contraction. Drugs such as caffeine are thought to affect the process of muscle contraction. In order to test caffeine’s effects on muscle contraction, we decided to measure how caffeine affects the contraction period length of the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens before (controll) and after (treatment) injecting the muscle with 0.1 Ml of caffeine. We predicted that upon stimulation, the average muscle contraction period length of the treatment trials would be longer than that of the controll trials for the frog legs. In order to test this, we stimulated two frog legs with five pulses at 125% the minimum stimulus contraction threshold before and after being injected with caffeine and compared the average contraction period lengths. We then used a paired t test to determine if there is a statistically significent difference between the contraction period lengths for the two trials. Since our p value was 6.07 x 10-10, we were able to determine that there was statistically significent difference in contraction period length for the controll and treatment groups, with that of the treatment group being much larger. This is due to the fact that caff

Introduction:
The nervous system uses chemical messengers known as neurotransmitters in order to cause changes in the body, and one of these changes is muscle contraction. Drugs such as caffeine are thought to affect the process of muscle contraction. In order to test caffeine’s effects on muscle contraction, we decided to measure how caffeine affects the contraction period length of the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens before (controll) and after (treatment) injecting the muscle with 0.1 Ml of caffeine. We predicted that upon stimulation, the average muscle contraction period length of the treatment trials would be longer than that of the controll trials for the frog legs. In order to test this, we stimulated two frog legs with five pulses at 125% the minimum stimulus contraction threshold before and after being injected with caffeine and compared the average contraction period lengths. We then used a paired t test to determine if there is a statistically significent difference between the contraction period lengths for the two trials. Since our p value was 6.07 x 10-10, we were able to determine that there was statistically significent difference in contraction period length for the controll and treatment groups, with that of the treatment group being much larger. This is due to the fact that caffeine inhibits the function of the pump that pushes calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and as a result the muscle cannot relax.

Introduction: Neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers that are a part of the nervous system, are essential to the physiological functions of many organisms. When a neurotransmitter is released from a neuron’s axon terminal into another neuron’s dendrite, the neuron that receives the neurotransmitter is flooded with sodium and loses potassium, and this causes it to depolarize. This depolarization of a neuron, known as an action potential, in turn causes it to release neurotransmitter into the next neuron. Action potentials can either be inhibitory or excitatory in terms of the release of neurotransmitters. Each specific neurotransmitter causes several specific things to happen throughout the body. For example, the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine causes muscle contraction. When acetylcholine is released from a neuron's axon terminal into the sarcolemma at a neuromuscular junction the neurotransmitter binds with acetylcholine receptors. This causes an action potential to travel down the t tubule, which in turn causes a conformational change in the ryanodine receptor that allows for calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Once the calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it activates troponin. Troponin causes tropomyosin to move away from the actin/myosin binding sites on the actin. As a result, the ATP powered heads of myosin bind to actin which causes muscle contraction. After a short period of time, a pump brings the calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby ending contraction. Certain chemicals can influence this process, including caffeine. Caffeine is thought to prevent the calcium pump from function properly, therefore preventing muscle relaxation. It is important to understand how caffeine affects skeletal muscle, because it is a substance that can be easily accessed by the general public, and the effects that it has on a person can be both negative and positive. In order to test its effects on muscle contraction, we decided to measure how caffeine affects the contraction period length of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. Similar studies like this have been conducted in the past, and many of concluded that the injection of caffeine into the muscles of frogs resulted in longer periods of muscle contraction. According to a study conducted by Kolawole Victor Olorunshola, the injection of caffeine into the skeletal muscle of frogs causes an increase in the length of muscle contraction [Olorunshola:2011]. We measured the muscle contraction period length in two Rania pipiens legs before (controll) and after (treatment) injecting the gastrocnemus with caffeine. We predicted that upon stimulation, the average muscle contraction period length of the treatment trials would be longer than that of the controll trials for the frog legs.

Materials and Method:
In order to test how caffeine affects the muscle contraction period length, we measured the contraction period length of two Rania pipiens gastrocnemus before and after being injected with 0.1 Ml of caffeine. In order to do this, we first separated the upper leg muscles of the frogs in order to isolate the sciatic nerve. We then cut the achilles tendon and attached the gastrocnemus to the IXTA isolated stimulator in order to record contraction period lengths. In order to cause a muscle contraction to occur, we stimulated the sciatic nerve. We determined the minimum contraction threshold by observing what the lowest stimulus amplitude in Volts was that caused the muscle to contraction. During our experiment we stimulated the frog leg with a stimulus of 125% of this threshold. We administered 5 pulses of this stimulus in a row and recorded the length of time in seconds that it took for the muscle to contract and then relax. We went through this process two times with each frog leg, once before injecting the gastrocnemus with caffeine and once after injecting the gastrocnemus with 0.1 Ml of caffeine. The trial before injecting the muscle with caffeine was the controll trial, and the trial after injecting with caffeine was the treatment trial. We took the average of the contraction period lengths and used a paired t test to determine if there is a statistically significent difference between the contraction period lengths for the treatment and controll trials.


Results:
The results of our paired t test gave us a t value of 27.14 and a p value of 6.07 x 10-10. These results are indicative of an extremely statistically significent difference in contraction period length for the controll and treatment groups, with that of the treatment group being much larger. As a result of this, we must reject the null hypothesis. We observed the trend that as caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus of a frog, the muscle contracted for a much larger period of time. In both trials, the injection of caffeine into the muscle resulted in chemically induce tetany, in which the muscle did not relax for several minutes. The muscle was far shorter in length while in chemically induced tetany than when it was relaxed. Also, it was extremely tense and hard compared to the relaxed muscle. For the first frog leg, the muscle contraction amplitude for the chemically induced tetany was 1.089 Volts. For the second frog leg, the muscle contraction amplitude for the chemically induced tetany was 1.180 Volts. For the first frog leg, the amplitude of the minimum stimulus threshold for contraction was 0.4 Volts, so for the experiment we used a threshold of 0.5 Volts. For the second frog leg, the threshold was 0.16 Volts, so for the experiment we used a threshold of 0.2 Volts. This information can be seen in figure 3. It is important to note that the average contraction period lengths for the controll trials differed by a small amount, with that of the first frog leg being larger than that of the second frog leg. This information can be seen in figures 1 and 2.

Discussion:
From our results, we are able to conclude that the average contraction period length was significently longer for the treatment trials (injected with caffeine) than for the controll trials (not injected with caffeine). Our p value (6.07 x 10-10) indicated a statistically significent difference between the averages for the two trials. Due to the fact that the muscle did not relax for several minutes, we were not able to record a value for the contraction period length, but it was very clear that the average contraction length period for the treatment group was much larger than that of the controll group. Since we were not able to record values for the contraction period length for the treatment group, we entered zeros for those values in the paired t test. While this may have changed the results of our paired t test a little bit, it did not change the fact that our results indicated a significent difference between the two groups. Our results are due to the effects that caffeine has on muscle contraction. Normally, when a muscle contracts the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum causes the activation of troponin. As a result of this activation, troponin moves tropomyosin away from the actin/myosin binding sites on the actin. Following this, heads of myosin, which are powered by ATP, bind to actin resulting in muscle contraction. During this time, a pump known as the calcium ATPase is pumping the calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Once all of the calcium is back in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the tropomyosin recovers up the bonding sights and cross bridges formed by the myosin heads release. This results in muscle relaxation. When a muscle is injected with caffeine, it can not relax for several minutes due to the fact that caffeine inhibits the calcium ATPase from functioning properly. As a result, the calcium is not pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Since calcium is still present in the binding site area, the troponin continues to keep tropomyosin away from the bonding sites which allows the muscle to stay contracted. This could be seen in our experiment, for when the frog legs were injected with caffeine they entered chemically induced tetany. This was due to the fact that the calcium pump was inhibited by the caffeine, and as a result the calcium did not go back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This caused the gastrocnemus of the frogs to stay contracted for several minutes. In comparison to the controll trials (had contraction period lengths on average shorter than 0.1 seconds), the treatment trials had much larger contraction period lengths (several minutes). According to other experiments involving caffeine and muscle contraction, when caffeine is administered into skeletal muscle, the resulting contraction is sustained in comparison to a muscle contraction where caffeine is absent. This is due to the fact that the concentration of caffeine near the bonding sight is greater for a longer period of time than normal [Olorunshola:2011]. It is important to understand all of this information because when consumed, the effects that caffeine has on the human body can be both beneficial and detrimental. For example, many athletes find that taking caffeine improves their performance during endurance sports. While the consumption of caffeine may be beneficial to some athletes, it also can have negative effects on people. For example, it is common knowledge that the consumption of caffeine products can increase one’s risk for coronary heart disease, anxiety, and sleep disorders [Olorunshola:2011]. Due to all of this, it is important to understand how the drug effects one’s body. The next logical step to take for this study would be to expand the sample size and administer varying levels of caffeine. Doing this would allow for us to gain a better understanding as to how caffeine affects muscle contraction period lengths. Also, if we were to do this experiment again we could make sure that we recorded the exact contraction period length for the trials that resulted in chemically induced tetany. Doing this would further improve the accuracy of our p value and our experiment. In conclusion, it is important to understand how drugs such as caffeine affect the human body, because if a large percentage of the population uses them then it is essential to make sure they are not extremely detrimental towards one’s health.
