Title: The effect of Azaguard (Insect Growth Regulator) stunts the growth of (Manduca sexta)

Abstract:
For (Manduca sextas) (hornworms) to metamorphisize into an adult the hormones in their body must be in sync to the different stages of their life. Juvenile hormone is present throughout every life stage of hornworms up until the end of the 5th instar larva. An increased exposure to a juvenile hormone mimicking agent (Azaguard) was hypothesized to stop or decrease the amount of growth that a hornworm has. After a week of feeding the hornworms either regular food, or food treated with Azaguard, it was determined that the presence of juvenile hormone decreases the amount growth the hornworms exhibit. This experiment is important to see the significance of hormones within insects and within vertebrates. 


Introduction:
In (Manduca sextas), a moth that begins its life as a tobacco hornworm, growth and molting is controlled by various hormones present or not present in their bodies. Nutrition and hormones are the main factors that regulate insect growth and development [Thounaojam; 2017]. One hormone that is present from the 1st instar larva to the 5th instar stage is juvenile hormone (JH). A decrease in JH should signal a molt in the hornworms and it should allow the hornworms to grow in size. In various biological events in insects JH is critical for regulating things such as reproduction and development [El-Sheikh; 2011]. Without JH decreasing in the 5th instar larva stage, the hornworms would not be able to metamorphisize into adults and reproduce which would be detrimental to the organism’s overall fitness. The presence of juvenile hormone is needed in order to keep the hornworms in a state where they can feed easily to ensure they will have enough energy to pupate into adults. The hormone inhibits what is needed for morphogenesis and does it without help from ecdysteroid [Truman; 2006]. In this experiment, the independent variable was the Azagurad in the food or the food with no treatment; and the dependent variable was the amount of growth the hornworms had. The objective of this experiment was to determine if juvenile hormone affects the amount of hornworm growth and to see if it affects the timing at which it molts. The null hypothesis was that an increased presence of JH will not affect the amount growth of the hornworms. The alternate hypothesis was that an increase in JH will affect the amount of growth in the hornworms. 


Materials and Methods:
Four containers with perforated lids were obtained along with four index cards, eight (Manduca sextas) (tobacco hornworms), eighty grams of food for tobacco hornworms, and Azaguard. Two hornworms were placed in each container separated by an index card, one hornworm was given food untreated and the other was given food treated with Azaguard. The caterpillars were to be fed everyday however, the group gave the entirety of the food at the beginning of the experiment. Each caterpillar was given ten grams of food on day one of the experiment but, before distributing the food, the control and treatment food had to have a drop of water for each gram of food. However, the treatment group received ten percent of the water added as Azaguard. The caterpillars were weighed each day and observations were taken of their appearance and the amount of molting that occurred. The differences in weight gain in the two groups were analyzed through the statistical two sample t-test. The p-value derived from this test told the group if the results were statistically significant or not. 


Results:
Once collecting the weights of the tobacco hornworms every day for a week, it was noticed that at the end of the seven days the average weights for the treatment group caterpillars were much smaller compared to the control group caterpillars. A two-sample t-test showed that there was a difference in the differences of weights after seven days with a p-value of 0.02. Figure 1 displays the weight gains of each group over the span of seven days. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported by the results of the experiment. It was expected that the treatment group would have lower weights than the control and little to no weight gain. The p-value for the change in weight over the course of a week showed that there was a difference in control and treatment weights due to something other than chance. This difference in weight is due to the Azagurad given to the treatment group. Since Azaguard mimics the juvenile hormone found in (Manduca sextas) up until the 5th instar larva stage, the hornworms remained in that stage and did not grow because the hormone was present to inhibit growth. This could relate back to what El-Sheikh states how juvenile hormone affects the development of the hornworms and delays the molt from the 5th instar larva to the pupa stage [El-Sheikh; 2011]. A lack of juvenile hormone signals the hornworm to grow, molt, and pupate for the next stage of their lives. This experiment shows that the presence of juvenile hormone affects the growth of hornworms by stopping it or slowing it down. Given the chance to redo the experiment, the food should be given to the hornworms daily rather than given ten grams all at once. This would have prevented any weight loss at the end if they were given food regularly than being allowed to eat most at the beginning of the week. This experiment is important in showing how hormones control life stages in insects and also in vertebrates. Hormones are key for many organisms and their growth which is why this experiment is significant in seeing the effect of an increase of one hormone in hornworms.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This graph displays the average weight gained over the course of seven days for each group. Although the treatment group started off with a higher average weight of hornworms, the control caterpillars’ weight surpassed the treatment group. The control group gained much more weight than the treatment group. The error bars display the results as statistically significant by not intersecting.
