Title: The Effect of Salinity on the Root:Shoot Ratio of Field Pea Plants

Abstract:
This lab report is on salinity's effects on the root:shoot ratio of field pea plants. In this lab report, I hypothesized that plants watered with salt water would have a significently different root:shoot ratio then plants watered with regular water. To conduct this experiment, my lab group planted field pea plants in soil and watered them with either salt or regular water over the course of two weeks. After measuring the plants at the end of two weeks, we found that the root:shoot ratio for both length and weight of the controll plants and experimental plants was very similar to each other. Also, the P-values for each plant was not P ≤ 0.05. Therefore, the experiment was not statistically significent, and the null hypothesis was rejected.

Introduction:
For this lab, my group designed an experiment to test the effects of salinity on plants. Salinity describes the concentration of dissolved salt in water. Salinity is a major environmental factor limiting plant growth [Allakhverdiev:2000]. Therefore, I hypothesize that plants watered with salt water will have a different root:shoot ratio then plants watered with regular water. In this experiment the independent variable is the type of water being used and the dependent variable is the root:shoot ratios of the plants. This lab is important because it allows people to see the effect salt water has on plant growth which is necessary to know in order to determine plant growth in coastal or arid areas.


Materials and Method:
To begin, my lab group planted multiple field pea seeds into four different pots. Next, we poured 50 Ml of miracle grow into every pot. After this, we labeled two pots as controll and two as experimental in order to keep track of which pot gets what type of water. Then we watered the seeds in the pot labeled "controll" with 100 Ml of normal water and watered the seeds in the pot labeled "experimental" with 100Ml of water containing 1.3 g/L of salt. We continued this watering process every day over the course of the next two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, we recorded our observations about the differences between the controll plants and the experimental plants. To take the measurements of all of the plants we first collected all of our samples of plants at the end of the two weeks. From each pot we used two plants to take measurements from. Therefore, we used four samples to take measurements from controll plants and four samples to receive data from the experimental plants, to minimize the error margin. After we selected a sample plant, we cut it in order to separate the roots from the shoot. We determined that the root ended where the plant turned from white to a red color. We weighed the roots and the shoot separately in a scale to determine their mass in grams. We then used a regular ruler to measure the length of the root and shoot in centimeters. The root:shoot ratio was then calculated by dividing the root value by the shoot value. The data we calculated included the root:shoot ratio for both the mass and length of the plant as well as the standard deviation and average. Finally, we used a two-sample t_test to determine if the experiment was statistically significent. 

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of controll plants was 0.44 and the mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.4375 (Fig.1). The mean root:shoot ratio for length in the controll plants was 0.72 and the mean root:shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.7525 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for mass in the controll plants was 0.0447 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.0286 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for length in controll plants was 0.0908 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.1264 (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean of the length controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 0.3617, d.f. = 26, P = 0.7299). The mean of the weight controll group was also not statistically significently different than that of the weight experimental group (t_stat = 0.8119, d.f.= 6, P = 0.4479). When observing the plants on the final day, there was not much visible difference. They appeared to be around the same height. Also, the leaves of both the experimental and the controll plants had the same luminosity and green color. As a result of this experiment, both the controll and experimental plants had around the same length and weight (Fig.1). Overall, the controll and the experimental plants had the same pattern of growth.

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that plants watered with salt water and plants watered with normal water will have significently different root:shoot ratios was not supported in this experiment. In order for the root:shoot ratios to be statistically significent my P values had to be P ≤ 0.05. My P-values were P = 0.7299 for length and P = 0.4479 for mass. Due to my P-values not being P ≤ 0.05, my null hypothesis was rejected. This is a confusing result due to the fact that usually salinity is an environmental factor that limits plant growth [Allakhverdiev:2000]. After further research, I found that the salt taken up by plants does not directly controll its growth. Rather, salt will build up in old leaves over time which causes them to eventually die, therefore, affecting the overall plant growth [Munns: 1993].  Most plants are only affected by salinity over a long period of time such as multiple weeks or years rather than days [Munns and Termaat: 1986]. Based off of this information, a possible source of error in this experiment would be the number of days it was preformed over. In order to see a significent difference between the controll and experimental plants, this experiment would have needed to be performed over the course of multiple weeks or even year, rather than only fourteen days. Another possible source of error would be the amount we watered the plants. Had we decided to water the experimental plants with more than 100Ml of salt water a day, there may have been a larger difference between the controll and the experimental plants. This experiment is relevant because it lends valuable insight to plants growing in areas containing a high salt concentration. For example, knowing how certain types of plants react to salt is an important component in building dunes to protect communities on the beach.
