Title: Visual exposure to the Poecilia reticulata fish Increases agnostic behavior in the Betta splendins fish

Abstract:
The effects of pollution to Earth’s oceans are ever increasing, with the Great Pacific garbage patch’s plastic accumulation preventing plankton and algae growth, threatening the entire ecosystem. To mitigate the consequences of human behavior, the impacts of these actions upon the needs of specific species must be understood. Animal behavior can be used to understand whether or not the needs of an organism are being met. To test the impact of another fish, the Poecilia reticulata, on the behavior of a Betta splendins fish, an experiment was performed in which Bettas were visually exposed to Poecilia reticulata. It was hypothesized that when a male Betta fish was visually exposed to another fish species, the Poecilia reticulata fish, the Betta would exhibit aggressive behavior more so than when it was not exposed visually to another fish species. When a paired t_test was performed on the results, the p_value was 0.0208 with an alpha-value of 0.05 and a t-value of 6.83. Through this, it was determined that there was a significent difference between the two treatments. 


Introduction:
With human influences constantly altering animal ecosystems, it is crucial to understand animal behavior in order to interpret the needs and challenges of different species in the wild. This deeper species understanding can be gained through observation of intraspecies interactions, behaviors exhibited in the presence of other members of a species, and interspecies interactions, behaviors exhibited in the presence of member of another species. One species with distinct intra and interspecies interactions is the Betta splendins fish, which exhibits colorful displays and aggressive behavior in the presence of other individuals. Simpson’s 1968 study of the Betta determined that many factors, including the body length, species, and facing direction of other fish all impact Betta behavior [Simpson: 1968]. Thus, individuals of other species may influence the reactions and subsequent agnostic behaviors of the Betta splendins fish. Their behaviors can be observed and categorized in terms of their aggressiveness in order to objectively quantify the reactions and to identify the different behaviors exhibited based on changes of different body areas. It can be hypothesized that when a male Betta fish is visually exposed to another fish species, the Poecilia reticulata fish, the Betta will exhibit aggressive behavior more so than when it is not exposed visually to another fish species. 


Materials and Method:
Obtain a male Betta fish, place into a tank with water. Observe the fish for 5 minutes alone as the controll treatment. Repeat this twice more. Next, insert a clear plastic and oquae plastic divider. Place a Poecilia reticulata fish on the other side of the opaque plastic divider. Lift the opaque divider, and observe the Betta’s behavior for 5 minutes. Let it rest with the opaque divider back in the tank for 5 minutes. Repeat lifting the opaque divider and observing the Betta for 5 minutes twice more, followed by a 5-minute break each time. Quantify the observed aggressive behaviors, as pelvic fin flickering has a value of 1, tail beating has a value of 2, tail flashing has a value of 3, erect pectoral fins has a value of 4, spread gill covers has a value of 5, “red mane” has a value of 6, and all agnostic behaviors, including raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, and darting, all have a value of 7. Sum these behavioral values to come to a single behavioral value for the trial. Find the mean of the 3 trials for each treatment. Analyze this data using a paired t_test. 


Results:
The average behavioral value of the Betta fish was higher in the treatments with visual exposure to the Poecilia reticulata than the average of treatments without this visual stimulus. The average behavioral value in the Poecilia reticulata exposure treatments was 25.67 (Figure 1). The average behavioral value in the treatments lacking this visual stimulus was 0 (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the Poecilia reticulata treatment was 6.506, while the standard deviation for the treatment lacking visual stimulus was 0 (Figure 1). The p_value was 0.0208 with an alpha value of 0.05 and a t-value of 6.83. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that the male Betta fish visually exposed to another fish species would exhibit more aggressive behavior than a Betta fish without this stimulus was supported by the findings of this experiment, as the data was found to be statistically different. The fish may have exhibited this behavior as Betta’s are territorial and the Poecilia reticulata was infringing upon the Betta’s area. In order to defend this area, the Betta exhibited agnostic behaviors in order to scare the Poecilia reticulata off.  Bronstein’s 1984 study of male Bettas yielded similar findings, as longer residency within the tank lead to an agnostic advantage between Bettas [Bronstein: 1984]. Because in this experiment the Betta was within the tank longer and thus had a greater duration of residency, the Betta perceived the Poecilia reticulata as invasive and, similar to what Bronstein found, displayed greater agnostic behavior. Another factor contributing to the Betta’s behavior may have been the size of the Poecilia reticulata. As the Poecilia reticulata is a smaller fish, the larger Betta may have seen itself as capable of winning in a physical altercation, and thus exhibited aggressive behavior. Bronstein, again, found that large body size produced an agnostic advantage, meaning that greater agnostic behavior was exhibited [Bronstein: 1984]. The greater agnostic behavior exhibited may indicate the Betta’s dominance compared to other fish, in this case the Poecilia reticulata. If the Betta perceived itself of capable of losing, it may not have exhibited this behavior. Finally, the bright coloring of the guppy is similar to that of other male Bettas, possibly contributing to confusion about the species of the fish. Thus, the Betta may have exhibited this behavior as it saw the Poecilia reticulata to be of its own species and, as such, saw it to be a direct threat. However, Lissman’s well known 1933 experiments came to the conclusion that color had no effect on agnostic behavior [Lissman: 1933]. Similarly, Johnson’s 1973 study of the behavior of Betta fish found that they engage in agnostic behavior and altercations with fish, regardless of the species, sometimes fighting with fish of another species for over an hour [Jonhson: 1973]. Thus, the factor of color was likely not what drove the male Betta’s within this experiment to display agnostic behavior, as it has been determined that Bettas engage with fish of all species, regardless of coloring. The characteristics of both fish, including the Betta’s territorial nature and the Poecilia reticulata’s small stature led to the aggressive behavior of the Betta. Understanding what the Betta perceives as a threat leads to greater species understanding and to a greater understanding of its needs.

Figure 1: Graph displaying the average behavioral values for the Poecilia reticulata exposure treatment and the lack of visual stimulus treatments of the Betta fish. The Poecilia reticulata treatment had an average behavioral value of 25.67 while the lack visual stimulus treatment had an average behavioral value of 0. The error bars represent the standard deviation, which was 6.507 for the Poecilia reticulata group and 0 for the lack of stimulus group. The p_value was 0.0208 with an alpha value of 0.05 and a t-value of 6.83, and thus there was a significent difference between the two treatments.
