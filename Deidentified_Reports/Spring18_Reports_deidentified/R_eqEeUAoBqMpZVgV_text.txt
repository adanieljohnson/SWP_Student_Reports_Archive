Title: The Effects of Insect Growth Regulators on the Manduca Sexta (tobacco hornworms)

Abstract:
Hormones are fundamental to the growth of various mammals and insects. Ecdysterone and Juvenile hormones work as a pair to regulate the molting of the Manduca Sexta. Applying Insect Growth Regulators alter the physiology of the insect that are crucial for development. The application of Martin’s IGR was mixed into the food of the Manduca Sexta. The results determine that there was a significent difference of weight gain. There was no significent difference when comparing length elongation. The experiment proved that IGR affects the growth rate in relation to the weight of the caterpillars. 


Introduction:
Ecdysterone and Juvenile hormone are essential hormones that affect the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of an insect. Ecdysterone is secreted by the prothoracic glands, which regulates the timing of molting. The Juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allata, it regulates the type of molt. These hormones work in unison to allow the insect to pupate, this is called the commitment pulse. During this process, there is a rise of Ecdysterone while the Juvenile hormone maintains a decreased level. [Johnson, 2018]
In this experiment we used the Manduca sexta. The insect is of the Order Lepidoptera. The life cycle of this insect is approximately 39 to 48 days. It transitions between five instars before it pupates and becomes an adult. [Johnson, 2018] We decided to work with Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs). IGRs are a diverse group of insecticides, with a range of effects on insect, disrupting the growth and development of insect. They mainly affect the development of immature stages, and disrupt metamorphosis and reproduction and are becoming more important in the management of insect pests. [Al-Mekhlafi, 2012]
We conducted an experiment on Manduca Sexta’s to determine how applying IGR could affect their growth rates by measuring weight and length. If we add Martin’s IGR to the caterpillars in the treatment group, then we expect the caterpillars in the controll group that are given distilled water to have higher growth rates. 


Materials and Method:
The experiment was carried out by using the tobacco hornworms, they were stored in an incubator for the whole length of the experiment. The experiment took place in a span of seven days. We chose a total of eight caterpillars, that weighed approximately 1-1.5 grams each. There were two groups, each group contained four caterpillars. The placed two caterpillars in one plastic container, that was divided by an index card, a total of four containers. We maintained two containers for the controll group and two containers for the experimental group. 
Each caterpillar was given 10 grams of caterpillars about every two days. The food was mixed with distilled water or IGR, depending on the group. Each time the food was replaced, we applied five drops via a pipet to the food and mixed it with a clean spoon. To avoid, cross contamination we used two different pipets to avoid the treatment group from getting mixed up with the controll group substance. In addition, we took each caterpillars initial weight and length. Consequentially, we measured the weight in grams and length of the caterpillars in millimeters daily. A paired t_test was used, which allowed us to compare our data and obtained a p_value.


Results:
The treatment group that received Martin’s IGR was determined to have a significent difference based on weight gain (t_stat= 2.54, P=0.44). Interestingly, there was no significent difference based on length elongation (t_stat= 3.33, P=0.75). 

Discussion:
Based on our result, our statistical hypothesis based on weight has been accepted. Meanwhile, the statistical hypothesis based on length was denied. The treatment group growth rate affected their ability to pupate. In relation, other studies have found that IGR can have a detrimental effect on the rate of pupation. Other types specific types of IGR such as pyriproxyfen and fenoxycarb have shown to affect the pupation rate. [Wang, 2016] Furthermore, we noticed that the treatment group was a lighter shade of green when compared to the controll group. The controll group maintained a dark shade of green and appeared to be larger in width. The controll group experienced more weight gain than the treatment group. The IGR did not seem to affect the length of the treatment group. Both groups maintained a steady length throughout the experiment. 
One discrepancy was found, one of the controll group caterpillars ate through the index card and joined the caterpillar on the other side. Furthermore, that finding did not affect the data. For future experiments, we suggest using a more sturdy and impermeable divider to avoid any miscalculations. Additionally, the experiment allowed us to comprehend the effect that different substances can have on vital hormones that influence the physiology of an insect.
