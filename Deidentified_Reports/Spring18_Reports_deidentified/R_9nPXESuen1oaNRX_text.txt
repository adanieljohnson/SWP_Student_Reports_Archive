Title: The Impact of Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
      Juvenile hormone (JH) is important in insect’s development and molting. The dropping of JH level signals the insect to pupation. In this experiment, we want to find out how extra JH in 4th and 5th instar stage affects the growth of Manduca sexta. We applied M. sexta in our experimental group with food mixed with JH alternative Martin IGR. We hypothesized that the M. sexta without extra JH in their food would gain more weight compared to the M. sexta with extra JH in their food in 5th instar stage. Our hypothesis is supported by our result. Further study can be done to see how increasing amount of JH in the 5th instar stage influences M. sexta, or how the inhibition of JH in early instar stage influences M. sexta.

Introduction:
	Hormone plays important roles in insect’s development and reproduction. Juvenile hormone (JH) is known for its critical role in insect’s development and molting (Lab Manual, p11). For, some insect species, JH also affects polyphenisms (Riddiford, 2012). Normally, JH is secreted by insects in their early larval stage. After larvae reaching their critical weight, JH secretion stops. The decreasing level of JH signals the secretion of the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which stimulates the release of ecdysone that prepares the larvae for pupation (Riddiford, 2012). We wanted to study how extra JH would affect the development of insects. We chose 4th instar Manduca sexta as our study subject, because M. sexta has a relatively short life cycle (4 days in the 4th instar stage, and 5 days in 5th instar stage), and it is abundant in nature. For M. sexta, JH level stays high in first four instar stage, and it drops when M. sexta enters the 5th larval stage, in which M. sexta accumulates most of its body weight. The body weight of a caterpillar varies from 1.1g to 11g in 5th instar stage (Lab Manual, p7&12). We used Martin IGR to simulate the effect of JH on M. sexta caterpillars. We predicted that extra JH in 5th instar stage would slow down the accumulation of weight in M. sexta larvae, and would affect the coloration of M. sexta larvae. We hypothesized that the group of M. sexta larvae with extra JH intake would gain less body weight compared to M. sexta without extra JH in their 5th instar stage.

Materials and Method:
	Our study subjects were 8 4th instar M. sexta caterpillars. We randoMly assigned these 8 caterpillars into 2 groups of 4. We placed 2 caterpillars in one rearing box and separated them by an index paper. Each caterpillar was fed with 10 grams of food obtained from “Great Lakes Manduca” per day. For the controll group, every 10 grams of food was mixed evenly with 10 drops of distilled water (approximately 10 μL per drop). For the experimental group, every 10 grams of food was mixed evenly with 10 drops of 4% Martin IGR solution (approximately 10 μL per drop). The caterpillars were kept in an incubator with a constant temperature of 37°C. In each day, we measured the weight of each caterpillar. Also, we replaced the old food with new food every day for each caterpillar. After 7 days, we calculated the average change between initial and final weight of each group. We ran a two-sample t_tests on weight differences at the beginning and the end of experiment between controll group and experimental group. We took a 95% confidence interval for statistical tests.

Results:
	The average weight change of controll and experimental group over 7 days is shown in the figure 1. The average weight difference (the average weight each caterpillar gained during the experiment) is higher for the controll group (9.46g) compared to the experimental group (7.94g). The difference between two averages is statistically significent (t=4.068, p=0.0066). We observed that caterpillars in the controll group were in bright green color; caterpillars in the experimental group were paler.

Discussion:
	Our result indicated that caterpillars in the controll group gained more weight in 7 days compared to the experimental group. The difference in average weight change between two groups is statistically significent for a 95% confidence interval. Thus, our hypothesis that the JH would slow down the growth and would result in less body weight gain for M. sexta caterpillars in 5th larval instar is supported. JH reduced the body weight gain of caterpillars in the experimental group in the 5th instar stage. We observed pale color in experimental group compared to the bright green color in controll group. This indicates the influence of JH in polyphenism on M. sexta.
	Understanding how extra JH in 5th instar stage reduces the growth of M. sexta makes JH alternatives like Martin IGR possible pesticides. The chemicals that directly targets insects are called insect growth regulators (IGR). They are considered safer than traditional synthetic organic pesticide (Lab Manual, p14). For future experiments, we may apply a larger amount of JH on M. sexta in 5th instar stage to see how the caterpillar’s growth is affected, or we may inhibit the JH binding sites in M. sexta’s early larval stage to see if their growth stops.
