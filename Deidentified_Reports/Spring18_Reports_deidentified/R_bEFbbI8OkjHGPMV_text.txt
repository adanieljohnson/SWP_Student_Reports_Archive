Title: The lack of changes in root to shoot growth in Vigna radiata treated with hydrogen peroxide versus water to demonstrate how plants allocate resources under environmental stress

Abstract:
This experiment set out to demonstrate the effects of hydrogen peroxide on Vigna radiata, or mung beans, over a two-week period. Plant species have evolved complex ways to allocate energy and metabolic resources in response to biotic and abiotic stress. Plants produce hydrogen peroxide during photosynthesis and photorespiration as a more stable and less reactive oxidative species. By treating 3 pots of plants with a solution of 10mm hydrogen peroxide and 3 control pots with water, it was predicted that the treatment group would have a significant difference in root to shoot weight and length ratios. This is because hydrogen peroxide can influence plant growth and development. The results of the study did not support the hypothesis because the difference in root to shoot weight and length ratios between the plants treated with water and the plants treated with hydrogen peroxide was not statistically significant. The experiment demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide can help plants respond to abiotic and biotic stress by initiating stress-regulating genes. It is important to understand the benefits and detriments of treating plants with hydrogen peroxide to create more efficient farming techniques. 


Introduction:
In nature various biotic and abiotic factors influence the ways in which plants allocate energy resources. To survive, plants need essential resources like sunlight, nitrogen, water, and nutrients from the soil. Different plant species have different resource limitations, based on their environment, that affect the plants’ phenotypic plasticity (Agarwal, et al; 2006). In this lab, the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) exposure in Vigna radiata, or mung bean plants, was investigated. Mung beans are a legume native to India, and are widely grown and consumed as sprouts or dry beans (Singh, et al; 2007). Hydrogen peroxide is found naturally in plants because it is produced in plant cells during photosynthesis and photorespiration. During these processes, hydrogen peroxide is used as a signaling molecule and a gene expression regulator because it is a more stable reactive oxidative species (Quan, et al; 2008). When plant species are experiencing abiotic or biotic stress, there is an increase in the cellular concentration of less stable reactive oxygen species, which are converted to hydrogen peroxide (Neill SJ, et al., 2002). The purpose of this lab was to determine the effects of increased hydrogen peroxide concentrations in mung bean plants. This is important because certain amounts of hydrogen peroxide have been found to aid with seed germination and plant growth, which could be beneficial to farmers and gardeners (Jafariyan, Zarea; 2016). Preliminary data has demonstrated that mung bean plants are affective in responding to their environment, when placed in nutrient deficient soil. The results of that experiment suggested nutrient stress will increase the root to shoot ratios when looking at weight. In this lab, the treatment group that was watered with a hydrogen peroxide solution was expected to mimic the effects of oxidative stress in plants (Hossain; 2015). It was predicted that oxidative stress would inhibit plant growth and development in the treatment group and result in a difference in the root to shoot ratios for both length and weight from the group that only received water.


Materials and Methods:
The plant samples were prepared by filling six plastic trays with nutrient rich soil. The mung bean seeds were placed in water for ten minutes before placing them into the plastic trays. About 50 seeds were placed into each tray, underneath a layer of soil, and were then watered and treated with 50mL of miracle grow. The six plant trays were placed in the greenhouse under regulated climatic conditions. For this experiment the six trays were separated into two groups of three. For the first week, each group was watered at the same time every day with only water (H₂O). After one week, once the seedlings had germinated, the treatment group was watered with a diluted solution of 3% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) every other day. On the days in between the H₂O₂ treatments the plants were treated with only H₂O. To prepare the H₂O₂ solution, 50mL of the 3% H₂O₂ solution was diluted with H₂O to a 10mm solution. The 3 trays in the control group continued to be treated with only H₂O. After 2 weeks, 9 larger plants per each treatment group (18 plants total) were harvested by carefully pulling them out of the trays. The roots were gently washed with water and then patted dry using paper towels. Each plant was weighed before being cut at the end of the root marks, where the shoots began. The roots and shoots of all the plants were then weighed and measured to determine the root to shoot ratios of each group. The data from the three sample plants of each tray was averaged. After the experiment, the statistical significance of the averaged data between the two conditions was determined using a two tailed t-test. 


Results:
The results demonstrate that there was not a difference in weight between the plants that were treated with H2O2 or water (see Table 1). There are no general trends between treatment groups of the average root: shoot weight and length ratios among each of the three pots (Figure 1 and 2). Using a significance level of 0.1, the mean root: shoot weight ratio of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the group that was treated with hydrogen peroxide (t-stat = 0.427, df = 16, P = 0.675). The mean root: shoot length ratio was significant when using a significance level of 0.1, but was not significantly different between the two treatment groups when using a significance level of 0.05 (t-stat = 1.79, df = 16, P = 0.092). 


Discussion:
The results demonstrate that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide utilized in this experiment had no major effect on plant growth and development. Specifically, looking at root to shoot ratios with this concentration of H2O2 was not a good indicator of phenotypic plasticity or resource allocation under oxidative stress. The results could have been a result of the short duration of the study, or the concentration of hydrogen peroxide that was used. In addition, studies have found that hydrogen peroxide can act as a signaling molecule in plants that can initiate the expression of stress-responsive genes (Hossain; 2015). A specific amount of hydrogen peroxide in plants can initiate stress tolerance that help cope with abiotic and biotic stressors (Quan, et al; 2008). This indicates that hydrogen peroxide can actually be beneficial to crop and plant growth when used in moderation. Further experiments would need to be conducted to determine what concentration of hydrogen peroxide is ideal and if there are long-term detrimental effects of extended hydrogen peroxide exposure in plants. It is important to investigate the mechanisms associated with abiotic and biotic stress tolerance in order to promote more environmentally sustainable agriculture.
