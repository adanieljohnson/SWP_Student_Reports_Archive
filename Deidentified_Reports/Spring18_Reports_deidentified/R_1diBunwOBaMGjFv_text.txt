Title: The Effects of Lidocaine (Sodium Channel Blocker) on Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction Threshold Voltage

Abstract:
This report examines the effect of Lidocaine on frog gastrocnemus muscle contraction threshold voltage.  The threshold voltage of each of 3 frog legs were determined with the use of Lab Scribe software, and the threshold voltages were determined again after administering lidocaine via syringe to each.  The remeasured contraction thresholds of the gastrocnemus muscle injected with lidocaine were more than twice the value of the muscle pre-lidocaine.  This report also offers insight into the effect of lidocaine on the biochemical and physiological levels. 

Introduction:
The following is a basic anatomical overview of skeletal muscle.  Skeletal muscle consists of myofibrils bound together in functional units by connective tissue. Motor neurons innervate these skeletal muscles and branch out into individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions [1].  Essentially, muscle contraction/shortening is directly caused by the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the post synaptic muscle fiber which was triggered by an acetylcholine induced action potential in which sodium ions depolarize the presynaptic neuron followed by repolarization by potassium ions.  
A study like the one we performed utilized a magnetic field generated by a current on a coil.  The current was applied to 12 human scalps, causing contraction in each person’s hands.  A single scalp stimulus produced twitches in 3 separate hand muscles [2].  It was found that the force of the twitch/contraction as well as the recorded action potentials from each of the muscles were enhanced by voluntary background contractions of the hand muscles.  A minor conclusion from this experiment supporting preexisting theories was that there must be threshold stimulus for voluntary activation of muscle.  Our experiment attempts to explore a method by which this threshold stimulus may be altered.
The biological question that this study investigates is: What are the effects of lidocaine on the threshold stimulus for contraction in frog gastrocnemus muscle? We hypothesized that if Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker, the threshold voltage for contraction should increase.  This hypothesis is mainly based on the perceived role that the influx of sodium ions plays in the initiation of muscle contraction. The null hypothesis we tested was that lidocaine will not affect the threshold voltage, and the alternate hypothesis was that it will be changed. 


Materials and Method:
Essential Equipment:
PC/Mac computer with Lab Scribe Software downloaded, 3 frog legs, 6 scapold pins, scapold, scissors, dissection tray, ringer solution, lidocaine solution, thread, syringe, disposable probes and stimulating electrodes, SMT-220 Striated Muscle Transducer, gloves. 
Procedure
•	Using scapold, dissected each frog leg by: moisturizing with ringer, peeling back skin and ripping it off, spreading the quadriceps and exposing the sciatic nerve, detaching the gastrocnemus and cutting along the achilles tendon with scissors
•	Tied the thread around the achilles tendon, cut off excess tendon with scissors, hung the dissected leg to the force transducer by the thread, and tightened the transducer to create tension
•	Utilized the scapold pins to pin down the femur
•	Tied the two electrodes around the gastrocnemus—black on the bottom, red on the top
•	Stimulated the muscle with Lab Scribe to determine the threshold voltage, which is the minimum voltage causing contraction. Refreshed the settings to the beginning and determined a 2nd and 3rd value. These were the controll group measures
•	Administered a 2Ml shot of lidocaine via syringe into the middle of the gastrocnemus muscle
•	Waited 8 minutes for the lidocaine to have ample opportunity to take an effect
•	Stimulated the muscle again to determine 3 more threshold voltages by starting from the beginning each time. 
•	Repeated the exact same procedure again with 2 other frog legs. 

We performed a two-sample t test to compare the mean threshold voltages of the controll gastrocnemus muscles to the ones treated with lidocaine, and more specifically, to see if the results of the two groups differed significently.  The average threshold or each leg were combined to allow one comparison across the experimental groups. 


Results:
General Trends: The lidocaine significently increased the threshold for each of the 3 frog legs by more than double the original.  Essentially, each of the gastrocnemus muscles under the influence of lidocaine require a greater input voltage for a contraction to occur, than under the normal state. 

Discussion:
The results of the experiment supported our hypothesis which was that the threshold voltage for contraction in the frog gastrocnemus muscle should increase with the addition of the lidocaine (sodium channel blocker).  The results were supportive because the p_value from the two-sample t test in Table 1 to determine if the administration of lidocaine to the gastrocnemus muscle made a significent difference was 1.57E-9, meaning that the lidocaine did cause a significent difference, calling for rejection of the null hypothesis.  The addition of the lidocaine led directly to the observed results because it is a muscle relaxer.  By blocking sodium channels, the acetylcholine induced action potential that was supposed occur at the original threshold voltage did not occur because the first step of an action potential the influx of sodium ions, but this action was blocked.  However, a threshold voltage remained for sodium to make its way through and for contraction to occur, it was just at a much higher value.  
Administering lidocaine to a muscle increases its contraction threshold, meaning that a contraction requires a greater input voltage.  This is just one way in which contraction threshold can be altered, quite possibly it can be altered biochemically in the opposite direction, lowering the contraction threshold.
Our findings serve as evidence sodium and other ions play important roles in the timing of muscle contraction, and that a muscles sensitivity to a stimulus can be altered rather drastically through biochemical measures.
