Title: Possible phenotypic plasticity in Fagopyrum esculentum in response to levels of sunlight

Abstract:
Phenotypic plasticity, the ability of plants to adapt their phenotypes to different environments, is known to occur in some plant species as a response to different levels of sunlight availability. This study attempted to discern whether Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) would exhibit adaptive phenotypic plasticity when grown in conditions of higher or lower sunlight, with the expectation that samples grown in lower light would allocate proportionally more biomass towards their photosynthetic shoots than those grown in full sunlight. We grew two groups of plants under full-sunlight and shaded conditions in a greenhouse, then measured and compared the average root:shoot (R:S) ratios of the two groups. Our data showed that the full-light and shaded groups hardly differed at all in their average R:S weight ratios and only slightly in average R:S length ratios. The latter showed a trend towards larger R:S ratios in the high sunlight group, suggesting possible adaptive plasticity. However, neither data set was statistically significant, leaving the question of adaptive plasticity in F. esculentum open to further research. 

Introduction:
Adaptive phenotypic plasticity allows plants to adjust their growth patterns to different environments in which they might be planted, resulting in variation in the observed phenotypes of plants not caused by genetic differences. It is especially important for plants to be able to alter their morphology in response to new environments because they normally cannot change the location in which they are planted [Dudley: 2004, Japhet: 2008]. Plants have demonstrated phenotypic plasticity in response to a variety of environmental conditions, including temperature, nutrients, and the presence of other plants, among others [Dudley: 2004]. It is well established that plants can show phenotypic plasticity in response to levels of sunlight in various ways, including increasing their photosynthetic efficiency [Boardman: 1977, Winn: 1991]. Plants may allocate more biomass toward areas that harvest scarcer nutrients from the environment [Frehner: 2002, Navas: 2002], which in the case of low sunlight would be the photosynthetic shoot of the plant. The principle of trade-offs in biomass allocation, which holds that because resources are always limited, allocation of more biomass to one area of a plant will necessarily mean less biomass in another area, indicates that allocating more resources towards the growth of the shoot will come at the cost of the root (the non-photosynthetic areas of the plant), yielding a lower R:S ratio.
In this research, we have explored whether different levels of sunlight cause different patterns of biomass allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat). We tried to discern whether F. esculentum would vary its morphology by devoting more of its available resources toward the capture of scarcer resources from the environment. In a low-light environment, one should expect plants with adaptive phenotypic plasticity to allocate more of their biomass towards maximizing their photosynthetic capabilities as a way of counteracting the scarcity of sunlight in the environment. Therefore, we hypothesized that F. esculentum plants grown in a condition of low light would have a lower R:S ratio than those grown in a condition of full sunlight. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to test this hypothesis, we used the root to shoot (R:S) ratio as a measure of differences in resource allocation. We planted six containers of about twenty seeds each of F. esculentum in vermiculite with Miraclegro (3.8 g/L). We placed three of the containers in a greenhouse area with full sunlight, and the other three in an area shaded on top and all sides by a shade cloth. After two weeks we harvested the plants. For each replicate we selected three individual plants. We first weighed the three plants of each group combined, then divided the collective weight by three to give the average individual weight. We then separated the roots from the shoots of the plants by cutting at the point of color change. We weighed the roots of each replicate collectively, then repeated the process of dividing by three to find the average individual root weight. We then subtracted the root weight from the total weight to derive the total and individual shoot weights. Using the individual weights, we calculated the average R:S weight ratio. We then measured the maximum root and shoot lengths of each replicate and used these to calculate the average R:S length ratio. We used a two-sample T-test to compare the means of the R:S length and weight ratios between the two groups with an ÔÅ° value of 0.05.

Results:
The R:S weight ratios showed no statistically significant difference between the high and low sunlight groups [Fig. 1]. The groups had similar means as well as high standard deviations and P values: for the high sunlight group, 0.512 +/- 0.130; for the low sunlight group, 0.523 +/- 0.051 (t = 0.136935, df = 4, P = 0.897698). The low-sunlight group showed a very slightly higher average R:S ratio than the high-sunlight group, but the high P value (P &gt; 0.05) renders this difference statistically insignificant.
	The R:S length ratios showed somewhat more variation between the high and low sunlight groups [Fig. 2], but nevertheless did not produce statistically significant results. The mean R:S ratio of the full light group was 0.733 +/- 0.109, higher than that of the shaded group with 0.596 +/- 0.062 (t = 0.136935, df = 4, P = 0.897698). Again, the standard deviation and P value for both groups were high. However, we were able to recognize a trend in the R:S length ratios, in which the full light group grew proportionally longer roots than the shaded group.


Discussion:
The slight trend toward higher R:S length ratios in the high sunlight group as compared to those of the low-sunlight group was consistent with our hypothesis. The principle of resource allocation trade-offs in phenotype expression would explain why F. esculentum plants grown in shaded conditions should expend more resources toward photosynthetic shoots in order to capture more available energy, while those grown in plentiful sunlight should be able to direct more resources toward growing roots. However, because the results were not significant, we cannot say for certain that they show adaptive plasticity. 
	Previous studies have shown that F. esculentum exhibits phenotypic plasticity in response to population density and sowing date in terms of leaf:root, leaf:mass, and stem:mass ratios [Japhet: 2008]. Shaded environments, especially when plants are grown in close proximity such that they shade each other, are known to lead to higher leaf:root ratios than those with plentiful sunlight. However, these previous studies were conducted in natural environments rather than greenhouse conditions. An experiment conducted in a controlled greenhouse on Rubia peregrina [Navas: 2002] showed no difference between plants grown in shaded and full-sunlight conditions. Another study found plastic responses to CO2 levels in plants grown in free-air but not controlled environments [Frehner: 2002]. 
	It is possible, therefore, that conducting an experiment in a controlled greenhouse environment fails to produce the natural stimuli that would induce an adaptive response in natural conditions. It may be that the full-plant shading, as provided by the shade cloth in our experiment, does not have the same effect on plants as mottled or uneven shade that they would experience in the field. Alternately, adaptive plasticity in shaded conditions may be a response to density rather than a direct response to light levels, as the shade experienced in the field would most likely result from neighboring plants. A number of studies on multiple species, including F. esculentum, have shown adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to density [Japhet: 2009, Dudley: 2004], suggesting that density may be a more influential determinant of phenotype than shade itself. 
	It could also be the case that F. esculentum exhibits phenotypic plasticity in response to varied levels of sunlight by means not measurable in biomass allocation. Previous studies have shown that plants can increase their efficiency in conducting photosynthesis by altering the size and chlorophyll content of their chloroplasts [Boardman: 1977]. Therefore, F. esculentum may respond to shade conditions by increased photosynthetic efficiency rather than shoot size. 
	Further studies with larger sample sizes might be able to produce statistically significant results showing phenotypic plasticity in biomass ratios as a response to sunlight in F. esculentum. Future research might also compare phenotypic plasticity in field and greenhouse conditions or use both mottled and fully shaded light qualities. One could also attempt to study adaptive plastic responses other than allocation of biomass, such as photosynthetic efficiency, by measuring chloroplast size and levels of chlorophyll rather than R:S ratio alone.
