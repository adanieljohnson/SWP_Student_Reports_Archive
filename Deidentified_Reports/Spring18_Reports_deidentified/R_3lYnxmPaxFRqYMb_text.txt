Title: Acetylcholine Esterase Inhibitor’s Effects on Frog Leg Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
In this lab, the effects of acetylcholine esterase inhibitor on muscle contraction were investigated. It was hypothesized based on the previous findings that when treated with AChE inhibitors, the muscle contraction period would be prolonged and the twitch amplitude would be increased. The experiment was carried out by three frog legs treated with 0.1mL Sevin, which contained AChE inhibitors Carbaryl. The result showed that there were no inconsistencies of the variable of twitch duration, and opposite trend in the variable of twitch amplitude. This might be caused by the discrepancies of the frog legs and the improper experimental design. 


Introduction:
In this lab, the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor’ effect on muscle contraction is of particular interest. In the experiment, frog leg will be used as the experimental subjects. It is known that the acetylcholine, as a common neurotransmitter, stimulates an endplate potential on the postsynaptic cell by binding to the receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane. And to stop the transmission, the ACh esterase will need to hydrolyze the ACh that bind to the receptors. AChE inhibitors inhibit the activities of AChE, thus not terminating the transmission process, resulting in the accumulation of Ach[Fatt: 1951]. As previous studies showed, with the presence of AChE inhibitors, the ACh will bind to the receptors repeatedly on their routes to leave the synaptic cleft, thus causing the prolongation of end-plate currents[Magleby: 1975]. So, it is hypothesized that the muscle contraction period will be prolonged and twitch amplitude will increase with the presence of AChE inhibitors. 


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used as the experimental subjects. They skins were teared off firstly. Then the Gastrocnemius muscles were separated from skeletons with a scissor. After that, sciatic nerve was exposed and connected to the electrodes, which are connected to iWorx TA apparatus that can produce myograms on the computer. The separated Gastrocnemius muscle was then hanged and given the tension. The muscle was stimulated by the electrodes at voltage of 0.5mV, and the amplitude and duration of the twitch generated by the stimuli was recorded from reading the myogram provided on the computer. Each frog leg was then injected with 0.1mL of sevin, which is the Ach esterase blocker, on the muscle and stimulated again to obtain the same variables. A paired T-Test was used for each set of data, a critical value of 0.05 was used. 


Results:
As shown from the figure 1 to 6, for each of the 3 frogs, the twitch duration seems to have no consistencies between different treatment groups. And according to the statistical tests, it is known that there are no statistically significant difference between the two treatment groups. However, according to the data for the twitch amplitude, there are statistically significant differences and the control groups all have higher amplitude.  


Discussion:
The result indicates that the hypothesis cannot be supported because one of the variable(twitch duration) was insignificant and inconsistent through 3 groups of subjects and the other variable(twitch amplitude) turned out to follow the opposite trend compared to the predicted one. The inconsistency of the twitch duration shows that there may be something wrong with the experimental design. As stated earlier in the method part, the duration of twitch was measured manually from the myogram on the computer. So the inconsistency of the twitch duration may be caused by manually determining the twitch period and the discrepancies of the frog legs.
