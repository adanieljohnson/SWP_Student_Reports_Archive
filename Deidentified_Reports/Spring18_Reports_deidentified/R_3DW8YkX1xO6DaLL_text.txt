Title: Impact of Tetraethylammonium chloride on Relaxation time and twitch duration of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the introduction of Tetraethylammonium chloride, a potassium channel blocker, will cause an effect on the relaxation time and twitch duration of the muscles of the Rana pipiens frog leg. It was hypothesized that larger relaxation periods and a longer twitch durations would occur when the potassium channel blocker was administered. Electrical impulses were fired into 3 frog legs and twitch duration and relaxation period for 3 myograms are recorded and interpreted before and after the potassium channel blocker is inserted. The data indicated that muscles contraction after the potassium channel blocker had longer relaxation periods and larger twitch durations. It can be concluded that our results did support the hypotheses.


Introduction:
The Rana pipiens , also known as the Northern Leopard Frog, is a great animal to observe neuromuscular interaction and muscle contraction in [Rogers: 2012]. When nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, they promote the release of acetylcholine (ACh). Acetylcholine proceeds to bind to receptors on muscle fibers which prompts to opening of sodium channel. The entrance of sodium causes depolarization in the cell. The opening of sodium channels causes the generation of action potentials which in turn prompts the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This release of calcium allows for the activation of contractile mechanism which shorten muscle (contraction) [Johnson: 2018]. Potassium allows for a muscles to begin and complete the relaxation process. . If potassium channels are blocked, muscles will have increasingly difficult time relaxing because repolarization cannot occur. The present study attempts to determine the effects of Tetraethylammonium chloride, a potassium channel blocker on the relaxation period and twitch duration on the muscles of 3  Rana pipiens frog legs. We hypothesize that a muscle that is inserted with the potassium channel blocker will have a larger relaxation periods and a larger twitch duration.


Materials and Methods:
3 Rana pipiens frog legs were skinned and cut at the Achilles tendon, exposing the gastrocnemius muscle. The muscle is suspended to a force transducing machine connected to iworx. For each leg, 2 electrodes are placed in the sciatic nerve. The stimuli parameters were set to 5 pulses at 0.8V generated at 0.5 Hz. We fired electrical impulses resulting in myograms. Twitch duration and relaxation periods were recorded for three myograms. .1 mL of Tetraethylammonium chloride was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle and a 2-minute time gap was observed before proceeding.  Electrical impulses were fired and twitch duration and relaxation period for 3 myograms were recorded. This process was repeated for the other two frog legs.


Results:
In figure 1, the data collected shows that there is a large difference between the average twitch durations for the frog legs before and after the insertion of the potassium channel blocker. In addition, figure 2 also shows that there is a large difference between the average relaxation time between the control group and the experimental group. Table 1 shows the extremely large difference between the average twitch durations for both groups (p-value of 0.009599). The second table also portrays a extremely large difference between the average relaxation times in both groups (p-value of 0.010885). 


Discussion:
After all the observations and statistical calculations have concluded, it can be determined that the results attained affirm the original hypothesis. In addition, the hypothesis was statistically supported. 

One likely source of error regards the administration of the potassium channel blocker. If the syringe is not handled properly or placed in the proper place, the full amount of  Tetraethylammonium chloride may not enter the muscle, rendering it useless and providing inaccurate myogram readings. If this experiment were to be repeated again, I would double the amount of time I would record data in addition to adding two more frog legs to the experiment. This way, we can have more data to compare our results with. 

Even if the hypothesis is supported, this experiment is a great way to portray relationships the brain, nervous system, and muscles. It also allows for a deeper understanding of some of the basic properties of the neuromuscular control
