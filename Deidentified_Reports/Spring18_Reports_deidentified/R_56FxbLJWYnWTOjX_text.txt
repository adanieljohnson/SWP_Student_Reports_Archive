Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:

I.	Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to examine the impact that increased levels of juvenile hormone had on the weight and growth of M. sexta caterpillars. Our hypothesis was that the caterpillars whose diets contained the supplement of JH would show higher weight over the course of the experiment than the controll group. Juvenile hormone is one of the key components present leading up to metamorphosis in M. sexta. According to our results, the experimental group did, in fact, gain more weight throughout the experiment. Therefore, it can be concluded that an increased amount of JH does have an impact on the overall growth of the M. sexta and its maturation.


Introduction:
II.	Introduction: 
The goal of this experiment is to examine the effects of juvenile hormone (JH) on Manduca sexta caterpillars, commonly known as tobacco hornworms. When the M. sexta reach critical weight, size during final instar prompting metamorphosis, juvenile hormone is inhibiting the release of the hormone necessary for the release of ecdysteroids which trigger metamorphological changes [Hatem, 1-2]. Along with the reduction of the juvenile hormone before the beginning of metamorphosis after the final larval stage is a reduction in food consumption [Hammock, 458]. In this experiment, we will be examining the effects of the JH analog methoprene on the weight of the caterpillars and the impact it has on the maturation process. Our controll group will be fed a normal diet throughout the experimentation process. The experimental group will receive a diet that has been supplemented with a [1: 1250] juvenile hormone percor. We will use the controll group as a baseline to which we compare the growth of the experimental group and therefore draw conclusions about the impact that the JH has on the caterpillars. The variable that we are looking to test and measure is the overall weight increase in the caterpillars over the course of the experiment. It is our belief that, due to the nature of the JH, it will inhibit or slow maturation and cause the caterpillars to grow larger throughout the course of the experiment. 


Materials and Method:
III.	Method/Procedures:
For this experiment, we selected 8 caterpillars of relatively similar sizes and split them into two groups: experimental and controll. Each group was then split into pairs and placed into a labeled containers with one caterpillar on each side of a divider. Each day, for one week, the caterpillars were each weighed and then fed 10 grams of food. The food for each caterpillar in the controll group contained 10 drops of water while the food for each of the experimental caterpillars contained 10 drops of [1: 1250] JH percor. Their weight was recorded at the time of each feeding along with the amount of food they had eaten since the time of the last feeding. At all times other than feedings, the caterpillars were placed in a 23Â°C incubator. Their initial and final weights were compared graphically. We also conducted a paired t_test on the data for the initial and final weights of both groups.


Results:
IV.	Results/Outcomes:
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the initial and final weight comparisons, in grams, of the two groups that were examined through the course of this experiment. Figure 3 shows the mean weight gain of both groups. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the weight gain over the 7 days of the controll and experimental groups respectively. Trends in all of the data showed that the weight gain of the experimental group overall was higher in general than that of the controll group. The results of our paired t_test of the controll group showed that the difference in weight from initial to final was statistically significent (d.f.=3, P= 0.0000017231). Our paired t_test of the experimental group showed that the weight difference from initial weight to final weight was statistically significent (d.f.=3, P= 0.0000100192). 


Discussion:
V.	Discussion/Observations:
We observed that over the course of the study, the experimental group tended to consume more of their food each day than the controll group. They appeared longer and lighter in color than their counterparts at the conclusion of the week. The skin of the controll group appeared glossier and darker in color while the experimental group had muted colored, matte skin. The experimental group appeared to produce more fecal matter that was also larger and lighter in color than that of the controll group throughout the experiment. According to the mean weight gain, the experimental group gained more over the course of the week. The P values that resulted from our paired t_tests were below 0.5, indicating that our results were statistically significent. This lead us to reject our null hypothesis, that the juvenile hormone would have no effect on weight gain, and accept our alternate hypothesis which said that the hormone would have an impact on the weight gain of the caterpillars. 
There are several potential sources of error for this experiment, including human error, varied timing of feeding, and uncontrolllable variables such as the caterpillars crossing the border and being in the same side of the container. On day 6 controll caterpillar #3 chewed a hole in the barrier and was halfway into the other side. Control #1 had also moved into the other side of its container at feeding time, and we are unaware of how long they had been like this. On day 7, controll #3 moved into the side belonging to #4 once again. The caterpillars moving between each other's sides created the possibility of mixing them up due to the fact that they were almost identical in appearance which would have affected the overall data for the caterpillars in question and their trend of weight gain over the week. Our goal was to feed the caterpillars at approximately 3:30 p.m. each day, and times varied by about a half hour. 
Future improvements to the experiment may be keeping each of the caterpillars in a separate container to eliminate the possibility of mix ups and any potential confusion. Their feeding could also occur at a set time without variation. The same method of weighing and scale should be used at each feeding to minimize variation in results. The experiment could also be conducted over a longer period of time with a larger sample group to increase the size of the data set and possibly improve the accuracy statistical analysis.
