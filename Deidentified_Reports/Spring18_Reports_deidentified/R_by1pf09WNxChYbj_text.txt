Title: The Effects of Martin's IGR on Manduca sexta Growth and Development Processes

Abstract:
Many different hormones in insects help with growth and development, these are called juvenile hormones and hormones that stop growth and development are called anti-juvenile hormones. An example of a juvenile growth hormone is ecdysone. To test the effect that juvenile hormone alterations have on insects, specifically the Manduca sexta, we raised eight different M. sexta. Four caterpillars were fed a normal controll diet, while four were fed a diet with added IGR hormone. We predicted that the caterpillars fed an IGR diet would grow less in length and in weight than those that were fed a normal diet. Average weight and length gain for these caterpillars were determined after a week, and using a two sample T-test, it was found that IGR does have a significent effect on M. sexta ability to gain weight but does not have a significent effect on M. sexta ability to grow in length. These results suggested that IGR has an effect on M. sexta as an acting anti-juvenile hormone.

Introduction:
The M. sexta is better known as the tobacco hornworm. M. sexta are large green caterpillars that follow the typical stages of life that most caterpillars do, these being egg, larva, pupa, and adult. M. sexta spend about three weeks of their lives going through five instar phases of being a larva. These larval body formation changes are signaled to occur due to hormonal shifts in the body. Understanding how hormones mediate the life cycle of insects is essential to understanding why insects grow and survive in the ways in which they do. The main hormones that are used to signal for large scale growth changes in the M. sexta are prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Johnson: 2018].
The prothoracicotropic hormone is produced by the corpus cardiacum which is located just behind the caterpillar's brain. This hormone is used to regulate the release of ecdysterone. Ecdysterone and the juvenile hormone work together to make the major larval changes in the M. sexta. Ecdysterone is secreted by the prothoracic glands and are used mainly to regulate the timing of molting in M. sexta. The final major hormone, the juvenile hormone, is produced by the corpus allata, and mainly regulate the type of molt that occurs [Riddiford, Hiruma, Zhou, Nelson, 2003].
The main times that these major growth hormones are used to regulate the changes in the M. sexta are between each larva instar, near the end of the 4th instar, the commitment pulse, before pupation, and as a developing adult [Johnson: 2018]. At the end of the 4th instar, ecdysteroid levels increase significently and juvenile hormone levels drop slightly. At the commitment pulse there is a very small rise in ecdysteroid levels, these indicate the caterpillar has become large enough to become a pupa. Before pupation ecdysteroid levels spike while juvenile hormone levels only increase slightly. These main hormone level changes are extremely important in M. sexta having proper development.
If steroid levels are altered in the M. sexta it can have drastic changes in the life of the caterpillar. For instance, it has been found that changes in amounts of any of these hormones can prevent growth, development, and survival of many types of insects [Staal, 1975]. IGR (insect growth regulator) hormone in previous studies has been found to be a growth inhibitor due to its nature of lowering ecdysterone levels in the caterpillar [Baker, Miller, Tsai, Jamieson, Cerf, Schooley, 1986]. These previous tests showed that caterpillars being fed IGR had both length and weight growth inhibited, leading us to wonder if we would have similar results if we were to feed these caterpillars a diet mixed with Martin's IGR. We predicted for our experiment that the M. sexta being fed a diet with Martin's IGR added to it would grow to be significently smaller in length as well as weight than those being fed a normal diet.


Materials and Method:
Eight young individuals of M. sexta with similar lengths (4-4.5cm) and weights (1.13±0.29 grams) were acquired. The eight M. sexta were then separated into two groups, a controll group of four caterpillars and an experimental group of four caterpillars. Four containers were obtained, and two M. sexta were then put into each container, one on each side being separated by an index card. Two 40-gram portions of food for M. sexta were weighed out. One 40-gram portion was mixed with five drops of water while the other portion was mixed with five drops of Martin's IGR. The portions were then divided into eight, 10-gram portions, and the water mixed food was given to the controll caterpillars while the Martin's IGR mixed food was given to the experimental group. The M. sexta were checked on daily for a week, and new food was restocked if needed. At the end of a week each M. sexta was weighed and measure and the data was analyzed by using two-tailed T-tests. If the results of the T-test had a P value of .05(5%) or below they were determined to be significent, while if they had a P value of above .05(5%) they were determined to be insignificent.


Results:
Table 1 shows the average length gain, weight gain, and P values for both experimental and controll groups, and includes the standard deviation for the weights and lengths found. It can also be seen in table 1 that the P value for length gain was found to be 0.75 while the P value for weight gain was found to be 0.044.

As can be seen in figure 1 and table 1, the average length gained by the controll group of M. sexta was 3.18±0.63 cm.
 
As can be seen in figure 1 and table 1, the average length gained by the Martin's IGR group(experimental) of M. sexta was 3.0±0.41 cm.
 
As can be seen in figure 2 and table 1, the average weight gained by the controll group of M. sexta was 8.35±0.44 g.
 
As can be seen in figure 2 and table 1, the average weight gained by the Martin's IGR group(experimental) of M. sexta was 7.1±0.87 g.

As can be seen in figure 3, the average coloration in the M. sexta that were fed Martin's IGR was much lighter and less pronounced than that of the controll group.
 


Discussion:
When it came to our experimental results, we found that Martin's IGR had a significent effect on the weight gain of M. sexta (Table 1; P=0.044). However, the Martin's IGR did not have a significent effect on the length gain of M. sexta (Table 1; P=0.75).
These results support the first prediction of our hypothesis, while they reject the second prediction of our hypothesis. While we found our results to be fairly reliable, there was one known source of error in our experiment that could have altered results. When measuring the length of the caterpillars they had a tendency to shrink or curl up due to natural adaptations for feeling stressed or under attack [Heads, Lawton, 1985]. This meant that our initial and final length measurements of these caterpillars cannot be viewed as completely accurate. 
When it came to differences between controll fed M. sexta and Martin's IGR fed M. sexta not all differences needed exact measurements to be seen. One extremely obvious difference was coloration of the caterpillars. The IGR fed M. sexta were a much lighter greenish-white in coloration. In fact, the black stripes on a healthy M. sexta were nonexistent on the IGR fed caterpillars. All of these coloration differences can be seen in figure 3. These results are fairly opposed to what was found by an experiment undertaken in 1975 [Staal, 1975]. Staal found that when adding extra IGR to the diet of corn plant hoppers (Peregrinus maidis), the normally light-colored insect began to produce black coloration in the cuticles [Staal, 1975]. However, Staal's results still emphasizes how IGR can in fact cause coloration changes in insects, a fact that supports our results of coloration change.
This experiment, while fairly simple, could lead to some long term uses. With our results showing that IGR has a significent effect on slowing or stopping the maturation of M. sexta caterpillars, many new uses can be thought of for IGR. While keeping M. sexta in juvenile stages for a longer time is more harmful than helpful due to the fact that M. sexta are more of a pest when they are caterpillars than when they are moths, not all insects follow this same trend. Many insects that are affected by IGR are far more harmful as adults than as larvae. Take for instance the Culicidae, also known as mosquitoes [Shaw, Robbins, Jones III, 2010]. When mosquitoes are larvae they are fairly harMless, however as adults not only are they an irritant, but they also are vectors for diseases such as malaria. Our experimental results proved that IGR is a growth inhibitor in insects, so if IGR could be formed into a pesticide that only affect mosquito larvae, it could be a significent aid in stopping larvae from growing into pests. This pesticide would use the knowledge that IGR acts as an anti-juvenile hormone, to prevent mosquitoes from being pests and causing problems for people before they are ever able to.
