Title: The Effect of Water Visibility on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Animals in every environment have to compete for resources like food, nutrients, territory for mating, and space to live. Organisms are required to use defense mechanisms based on the amount of competition they face in their environment. The Siamese fighting fish or Betta splendins are highly aggressive towards each other when competing for resources. These fish show multiple levels of aggression towards one another and can fight to the death. In this experiment, two male betta fish were encouraged to interact in an aquarium setting. We examined the effect of water turbidity on the aggressive behaviors towards an opponent. The levels of aggression of the fish were examined in clear water and then turbid water. Our prediction was that more turbid water would lead to less aggression in the fish. In the experiment, we found that the results of this experiment supported our hypothesis that the amount aggression is decreased when there is less water visibility. Overall, our results show that the betta fish are more aggressive to one another when they can see one another. 

Introduction:
Animal behavior, like aggression, is used to defend oneself and prevent predators or other organisms causing harm. Within each environment, every organism has to interact and compete for resources like food and territory to mate and live. They are required to interact and coexist with both abiotic and biotic factors of their environment. Competition and interaction almost requires some form of defense mechanisms by each organism. Aggression can be useful to compete for the resources necessary for survival but can also cost the fish a lot of energy. The betta fish have to allocate energy towards the aggression at a cost of not being able to use energy for other things like finding food. In this experiment, Betta splendins, a fighting fish that originated in Southeast Asia, are placed in a small aquarium environment to observe aggressive behaviors in two different water environments. Male bettas can show extreme aggression towards one another and are significently more aggressive towards each other than females (Forsatkar; 2016). This experiment tests whether turbidity of water can affect the amount of aggression. I predict that the betta fish will have quicker and more aggressive behaviors in the clean water environment. 

Materials and Method:
A sectioned aquarium with the availability of two individual slots was obtained. Two sectioned off areas were created using both a transparent glass slide and a solid white slide. One male Betta fish of similar size was placed in each side of the aquarium with both the white and glass slides separating the fish. The white slide was raised so the two fish could see one another but the glass slide was left down so they couldn't make any physical contact. The fish were able to react, and observations were written down using a point system (1x=pelvic flickering, 2x=tail beating, 3x=tail flashing, etc.) for both broadside and frontal behaviors by amount of aggression. Observations were made, and tally marks were recorded for five minutes. Immediately after five minutes, the white slide was put back into the aquarium and the fish were allowed to rest foe five minutes. This was repeated for a total of three trials. The fish had to rest for five minutes then unfertilized soil was added to the water and the fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. After the resting period, the same procedure was repeated as the clear, clean water. Then the tally marks were recorded and counted. The means and standard deviations were found for the broadside and frontal movements of both fish. A paired t_test was performed with an alpha=.05 to compare the data. 

Results:
The betta fish in clean water responded to each other with more aggressive behaviors than in the turbid water. Based on the average number of aggressive behaviors during each trial, there was a significent difference between the behaviors in the two environments. The mean amount of aggressive behavior for trials in the clear water 93.33 +/- 22.50 was greater than the mean amount of aggressive behavior in turbid water 45 +/- 15.54 (Fig. 1). In a paired t_test, the results show that there was a significent difference between the two groups (t=2.055, d.f.=3, p&lt;.05) for the aggressive behaviors between the two betta fish. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the male betta fish would have quicker and more aggressive behavior in clear water than turbid water was supported. The mean number of aggressive acts in clear water was almost twice as much as the mean number of aggressive acts in the turbid water. This could be explained by the amount of visibility in the water in the turbid water versus the clear water. The soil made the water much cloudier and the fish could have had a harder time seeing their opponent, more specifically, their size. The fish could also have had a hard time determining their territory and the limits of their territory in the aquarium due to the turbidity. Also, due to the biology of the fish, swimming in the turbid water could have been more energy consuming. They could have expressed less aggression due to energy allocation and focus on conserving energy for food. In this species of fish, there seem to be a few cues that can prompt the aggressive and agonist behavior (Romano, et al., 2017). In a similar lab, betta fish were placed in front of a mirror and this resulted in aggressive behavior towards the reflection. The fish continued their aggressive behavior in multiple trials (Frances & Hinde, 1968). This could be due to the identical size of the fish in the reflection and the mirrored behavior displayed. Betta fish tend to use this aggressive behavior to distinguish where their territory is and began in the rice patties in Southeast Asia. In their original environment, the Betta fish would fight until the death of an opponent, and this allows for competition to lead the natural selection of aggressive traits.
