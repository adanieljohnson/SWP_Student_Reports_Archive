Title: The Effect of the Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca sexta’s Growth

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is an insect that relies on the Juvenile Hormone to regulate its molting. In this experiment, we wanted to see how an increase in the hormone in the caterpillar’s diet would affect its weight over time. We believed that there would be an increase in weight when there was an increase in the Juvenile Hormone in their diet, since the hormone is highly present in the early stages of the insect’s life. However, after studying the caterpillar for 7 days, there was no significent difference in the weight change of the caterpillars who ate food mixed with methoprene, a substitute for JH, and the caterpillars who ate food mixed with water. This means additional JH, that the caterpillar consumes, has no effect on the caterpillar’s weight gain.


Introduction:
Hormones are signals that help regulate many processes undergone in an organism and are used widely in insects for growth and development. The Manduca sexta is a pest during its larval stages and turns into a moth after metamorphosis and it releases the Juvenile Hormone to regulate molting (Johnson: 2018). JH prevents metamorphosis by acting upon the Methoprene-tolerant gene (Jindra: 2013). High amounts of the Juvenile Hormone are present through the 4th larval instar because the organism needs to grow for metamorphosis (Johnson: 2018). Because of this, we wanted to test how an increase in the Juvenile Hormone in the Manduca sexta’s diet would affect its growth. During an experiment performed by Nijhout and Williams, it was discovered that as the caterpillar gained weight when there was a lower concentration of JH in the haemolymph of the Manduca sexta. They did this by extracting the haemolymph at different weights and measuring the concentration of JH (Nijhout: 1974).  This experiment showed that JH is higher during the earlier stages of the caterpillar’s life when they weight the least and during the time they are growing the most. Thus, since the Juvenile Hormone also prevents metamorphosis and is higher during these earlier stages of the organism’s life, we think that an increase in JH to the diet will cause an increase in growth.


Materials and Method:
For our experiment, we had 2 groups of 4 caterpillars with one group being the experiment group which had methoprene, a JH substitute, added to its food and a controll group that had only water added to its diet. The experimental group received 10g of food with .41 Ml of 4.1% methoprene mixed in it, while the controll group received 10g of food with 4.1 Ml of distilled water mixed in it. We checked the weight of the caterpillars every day for 7 days between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM. The independent variable was the different caterpillar’s food and the dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillar. We ran a one tailed two sample t_test at the end of the experiment comparing the average weight change of the two groups between the seven days.


Results:
As in chart one, the average weight change in the experimental group, 2.75+/- .3185, is higher than the controll group, 2.3175 +/- .7211. Both groups of caterpillars did gain weight over the 7 days. Our t_test produced a P-value of .3146, our t-value is 1.0972, and our degrees of freedom is 6. 


Discussion:
Our P-value of .3146 proves that there is no significent difference between the change in weight of the controll group versus the treatment group indicating that an increase in JH in the caterpillar’s diet does not increase weight. Even though JH regulates molting and high amounts of it are present during the caterpillars growing stages before metamorphosis, increasing JH does not increase the growth of the caterpillar. This may be so because the caterpillar may already produce the efficient amount needed for growth naturally and any additional JH is used elsewhere or excreted. Although at first we believed that Nijhout’s and William’s experiment would support our hypothesis, perhaps their results that there is a decrease in concentration of JH as the caterpillar grows concludes that the caterpillar only needs a certain amount of JH. They discovered that the caterpillar has a sharp decline in JH secreted in its later 5th-instar which may support that the caterpillar only secretes the amount needed during its current life stage and ignores any excess JH (Nijhout,1974). This would align with how adding JH to our caterpillar’s diet had no effect on their weight. However, our experiment did only use 8 caterpillars total, thus perhaps studying more caterpillars would provide for more concrete evidence. In order to change the pest’s behavior, it may be beneficial to examine how removing JH from the insect’s diet or habitat would affect the caterpillar, since adding JH to its diet has no effect on its size. In conclusion, the Manduca sexta does not significently change in weight with an increase in JH.
