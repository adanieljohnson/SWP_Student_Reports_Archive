Title: Azamax impact on Manduca sexta weight

Abstract:
20-hydroxyecydsone or 20E is responsible for the development of the Manduca sexta. In this experiment, we studied the effects of the insect growth regulator, Azamax, on the weight of the Manduca sexta as the chemical inhibits the production of 20E. 8 caterpillars will be separated in 2 groups of 4. The controll group will receive food with water and the experimental group will receive food mixed with Azamax. We will separate each caterpillar, label the containers, and weigh them every day for 8 days. We believe that due to the inhibitory effects of Azamax on 20E, that there will be a significent change in weight between the controll and experimental groups. This data is important because it studies the effects of 20E on growth and development in Manduca sexta and tests the quality of life in these insects. 

Introduction:
Insect responses to altered dietary necessities have been characterized by two effects, growth rate changes and compensatory feeding (Perkins, 2004). Like vertebrates, insects controll growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes using both hormonal and neural signaling. Specifically, in the Manduca sexta larvae, growth is primarily dependent on juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecydsone (20E). Insects need these two hormones to survive. Therefore, if either is eliminated, the insects will die. JH and 20E both controll growth, molting and metamorphosis of Manduca (Johnson, 2016). During the 5th larval stage of Manduca sexta there is a rise in production of 20E. This increase of the hormone signals to the caterpillar that it is large enough in size, contains enough nutrients to pupate, and is ready to form into an adult moth. This brings us to the question: what happens if the amount of 20E produced in Manduca sexta is decreased?
Azadirachtin, or Azamax, is an insecticide known to help manage insects and pests during various stages of growth. It is also an inhibitor for ecdysterone or 20E in which it acts as an insect growth regulator to controll pests through starvation and growth disruption. The insect growth disrupter acts by interfering with the insect endocrine signaling molecules, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecydsone (20E), which leads variations in development and reproduction in Manduca sexta (Aribi, 2017). We chose Azamax specifically to affect the amount of 20E in the Manduca sexta to observe the effects on the developmental expression and hormone regulation in these insects. We chose to use the Manduca sexta for this experiment because the insect is directly affected by 20E and would be able to show a visual, observable effect of the inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of Azamax on Manduca sexta as we hypothesize the Azamax will inhibit the 20E production in the insects and cause a significent decrease in weight.


Materials and Method:
We collected a total of 80 grams of Manduca food and separated it into 2 clumps of 40 grams. For the experimental group, we added 0.60 Ml (equivalent of 12 drops) of an Azamax solution that consisted of 1-part chemical to 20-parts water and combined it with the food. For the controll group, we mixed 0.60 Ml of distilled water into the food. Each subject was place in an enclosed plastic container with holes on the top. We placed an index card in the middle of each plastic container to separate each caterpillar and labeled the outside of each container which helped identify each subject from the other. We placed 10 grams of their respective food in the containers and weighed each subject every day for 8 days. We chose to use a two sample t_test because it clearly compares the controll and experimental group and the overall difference in weights for the 8 days of the experiment. 

Results:
After 8 days, we recorded the final weights of Manduca sexta and began to analyze the data. Each subject that consumed the controll food increased weight, averaging at an increase of 6.44g. The experimental group, however, showed an overall trend of slightly increased weight. Only one of the caterpillars showed a decrease in weight. The experimental group showed an average change in weight of 1.94g. Each of the 8 subjects experienced a big fluctuation or jump in weight between Day 5 and Day 6. 



Discussion:
Our results show that the weight of Manduca sexta is affected by Azadirachtin or Azamax. The experimental group, the group that received the treatment, did not show as drastic of weight increase as the controll group. Instead, the weight of the caterpillars slowly increased over the 8 days of the experiment. The controll group, however, showed an immediate increase in weight. The treatment also caused a decrease in size, or length. Not only did the controll group grow in weight, but due to visual evidence, the subjects also showed an increase in length and size overall. 
Though the weight was affected directly, the Azamax also caused a decrease in activity of the caterpillars. The experimental group as a whole showed less physical movement than the controll group. This data is important as if shows that with a decrease in the 20E hormone in Manduca sexta, the caterpillar will not grow and form into a normal and functional adult moth. 
Our original hypothesis proved to be incorrect, as we argued that the weight of the Manduca sexta would be decreased due to the consumption of Azamax. However, the growth rate of the caterpillars was slower and significently lower than the controll group. Our experiment is important because it shows the effect of the hormone 20E on growth in Manduca sexta. 
	Possible errors in our experiment could've originated from the amount of food eaten. We did not keep track of how much food each caterpillar consumed, which could've resulted in varied results for experimental group because they would not have consumed enough Azamax to affect the 20E production.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Effect of Azamax on weight of Manduca sexta. The controll group showed no abnormalities. The experimental group had one subject that decreased in weight, while the other three subjects that consumed the treatment gained weight. 8 caterpillars were separated into 2 groups of 4, one group being fed food with Azamax mixed in and one group being fed a mix of food and water. Weight was measured in grams. Error bars for the controll group is  1.177 s.d. error bars for the experimental group is  1.612 s.d. The p_value shows a significent difference of 0.003.
Figure 2. Average weight of Manduca sexta in controll and experimental group over 8 days. The controll group experienced a significent increase in weight. There were no abnormalities in the controll group. The experimental group experienced a slower increase in weight. One caterpillar that consumed the Azamax decreased in weight. The weight of all 4 caterpillars in each group on each day were averaged together. The line graph shows the change in weight over the 8 days of the experiment.
