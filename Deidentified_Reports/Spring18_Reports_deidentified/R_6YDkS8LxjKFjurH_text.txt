Title: Effects of Light and Darkness on the Root:Shoot Ratio of Mung Bean (vigna radiata) Plants 

Abstract:
   The main objective of this experiment was to test what plants will do in the presence of little to no light. For the experiment we used mung bean plants, or, vigna radiata. Our group wanted to see what the tradeoffs of the plants are in this kind of scenario. If a group of mung bean plants are placed under a UV protected cover, I predict that the mung beans with light access will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the group placed under the UV cover. We had a controll group that had access to sunlight while another group of mung bean plants were covered with a UV protective cover. We watered them every day for two weeks and then we separated them out and calculated the root:shoot ratios with weight and length. The average root:shoot weight ratio had a p_value of .029 (t-value: 2.619133, d.f.: 4). The average root:shoot length ratio had a p-vaule of .078 (t-value: 1.737603, d.f.: 4). The hypothesis was supported and the mung bean plants with more access to sunlight had a higher overall average root:shoot ratio than those that did not get sunlight. 

Introduction:
   Plants interact with abiotic and biotic stimuli in their natural environments and depending upon what resource is most abundant, they will change their root:shoot ratios. For this experiment, my team and I are looked at mung bean plants, or, vigna radiata, which we have used previously. We want to see what will happen if plants are grown in a UV abundant space versus a non-UV abundant space. This is important as a tree or plant, under a forest canopy are subjected to different levels of light, and usually limits plant growth. It is also important to the study of a plant's circadian rhythms. For plants, being without UV light leads to energy allocation being more important than something like reproduction [Korhonen:2004]. Resource limitation leads to tradeoffs and with some plants they will tradeoff longer shoots for shorter roots, so they can try to attain more UV light, especially if the soil is rich with nutrients. If a group of mung bean plants are placed under a UV protected cover, I predict that the mung beans with light access will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the group placed under the UV cover. Along with this I feel that the UV covered plants will have a lower root:shoot ratio than the plants with full UV access. We will test statistical significance of our data with a one-tailed statistical t_test. 

Materials and Method:
   We used mung bean seeds/plants for this experiment. A hand.f.ul of seeds were used for each planting container and we added 50 Ml of Miracle Grow to both of the containers. Both groups were watered every day for two weeks at 11 AM. They received enough water for it to seep through the bottom of the containers. The controll group was placed in a greenhouse, and while the other group was also in the greenhouse, that group did not receive direct sunlight due to a UV blocking cover. After the two-week period, the plants were taken out and carefully separated by their respective groups, with sunlight and without sunlight. We washed and dried them with paper towels and then weighed the whole plant together and recorded their weights. After that, we separated the roots from the shoots and measured the weights again. The roots were cut at the root, shoot junction where the stem starts to change color. Lastly we measured the root and shoot length to the nearest millimeter, as well as measuring the root and shoot weights separately to get the root:shoot ratio. We used a one-tailed t_test to analyze our data.  

Results:
The controll group had an average weight of .8266 grams which decreased to .5733 grams in the experimental group [t-value: 2.619133, d.f.: 4, p_value: .029426]. The trend in this graph is that the average root:shoot ratio for weight decreased.

The controll group had an average length of .8233 centimeters which decreased to .58 centimeters in the experimental group [t-value: 1.737603, d.f.: 4, p_value: .078639]. The trend in this graph is that the average root:shoot ratio for length decreased.

Discussion:
   In the end of this experiment, the null hypothesis was rejected, and my hypothesis was supported. The mung bean plants with full UV access had higher average root:shoot weight and length ratios. The plants with UV access did not need to tradeoff smaller roots for longer shoots to break through a hypothetical forest canopy to attain sunlight. Plants in in a situation of lower levels of light or even light competition will work harder to try to attain resources in other ways or will work to reproduce more rapidly so that the plant can pass on its genes to the next generation so that the new plant can have a higher level of success. [Nam: 2017] The plants with sunlight access had nutrients from the soil as well as full nutrients from photosynthesis, which the non-UV plants did not have. The non-UV plants would have a smaller average root:shoot ratio because they need to tradeoff long roots for taller shoots so that they could break through the hypothetical forest canopy. The p_value of the average root:shoot length ratio was above .05, and was .0786 (t-value: 1.737603, d.f.: 4, p_value). Therefore, we cannot interpret this as a significent difference between the shade group and the sun group. On the other hand, the p_value of the average root:shoot weight ratio was .0294 (t-value: 2.619133, d.f.: 4). Due to the p_value being below .05, this can be interpreted as a significent difference between the sun and shade groups for the average root:shoot weight ratio. This research is important in the study of circadian rhythms of plants. The next logical step for this study would be to see if doing the same experiment with lower nutrient soil would yield similar results. The plants with sunlight had higher root:shoot ratios than the plants without light. In a larger context this shows how plants will adapt and change when not in the presence of natural light, as well as furthering experiments to tell if people can grow plants in places of low levels of natural light. This information could be used to help create new, untapped places to farm.
