Title: Similar aggression shown in different sizes of Male Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Our initial goal in this experiment was to determine if there was a significent difference in aggression between small and large Betta Splendins. Considering that most bigger animals tend to be more aggressive, we hypothesized that the fish bigger in size would show more signs of aggressive behavior over the smaller Bettas. We set up an experiment using one small and one large fish for each treatment. We allowed both sizes of fish to visually interact with each other without physically touching. We also allowed both sizes of fish to interact with a female, while also being separated by a divider. In the end, we found that our results did not support our hypothesis. Our treatments seemed to not have a direct effect on the frequency of tail-beating for both sizes of fish, but however, since I our p_value was less than 0.05 for the duration of time in which the Bettas displayed a “red-mane,” shows that in this case our treatment was a direct cause of this aggressive behavior and that it was not due to chance. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish are common fishes that originated in southeast Asia. They are a style of fish that show intraspecific behaviors in the presence of their own species. According to an article found in Behaviour, aggressive behaviors in Betta Splendins are more extreme in the presence of stimuli such as other males, rather that Betta seeing their own reflection in a mirror (Thompson, 1963). 

For this lab we tested the different levels of aggression displayed among various sizes of Betta Splendins. We chose this experiment because, these behaviors affect a variety of factors, including the way in which Betta Splendins mate. 

Bettas have been known for their aggressive tendencies, normally when they are faced with a male other than a female. In an article found in Psychon, a similar experiment was conducted to the different aggression levels of Bettas. The article states that the result of their experiment seemed to be pretty obvious. After running multiple trials, they found that the Bettas spent more time showing aggressive displays with their own reflections than they did with other live male stimulus fish (Ronald Baenninger 1966). 

In our experiment, we hypothesize that the bigger fish will show more extreme signs of aggression, both with and without live stimulus, than the fish smaller in size.


Materials and Method:
In this study we will be using a two-sample one tailed t_test to compare our data. We will first start by place three different sized Beta Splendins in a tank with three compartments. Only two fish will be able to see each other at a time. We will be using multiple treatments to test different situations when Bettas may show aggression. The order will be one female in the first compartment, leaving one small male and one large male to visually interact behind the divider. To avoid any discrepancies with our results, we will use different color Bettas, as well as making sure we swap the fish with new fish after each treatment to avoid habituation. Our data will consist of two factors, time (in seconds) and frequency of aggressive traits. We will be collecting a mean, standard deviation, and p_value as normal for both factors. A bar graph will be used to visually interpret our results.  

Results:
After collecting our tail beating frequencies, we calculated a mean of 12.33 for big fish, and 7 for small fish. Our standard deviation for tail beating came out to be about 10.7 for big, and 5.6 for small. To compare, we calculated a mean duration of 261 seconds that the bigger fish displayed a “red-mane,” with a standard deviation of 69.54 secs. On the other hand, small fish had an average duration of 46.66 secs, and a standard deviation of 43.73 secs. Our p_values were quite different from one another, with tail-beating having a p_value of 0.486241, and “red-mane” duration having a p_value of 0.010666. Our independent variable was the size of the fish, and our dependent variables were the duration of their “red-mane,” along with the frequency of tail-beating. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was not a significent difference of aggression between the big and small sized Betta Splendins. Our results showed a p_value of 0.486241 for tail-beating, which is significently higher than .05. This means that the data collected from both fish beating their tails were not caused by our treatments but was rather due to chance. Our p_value for displaying a “red-mane” was 0.010666, which is a value less than 0.05. This means that our treatment had a direct effect to how long both categories of fish opened and closed their operculum. The “red-mane” did not occur due to chance for both fishes. To compare our study to another, it was noted in Psychon that Betta Splendins tend to spend the most time in front of their mirrored image rather than another physical fish (Ronald Baenninger 1966). This trend was actually quite different during our treatments. Instead of the fish spending more time in front of their mirrored image, they were actually more aggressive when it came to the physical stimuli of other male fish.
