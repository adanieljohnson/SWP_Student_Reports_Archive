Title: Impact of Martin’s IGR on Mass and Length of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effects of insect growth regulators (IGR) on the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. It is hypothesized that the introduction of Martin’s IGR into the diet of the caterpillars would increase length, mass, and JH levels, thus prolong molting and prevent maturity into adulthood. Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars are split into a controll group (generic diet) and an experimental group (generic diet plus IGR), and mass and length are recorded daily for seven days. After experimentation concluded, it can be concluded that the hypothesis had no statistical grounds to be accepted.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta , a member of the Sphingidae family, is a moth with an intricate and fascinating life cycle [Johnson: 2018]. The life cycles of these insects are holometabolous, meaning that their life cycles involve fours steps: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The egg/embryo stage involves the insect being confined to a small spherical closure and can vary in color. The larvae stage, which contains five instars, are characterized by soft outer layers and often referred to as caterpillars. The pupal stage involves containment and protection in a silk cocoon. Finally, the adult stage is characterized by full maturity, expressed in functional wings and organ systems [Johnson: 2018]. 

	Hormones play a colossal role in an insect's progression through these stages of development. Specifically, Juvenile Hormone (JH), a family of insect hormones composed of long-chained organic molecules, impact molting [Johnson: 2018]. In the lifecycle of the Manduca sexta, progression from one stage of life to the next requires molting, a process through which epidermal skin cells shed and create a new outer layer [Johnson: 2018]. After each molt, the Manduca sexta, increases in size and nears adulthood.

            This experiments shows the effects Martian, a chemical insect growth regulator, in the food of  Manduca sexta caterpillars [Tunaz: 2014]. Martins IGR (independent variable) has the ability to interfere or enhance functions regulated by JH, which can severely affect insect growth and development. Martins IGR’s impact on the mass and length of Manduca sexta caterpillars (dependent variable) allows us to better understand the relationship and impact of hormones in the life cycles of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Manduca sexta caterpillars are great organisms to use in this experiment due to their neatly and explicitly staged life cycles and relative ease in data collection. I hypothesize that the addition of Martin’s IGR into the Manduca sexta diet will increase length, mass, and JH levels, thus prolong molting, prevent commitment pulse-access, and prevent maturity into adulthood.


Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars, ranging from .5- 1.5 grams are evenly divided into 2 groups: controll and Martin’s IGR. The controll group is given generic insect food with 3-10 drops of water. The experimental group is given the generic insect food with approximately 6 drops of Martin's IGR. Each caterpillar is given 10 grams of each corresponding diet, which can be replaced if completely consumed. All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars are placed in the same incubator and under the same conditions (12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness). Each caterpillar mass and length are recorded daily for seven days. The hypothesis is tested through Two 2 sample t_tests in order to test for the statistical significance of the controll and experimental data from both recorded masses and lengths. 


Results:
The general trends in Table 1, in addition to figure 1 and 2, portray a small difference between the averages of data collected for the controll and experimental group for the length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. In addition,  The table and figures above indicate a minuscule difference between the averages of data collected for the controll and experimental groups for the mass of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The two two-sample t_tests produced p_values of 0.796 (length) and 0.961 (Mass). These values indicate that there is no statistical significance due to the p_value being much higher than a significance level of 0.05

Discussion:
After all the observations and statistical calculations have concluded, it can be accurately determined that the results attained refute the original hypothesis. By looking at table 1, it can be numerically determined that there is not a significent difference in the controll or experimental data for both the masses and lengths of Manduca sexta caterpillars collected. In addition, the hypothesis was not statistically supported. The p_values are 0.796 (length) and 0.961 (Mass). Both of the p_values are far from the statistically significent p_value of 0.05.  This indicates that there is no statistical evidence linking a difference between the caterpillars that consumed Martins IGR and the caterpillars who consumed no IGR. Therefore, this study cannot statistically prove that the addition of Martins IGR in the food of Manduca sexta caterpillars increases length, mass, and JH levels, thus prolong molting, prevent commitment pulse-access, and prevent maturity into adulthood. A study regarding the impacts of IGR on mosquitos shows that pre parasitic exposure to IGRs has no effect on the size of male mosquitoes[Suman: 2013].

One likely source of error is recording an accurate length and mass of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. When recording the length of the caterpillars, some would refuse to stretch to their full lengths so inaccurate readings are likely to have occurred. In addition, the fecal matter of the Manduca sexta caterpillars would often stick to the bottom of them. If unremoved, they could skew the mass reading which would yield inaccurate data. If this experiment were to be repeated again, I would double the amount of time I would record data in addition to employing stricter method of massing and taking the length of the caterpillars. 

Although the hypothesis was refuted, this experiment is a great way to portray relationships between the endocrine system and the life cycles of insects such as the Manduca sexta caterpillars. It also allows for a deeper understanding of central physiological regulatory processes that are essential to normal insect development [Tunaz: 2004]. In addition to physiology, this experiment allows us to truly understand and respect all aspects of the scientific method and experimental design.
