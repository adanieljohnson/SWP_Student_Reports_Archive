Title: Resource allocation is not affected by oxidizing conditions in mung bean (Phaseolus aureus) 

Abstract:
As the climate changes, it becomes critical to develop commercial strategies that allow agricultural species to tolerate the increases in temperature and carbon dioxide levels as well as the accompanying drought conditions. Plants experiencing heat stress both generate increased levels of reactive oxygen species and reallocate resources to increase root growth. Here, we test whether creating non-toxic oxidizing conditions in the soil can mimic heat stress and result in increased allocation of resources to root systems in an agricultural model mung bean (Phaseolus aureus). Mung bean seedlings were treated with hydrogen peroxide every other day for one week. Control seedlings received water instead of hydrogen peroxide. The length of root and shoot as well as weight of seedling, shoot, and root were measured and the root to shoot ratio for each measure calculated. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide treatment caused a general growth defect manifested in decreased whole seedling weight but that seedlings did not reallocate growth in a way to increase root mass relative to shoot mass. However, hydrogen peroxide treatment did result in an increase in the root to shoot length ratio, suggesting that oxidizing conditions result in an increase in resources directed to primary root 

Introduction:
To adapt to changes in the environment, non-mobile plants must be able to modulate their phenotypes to reallocate their resources to best promote growth, development, and survival. Plants will redirect resources to promote growth of the organs which will best promote survival under particular conditions [Johnson: 2018]. For example, in nutrient limiting conditions, plants will devote more energy to promoting root growth to promote the plant’s ability to take up what little nutrients are available in the soil [Giehl and von Wirén: 2014]. Conversely, under favorable conditions plants will devote more of their resources to reproduction [Tardieu: 2013]. It is critical to understand the mechanisms of resource allocation in plants under limiting conditions to enable predictions of how plants, especially agricultural species, will respond to constantly fluctuating environmental changes. 
As the Earth’s temperature continues to rise, it becomes critical to understand how plants reallocate growth and resources in response to heat stress, drought, and increased carbon dioxide levels to enable development of commercial strategies to prevent heat-induced agricultural damage. It is already known that when experiencing heat stress, in which water loss occurs more rapidly [Hatfield and Prueger: 2015], plants will reallocate more of their resources to root growth. Specifically, increased root length, branching, and changes in root soil depth will occur [Gray and Brady: 2016]. 
In plants, heat stress is also known to induce production of a class of damaging oxidizing molecules called reactive oxygen species [Choudhury et al: 2017]. Having an ability to induce root growth in agricultural settings in preparation for expected drought conditions may be a valuable strategy to combat declines in agricultural yield from increasing temperatures. Here, we test whether treating the agricultural species mung bean with a non-toxic level of hydrogen peroxide will induce a resource allocation response towards increased root growth, mimicking the physiological response to heat stress.  


Materials and Methods:
This procedure was adapted from [Johnson: 2018]. Six pots of mung bean seeds, presoaked in water, were planted in vermiculite soil. Growth initiation was aided by adding 50 mL of Miracle Gro to each pot. The plants were grown in a temperature and humidity controlled greenhouse and watered every day for one week. Starting seven days after placing the pots in the greenhouse, the experimental group of three pots was given 50 mL of 10 mM hydrogen peroxide, a non-toxic dose [Lum et al: 2002], every other day for another week. On the opposite days, these pots were given 50 mL water. The three control group pots were given 50 mL of water every day starting seven days after placing in the green house. 
Fourteen days after placing the pots in the green house, three healthy looking plants (defined as having no leaf or stem damage and being about the same height as the rest of the seedlings in the pot) were harvested from each pot. For each plant, the weight of the whole plant, shoot, and root was measured. Additionally, the length of the shoot and root was measured. Finally, the root to shoot ratio for each measurement (weight and length) was calculated by dividing the root measurement by the shoot measurement. The division between shoot and root was defined as the location on the root-shoot junction where the tissue color changed from white to purple. The average was pooled from the three seedlings per pot to create a pot average. 
Because we hypothesized that hydrogen peroxide treatment would increase resource allocation towards roots, one-tailed two-sample t tests comparing the pot averages of each measurement (weight and length of each tissue type) for water and hydrogen peroxide treated mung beans were used to evaluate the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment on these tissues. 


Results:
Plant mass decreases with hydrogen peroxide treatment
The weight of the entire plant, root, and shoot were measured for each sample collected from hydrogen peroxide treated and water treated samples. The hydrogen peroxide treated whole plants weighed 0.63 ± 0.02 g while the control group weighed 0.68 ± 0.02 g. A one-sample t test comparing the average whole plant weight of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.015, indicating that the average weight of mung bean seedlings decreased significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 1).
The hydrogen peroxide treated shoots weighed 0.63 ± 0.02 g while the control group weighed 0.68 ± 0.02 g. A one-sample t test comparing the average shoot weight of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.048, indicating that the average weight of mung bean seedlings decreased significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 1).
The hydrogen peroxide treated roots weighed 0.18 ± 0.02 g while the control group weighed 0.18 ± 0.03 g. A one-sample t test comparing the average shoot weight of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.323, indicating that the average weight of mung bean roots did not decrease significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 1).
The root to shoot weight ratio in hydrogen peroxide treated plants was 0.31 ± 0.03 while the control group root to shot weight ratio was 0.39 ± 0.08.  A one-sample t test comparing the root to shoot ratios of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.38, indicating that the average root to shoot ratio mung bean seedlings did not decrease significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 2).



Root to shoot length ratios increase under oxidizing conditions
The length of the root and shoot were measured for each sample collected from hydrogen peroxide treated and water treated samples.
The hydrogen peroxide treated shoots were 18.1 ± 1.9 cm long while the water treated control group were 19 ± 0.70 cm long. A one-sample t test comparing the average shoot length of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.25, indicating that the average length of mung bean shoots did not decrease significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 3).
The hydrogen peroxide treated roots were 11.8 ± 1.2 cm long while the water treated control group were 10.9 ± 0.4 cm long. A one-sample t test comparing the average root length of each treatment yielded a p value of 0.13, indicating that the average length of mung bean roots did not decrease significantly during hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 3).
The root to shoot length ratio in hydrogen peroxide treated plants was 0.66 ± 0.06 while the control group root to shot length ratio was 0.57 ± 0.01.  A one-sample t test comparing the root to shoot length ratios of treatment yielded a p value of 0.033, indicating that the average root to shoot length ratio mung bean seedlings was significantly increased by hydrogen peroxide treatment (Figure 4).


Discussion:
The results of this experiment suggest that hydrogen peroxide treatment is not an effective way to mimic heat stress and induce reallocation of plant growth towards roots.  The effects of hydrogen peroxide treatment on mung bean resource allocation are complex. First, the results suggest that hydrogen peroxide treatment is responsible for a decrease in seedling weight, and more specifically, shoot weight. This suggests an overall growth defect resulting from the damaging properties of sustained hydrogen peroxide. However, the root to shoot weight ratio was not statistically different between hydrogen peroxide treated and water treated seedlings, suggesting that the oxidizing soil conditions do not result in growth reallocation in mung bean. Second, the root and shoot lengths do not differ between hydrogen peroxide treated and water treated seedlings, demonstrating that growth of each organ type remains about the same under normal and oxidizing conditions. However, the root to shoot length ratio increased as a result of hydrogen peroxide treatment, suggesting that under oxidizing conditions, plants may allocate more energy to increasing primary root growth. 
The implications of these results are complex considering the known roles of reactive oxygen species in root development. Reactive oxygen species are required for and promote lateral root initiation [Orman-Ligeza et al: 2016] and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in primary root tips results in cell death and a decrease in growth [Liu et al: 2016]. An increase in allocation of resources to primary root length could suggest that plants are compensating for potentially low levels of ROS-induced cell death by increasing growth efforts, resulting in overall increased root elongation. However, allocation of resources did not result in an increased amount of relative root mass, suggesting that the hydrogen peroxide treatment regimen did not reach a threshold required for increased lateral root initiation that translates to increased root to shoot weight ratio. Future experiments should investigate specifically whether oxidizing soil conditions can result in increased lateral root formation, which could promote water and nutrient uptake in difficult environmental conditions. Overall, the results suggest that creating non-toxic oxidizing soil conditions do not mimic the resource allocation effects towards increased root growth of heat stress. Thus, this method is not likely to be useful to increase the tolerance of agricultural species to expected heat stress and drought conditions.
