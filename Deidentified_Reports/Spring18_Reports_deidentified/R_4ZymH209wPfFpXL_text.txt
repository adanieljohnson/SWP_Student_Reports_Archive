Title: Effects of Shade on the Root to Shoot Length Ratio of Pisum sativun

Abstract:
Sustainable farming practices have been advocated for within the United States in recent years in an effort to mitigate the spread of pollutants throughout the natural world, especially those found in plant fertilizer. However, if agriculturalists are expected to forego this form of nourishment, they must have a thorough understanding of the needs of the crops in order to ensure their own economic security. To test the impact of an abiotic factor on the growth of a plant, an experiment was performed in which Pisum sativun plants were grown in both shaded and light environments, then the average root to shoot length ratio was found. It was hypothesized that Pisum sativun plants treated with lower sunlight levels will have a higher average root-to-shoot length ratio than that of the Pisum sativun plants exposed to normal sunlight levels. When a paired t_test was performed on the results, the p_value was 0.224. Through this, it was determined the data collected on the average root to shoot length ratios was not significent. 

Introduction:
A major industry within the U.S. economy is agriculture, the cultivation of different crops to be harvested for food. In different environments, there are varying amounts of resources available to different species of plants. The availability of resources, biotic (living) factors, and abiotic (nonliving) factors, like exposure to sunlight, all influence where plants allocate their resources. Plants tend to allocate these resources to where they are most needed in the plant. The abiotic factor of the amount of sunlight can cause plants to allocate resources to different areas. With limited sunlight, a plant may need to focus its resources to its roots in order to draw an adequate amount of nitrogen from the soil, as less photosynthesis is occurring in its leaves [Thornley 1972]. By focusing its resources in its roots, the plant’s roots will be well nourished to grow longer in length and thus, will be able to absorb more nutrients from the soil with their greater root surface area. Because the resources are being sent to the roots instead of the shoots in a shaded plant, the shoots may receive less nutrients and will be shorter in length, and thus will capture less carbon [Thornley 1972]. Thornley analyzed the root to shoot ratio in terms of the allocation of various plant resources in his 1972 study, which found that, “[t]he…growth of a…plant consisting of root and shoot…is considered in terms of the transport and utilization of two required substrates, one providing carbon and the other providing oxygen” [Thornley 1972]. This indicates that a plant must balance both nitrogen and carbon intake, and will allocate its resources according to whichever element it needs most. The plant Pisum sativun was chosen as the sample organism due to its rapid speed of growth and the relatively low maintenance nature of the plant. It can be hypothesized that Pisum sativun plants treated with lower sunlight levels will have a higher average root-to-shoot length ratio than that of the Pisum sativun plants exposed to normal sunlight levels. 

Materials and Method:
Around 100 seeds of the Pisum sativun plant were gathered. They were then soaked in a beaker with water. In 6 different planters, soil was added. Then the soaked seeds were divided up equally and buried into the soil of each planter. Half of the planters were placed in the greenhouse. A dark colored cloth was draped over a 3-pronged pole placed in the shaded half of the planters and this half was then placed in the greenhouse. Each treatment was watered every other day for three weeks. The plants were then removed and their max root length and max shoot length for each replicate of each treatment were measured. The root to shoot length ratio was then calculated using the maximum measurements of each replicate. The mean root to shoot length ratio for each treatment was then found. The standard deviation of the average root to shoot length ratio for each treatment was then calculated. A two sample t_test was used to analyze the means. 

Results:
The average root to shoot length ratio was higher in the plants in the light treatment than it was in the plants in the dark treatment. The average root to shoot length ratio in the light treatment was 0.776 (Figure 1). The average root to shoot length ratio in the shade treatment was 0.637 (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the light treatment was 0.140, while the standard deviation for the light treatment was 0.094 (Figure 1). The p_value was 0.224. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that Pisum sativun plants treated with low sunlight levels would have higher average root to shoot length ratios than the average root to shoot length ratio of Pisum sativun plants treated with normal sunlight levels was not supported by the findings of the experiment, as the data was found to be statistically insignificent. The lack of a significent difference between the dark and light treatments implies that this abiotic factor has no impact upon the resource allocation of this species. Ericsson came to this conclusion as well in his 1995 study of Betula pendula plants, in which he states that, “[t]he light regime had no effect on…allocation except at very low photon flux densities…, in which a small decrease in the root fraction was observed” [Ericsson 1995]. Through this, it can be seen that the abiotic factor of the amount of sunlight has little impact on the allocation of resources to root or shoot. Additionally, Ericsson only began to see a difference in resource allocation at different photon flux density levels, which were held constant in this experiment. Varying photon flux density levels seems to be a promising area for future study, as the exact amount of light required to induce allocation differences could be determined. McConnaughay’s 1999 study of annual plants found that, “comparisons of root:shoot…ratios across light…gradients were generally consistent with predictions based on optimal partitioning theory; allocation to roots decreased and leaf [biomass] increased under low light conditions” [McConnaughay 1999]. The optimal partitioning theory states that, “plants respond to variation in the environment by partitioning biomass among various plant organs to optimize the capture of nutrients, light, water, and carbon dioxide in a manner that maximizes plant growth rate” [McConnaughay 1999]. Although the data of this experiment was not statistically significent, this theory explains the findings of McConnaughay’s experiment. Due to a lack of light, the annual plants he studied allocated their resources to their leaves. This may be to maximize growth and obtain as much sunlight as possible to acquire carbon and obtain the products of photosynthesis, instead of allocating resources to the roots to acquire more soil nutrients. This concept deepens our knowledge of the Pisum sativun species and of the behavior of plants in general, as when resources are limited plants allocate in order to maximize what is scarce. The industry of agriculture can make use of this knowledge, as understanding the challenges of a plant’s environment as well as their needs allows one to prevent abiotic stressors from harming the success of crops.
