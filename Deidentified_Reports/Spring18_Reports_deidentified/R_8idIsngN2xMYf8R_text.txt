Title: Calcium Channel Blocker has Mere Effect on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The nervous system sends electron signals to muscles and results in muscle contraction. Calcium ions are important in this process as they bind to vesicle and release acetylcholine (ACh) and bind to troponin and expose myosin binding sites on actin filaments. In this experiment, we want to know how the absence of calcium ion would result in a neuron-muscle interaction. We blocked calcium channels in frog legs with lanthanum chloride solution. We compared the minimum amplitude to the threshold before and after the injection of calcium channel blocker. Our hypothesis is that if the calcium channel is blocked, the minimum amplitude to reach the threshold would be significantly higher. We ran a paired t-test to find out if a significant difference exists. The p-value is 0.7743, which is greater than 0.05, indicating there is no significant difference. Thus, our hypothesis is not supported. The red leg syndrome in the subject pool and chemical feature of lanthanum chloride might lead to this result. In the future, we would repeat this experiment in a healthy subject population with other kinds of calcium blockers at different concentration levels. 

Introduction:
Nerve system encodes, process and store information from the internal and external environment of organisms.  In the interaction between neuron and muscle, the afferent nervous system carries information to the central nervous system and the brain whereas the efferent nervous system sends information from Central Nervous System to muscles to process movement. Neurons transmit information through electron signals. A sodium-potassium pump locates in the membrane keeps the membrane potential negative at resting membrane potential. When there is a signal, the voltage-gated sodium channel would open and depolarize the cell membrane. If the voltage of cell membrane reaches a threshold, and action potential would be carried out by the opening of additional voltage-gated sodium channel. Action potential travels along axons and arrives at neuromuscular junction, a synapse between neurons and skeletal muscle cells. The depolarization of cell membrane causes voltage-gated calcium channel to open and allows calcium ions to enter and attach to vesicles. Vesicles fuse with presynaptic membrane and release acetylcholine (ACh). ACh molecules bind to receptors on postsynaptic membrane and open sodium channels to depolarize the membrane and transmit action potential. Action potential travels down t-tubules and causes change in conformation of DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor, releasing calcium ions stored in sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions bind to troponin and expose myosin binding sites on actin filaments. The muscle thus contracts [Sadava: 2017]. In this process, calcium ions are involved in two key parts, the release of ACh and the and exposure of myosin binding sites. In this experiment, we want to explore calcium's role in neuron-muscle interaction. We wander the how the absence of calcium ions would affect the firing of neural signals and the muscle movement. We used gastrocnemius muscles and sciatic nerves from frog legs to study this process. Lanthanum chloride can alter intracellular calcium concentration [Yang: 2013]. The lanthanide ions block calcium ion permeable channels [Halaszovich: 2000].Thus, we are going to use Lanthanum chloride as calcium channel blocker in this experiment. Our hypothesis is that if the calcium channel is blocked, the minimum amplitude to reach the threshold would be significantly higher.

Materials and Methods:
We collected the minimum amplitude to reach threshold from frog legs before and after the application of Lanthanum chloride. We separated gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg. We rinsed the frog leg with frog ringer solution to keep the tissue moisturized. We attached the frog leg to the IXTA stimulator. We used the iWorx EP units to record muscle movements and measure key parameters. We stimulated the exposed nerve with electron signals and recorded resulting electron signal in gastrocnemius muscle. We started with a group of 5 stimulations at 0.0 v amplitude and increased by 0.1v every time until we observed twitches in frog legs. We recorded the minimum amplitude to reach threshold for each frog leg in the control group. Then, we injected 1mM Lanthanum chloride solution to each frog leg and waited ten minutes before we repeated the stimulation. We compared the minimum amplitude required to reach the threshold in the control group and treatment group with paired t-test. If the resulting p-value is smaller than 0.05, there exists a significant difference between the minimum amplitude to threshold in the control group and the treatment group. If the minimum amplitude required to reach the threshold in treatment group is significantly higher than the control group, our hypothesis is supported. 

Results:
The average amplitude to threshold in the control group is 0.1475 (+/- 0.0653). The average amplitude to threshold in the treatment group is 0.1575 (+/- 0.1021). The data is referred in figure 1. In the paired t-test, the resulting p-value is 0.7743. Because the p-value is greater than 0.05, there exists no significant difference in the minimum amplitude to threshold in the control group and treatment group.

Discussion:
The statistic test shows that there exists no significant difference between the amplitude to threshold between the control group and the treatment group. Thus, our hypothesis that if the calcium channel is blocked, the minimum amplitude to reach the threshold would be significantly higher is not supported by this experiment. There are two possible reasons that would lead to this result. First, the frog population we selected for this experiment is affected by "red leg syndrome". It is attributed to infection of bacterium Aero- monas hydrophila. This disease led to a high death rate and a decrease in number of samples. This also decreases the activity level of frogs which are infected [Pessier: 2017]. Second, calcium channel blocker chemicals can be inefficient. Most blockers are efficient in blocking voltage-dependent calcium channels and blocking synaptic transmission. But they are inefficient in in blocking voltage-dependent calcium spikes and the calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization [Taube:1986]. Also, The concentration of Lanthanum chloride reported needed for block of TRP3 channels varies in various expression systems [Halaszovich: 2000]. The chemical we injected might fail to function as a calcium blocker in the treatment group because of these two reasons. In the future, we should repeat the experiment on a healthy grog population. We need to use different kinds of calcium blockers and repeat the experiment with different concentration to avoid inefficiency of chemicals.
