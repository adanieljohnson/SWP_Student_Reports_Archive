Title: Caffeine Effect On Muscle Contraction Investigation

Abstract:
We conducted an investigation on Rania Pipiens (Northern Leopard Frogs) to explore the effects of caffeine on the calcium ion channels and muscle contractions in the gastrocnemus. We hypothesized that the caffeine would open the calcium ion channels and release more calcium, thus making the muscle contract more. To conduct this investigation, we stimulated the gastrocnemus using a force transducer to determine the average controllled amplitude. After injecting the frog with caffeine we repeated the steps. This experiment was performed on two frog legs. The results show that the muscle contracted more once the caffeine was added, thus allowing more calcium to flow out of the calcium ion gates. Our results were significent because the calculated P value was 0.000145, so we rejected the null hypothesis that caffeine would not affect muscle contraction.


Introduction:
In this study, we will test the effects of caffeine on the opening of calcium gates, and in turn, muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens. We hypothesize that caffeine will cause more muscle contractions in the muscle. The release of calcium causes muscle contractions, and the closing of the calcium channel stops the contraction. Caffeine is a chemical commonly found in foods and drinks that stimulates the nervous system. According to a study conducted in 2011, “caffeine acts through the release of calcium ion from the terminal cisterns of the sarcoplasmic reticulum” (Olorunshola & Achie, 2011). Injecting caffeine into the muscle will allow more calcium to flow out of the calcium channels, causing more muscle contractions. To test our hypothesis, we will stimulate frog legs using a force transducer and gather the average amplitudes from a myogram. We will then add caffeine to the frog leg and repeat the process.


Materials and Method:
We will test our hypothesis by putting caffeine in the frog leg to open the Ca2+ gates and se a force transducer to measure tension in the muscle contraction. We will have 3 frog legs that are controllled for the first trial, then we will inject the 100mM caffeine into them and record the results again. Then we will average the results to use for the paired T-test. We will use this test to compare the muscle’s tension during contraction before and after adding caffeine.    First we skinned the frog leg. We pulled on each side of the muscle to reveal the sciatic nerve, then pulled the sciatic nerve to separate it from the muscle. We used scissors to separate the connective tissue from the muscle to ensure the gastrocnemus was visible. Next, we tied a double knot around the junction between the tendon and the gastrocnemus muscle using 20-30 cm string, then removed the tendon with scissors. We used the pins to stabilize the leg on either side of the tibia and fibula and ensured that w did not impale the nerve. We then inserted the black needle into the top part of the gastrocnemus and the red needle into the bottom. For the controllled frog legs, we stimulated the muscle at 0.5 volts for 3 pulses, 1 volt, and 1.5 volts and averaged the pulses for each voltage. After this we used the syringe to absorb 6Ml of caffeine and injected 1 mm of caffeine into 3 different places in the frog leg. Again we stimulated the muscle at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 volts for 3 pulses and averaged the pulses for each voltage. We repeated these steps with the second leg.


Results:
The following table displays the averages of the amplitudes of the muscle contractions in frog legs read from a myogram. The amplitudes of the controllled frog legs were significently larger than the amplitudes of the experimented frog legs, which were injected with caffeine. Each frog leg tested shared a trend: as the voltage increased, the amplitude of the muscle contraction increased as well. Figure 2 also reflects the increase in muscle contraction after injecting caffeine into the leg. The calculated P value is 0.000145.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that there will be an increase in calcium flow from the calcium ion channels, thus creating more contractions. amplitude of the experimented muscle contractions are significently smaller than the controllled muscle contractions because the caffeine caused the muscle to contract before it was stimulated, therefore the amplitude showed in the myogram has decreased compared to the controllled muscle. As shown in figure 2, the muscle with caffeine has contracted more than the muscle without caffeine without either muscle being stimulated. Moreover, the P calculated P value is 0.000145, which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that there is not a difference in amplitude when adding caffeine to a muscle. In future investigations, we should use different doses of caffeine. In another study, they used “Varying doses of caffeine… to the organ bath at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 mg/Ml and its effect on skeletal muscle contraction was studied” (Olorunshola & Achie, 2011) and received results that supported their hypothesis better than our results did.
