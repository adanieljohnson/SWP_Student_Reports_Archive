Title: Rana pipiens: Effects of Tubocurarine on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effects of tubocurarine on muscle contraction. The experiment uses Rana pipien frogs to test the hypothesis that if tubocurarine is injected into the muscle, then the muscle contractions will have lower amplitudes. Tubocurarine blocks acetylcholine receptors which bind with ACh from presynaptic cells. The binding of ACh to receptors open sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. This action potential moves through the fiber which triggers the release of calcium enabling muscle contraction. If the receptors are blocked by tubocurarine then the muscle will not contract. The experiment treats a group of three frogs with tubocurarine to demonstrate the effects of ACh receptor blocking. The frog's sciatic nerves were stimulated using a force transducer and the gastrocnemius muscle contractions were observed. The study found a trend that treatment groups had lower amplitudes of muscle contractions, but was not able to make any conclusions because the statistic results were not significant. The experiment used a paired t-test and the p value was 0.224229. Therefore, the experiment noticed trends in smaller amplitudes but was not able to make any conclusions due to the p value being greater than 0.05.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the functions of nerves and muscles. Similar to hormones, nerves and muscles allow organisms to detect stimuli from their environments and respond to those stimuli. However, the neuromuscular system is different because it can respond to these stimuli in milliseconds instead of days like hormones [Johnson: 2018]. The specific organism used in this experiment is the Rana pipiens, or the northern leopard frog. In these frogs there is skeletal muscle made up of myofibers which attach to motor neurons at neuromuscular junctions. Once a nerve is stimulated an action potential travels down an axon and arrives at the neuromuscular junction where depolarization leads to the release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh goes into the synaptic cleft where it binds with ACh receptors on the postsynaptic cell. This opens sodium channels and generates an action potential in the muscle fiber. 
Research has been done with the alpha-bungarotoxin which was found to be an ACh receptor blocker. This toxin has the ability to kill an organism because it blocks receptors so no action potentials can be created and the organism’s muscles are paralyzed [Oswald 1982]. This experiment evaluates the effect of tubocurarine, which is an ACh receptor antagonist, or blocker, in frogs. This experiment treats a group of frogs with two milliliters of tubocurarine to evaluate the amplitude of five muscle contractions. Specifically, the experiment stimulates the sciatic nerve to observe gastrocnemius muscle contractions. If tubocurarine is injected into the muscle, then the muscle contractions will have lower amplitudes.

Materials and Methods:
Obtain the following materials: three frog legs, dissecting pan, forceps, frog Ringer’s solution, dissecting probe, dissecting needle, string, wire, pins, force transducer, ring stand, tubocurarine, syringe, and computer. Place the first leg in the dissecting pan and using forceps, grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull it down towards the foot. Place the skinned leg in the dissecting pan and make sure to occasionally moisten it with frog Ringer’s solution. Use a dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles, starting at the upper end and extending to the knee. This should reveal the white sciatic nerve and blood vessels. Free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue using a dissecting needle. Handle the nerve carefully to avoid traumatizing it and putting it into contact with metal. Tie two pieces of string at the top and bottom of the muscle. Attach the free end of the muscle to the force transducer using the string as a hook. Make sure the frog leg is completely on the dissecting pan and the muscle is suspended in a straight line. Additionally, ensure that the string attaching the muscle to the force transducer is taut. Place two pieces of wire connected to probes underneath the sciatic nerve, ensuring that they touch the nerve but do not overlap or touch each other. Attach the force transducer to a computer and open the LabScribe program. Set the pulse amplitude to 0.5 V, the number of pulses to 5, the frequency to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. Click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.5 V and press the mark button to record the results. Next, using the syringe, draw in 2 mL of tubocurarine. Inject 1 mL of tubocurarine at the top of the muscle and another mL at the bottom of the muscle. Stimulate the nerve and muscle with tubocurarine injected into it using the force transducer. Record these results as well. Repeat this process with the two other frog legs. A paired t-test will be used in this experiment to compare the data between the control group and treatment group.

Results:
The results were 0.0104 V ± 0.00114 V for the average amplitude of the five muscle contractions for the first control frog and 0.0072 V ± 0.00045 V for the first treated frog. For the second frog, the results were 0.0022 V ± 0.00045 V for the average amplitude of the five muscle contractions for the control frog and 0.002 V ± 0 V for the treated frog. For the third frog, the results were 0.0022 V ± 0.00045 V for the average amplitude of the five muscle contractions for the control frog and 0.001 V ± 0 V for the treated frog. In general, it was seen that the treatment group had smaller amplitudes for the average of the five gastrocnemius muscle contractions in comparison to the control group. Although this difference was more easily seen in the first frog, it was noted in all three despite the differences being smaller. The mean of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group since the p value was greater than 0.05. The statistical test results are as follows: t-stat = 1.738637, df = 2, P = 0.224229.

Discussion:
The data cannot support the hypothesis because the p value for the paired t-test was greater than 0.05, meaning the data is not statistically significant. When looking at the three frogs there seemed to be a greater difference between the control and treatment group in the first group compared to the second and third frog. The data did show a trend that the treatment groups have lower amplitudes than the control groups but it was not able to definitively conclude this due to the statistical results so the hypothesis in the end cannot be supported by the experiment’s results. The treatment groups should have lower amplitudes for the muscle contractions because tubocurarine is an acetylcholine receptor blocker. During the contraction of a muscle acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic cell and into the synaptic cleft where it binds to ACh receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber. This opens sodium channels in the postsynaptic cell which initiates an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads throughout the fiber which stimulates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of this calcium activates the contraction of the muscle fiber, which makes it shorten [Johnson 2018]. If tubocurarine blocks ACh receptors then the ACh would not be able to open the sodium channels in the muscle fiber that generate an action potential. Therefore the presence of tubocurarine should prevent the muscle from contracting. The amplitudes were predicted to be smaller because a greater amount of tubocurarine would be necessary over a longer period of time in order to fully stop contractions. However the presence of tubocurarine should lower the amplitude of the contractions to some extent.
The inconclusive results in this experiment contradict previously published studies because many recent studies have accepted the notion that the blocking of ACh receptors inhibits muscle contractions. These studies have then applied this knowledge to current medical issues. For example, in a study that investigates the detection of acetylcholine receptor blocking antibodies by flow cytometry, they use this alternate method to detect antibodies that take part in diseases like myasthenia gravis. This different technique of detecting antibodies is better for the environment and more cost efficient. It enables the study of antibodies in myasthenia gravis, which is a disease associated with the presence of antibodies directed towards receptors embedded in the motor endplate at the neuromuscular junction that cause blockage, dysfunction, and degradation of AChR which results in muscle weakness and fatigability [Cromar: 2016].
The next logical step in this experiment is to modify the procedure so that the added tubocurarine can rest in the muscle for a longer period of time. A possible error in this experiment is that the tubocurarine was allowed to rest for different amounts of time that were very short before the muscle was stimulated again. The first problem with this procedure step is that tubocurarine did not have enough time to settle in the muscle and block the ACh receptors which would have led to smaller amplitudes in the contractions. Additionally, since the tubocurarine was allowed to rest for different amounts of time, different frogs could have more distinct results than other frogs. If there was a longer set period of time between injection of tubocurarine and muscle stimulation, clearer results could be produced because the tubocurarine would have more time to block ACh receptors and inhibit muscle contraction.
