Title: The Effect of Male Coloration on Mate Selection in Betta splendins Based on Female Spatial Movements

Abstract:
Coloration in some species of fish has been observed to affect the mate selection of females in the population [Selz: 2016]. The objective of our study was to determine the effect of male coloration on the mate selection of female Betta splendins—for example whether females favor males of similar coloration as themselves or whether females favor more vibrant colors. We hypothesized that females would tend to favor males who shared their own coloration. To test this hypothesis, we set up three regions inside a middle section (a section near the beige male, neutral area, and a section near the red male) of a fish tank (males of either beige or red coloration are on either side, with each male being the color opposite of the other), and we recorded time elapsed in each of these regions. This time elapsed was then used to determine which male the female favored. Our results showed that the females favored males of beige coloration over males of red coloration (which was also more vibrant).

Introduction:
Sexual selection is the action of mate selection based on the preference of one sex of a species, most often females, for certain characteristics in the opposite sex, most often males [Wacker: 2016]. There are multiple factors that tend to affect mate selection in fish, such as the observation of male-male interactions and male coloration [Selz: 2016]. For this experiment, our group is exploring the effect of male coloration of female mate preferences. Previous research has shown varying results among fish species about the effect of coloration: as in Chrysiptera cyanea, the females showed little favor to male tail coloration [Wacker: 2016], but another study on Pundamilia nyererei found that male coloration was a significent contributor to female mate selection [Selz: 2016]. There are multiple reasons why coloration could be a factor in female mate selection, and we believed that the two most compelling explanations (female preference will be determined by elapsed time in a region close to the male of a color) are that females favor male color vibrancy or that they favor males with similar colorations as themselves [Wacker: 2016, Endler: 1982], and we hypothesize that of these two explanations, the females will favor males with similar colorations as themselves. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment will be set up in a three-part fish tank, approximately 30 cm in length. This tank is split into three sections, separated by a glass separator and a plastic opaque separator between each. On each side, a male will be placed, a male who is either beige, blue, or red, and different from the fish on the other side. Then a female is placed in the middle section, and she is of one of the two colors: beige or red (with the red being more vibrant). This middle section is split into three sections, the two outer sections being 4 cm and the inner section being 3 cm (middle section is 11 cm) and labeled in a place clearly visible such that it is obvious which part of the middle section is which section. We then had three separate timers, each to record the time elapsed inside each section by the female over a five-minute time period. Then we as a group ran this experiment and recorded the time in which the female was in each of the three sections  (this will be used to determine which color of the two she prefers). This same experiment is repeated multiple times with different color combinations (our experiment was three trials per color of female).  Then, in order to determine the significance of the test, a two-sample t_test (one tail) was used. 

Results:
Our results showed that there was not a statistically significent relationship (=0.05) between female fish favoring the region aligning with the male fish with like colors—there was a significent between the time spent in Region 3 and Region 1 (favoring beige males) by the beige females (P-Value = 0.0386), but there was also a statistically significent relationship between the time spent in Region 3 and Region 1 (also favoring beige males) by red females (P-Value = 0.0418). When combined, there was a statistically significent difference between the time spent in Region 3 by all female fish and the time spent in Region 1 by all female fish. However, there was not a statistically significent difference (P-Value = 0.0565) in the time spent in Region 3 by the beige females then by the red females. 

Discussion:
Because there was not a significent relationship between the time spent by the females in the region corresponding to the male of the same color, we conclude that we do not have sufficient evidence to support that female Betta splendins favor in mate selection males that share their same color. This implies that Betta splendins are more similar Chrysiptera cyanea than Pundamilia nyererei [Wacker: 2016, Selz: 2016]. However, our data does support that female Betta splendins favor beige males, which would support the claim that the color of the male does play a role. However, the beige males tended to be smaller and display less aggressive behaviors then the red males in the experiment, and both of these factors could have presented lurking variables that would require further testing to differentiate whether it was the color of the male, the size of the male, or the aggressive displays of the male in the direction of the female. For example, in Teleost fish, females tend to choose the male who is the more dominant male in male to male competition, based both on aggressive displays and body size [Gonclaves-de-Freitas 2009]. Another example, is that in Gobiusculus flavescens, male fish actually are the sexual selectors, and in the case of G. flavescens, the male selectors choose females with more vibrant colors [Amundsen 2001]. Thus, for further testing, one could attempt to block on aggressive displays such that these potential lurking variables could be eliminated, and determine whether color plays any role in B. splendins sexual selection, and if color does not, further testing could explore the relationship between dominant displays or male size with female mate selection.
