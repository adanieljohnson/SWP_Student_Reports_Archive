Title: The Effect that Sodium Blocker, 25 mM Lidocaine, has on Rana pippins Gastrocnemius Muscles Contraction Thresholds

Abstract:
In this lab, we tested the effect that a sodium channel blocker, 25 mM Lidocaine, had on muscle contraction thresholds. The release of sodium into the neuron is an essential step in communicating a response from an internal or external stimuli. In this lab, we used an iWork TA machine and a computer software known as LabScribe in order to observe myograms of the contractions in the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens leg. We predicted that the specimens that received the 25 mM Lidocaine treatment would require a greater stimulus amplitude. We predicted this because the sodium blocker would delay depolarization in the neuron, which would in turn, also delay the emission of action potentials, increasing the gastrocnemius contraction threshold. After conducting three trials on three separate frog legs, we confirmed our hypothesis, therefore, stating that blocking voltage gated sodium channels results in higher contraction thresholds.  


Introduction:
Nerves and muscles are essential anatomical structures that allow organisms to sense and respond to both internal and external stimuli. Skeletal muscles allows for voluntary movement, which is conveyed through muscle contractions. In muscle contractions, action potentials are triggered in order to undergo excitation-contraction coupling. Action potentials travel along a neuron’s axon to the neuromuscular junction. In the neuromuscular junction, the action potential causes a depolarization in the cell, which releases a neurotransmitter known as acetylcholine (Ach) from a region known as the presynaptic terminal. Acetylcholine binds to the acetylcholine receptor in the muscle, which causes sodium channels to open and depolarize the cell. The depolarization of the cell triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a calcium rich region, to release calcium. The calcium that is released binds to the troponin, which is a part of the actin filament, causing the muscle to undergo a conformational change and expose the myosin binding site. The globular head on the myosin binds to the actin and allows for the filaments to slide past one another. As the myosin pulls the actin filaments closer and closer to the M-line, the sarcomere shortens, resulting in a muscle contraction. 
	Since muscle contractions rely on millions of these actin and myosin interactions, muscle contractions and relaxations can be better understood and analyzed via the usage of a myogram. A myogram is a graphical portrayal of bundles of actin and myosin interactions. Myogram graphs are used to examine three phases of muscle contraction, the latent period, contraction period, and relaxation period. The latent period is the time between when a stimulus occurs and muscle contraction begins. The contraction period is when the sarcomere shortens and reaches maximal contraction. The relaxation period is the duration of time in which the muscle elongates back to its resting state. 
	One biologically natural phenomenon that can influence the height of these myogram peaks, and therefore, the amount of force the muscle is exerting is summation. In this lab, temporal summation is used, which is when active axons stimulate the neuron repeatedly, which can cause the muscle to exert more force. 
	With these facts in mind, we hypothesized that by inhibiting depolarization via the usage of a sodium blocker, 25mM Lidocaine, it would take longer for the muscle to reach the contraction threshold, due to inhibiting the action potential emission rates. The neuron is lines with voltage gated sodium channels, which is largely responsible for depolarizing and sending action potentials. Therefore, if we inhibit the release of sodium, it will take longer for depolarization to occur, which will slow the overall muscle contraction rate. 


Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we used three Rana pipiens legs. For each leg we first assessed the amount of stimuli required to reach the muscle contraction threshold, without any dosage of Lidocaine. First, we dissected the skin off the leg in order to expose the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve. Once the interior of the leg was exposed, we isolated the gastrocnemius muscle by severing connective tissue. We then tied a string to the achilles tendon and suspended the muscle. Once we adjusted the string to be a good tension, we carefully placed the sciatic nerve over two probes connected to the iWORKS TA machine. We then began to emit signals using a computer software known at LabScribe, starting at low amplitude, 0.1 Hz, and slowly increasing the amplitude by 0.1 Hz increments, until the threshold was located. Once we reached the threshold, we will test the threshold value in three trials in order to precisely confirm the threshold value. Once we confirm the threshold, we will use a syringe to inject 0.10 mL of 25 mM Lidocaine. After the Lidocaine injection, we will wait five minutes until we start testing for the threshold. We will find the threshold using the same technique used on the control leg. Once we locate the threshold for the treatment leg, we will perform the same procedure on two other legs for precision. We will use a paired T-test and standard deviation to support and further analyze our results. 


Results:
According to Table 1 and Figure 1, the average contraction threshold for the control legs, the legs that did not receive the 25 mM Lidocaine treatment, was smaller than that of the legs that did receive the 25mM Lidocaine injection. The first leg had a control contraction threshold of 0.11, which underwent a significant increase to 1.05 ± 0.007 upon the 0.1 mL Lidocaine injection. A similar trend was observed in the second leg. The control contraction threshold was 0.33 ± 0.007 and when 25 mM Lidocaine entered the gastrocnemius muscle, the contraction threshold increased to 1.03 ± 0.212.  The large deviation in consistency in the treatment threshold value seen in the third leg can be account for by the larger dosage of 25 mM Lidocaine. The larger dosage was required because after adding the first dosage, the myogram did not read any contractions. Therefore, we inferred that the lidocaine did not make it to the gastrocnemius muscle, which required us to add more Lidocaine in order to trigger contractions. Nonetheless, the control contraction threshold was 0.1433 ± 0.007 and increased to 3.41 ± 0.00 upon interaction with the 25 mM Lidocaine. In Table 2, the paired T-test and P-test show that the data that we retrieved was not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Our data supports our hypothesis, which states that injecting 25 mM Lidocaine increased the contraction threshold. The sodium blocker chemical inhibited the release of sodium into the neuron, therefore, inhibiting depolarization. Since depolarization was inhibited, the cell was not able to generate action potentials, meaning that when the leg was treated with 0.1 mL of 25 mM Lidocaine, to required a larger stimuli in order to contract. This phenomenon is accurately portrayed in Figure 1 and Table 1. The orange columns, which represent the 25 mM Lidocaine treated legs contraction threshold, are almost double the control group stimuli. Furthermore, Table 2, supports that the average control threshold is 0.19 while the average treatment is 1.83, which is more than double that of the control. The P-test was conducted on a 95% interval, meaning that anything above the 0.05 benchmark would be considered statistically insignificant. We calculated a 0.183 P-value which proves our results as statistically insignificant. 
By blocking the sodium channels, the cell was unable to communicate the stimuli to the muscle. Since depolarization is dependent on the release of sodium into the neuron, by inhibiting this release action potential emissions were delayed significantly. These results emphasize the biological importance of normal operating sodium channels, and the vitality of sodium emission in muscle contractions.
