Title: The Effect of Acetylcholine on the Duration of Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
In this study, we tested whether the injection of acetylcholine into the gastrocnemus of the frog leg would increase the duration of the muscle contraction.  We tested four different frog legs muscle contractions before and after the injection of acetylcholine three different times.  We found that injecting acetylcholine into the frog’s leg consistently caused an increase in the duration of the muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Sodium channels and sodium potassium channels both open when the cell body is stimulated causing sodium to stream into the cell.  This is conducted down the axon through the myelin sheaths reaching the dendrites.  After this, calcium is released into the neuron causing acetylcholine to enter vesicles and leaving the axon terminals through exocytosis entering the synaptic cleft. Then, acetylcholine journeys across the cleft binding to the muscle to cause contractions. In The Role of Calcium in the Secretory Response of the Adrenal Medulla to Acetylcholine, Rubin and Douglas find that calcium is an essential component to the use of acetylcholine.  In their experiment, they omitted calcium and as a result, there was no secretory response of the adrenal medulla to acetylcholine [Rubin: 1961]. Brown’s study, The Actions of Acetylcholine on Denervated Mammalian and Frog Muscles, shows that the amount of acetylcholine plays a large role in the nature of the muscle contraction [Brown: 1937]. If we inject 10 Ml of acetylcholine into the frog leg, the duration of the contraction will increase. 

Materials and Method:
We tested four different frog legs with and without acetylcholine and measured the duration of the contraction.  The controll was measuring the duration of the contraction before the acetylcholine was injected, and the experimental was injecting that same frog leg with 10 Ml of acetylcholine with a syringe.  We did this with four different frog legs.  We compared the controll and the experimental of the four different frog legs and ran a paired t test of the data. 

Results:
The duration of the contractions were consistently longer in the experimental groups than they were in the controll group.  We know this is significent because the P value was &lt; 0.05. The mean of the controll group is 57, and the mean of the experimental group is 63.  The standard deviation is 7.365+/- 10.996.  The P value was 0.01.  The t value was -5.09.  The d.f. was 3. 

Discussion:
The injection of acetylcholine into the frog leg increases the duration of the muscle contraction.  This is because the acetylcholine causes the cell to become depolarized which allows sodium channels to open causing calcium ions to be released into the cell, which causes the contraction.  This increase of calcium lengthens the duration of the contraction [Rubin: 1961].  In Brown’s study, Action Potentials of Normal Mammalian Muscle.  Effects of Acetylcholine and Eserine, the injection of acetylcholine in the gastrocnemus of cats produced a different burst of action that preceded the muscle contraction.  To further this study, one could test the effect of acetylcholine on the muscles between mammalians and amphibians.  They would have to controll the amount of acetylcholine used in proportion to the weight of each organism. In the Actions of Acetylcholine on Denervated Mammalian and Frog Muscle, Brown found that the reason for this double contraction was a larger dose of acetylcholine.  Therefore, we can conclude that a small amount of acetylcholine will largely increase the duration of the muscle contraction.
