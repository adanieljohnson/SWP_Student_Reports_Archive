Title: Hormones' Effect on the Life Cycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Insect metamorphosis is a necessity for the development of insects. This process is facilitated by hormones, specifically ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone. When the balance of either of these hormones is jeopardized, the life cycle of the insects will be disrupted. In this experiment, juvenile hormone was the focus. This lab tested the effect of added Martin’s IGR (an analogue of juvenile hormone) to the diets of Manduca sexta. Four Manduca sexta were fed a normal diet while the other four were given the treatment of Martin’s IGR. It was predicted that the addition of this treatment would inhibit the growth of the experimental group. The hypothesis was confirmed. The experimental group developed less than the control group. This was measured by length (in cm), weight (in grams), and observations. The experiment took place over seven days and the end results showed a larger increase in length and weight of the control group than the experimental group. Since juvenile hormone levels normally decrease during pupation, the added Martin’s IGR caused irregularities in the hormone levels of the Manduca sexta that resulted in their impaired growth.


Introduction:
There are mainly two hormones that control the growth and development of insects: ecdysteroids and juvenile hormones [Truman: 1999]. Ecdysteroids are more active through adulthood while juvenile hormones are at higher levels earlier in the life cycle of insects and then decrease into adulthood [Johnson: 2016]. Juvenile hormone levels are high up until the fifth larval instar and then drop during the pupa stage and into adult development [Léopold: 2006]. Since juvenile hormone plays such a large role in the life cycle of insects, the addition of juvenile hormone to the food of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, would greatly influence the development of the animal. There have been many studies done where insects are treated with IGR’s, or insect growth regulators, to see if their development is affected. These IGR’s mimic the effects of juvenile hormone. For this reason, IGR’s have also been used to eradicate pests by messing up the hormone balance of these insects. Too much juvenile hormone later in life can greatly inhibit the development of insects or even kill them [Léopold: 2006]. The purpose of this experiment is to determine the effect Martin’s IGR on Manduca sexta. Martin’s IGR is an analogue of juvenile hormone and will act in the same way. Added Martin’s IGR will prevent the experimental group from growing in length and weight to the same extent as the control group.



Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta were taken and divided evenly into 2 groups: experimental and control. Each insect in the control group was fed 10 grams of food with 6 drops of water every other day. The independent variable for the control group was the water. Each insect in the experimental group was fed 10 grams of food with 6 drops of Martin’s IGR every other day. The independent variable for the experimental group was the Martin’s IGR. The weight and length of every insect was recorded every day for seven days. Also, daily observations were noted. 
	The statistical test used in this experiment was a two-sample T test. 


Results:
The experiment showed that the addition of Martin’s IGR did, in fact, affect the development of the Manduca sexta. The treated Manduca sexta were a very pale blue by the end of the seven days while the control group had a very vibrant blue/green color. Also the control group tended to be more active and strong as they would fight back more when being measured or picked up. Also, although the experimental group started with a longer length, the control group grew to be longer and heavier than the experimental group. 


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that the experimental group of Manduca sexta would grow at a slower rate than the control group because of the added hormone to their food. The results show that the added Martin’s IGR did negatively impact the growth of the Manduca sexta. In the normal life cycle of Manduca sexta, the levels of juvenile hormone in the body decrease after the fourth larval instar and barely any juvenile hormone is produced as the Manduca sexta develops into an adult [Johnson: 2016]. Martin’s IGR copies the effects of juvenile hormone, so it makes sense that the experimental group experienced setbacks from the treatment. With the direction that this experiment was trending, it is likely that given a few more days, the differences in weight and length between the control and experimental groups would continue to increase. Another thing that is important to note is that while the experimental group began with a longer mean length, 3.81 cm, as compared to the control group, 3.73 cm, by the end of the experiment, the treated group had a lower mean length than the control group. The treated group had a average length of 6.61 cm on the seventh day while the control group ended with a mean length of 7.18 cm. This is clear data proving that the Martin’s IGR caused the experimental group to have setbacks in their development. The masses of both groups confirm the same hypothesis. The control group exhibited a 6.728 g increase in weight over the course of the seven days while the experimental group only gained 5.93 g. To conclude, while Martin’s IGR did not kill the Manduca sexta or drastically change their growth, it did impair their growth to a noticeable extent and change their color.
