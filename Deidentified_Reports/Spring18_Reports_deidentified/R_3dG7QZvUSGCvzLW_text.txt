Title: Increased Root Growth in Vigna radiata Grown Under Blue Light

Abstract:
The allocation of energy and material in plants for the purpose of growth changes depending on the availability of resources in the plants environment. One limited resource is light. A plant provided with poor light would allocate more resources towards stem growth so that it could better collect what limited light was available. A plant provided with high energy light would allocate more resources towards root growth since it has sufficient energy from light to seek out nutrients in the soil. Since plants are able to draw more energy from blue light than white light, a plant grown in white light would have a lower root to shoot ratio. In order to test this we grew two sets of Vigna radiata, one under blue light and one under white light and then measured the mass of the plants. Using these measurements we calculated the root to shoot ratio. However, when analyzing our results it became clear that our hypothesis was not supported by the data collected, because there was no significent change in growth patterns.


Introduction:
Under different conditions plants will change the ways they allocate resources to better access the resources available to them. For instance plants that are exposed to high levels of nitrogen will grow less roots and will place more energy into leaf growth. However, if a plant is exposed to low levels of nitrogen it will grow more roots and place less energy into leaf growth [Farrior: 2013]. Other conditions that change the allocation of resources in plants is exposure to water and exposure to sunlight. Limited sunlight is frequently an obstacle to the growth of plants largely due to competition from other plants [Craine: 2013]. A plant’s ability to perform photosynthesis changes in different wavelengths of light; the most energy can be absorbed through blue and violet light and the least through green light. Therefore it is safe to assume the wavelength of light a plant is grown in will affect how a plant allocates its resources. We decided to grow two groups of Vigna radiata, or mung beans, one group under blue light and one under white light. Vigna radiata was chosen due to its larger size which made it easier to measure. We expected that the plants grown under white light would allocate more resources to leaf and stem growth and would thus have a lower root to shoot ratio than those grown under blue light.   


Materials and Method:
We prepared six trays of mung beans to be grown in loose vermiculite treated with miracle grow. Three of the trays were to be grown under a tent of blue plastic, which converted all light to a blue wavelength, and three were to be grown under a tent of clear plastic, which left the light at its natural white wavelength. After growing the plants for two weeks we harvested nine, randoMly selected plants from each tray. We separated the nine plants into three groups and measured the mass of each group. We then removed the roots, cutting the plant just above the first lateral root to grow off of the taproot. We then measured the masses of the now rootless groups. In order to find the mass of the roots we simply subtracted the shoot mass from the total mass. This allowed us to calculate the ratio of root mass to shoot mass. We then ran two-tailed t tests on the root to shoot ratio results and on the total mass values.


Results:
The plants grown under the blue plastic tent grew no larger than the plants grown under the clear plastic. The average mass of the plants grown under blue light was 2.51 grams and the average mass of the plants grown under white light was 2.50 grams (Figure 1). The P value for the average masses was 0.9418 meaning the results are not statistically significent. The root to shoot ratio was not significently different between the plants grown under clear plastic and the plants grown under blue plastic. The root to shoot ratio of the plants grown in blue light averaged to be 0.39 and the root to shoot ratio of the plants grown under white light averaged to be 0.47 (Figure 2). However, the P value for the two sets of data was calculated to be 0.3407 meaning the results are not statistically significent.


Discussion:
Although at first look it appeared that the results suggest the inverse of our hypothesis the t test reveals that the results were not significent. This instead implies that the experiment supported the null hypothesis, that the color of light has no effect on resource allocation in plants. However, this result is not supported by other research on the topic [Craine: 2013] [Farrior: 2013]. Because there were no obvious mistakes made further experiments could be done to confirm that our results were unusual. The experiment could be conducted using a longer growth period or with another plant. Also a more rigorous watering schedule could be set in place. Our watering habits in this test were not ideal and it could have been that water was the limiting resource for our plants and not light, which would have potentially altered the plants allocation of resources and thus our data [Farrior: 2013].
