Title: How Soil and Sand Alter the Allocation of Resources (root to shoot ratios) in Raphanus raphanistrum Growth

Abstract:
Plants allocate their resources and adapt their growth to attain the necessary means for photosynthesis in different environments. Though not all plants can adapt at every season and in every location, they are capable of being adjusting to survive. The root to shoot ratio, which demonstrates growth regarding resource allocation, will be higher in plants with a larger root biomass than shoot biomass. We examined the ability of radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum) to adapt their growth in sand versus soil. To do this, we grew two samples of plants, under the same environmental conditions, in soil or in sand. Two weeks in, we uprooted the plants and took measurements of their root and shoot masses and lengths. We predicted that plants grown in sand would have a higher root to shoot ratio because they would need to grow out their roots further than soil plants would to attain water and nutrients. We expected sand to be less nutrient rich and worse at retaining water than soil. However, we found that over a two-week period, the soil grown radishes had a higher ratio. The sand held more water than we had anticipated which would have limited the need for root growth. However, wet sand packs, which would make root growth harder than in soil. Overall, our results show that radishes dist

Overall, our results show that radishes distribute more of their resources to root growth in soil and shoot growth in sand.

Plants require resources to photosynthesize and survive, like water, CO2, nutrients, and sunlight. However, these resources are limited and while some environments will be rich in certain resources, they can be lacking in others. Therefore, plants will adapt their growth to obtain the necessary amounts of the limited resource. Additionally, plants have a given amount of resources at any given point and it allocates these resources to different structures [Weiner: 2004]. Therefore, plants of one species cannot grow in certain environments where others can. Certain species can allocate their resources to attain more sunlight or CO2 while other plant can allocate well to attain nutrients and water. As a result, the plants will be more successful in adapting to some environments while they are unable to sufficiently adapt to others. Plants will distribute their energy in ways the search out or preserve the limited environmental resource, while minimizing energy used to attain abundant resources. This lab observes the root to shot ratio of plants grown in the University Greenhouse: Raphanus raphanistrum (radishes) to determine how their resources are allocated in two different and controllled environments. The root to shoot ratio divides the root biomass by the shoot biomass and depicts results that depend on separation of photosynthate that is influenced by environmental stimuli [Rogers, 1995]. which shows the plants’ ability to acquire different resources in given settings. In theory, plants allocate more energy to root growth where water or nutrients are far underground and less resources to shoot growth where sunlight is abundant. I predict that plants grown in sand, with controllled levels of CO2, water, and sunlight, will have a higher root to shoot ratio than plants under the same conditions but grown in soil because the sand plants will need to grow out their roots to attain nutrients and water that is easily attained in soil.

Materials and Method:
We planted six trays of radish seeds; three trays were soil and three trays were sand. For the next two weeks, the plants were watered every day. Starting with a sand trays, we carefully took the plants out of their tray so as not to break the roots. We broke apart the vermiculite in a water bucket, and rinsed the dirt off five individual plants from the first sand tray. After patting them dry, we massed the whole five plants and recorded the data. Then we chose the longest plant of the five and measured the root and shoot lengths at their maximums, and recorded the data. Once the plant was measured, we separated the plants by cutting them at the junction. We, then, massed the five shoots collectively and recorded the data. To get the root mass, we subtracted the shoot mass from the whole mass. We did the same for the rest of the sand trays and then the soil trays. We recorded the data in the following tables and excel graphs with standard deviation, as well as created a two-sample t_test.

Results:
The radishes had higher root to shoot ratios in soil than in sand. The mass root to shoot ratio of sand was .331 and .373 for soil. The length root to shoot ratio for sand was 1.14 and 1.33 for soil. As figure 1 shows, all the measurements had low standard deviations except for the sand length ratio because one plant in replicate 1 had a long root length of 14.12 cm (Table 1) which effected the deviation calculation. When all replicates were considered together, the difference for the length ratio was not significent (t= .66, d.f.=4, p> 0.5). However, the difference for the mass ratios was significent (t=.95, d.f.=4, p< 0.5).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that sand would grow plants with higher root to shoot ratios than plants grown in soil was not supported. In both cases, mass and length, the soil produced higher root to shoot ratios. The sand retained water better than what was expected so the roots of the plants did not have to grow to extraordinary lengths to obtain water (which is what was expected). The sand was also expected to be less nutrient rich, which would have, in theory, increased root growth to seek out nutrients. A study about plant growth in costal sand dune soils, suggested that deficiencies in nutrients, like phosphorous and nitrogen, limit the growth of annual plant species [Kachi and Hirose: 1983]. Yet, that did not hold true in this experiment. As shown in Table 1, the root to shoot mass ratio was .331 for sand and .373 for soil (Table 2). The root to shoot length ratio for sand was 1.14 (Table 1) and 1.33 for soil (Table 2). This means that the roots of the sand plants were growing less in relation to the shoots than the plants from the soil. However, the ratio for length proved to be insignificent data, even though it matches the trends of the mass ratio. Besides attaining water, this could have happened because the sand became very compact making it hard for the roots to extend. This shows that sand plants did not need to, or could not, allocate their resources in ways to attain more water and nutrients. However, as the plants grow larger, they would need more resources which could change the root to shoot ratios. To photosynthesize, in this experiment, the sand plants did not allocate their resources in the same ways as the soil plants did.
