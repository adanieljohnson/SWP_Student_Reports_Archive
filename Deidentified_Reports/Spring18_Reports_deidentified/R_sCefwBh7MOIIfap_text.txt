Title: Lidocaine, Sodium Channel Blocker, Effect on the Threshold Stimulus of the Action Potential in Muscle Fibers

Abstract:
The goal of this lab is to be able to observe the effect lidocaine has on the threshold stimulus of the muscle contraction in the leg of the Rana pipiens.  The Rana pipiens, more commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, can grow up to lengths of 11 cm.  We believe lidocaine will cause the threshold stimulus of an action potential to increase due to the fact that multiple sodium channels have been blocked and therefore causes a less rapid depolarization.  We will expose and utilize the Leopard Frog’s gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve to visualize the effects of inputting electrical circuits from the iWorks machine.  Our second leg stopped functioning before we were able to finish collecting data.  The first frog leg reacted to the electrical impulses pre and post lidocaine, however, the decrease in the threshold was very minimal and therefore would not yield good results and p-value.  However, in the end we were able to calculate that our hypothesis was indeed supported.


Introduction:
In this lab we are utilizing the leg of the Rana pipiens, more commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, which varies in size between 5-11 cm.  We are utilizing this organism due to the fact that it’s muscle contraction goes through the same steps as of humans and also have a gastrocnemius muscle.  The purpose of this lab is to determine the effect of Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, on the threshold stimulus of the action potential in the frog leg.  We isolate the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg as well as the sciatic nerve in order to observe the effect of the electrical stimuli.  Nerves stimulate the muscle contraction through excitation-coupling, which converts electrical signal to mechanical response.  During excitation-coupling, action potentials travel through the nerve and arrive at the neuromuscular junction, the depolarization of the neuron causes the release of acetylcholine, which then diffuses into muscle fiber and binds to the membrane receptor.  This binding then causes sodium channels to open, which will generate the action potential in the muscle fiber.  Once the action potential has traveled through the length of the fiber, calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is stimulated, which then activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber.  Sodium channels open within milliseconds after acetylcholine binds in the muscle fiber membrane and this fast influx of sodium into the cell is responsible for rapid depolarization, setting the thresholds of electrical excitability and initiate action potentials.  Voltage gated sodium channels are crucial in initiating action potentials and any mutation that inhibits sodium channels can result in periodic paralysis due to inhibited muscle fiber excitability [Simkin: 2011].  We predict that if you inject a sodium channel blocker into the frog leg, you will observe an increase in the necessary threshold stimulus.


Materials and Methods:
Begin by preparing the frog, making sure the leg and the sciatic nerve do not try out (squirt ringer on the leg, however, be careful to not drown it).  Begin by removing the skin off the frog leg.  Start at the thigh and detach the skin and pull it off the rest of the leg.  Next, separate the thigh muscles in order to reveal the sciatic nerve (white string), be careful not to touch the nerve with any metal object, only fingers.  Once the sciatic nerve is exposed, use a scissor to separate the gastrocnemius from the tibia by inserting the scissor into the gap and moving it up and down the leg making sure all the connective tissue is cut.  Once they are separated cut at the base of the achilles tendon, making sure to get as much of it as you can.  Once the achilles is cut and the gastrocnemius is fully detached, take a string and fold it in half and tie it around the base of the gastrocnemius and above the achilles.  Double know it and make sure there is a loop hanging off.  Cut off the excess string, do not cut off the loop, and cut of the extra achilles tendon, make sure you do not cut too much off that the string will slip off.  Next, use the loop to hook the leg onto the hook coming off of the ring stand.  Adjust the ring stand accordingly so the leg lies flat while the gastrocnemius is upright and perpendicular to the rest of the leg.  The string holding up the gastrocnemius should be taut with a little room to move.  After the leg is in place, stabilize the tibia by placing two needles over it making sure it cannot move.  Stabilize the femur the same way as the tibia, you can put the needle through the muscle but make sure you do not touch the sciatic nerve.  Once the entire leg is stabilized, tie silver wire around each electrode and lie the sciatic nerve over each wire, making sure to not overlap the wires.  Once the wires are in place, labscribe is ready to be used.  Do not change any of the settings except the AMP.  Begin by finding the threshold of each leg.  Start at .1V and work up until you see a noteable myogram (if see movement at .1V decrease until no movement is seen and note the lowest voltage movement was seen).  Once the threshold is found, set to a desired voltage above the threshold that you will use for both the control shock and the treatment shock, this will enable you to compare the changing thresholds).  When testing the treatment leg, inject 1 mL of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle.  Inject half of the lidocaine near the bottom of the gastrocnemius and half at the middle. Once all data is collected, we used a paired t-test in order to evaluate our results.


Results:
Looking at the bar graph it is clear that the threshold of the treatment group did increase significantly.  The average threshold for the control group was .162 with a standard deviation of +/-.111.  The average threshold for the treatment group was .364 with a standard deviation of +/- .231.  

Observations:
For the first leg we did not get a threshold value for the control.  We also did not see a drastic enough decrease in the treatment threshold of leg one.  Leg two stopped reacting to the electrical impulses and therefore we were unable to receive all the data necessary.

T-value: 4.777597
Degrees of freedom: 8
P-value: .001005 (since our p-value was lower than .05 our results are significant)


Discussion:
After calculating our p-value (.001005) it is evident that our hypothesis was supported.  In our results we saw an increase in the threshold after injecting the sodium channel blocker, lidocaine.  This demonstrates that when voltage gated sodium channels are blocked an increase in voltage is necessary in order to successfully activate an action potential in the frog leg.  This indicates the importance of sodium channels in muscle contraction due to the fact that the inhibition of sodium channels increases the difficulty of activating an action potential in the muscle fiber.  In another study lidocaine was injected into the nerve cell soma in rats and an increase in firing threshold, action potential duration and intracellular current threshold for firing the cells all increased significantly (p-value was also lower than .01).  These results showed that the postsynaptic cell is the main target site of action for lidocaine since it is more sensitive than the presynaptic nerve fibers [Tabatabai:1990].  The study also states that the action potential amplitude decreased in the presence of lidocaine, which we observed as well in our data.  The results in this study are important due to the fact that they show how local anesthetics, when injected in areas where cell bodies, axons and dendrites are present together, affect cell bodies and the processes, as well as suppressing excitability and function.  Possible sources of error in the lab could have been not placing the silver wires securely under the sciatic nerve or having them over lapping each other.  Improvements for future studies could involve more carefully distributing the lidocaine throughout the gastrocnemius, with care to not over inject in one area.  Studying the effect of blocking sodium channels can also provide further insight for muscular debilitating diseases.
