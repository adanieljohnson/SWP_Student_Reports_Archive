Title: Allocation in Plants Resulting from Acid Rain

Abstract:
The presence of acid rain in a particular area causes harmful effects on an environment such as depleting nutrients and leaching harmful substances from the soil. Plants that are exposed to low-nutrient soil typically develop longer roots to obtain nutrients over a larger area. Because of this, this experiment hypothesized that plants exposed to acid rain would have longer roots, and a larger root to shoot ratio. Wheat (Triticum) seeds were grown for two weeks. A controll group was watered daily with water while the experimental (acid rain) group was watered daily with a solution with a pH of 4 (which is similar to the average pH of acid rain). Results found that the root to shoot ratio was higher in the controll group, which differed from the hypothesis. A t_test finalized that these results were not significent enough to conclude that wheat watered with a pH of 4 will have smaller root to shoot ratios. After the experiment, it was found that depletion of the soil due to acid rain is usually a long-term effect, so results of soil exposed to a pH 4 solution for two weeks would not show differences from the controll group of wheat. 

Introduction:
Acid rain has become a common phenomena due to the high amount of pollutants in the air. Pollutants such as sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides are emitted from industrial factories and power generating plants where they then mix with water in the air to form strong acids. (McGee: 1997) Since they have mixed with water, they are precipitated along with rain, snow, and hail. The average acidity of acid rain varies from a pH of 4.0 to 4.4 (McGee: 1997). This pH level can be harmful to the environment. Acid rain can affect plants and their environment by leaching aluminum (which can harm plants) from the soil and also removing needed minerals and nutrients that are needed for growth (EPA: 2017).
	Plants that typically grow in low-nutrient soil will have longer roots in comparison to plants that grow in soil with plenty of nutrients. Roots are usually longer in low-nutrient soil in order to obtain more nutrients through a larger space and surface area (Atwell: 1999). This also means that these plants will have a larger root to shoot ratio. Since acid rain has a tendency of creating a poor-nutrient soil, plants that are watered with a solution with the same pH of acid rain will have longer roots in order to obtain nutrients in the soil, and will also have a higher root to shoot ratio. This experiment will test this hypothesis to discover if there is a correlation between acidity and poor-nutrient soil. 


Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, two groups of plants were grown and watered with two solutions that had a different pH. After results were finalized, a t_test was used to compare the two groups of plants watered with either tap water of a solution of pH 4. 

Materials: wheat (Triticum) seeds, water, pH 4 solution, vermiculite, 6 pots, Miracle-Gro, scissors, scale, ruler, container for separating plants, bowl

Variables: 
-Dependent: root to shoot ratio (R:S)
-Independent: pH of water
-Controls: sunlight, temperature, soil type (vermiculite)

Procedure / Experimental Setup:
1. Label six pots. Three are labeled ‘controll’ and three are labeled ‘pH 4’ in order to differentiate between plants.
2. Fill all pots to the top with vermiculite, then drench the vermiculite with water and add Miracle-Gro. While doing this, place the seeds in a bowl of water to sit.
3. Place about 50-100 seeds in each pot and water well. Place the pots in a greenhouse to grow.
4. Water plants daily, using tap water for the controll and pH 4 solution for the test group (which can be distinguished by the labels from step 1). Water each pot until water drips through the bottom.
5. After two weeks, remove plants from soil one pot at a time using a large container filled with water. Remove five plants from each pot and clean them with water until there is no more vermiculite on the plant. 
6. Dry the plant and measure its mass. Then cut the plant in half where the root and shoot meet and measure the mass and length of each individual root and shoot.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for all six pots. 


Results:
The graph shows the calculated averages of the root to shoot ratios of the controll plants and the pH 4 group plants, along with their standard deviations through error bars. On average, the root to shoot ratio was higher in the controll group than in the pH 4 group.
The P-value that was found through the t_test is much higher than the expected P-value. 

Discussion:
The results showed that the average root to shoot ratio was higher in the controll group than in the pH 4 group. However, this was only by a very small amount. The hypothesis stated that the root to shoot ratio would be higher in the pH 4 group plants because the roots would be longer because of less nutrients in the soil. The averages of the root to shoot ratios showed that this hypothesis was incorrect. Since the results were very close together, a t_test was used to determine if the results were significent enough to conclude that the root to shoot ratios of the controll group were significently higher. The P-value that was found was much higher than what would be expected, which means that the null hypothesis is accepted. This means that there is no significance to the results of the root to shoot ratio being higher in the controll group than in the pH 4 group. However, the hypothesis for the experiment can still not be accepted because the results did not show a distinction between the root to shoot ratios of the groups. 
	Since these results differed from the hypothesis, there must be another explanation to why the root to shoot ratios did not differ. At first, I thought this may have been because of the presence of mold growing on the top of the soil in the pots. However, this was the same in each pot, so it would act like a controll that did not differ between groups. Then, I discovered that soil nutrient depletion is a more long-term effect of acid rain (2018). The pH 4 solution was only present in the vermiculite for two weeks, so it did not have enough time to create a low-nutrient soil environment. If this experiment were repeated, it would be best to allow the soil to be exposed to a lower pH solution before planting the seeds so that the solution would have time to deplete the soil of its nutrients. 
	In general, plants will adapt to poor soil environments by having longer roots for nutrient uptake. If the low pH of acid rain causes poor-nutrient soil, a soil that is constantly treated with a low pH solution should have poor soil over time. The plants that grow in that soil would then most likely have longer roots than plants whose soil (and plants) were not exposed to acid rain.
