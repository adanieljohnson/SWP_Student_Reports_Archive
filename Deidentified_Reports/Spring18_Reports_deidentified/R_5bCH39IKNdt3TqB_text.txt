Title: Precor and its Effect on the Manduca sexta Caterpillar 

Abstract:
Over the course of the week, our group observed and analyzed the effect of a Juvenile Hormone mimic –Precor, on the development and growth of Manduca sexta larvae. We predicted that if we added the Precor to the diet of the Manduca sexta 4th instar larvae, the larvae growth and development would stunt, and their health will deteriorate. Each day, the control larvae received 10 grams of food mixed with water, while the treatment larvae received 10 grams of food mixed with JH hormone. We recorded their weights and physical observations every day. Overall, we could not analyze the effect of JH hormone on molting in particular because none of the larvae actually molted. We did observe that JH has negative side effects on development by looking at the weights and physical characteristics of the caterpillars. However, based off of the T-test we conducted, the difference in weights were significant, therefore we can accept the hypothesis that JH hormone will cause detrimental health effects on the Manduca sexta larvae.


Introduction:
Introduction
Like vertebrates, insects control growth and development processes using hormones. Two hormones in particular are crucial to the cycle of molting and pupation in insects. Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and the JH hormone regulates the type of molt. JH and Ecdysterone work together to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis of insects. JH levels are high in the first stages but low after the molt in the 5th instar. A decreased level of JH is needed and involved in the metamorphosis from the caterpillar to pupa stage. The earliest observation of this was accidental. Researchers observed that IGR’s lead to abnormalities in insects, particularly in the linden bug (Tunaz, 2004). The IGR causes the bugs to fail to grow into mature adults, and it also causes low egg hatch rates. Similarly, the tobacco hornworm caterpillars, or Manduca sexta, has the same effects when exposed to JH Manduca sexta caterpillars are cheap and easy to store and maintain. The life cycle of the Manduca sexta ranges from 39-48 days.  Manduca sexta worms are an example of holometabolous insects, meaning they have four major life stages.   In this experiment, we will be looking at how JH levels affect Manduca sexta development. In order to test of JH affects the growth of the caterpillars, we will administer 4 drops of Precor into the food of the Manduca sexta for a seven day period. We hypothesize that compared to a Manduca sexta given no JH, it will mature slower.


Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the experiment, we used eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, all around the end of the 4th instar. We used four, round, plastic containers with four perforated lids and an index card dividing each container in half. One group of four caterpillars, the control group, was placed in two of the containers. Each caterpillar received 10 grams of food initially with 4 drops of water. The other group, the treatment group, was placed in the remaining two containers and was each given 10 grams of food with 4 drops of Precor, a JH mimic. The dilution of the Precor was 1:1250 in deionized water.  We measured their weight and length each day for seven days and placed them in the same incubator. We conducted a 2-sample t-test to determine the difference between the weights of the control groups versus the weights of the treatment groups. When we were done with the experiment, they were frozen. 


Results:
The Manduca sexta were not as active by the end of the week and were experiencing discoloration. A few of them had lost their bright green color and had brown markings on them. A couple had a yellow tint to them. We did observe harmful effects on weight, based on the 2-sample t-tests conducted. By comparing the physical observations each day, it is clear that the JH hormone had some negative effects on the treatment larvae. All six larvae started out with a bright green color, and were relatively active. By day 3, the activity and movement had changed significantly and the color of the caterpillars had also changed. Their size started to change and they also started to turn yellow, and slightly red. On day 4, some of the treatment caterpillars squirmed a significant amount when being picked up for weighing. Although this did not affect the caterpillars past day 4, it may have played into the weight recorded or the amount of food eaten.


Discussion:
Overall, we can accept our hypothesis that Precor will cause detrimental health effects on the Manduca sexta larvae. They were not as active by the end of the week and were experiencing discoloration. A few of them had lost their bright green color and had brown markings on them. A couple had a yellow tint to them. We did observe harmful effects on weight, based on the 2-sample t-tests conducted. By comparing the physical observations each day, it is clear that the JH hormone had some negative effects on the treatment larvae.  A decreased level of JH is needed and involved in the metamorphosis from the caterpillar to the pupa stage (Johnson, 2018). This trend can be observed, in Figure 1. However, there are many factors that could have possibly altered the results. The Manduca sexta’s moved a lot while being weighed, so their weights could have been different than what they actually were recorded as. To be able to come to a conclusion, further experimentation would have to be done. Our data may not have been strong enough because of the environment that the larvae were placed in, as well as the short duration of the experiment. If given more time and resources, a second experiment conducted over a longer period of time, such as two weeks, where the larvae are placed in individual containers could perhaps show a more direct causation between Precor and development.
