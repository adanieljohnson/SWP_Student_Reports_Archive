Title: Root to Shoot Ratio of Avena sativa in Different Soil

Abstract:
In this experiment, we planted Avena sativa, or oat, seeds in both vermiculite and half clay with half vermiculite and then compared the root to shoot ratios to look for potential differences in mass and length.   Results showed a significant difference in the length ratios of the two groups, but not the mass.  This is likely a result of the plants grown with clay facing the need to allocate more toward collecting water from the soil, because clay retains water more than vermiculite, making it more difficult for the roots to absorb.

Introduction:
Many factors—both biotic and abiotic—affect the growth of plants.  One of these abiotic factors is soil.  The factors’ effects can be studied through analysis of root to shoot ratio.  In this experiment, we grew Avena sativa (oats) from seeds in either vermiculite or half clay mixed with half vermiculite.  The hypothesis is that the plants grown in the combination of both soils will have a higher root to shoot ratio.  That is because it will likely be more difficult for the plants to extract water in the clay, so they will need longer roots in order to thrive in the more difficult conditions.

H0= There is no significant difference in root to shoot ratio of oat plants grown in the two conditions.
HA= The root to shoot ratio of oat plants grown on combination soil is significantly higher than that of plants grown in 100% vermiculite.


Materials and Methods:
1)Fill three containers with 100% vermiculite.
2)Fill three containers with 50% vermiculite and 50% clay.
3)Place oat seeds in each container.
4)Move plants to greenhouse.
5)Water daily.
6)Extract plants from soil and wash dirt from roots and shoots.
7)Measure mass and length of roots and shoots of five plants from each container.
8)Compare mass and length ratios of plants from each treatment condition.


Results:
We found a statistically significant difference in the in the root to shoot length ratio between the control (vermiculite) and experimental (clay and vermiculite) groups (t-stat = 6.592913 , df = 4, P = 0.002742).  We did not find a statistically significant difference in the in the root to shoot mass ratio between the control and experimental groups (t-stat = 0.246258, df = 4, P = 0.817603).  Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis for length and fail to reject the null hypothesis for mass.  This meets that we have sufficient evidence at the 95% confidence level the alternative hypothesis is supported for root to shoot length ratios.  We do not have sufficient evidence in terms of mass.


Discussion:
The difference in length ratios shows that the plants in the clay and vermiculite mixture likely had to allocate more effort into water uptake, thus resulting in longer roots.  Clay retains water, making it more difficult for the plants to absorb, so the longer roots help with the ease of that process.  
These findings are significant because the help us understand how plant allocation helps oats and other plants get the resources they need.  We are able to see that when a certain part of the plant, such as the roots, is having difficult carrying out its intended task(s), the plant will devote more toward making that part function.  For example, the oat plants that struggled with uptake of water through the roots grew longer roots to assistance in carrying out the task.
