Title: Different Types of Soil has No Effect on the Root to Shoot Ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum  in the First Two Weeks

Abstract:
 In all different types of environments, plants and are animals are able to allocate their resources in different situations. When plants allocate their resources, it is due to either a biotic or abiotic factors. Some plants are able to adapt to their changed environments better than others and it may or may not be due to the plants allocating their resources. This experiment was used to determine if the difference in where the Raphanus raphanistrum was planted would have an effect on the length root to shoot ratio. There were two sets of plants planted, with one set planted in vermiculite and the other planted in sand. Sand does not hold water as well as dirt soil, so the plants should have allocated its resources to the roots so the plant could get more water. This was disproven by the mean for the root to shoot ratio for the sand plants being 1.140.504 and for the plants in vermiculite being 1.130.110. The root to shoot ratio was higher in the radish plants that were planted in vermiculite. This could have been because root plants grow well in sand as well as dirt soil, or because the sand and dirt soil were watered every day which is not very typical in the real environment. The experiment showed inconclusive results and the difference in the ratios was not enough to make a

Introduction:
This experiment was performed based on the knowledge of resource allocation. At many different times in an ecosystem, a plant has a limited amount of resources and allows them to allocate their resources to different structures within itself [Iveta:2018]. Plants adapt to their environment based on different biotic and abiotic factors. Some plants have very little phenotypic plasticity and do not tolerate changes from different conditions, but some plants can adapt to many different conditions. In this experiment, different soils were used to see if Raphanus raphanistrum would adapt and allocate their resources to different structures. If Raphanus raphanistrum can adapt to many different types of conditions, they can easily be grown in many different environments. Sand does not hold water as well as vermiculate does, so it was expected that the Raphanus raphanistrum in the sand would allocate their resources more to the roots than the shoots in order to get enough water to grow. It was hypothesized that the Raphanus raphanistrum in the sand would have a higher root to shoot ratio than the Raphanus raphanistrum in the soil.

Materials and Methods:
There were two groups that were assessed in this experiment. There were three plants that were planted in sand and three that were planted in vermiculate. Each plant received miracle grow and then 10-15 seeds of Raphanus raphanistrum was placed in the sand and soil. The plants were placed in a green room in a place that had similar amounts of sunlight. Each day all of the plants were watered and this continued for two weeks until it was time to look at the root and shoots of each plant. After the plants were received form the green room, there were 10 plants that were harvested from each plant. The plants were weighed together, and then cut at the junction between the roots and shoots. The shoots were weighed and from this the root weight could be determined. The root to shoot ratio was determined and recorded. The longest root and shoot was picked from each plant and the length was recorded. The root to shoot length ratio was determined and recorded. The root to shoot ratio for both the weight and length for the plants in the soil and the sand was determined by taking the mean of the three of each plant. The mean was taken for each the root to shoot ratios for the length and weight. A two-sample t-test was also given to determine if the experiment was statistically significant

Results:
It was determined from the experiment the weight root to shoot ratio mean for the plants in the sand was 0.3310.0679 (Figure 1) and for the length it was 1.140.504 (Figure 2). The weight root to shoot ratio for the plants in vermiculate was 0.3730.0340 (Figure 1) and for the length it was 1.130.110 (Figure 2). [The weight was measured in grams and the length was measured in centimeters]. The value for the two-sample t-test for the weights is: t-stat= 0.951, df= 4, P= 0.396. The value for the two-sample t-test for the lengths is t-stat= 0.650, df= 4, P= 0.551.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment does not support the hypothesis stated at the beginning of the experiment. The results show the mean for the root to shoot ratio for the length was higher in the plants in the soil than in the sand. The two-sample t-test also shows the results of this data were significantly different. It was believed the sand would have a larger root to shoot ratio because of the allocation of the plants. There are many reasons why this hypothesis was not supported. When planting radishes, it is important to make sure the soil remains moist and the depth is just right and planting radishes from seed works best if the soil is moist but does not have standing water. This is a potential reason for the hypothesis not being supported by the experiment. The plants were watered each day and this allowed the sand to continue to be moist as well as the soil. In the real environment, it does not rain every day, so allowing the plants to be watered everyday may have affected the way radishes grow in the real environment. If the plants were not watered every day the sand would have not remained moist and it could have caused the plant to allocate its resources to its roots. Another reason the hypothesis may not be supported is because root vegetables specifically, will grow well in sand even when started from seed. This group includes vegetables such as radishes, carrots, potatoes, turnips and alliums like garlic and onion. This experiment only lasted for two weeks so the plants were not fully ready to be picked. Radishes must be able to adapt to new environments which allows them grow efficiently in different soils. Another experiment was done to determine what the effects of different abiotic stressors would have on plants [Zandalinas:2017]. This experiment showed that in all of the different environments there were many different reactions form the plants [Zandalinas:2017]. Some stressors caused positive interaction, negative interaction, or even no interaction [Zandalinas: 2017]. The effect of each of these stressors completely depended on the species, and because this plant can grow in moist sand, the stressors had no effect. This experiment could have been continued to see how as the plant continued to grow how the sand would affect the roots. If the plants got bigger, they many need more water, and the dirt soil holds it better. Also, if the plants were not watered every day, but instead every three days, it may show a difference in the root to shoot length ratio.
