Title: Female Beta Splendens Show No Preference for Larger Males Based on Appearance Alone

Abstract:
	By observing how Beta splendens respond to conditions and stimuli we can develope a greater understanding of their behavior. Mating behavior in this species is highly observable and is important to our understanding of evolution and the sustainability of a species. In this experiment, we focused on behavior in female Beta splendens in the presence of large and small male Beta splendens. We hypothesized that the female Beta splendens would show a higher preference for the larger male Beta splendens by engaging with them for longer periods of time than with the smaller Beta splendens. We tested this prediction by observing four situations in which a female Beta splenden and two males (one large and one small) are put in an aquarium separated by plastic dividers. After quantifying the engagement of the females with the males, our data showed that the females do not show any preference for larger or smaller males based on appearance alone, but by observing physical combat between the two and choosing the winner as a mate.  


Introduction:
Animals respond differently to different conditions and stimuli, and by observing them we can work to understand typical patterns of behavior, how allocation patterns change under low nutrient conditions, and in what ways these patterns change. 
	In some species, including Beta splendens, the males struggle against one another in competition over a potential female mate [Jones: 2009]. This is an example of an introspective behavior in which the male species displays aggression against another member of their species. The victor in these situations tends to be the male that mates with the female. In addition, in some species the female may choose a male based on his physical characteristics. For example, in some species, the females choose mates with more ornate appearances. This has evolved in these species because choosing mates with more elaborate features has led to the production of more viable offspring [Jones: 2009]. 
In this experiment, we focused on behavior in female Beta splendens in the presence of male Beta splendens (further referred to as betta fish). We designed the experiment to help quantify a female betta fish’s preference for male betta fish based on size. We focused on two categories in order to quantify the female betta fish’s behavior: total time the female betta fish was engaged with the larger compared to the smaller male betta fish and the amount of time spent on either side of the enclosure (whether it be closest to the larger male betta fish or the smaller male betta fish). Betta fish served as our test species because their behavior is easy to study. Due to the brightly colored bodies and aggressive behavior they make great organisms for studying sexual behavior [Brownell: 2014]. 
We hypothesized that female betta fish would show a stronger preference for large male beta fish over small male betta fish.  


Materials and Methods:
We first obtained two male betta fish, one small and one large, that were both red. We placed the small male in the left-most section of an aquarium divide into three compartments, separated by both clear and white plastic dividers. We placed a large white male in the right most compartment and a female in the center compartment. We removed the white plastic dividers (leaving the plastic dividers in place so that the female could interact with the male fish without making physical contact with them). We observed the female betta fish’s behavior for a total of 5 minutes making sure to make note of the amount of time she spent on each side of her enclosure and how much time the female spent engaged with each male fish (also making note of any time the female betta fish was not engaged with either). We recorded all of these values in seconds. We completed this process a total of 4 times (each time changing out both the males and females in order to prevent habituation of the fish and to control for color). We used males of a variety of colors, including red for the first two encounters, blue for the third encounter, and purple for the encounter. Each individual round of encounters, we made sure that both males were as close in color as possible.
	After collecting all of our data for the time the female spend engaging with each male and time spend on either side of the enclosure, we calculated the ratios comparing the time spent engaging with each male compared to the total 5 minutes or 300 seconds (so for each encounter we had 2 ratios). We also calculated ratios comparing the total time spent on either side of the enclosure compared to the total amount of time for each individual set of encounters. The ratios were calculated by dividing the time spent of the given side of the enclosure by the total time of the encounter (300 seconds). We conducted an analysis of variance in order to compare the average length of each engaged encounter, in seconds, that each female betta fish (1, 2, 3, and 4) had with the larger or smaller male betta fish during that specific trial.


Results:
    For Female 1, the average time of an encounter with the bigger male was 46.2 seconds (with a standard deviation of 32.7). For Female 2, 8.8 seconds (with a standard deviation of 6.16), for Female 3, 5.8 seconds (with a standard deviation of 1.27) and for female 4, 0 seconds (with no standard deviation. For Female 1, the average time of an encounter with the smaller male was 23.7 seconds (with a standard deviation of 18.1). For Female 2, 3.7 seconds (with a standard deviation of 3.27), for Female 3, 42.6 seconds (with a standard deviation of 42.6), and for Female 4, 2.1 seconds (with a standard deviation of 2.1).
    There was a variety of behaviors displayed by the females. Based on Figure 2, there was also a great deal of time (compared to the total 300 seconds) spent by Females 1, 2, and 3 engaging with neither of the two male betta fish.Although Females 1, 2, 3, and 4 spent time engaged with neither of the males, Females 2, 3, and 4 spent a larger portion of the total time engaging with the smaller male than the larger male.
   Conducting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing the average length of each engaged encounter, in seconds, that each female betta fish (1, 2, 3, and 4) had with the larger or smaller male betta fish during that specific trial resulted in a p-value of 0.301, and F-value of 1.409 and an F-critical value of 7.709. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that female betta fish would show a stronger preference for large male beta fish over small male betta fish. Based on the results of the ANOVA, our hypothesis was could not definitively be supported by the results of this experiment. 
Since the F-value is smaller than the F-critical value, this supports the fact that the results are not significant. This is further supported by the fact that the p-value is much greater than the alpha (0.05). 
The insignificance of the results can be attributed to the large variety of behaviors displayed by each female. Based on Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4, there was not a trend clear pattern in over the 4 trials. Betta splendens are affected in intersexual selection in that the males tend to be larger than the females. This is because the male betta compete for females through combat, and larger males just tend to be the stronger than the smaller ones. Since the larger males usually win the fights, they are exposed to more females and are more inclined produce offspring with these females, so the traits that perpetuate larger males are passed on and this phenotype increases in frequency and ultimately increase evolutionary fitness [Brownell: 2014]. So the females ensure that the male is worth an energy investment to reproduce by selecting the winner of fights to mate with, and these “winners” happen to mostly be the larger males [Brownell: 2014]. Female betta fish also have been known to choose their mates based on olfactory cues, using their since of smell to detect genetic compatibility [Brownell:2014].  Based on the fact that female beta splendens choose the winning male to mate with and that the winner is usually larger, it makes sense that it may seem like female betta prefer larger males. They may prefer larger males, but it is as a result of the fact that these males are evolutionarily more fit due to their ability to defend their territory and produce more viable offspring. It is not merely based on their appearance of being bigger that the females choose them as mate. In our experiment, all three of the fish were separated by clear plastic dividers. This prevented the males from engaging in physical combat over the female, thus removing the possibility for the weaker male to be eliminated. The plastic dividers may have also interfered with olfactory cues. For these reasons, is can be inferred that this experimental design was not affective in helping to determine if female betta splendens prefer larger male mates or smaller male mates. It can be inferred that it is less about size for the female beta, and more about the male’s ability to help preserve the species as a whole. This ability just happens to come with the larger males more so than the smaller ones.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This shows the average length of each engaged encounter, in seconds, that each female betta fish (1, 2, 3, and 4) had with the larger or smaller male betta fish during that specific trial. The graph also shows the standard deviations for each average. Based on Figure 1, Female 1 was the only female betta fish to spend more time (on average) engaging with the larger male than the smaller one.
Figure 2. Shows the ratios of time (compared to the total 5 minutes) that each female betta fish spent engaging with each male (bigger and smaller) or neither of the two males.
