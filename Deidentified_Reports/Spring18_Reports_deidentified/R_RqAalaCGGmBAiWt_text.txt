Title: Increased Agonistic Intraspecific Behavior Among Betta splendins of the Same Color

Abstract:
Intraspecific agnostic behavior is common among many organisms such as the fish species Betta splendins which compete with one another for mates. I hypothesized that the fish would show more agnostic behavior towards fish of the same color. In order to test this we documented the number of times a specific agnostic behavior was performed over a five minutes. We recorded data from a blue male facing a red male, a blue male facing a blue male and a red male facing a red male. The data from the mane display behavior supported the hypotheses.

Introduction:
Intraspecific agnostic behavior is common among many species. Organisms may be competing for food, territory or mates. The frog species Oophaga pumilio is one intraspecific agnostic behavior in the interest of maintaining territory. Their level of aggression is also dependent on their skin color [Galeano: 2016]. Another species that displays intraspecific agnostic behavior is the fish Betta splendins which compete with one another for mates. The fish’s chances of fighting are altered by a variety of factors such as size. Larger male fish will fight more frequently than male fish [Jaroensutasinee: 2001]. We wanted to see if Betta splendins’, like Oophaga pumilio, level of aggression would change depending on their opponents color. We examined the behavioral changes of Betta splendins when confronted with other fish of different colors by documenting the number of times an agnostic behavior was displayed during a confrontation. Since competition is hardest between organisms that occupy the same ecological niche, I hypothesized that the fish would show more agnostic behavior towards fish of the same color. 


Materials and Method:
We placed a red fish in the center tank and placed one blue fish on each side. We removed the opaque barrier between the red fish and the blue fish and documented the number of times a specific agnostic behavior was performed for five minutes. These behaviors were tail movement, pelvic fin extension, gill spreading and mane display. We then placed the opaque barrier back and alloted the fish a five minute rest period. We then removed the barrier between the red fish and the second blue fish and documented the number of times the same behaviors were displayed for five minutes. This entire process was repeated with a set of all red fish and a set of all blue fish.


Results:
When the fish were confronted by fish of different colors the mane display was not frequent; it was displayed an average of 4.5 times. However, when facing fish of the same color they displayed their manes more frequently; it was displayed an average of 16.5 times (figure 1). The unpaired t test revealed a p value of 0.0039 which shows that these are statistically significent results. This appeared to be the case with the total sum of the behaviors as well. The fish displayed agnostic behavior to fish of the same color an average of 40.5 times and to fish of a different color an average of 80.25 times (figure 2). However, the unpaired t test revealed a p value of 0.0556 which means the averages are not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
The data from the mane behavior supports the hypotheses; the fish displayed more agnostic behavior towards fish of the same color. However, the total sum of all behaviors, although appearing to support the hypotheses, was not statistically significent. This may be due to the way fish display agnostic behavior. When a different behavior is exhibited the fish will cease performing the less aggressive displays; it would appear to display the same level of behavior when in reality it is displaying more aggression. Although there is no reason to suspect any errors occurred in our experiment it would be beneficial to examine the interaction of a red male Betta splendins when facing a blue male. Some organisms show increased aggression depending on their own color and not just their opponents so it would be good to make certain our results are not skewed by any increased aggression among red males [Galeano: 2016].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average number of times any recorded behavior was displayed in a confrontation between fish of different colors and a confrontation of fish of the same color. The average number of times a blue male Betta splendins displayed agnostic behavior when facing a red male was 40.50 times with a standard deviation of 23.33. The average number of times a male Betta splendins displayed agnostic behavior when facing a male of the same color was 80.25 times with a standard deviation of 14.50.

Figure 2. Average number of times mane behavior was displayed in a confrontation between fish of different colors and a confrontation of fish of the same color. The average number of times a blue male Betta splendins displayed it's mane when facing a red male was 4.5 times with a standard deviation of 2.12. The average number of times a male Betta splendins displayed it's mane when facing a male of the same color was 16.5 times with a standard deviation of 2.38.
