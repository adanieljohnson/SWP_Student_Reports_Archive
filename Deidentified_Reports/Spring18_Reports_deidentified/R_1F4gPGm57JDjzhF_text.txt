Title: Effects of Carbon Dioxide on Photosynthesis in a 30 Minute Span

Abstract:
Plants gain energy through the process of photosynthesis which primarily requires carbon dioxide, light, and water. This process is affected by many factors, including light intensity, temperature, and the concentration of gases present, specifically carbon dioxide. This experiment considers how increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide effects the photosynthetic activity in [Brassica oleracea var. sabellica], or kale leaves. The leaves are ground into a solution and chloroplasts are isolated via a centrifuge. Several test-tube samples were created using DCPIP and a pH buffer, seltzer water, and the chloroplasts were added.  The absorbance of each sample was measured and one tailed, unpaired 2 sample t test was performed on these results of the study on both a low and high concentration of carbon dioxide. The statistic tests revealed a p value of p=0.002512 for the high CO2 content and p = 0.06628 for the samples with low CO2 concentration. Increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide appeared to be correlated with an increase the rates of photosynthesis at high concentrations of CO2and not statistically significent at low concentration of CO2.

Introduction:
Plants gain energy and the nutrients through the process of photosynthesis. This process requires carbon dioxide, light, chlorophyll, and Manganese (II) ions (Mn2+) to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, water and oxygen [Johnson: 2017]. Plant photosynthesis is affected by many different factors including pathogens such as herbicides, temperature, light intensity, and carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide is converted into glucose energy and oxygen is released into the atmosphere according to equation 1. Previous studies have studied this phenomenon due to the growing levels of many atmospheric gases such as carbon dioxide. These studies have found that “higher concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide…boost crop yields by increasing the rates of photosynthesis, which spurs growth…” [Hille: 2016].

	6CO2 + 6H2O --&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2 + energy				                                                                 	(Eqn. 1)

	The goal of this lab is to analyze how dissolved carbon dioxide gas effects the rates of photosynthesis in light reactions in [Brassica oleracea var. sabellica] leaves, commonly known as kale, over a period of time. Specifically, we studied how increasing concentrations of CO2 effects these rates in light reactions. The rates of photosynthetic activity were determined through examining the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts using spectrophotometry. Spectrophotometry is the process of using the amount of absorbance a solution to analyze its concentration. It uses light to probe molecules in a quantitative way to evaluate how they interact with light [Colyer: 2017]. During the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis light excites electrons that react with NADP+, a carrier molecule that carries electrons between the photosynthesis. We will be using DCPIP to replicate this NADP+ and monitor its absorbance over time. As photosynthesis occurs the DCPIP is expected to get lighter than the royal blue it starts as. Kale leaves are readily available and abundant in chloroplasts making it a useful reagent for to use for the experiment. Since carbon dioxide is a reactant in photosynthesis, we predicted that increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide will increase amount of photosynthetic activity in the chloroplast; therefore, increasing the increasing the rate of photosynthesis in the leaves. 


Materials and Method:
To obtain a sample of chloroplasts the leaves from 1 bushel of Kale were ground to a slurry with a grinding buffer using a mortar and pestle. The sample was strained and spun in a centrifuge twice 1200 rotations per min (rpm) for 3 minutes and then spun again at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. After spinning, the resuspended pellet was separated from the solid residue and placed in ice. This resuspended pellet contained enriched chloroplasts from the kale leaves because it is the most dense component. While cooling, two different concentrations, one high and low, of carbon dioxide solutions were created using Seltzer water.  For the higher concentration 20 Ml of Seltzer water was combined with 20 Ml of 2X reaction buffer. The lower concentration was approximately half that of the first solution created and 10 Ml of seltzer water was combined with 10 Ml of water and 20 Ml of 2X reaction buffer. Once these dilutions were completed six solutions were prepared containing different quantities of 100 mM of 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), water, reaction buffer and one of the CO2 dilutions. Three positive controll solutions were also created using just the DCPIP water and reaction buffer (did not contain any Seltzer water). 100 µL of the enriched chloroplasts were then added to each of the 9 solutions and a blank was made of water and the reaction buffer. These solutions were then mixed and transferred to cuvettes and an assay was ran on the solutions. Using the Genesys Spectronic 20, or Spec 20, the absorbances of each cuvette was read at a wavelength of 600 nm in 10-minute intervals. In between intervals the cuvettes were placed under a lamp to ensure that light sensitive photosynthetic reactions occurred. After completing the experiment an unpaired 2 sample t_test with one tail was used on the average percent change (over 30 min) in absorbance for the kale leaves without any CO2, our controll factor, and the kale leaves in the high concentration of CO2. 

Results:
As shown in figure 1, the change in absorbance increase for all three parameters measured as time increases. However, the change in absorbance also decreases as the concentration of CO2 increases. The changes in the absorbances the low concentration of CO2 and the high concentration of CO2 were both less than the change in absorbances for the controll. Furthermore, the changes in absorbances for the high concentration of CO2 were less than the changes in absorbances for the low CO2 concentration solutions. The average percent change in absorbance after 30 minutes for the controll group, low concentration group, and high concentration group was 31.93 ± 3.194%, 25.93 ± 4.409%, and 15.91 ± 2.355% respectively. The standard deviation for the controll was 3.194 and the standard deviations for the low and high concentrations was 4.409 and 2.355 respectively. A one tailed, unpaired two-sample t_test with of this data revealed a t-value 7.034 with 4 degrees of freedom for the high carbon dioxide concentration. This corresponded with a p value of p = 0.002152 for the high CO2 concentrations. The t-value for a one tailed unpaired 2 sample t_test of the results for the low conentration of CO2 solutions was 2.506 with 4 degrees and had p_value of 0.06628

Discussion:
This experiment revealed favorable results and it appeared that the change in absorbance decreased as the amount of carbon dioxide increased. Since the p_value (p = 0.002) obtained from the high concentration solutions was less than an alpha level of 0.05, the results was statistically significent, and we reject our null hypothesis. In addition, as photosynthetic activity increases the light should also increase, thus decreasing the amount of absorbance. Therefore, since the absorbance of the samples decreases as carbon dioxide increases, we can assume that the photosynthetic activity is increasing. These results are supported in other studies whose “data suggest that plants maintain a high photosynthetic capacity as the atmospheric CO2 level continues to rise” [Arp: 1991]. A more recent study also showed that the results were mixed and depends on species identity and the availability of other factors influencing the ecosystems [Newark: 2004]. The results for the low concentration of CO2 was less convincing and the p_value (p = 0.06) was greater than the alpha level. Since the p value was slightly high we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There was no significent increase in photosynthetic activity when the level of carbon dioxide was increased by a small amount. This could have resulted from other factors in the experiment (such as their location under the lamp) and reflect the mixed results explained in the Newark study.While our high concentration of CO2 results were statistically significent there are other factors that could there was some variation in our data and the standard deviations was different between each group. Though the results for this experiment were favorable for the high concentration of CO2, we only had 9 solutions and used chloroplasts from only 1 bushel of Kale. This small sample size is not representative of a larger population of Kale and other greens plants. It would be useful to study a larger number of samples in the future. In addition, the experiment was completed in open test tubes and not in a closed chamber so normal atmospheric carbon dioxide could have interacted with the solutions. In the future it would be useful to carry out the experiment in a closed chamber to ensure that carbon dioxide in the air does not interact with the experimental solutions. It would also ensure that no carbon dioxide is lost or bubbles out of the solution.
