Title: Case Study: Effects of Aza Max on the Growth of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone (JH) is important in regulating an insect’s physiological development by promoting growth of the larva and inhibiting metamorphosis. Our experiment is proposed to test the effects of Aza Max, JH mimic. on the Manduca sexta Caterpillars. Eight caterpillars were divided into a control group and a treatment group. We collected data of each caterpillar’s weight and recorded observations for a week. Two sample t-test is applied to analyze data. The results lead to conclusion that under Aza Max treatment, the caterpillars are slower in growth and tend to remain in their larva state for a longer time than those under normal condition.

Introduction:
Biological research over the last two decades has resulted in the discovery of chemically novel pesticides that mimic the function of the two insect growth and developmental hormones, the steroidal 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the juvenile hormone (JH). Juvenile hormones regulate an insect’s physiological development by promoting growth of the larva and inhibiting metamorphosis. JH’s inhibiting effect on insects’ metamorphosis makes it an effective pesticide. According to the study conducted by Thomas G. Wilson, “JH is a necessary molecule at certain times in insect development but becomes toxic when present during metamorphosis” (Wilson, 1). The conclusion is led by Wilson’s studies of effects on insects by juvenile hormone analog (JHA) insecticides, which mimic the function of JH. Application of JHA to white puparia which have just entered metamorphosis results in metamorphic disruption. The disruption is discovered through morphogenetic effects as Wilson claims. “Abdominal bristle disruption and malrotated male genitalia, as well as toxic effects that can result in death during the pharate adult stage” (Wilson 1). Our experiment is proposed to test the effects of Aza Max, a type of JH substituent, on Manduca Caterpillars. We selected 8, 8-10 day old Manduca sexta larvae and divided them in to 2 groups. The larvae in the control group are fed by diets with water, and the rest in the treatment group receives same portion of Aza Max solution. We recorded weights of the caterpillars and observations for a week and developed statistical results based on the data. Before the experiment, a null hypothesis is claimed to be tested, that there will be no statistically significant difference in the time it takes the caterpillar to pupate. An alternate hypothesis is stated that there will be statistically significant difference between the control and experiment group in the time it takes to pupate.

Materials and Methods:
We selected 8, 8-10 day old Manduca sexta larvae and divided them in to 2 groups. Their weights were measured. Each two caterpillars were placed in one container, separated by an index card. Each caterpillar in the control group were fed by 10g of normal Manduca caterpillar diet containing 7 drops of water. Each caterpillar in the treatment group were fed by 10g of normal Manduca caterpillar diet containing 7 drops of Aza Max solution. Both groups were kept in incubator at 25 Celsius degrees, 12-hour dark cycle. We measure the weights of all caterpillars every day for a week, and recorded observations. After 7 days, we recorded the final weight of each caterpillar and organized our collected data. 

Two-sample test is utilized to compare the means from two groups of our data. The mean of the control group and the mean of the treatment or the experimental group are compared. Two types of variables are present in the two independent groups. The categorical variable is application of treatment, with values of “treated” or “untreated”. The measurement variable is the weight of each caterpillar. 


Results:
Graphs and tables are uploaded as pictures. In the control group, we observed that two caterpillars showed changing in color. One caterpillar turned brown from bottom to top, but was the lightest in the group. The other grew whitish on head and was big in size. The rest in the control group grew slightly yellowish and gained weights. In the treatment group, we observed that one caterpillar was significantly heavier than the rest in the group, while the rest in the group was small in weight compared to those in the control group. Only one caterpillar in the treatment group showed slight change in color. Figure 1 and 2 suggest that the average weight of caterpillars in control group is larger than that of treatment group. Table 1 suggest that caterpillars of control group were more advanced in growth than those of treatment group. Caterpillars of treatment group showed slow growth and remained small in size, except for one large and greenish caterpillar in the group.  

According to t-test results (table 2), the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=0.49, df=14, P=0.32).


Discussion:
The analysis of data supports a trend that caterpillars in the treatment group, which were fed diets with Aza Max, grew slower than those in the control group. In the treatment group, 3 of the 4 caterpillars gained less weights than all caterpillars in the control group (see table 1). In addition, no caterpillar in the treatment group showed sign of color changing. Our hypothesis is not supported by our data results. No pupation was observed throughout the experiment. According to our null hypothesis, there is no significant difference between the control and experiment group in the time it takes to pupate. However, the lack of observation on pupation leads no supporting data to test the hypothesis. If we continued our experiment for a longer time, we would possibly collect important data on caterpillars’ pupation time, which help to test our hypothesis. Though our hypothesis fails to be tested, the results render us insights into the effects of Aza Max on caterpillars’ growth and development. According to another study published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, the researchers conclude that “insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect certain physiological regulatory processes essential to the normal development of insects or their progeny” (Tunaz 1). In the article, the IGRs are referred to substances that disrupt processes regulated by insect hormones such as the juvenile hormone (JH). The Aza Max solution applied in our experiment coincides with the role of IGRs, and we know that it can mimic the structure of JH to disrupt a caterpillar’s normal physiological growth. A conclusion is drawn from our results, that under Aza Max treatment, the caterpillars are slower in growth and tend to remain in their larva state for a longer time than those under normal condition.
