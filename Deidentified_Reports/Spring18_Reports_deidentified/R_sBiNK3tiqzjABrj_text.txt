Title: The Effects of Varying Light Strength on the Oxidation of water in spinach leaves

Abstract:
One of the main products of photosynthesis is diatomic oxygen (O2). Diatomic oxygen is made in photosystem II when water is oxidized to form O2. In our experiment the goal was to determine the effects of varying light levels of 600, 1300, and 1630 lumens on the oxidation of water in the chloroplasts of spinach leaves. We measured the oxidation of spinach leaves via spectrophotometry using DCPIP, an optically active chemical that is electrophilic. We calculated the percent difference of absorbances from our samples in 600, 1300, and 1630 lumens to be 58.37, 90.22, 88.79 respectively. We found no significent difference between the light levels and our null hypothesis could not be rejected. Further study on fluctuating levels would be compelling due to plants daily challenge of accommodating varying levels of light.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which most plants and some microorganisms derive their energy from the sun. Photosynthesis involves the excitation of electrons to generate a proton gradient which allows for the formation of ATP. Photosynthesis is composed of two protein complexes, photosystem I and photosystem II. In our experiment, we focused on the mechanism of photosystem II. During photosystem II, a photon of light excites an electron which is then transported down an electron transport chain allowing for a proton gradient to be created and used in photosystem I. The electrons are generated by the oxidation of a molecule of water. The mechanism by which water is oxidized in photosystem II has been debated, but there are two arguments that are currently at the forefront: one that involves oxo-oxyl radical coupling and another based on nucleophilic attack; these mechanisms have been based on x-ray crystallography and theoretical calculations (Shen: 2015). This splitting of a water molecule is ultimately driven by the light sensitive pigment P680 (Shinkarev et al: 1997). The general redox reaction of the splitting of water is shown in Figure 1.
Researchers in 2016 found that by inhibiting two cyclic electron flows (CEF) around photosystem I in rice (Oryza sativa L.), photosynthetic rates were reduced after sudden irradiation of light. These fluctuations of light resulted in a loss of biomass; Their research lends support to the protein complexes that facilitate electron flow are crucial in the maintenance of photosynthesis (Yamori et al: 2016).
In our experiment we decided to determine the effects of varying light levels on photosystem II, since varying light levels had an affect on photosystem I. We also wanted to determine if there was a saturation point of photosynthetic rates and which light level had the greatest effect. We decided that we would use spinach leaves as our model organism. Other reasons for why we chose Spinach as a model organism was because they are inexpensive, easy to access, and the chloroplasts from spinach leaves are easily extracted. The varying light levels will be assessed using lightbulbs with varying levels of light measured in lumens. In the presence of more light, the oxidation of photosystem II might increase; meaning that the amount of light and the oxidation reactions of photosystem II could be directly related. 

Materials and Method:
Beginning the experiment, we obtained spinach leaves from our graduate teaching assistant and grinded the leaves in a mortar & pestle with cold grinding buffer until the leaves were a slurry like mixture. We added more grinding buffer and strained the solution to remove any debris from the leaves through cheese cloth. The sample was then poured into a 50Ml centrifuge tube and spun at 200 × G for 3 minutes at 4° C. After this centrifuge, the supernatant of the sample was poured into another centrifuge tube and spun at 1000 × G for 10 minutes at 4° C. The first centrifuge run was at a lower force, because it was used to separate the chloroplasts from debris. The debris would have a higher density than the chloroplasts and would be situated at the bottom. The second centrifuge was run at a higher force, because it would allow for the greatest concentration of chloroplasts to be separated at the bottom. The supertant of the second centrifuge was poured into another tube and discarded. The solid at the bottom of the second tube was mixed with 20 Ml of grinding buffer and resuspended by stirring. This is the sample that we used for the assay.
In our experiment we decided to employ the Hill assay. The Hill assay uses the redox reaction of water splitting. Instead of donating the electrons to a protein complex, in the Hill assay, the chemical DCPIP is used as an electron acceptor and is blue when oxidized. Therefore, as light is absorbed by the chloroplasts and oxidizes water, the DCPIP accepts the electrons from the split water molecule and changes from blue to colorless. This allowed us to measure the absorbance of each prepared sample. The sample absorbance was measured at 600 nm with a Spectronic 20 Genesys, because the wavelength allowed the maximum absorbance for blue light. (AD Johnson: 2017).
We tested three levels of light: 600, 1300, and 1630 lumens; we put a set of samples in a dark drawer as the controll. Three different lamps with the assigned level of light were put into a different drawer and the lamps were turned on. We made three replicates for each light level including the samples placed in a dark drawer which was used as the controll; a blank was also produced. The blank contained all of the same compounds as the other replicates, except it did not contain DCPIP. The blank contained 8 Ml of distilled water, 100 μL of chloroplasts and 2 Ml of 6.5 pH reaction buffer. The first set of three replicates contained no chloroplasts, 6 Ml of water, and 2 Ml of 6.5 pH reaction buffer; these samples were placed in the dark drawer. The next three sets of three test tubes contained 100 μL of chloroplasts, 6 Ml of water, and 2 Ml of 6.5 pH reaction buffer; the three sets were prepared in individual test tubes. As soon as 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP was added to each of the test tubes, except the blank, a timer was set for 10 minutes, the samples were poured into cuvettes and their absorbances were measured and recorded. The reaction was timed two more times for 10 minutes each, with the absorbances of the samples being measured and recorded between each ten-minute interval. We calculated the percent change of each absorbed light for each replicate set and used a statistical two tailed t_test determine significance.


Results:
In our experiment, the light level was regarded as the independent variable and the measured absorbance which we used as an indicator of the reduction of DCPIP, was regarded as the dependent variable. From our lab we determined the percent change of absorbance for 600, 1300, and 1630 lumens to be 58.37 ± 23%, 90.22 ± 6.44, and 88.79 ± 5.59, respectively. From our results we calculated that there was no statistical significance when comparing the percent absorbance between 600 and 1630 lumens, t(4) = 1.52, p = 0.2033. We also determined that there was no statistical significance between the 600 and 1300 lumens, t(3) = 1.79, p = 0.1714. We were not able to determine a saturation point since we could find no significent difference between the different light levels. 

Discussion:
Photosynthesis is crucial for the homeostatic processes of a plant. According to our hypothesis we were expecting that there would be a significent effect on oxidation by the amount of light, but our null hypothesis could not be rejected. Although there are greater absorbances of light in the 1300 and 1630 lumen light bulbs than the 600 lumen light bulb, there is not enough statistical significance to say that these higher light levels have a greater affect on the oxidation that occurs in photosystem II. Researchers in a 2013 study found that flowers in the species Arabidopsis thaliana, found that flowers that were adjusted to low light conditions had greater concentrations of light absorbing proteins in photosystem II and were not affected by varying levels of light as compared to flowers that were acclimated to high light levels (Kouřil et al). Researchers in a 1997 study also using flowers in the species Arabidopsis found that when exposed to 5°C there was a 55% decrease in photosystem II chemical efficiency in unacclimated plants (Prafullachandra et al). These studies together could lead to possible sources of confounded error, as to why we did not get significent results. If the spinach leaves that we were using were acclimated to low light levels, then fluctuating varying levels of light would not have an impact on their oxidative rates. Since the leaves were kept over night in a refrigerator and according to the study in 1997 this could reduce the photosynthetic rates of the leaves if they were not acclimated to cold temperatures. Another possible source of confounded error, could be that we could not determine the age or how healthy the spinach leaves were which could also have an impact on photosynthetic rates. During our experiment one of our samples spilled which reduced the amount of solution in the cuvette and this would reduce the accuracy of the sample absorbance measured by the spectrophotometer. In future experiments it would be interesting to determine how glucose production is affected by various light levels, since this is the main product of photosynthesis that concerns plants. Studying fluctuations of light levels is important, because plants deal with fluctuating light levels daily and studying this in more depth would provide a better perspective into the life of a plant.
