Title: Juvenile Hormone affects growth in Manduca Sexta caterpillars by controllling the timing of molt

Abstract:
The manduca sexta are insects  common pests that can be found throughout Central America. This species usually molts, or sheds its exoskeleton before proceeding into the next life stage. Juvenile Hormone normally affects the cycle by regulating the type of molt the manduca sexta produces. My hypothesis was if the manduca sexta caterpillars consumed food contimanited with Juvenile Hormone, growth would be greatly affected. Eight manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into two separate groups, one with Juvenile Hormone affected food, the other with the standard food. After a week of collecting data on the weight between the controll group and the experimental group, the caterpillars given a diet contaminated with Juvenile Hormone had decreasing range of weight. The controll group had a significently greater weight than the experimental group. Conclusively, Juvenile Hormone inhibited the appropriate growth rate for the manduca sexta by not allowing pupation to take place. 

Introduction:
 The manduca sexta, commonly known as the “tobacco hornworm”, are a type of insect which has a holometabolous life cycle. A holometabolous life cycle includes four stages:egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Ecdysterone, or 20E (20-hydroxyecdysone), is a hormone secreted by the Prothoracic Gland is a regulator for the timing of the molting within an insect [Johnson: 2018]. JH or Juvenile Hormone is secreted from the corpus allata, JH “regulates the type of molt” [Johnson 2018]. Both JH and Ecdysterone work together for the development of an insect, if the concentrations are altered, it will determine the developmental stage of the insect [Johnson:2018].  Precor is classified as an insect growth regulator (IGR) a JH analogueand JH, it prevents the maturation of an insect.  In the study by S.R. Loschiavo Effects of the Synthetic Insect Growth Regulators Methoprene and Hydroprene on Survival, Development or Reproduction of Six Species of Stored-products Insects [Loschiavo: 1976], it showed that “Methoprene, another form of Juvenile Hormone, at a certain concentration prevented an emergence of adults in specific species [Loschiavo: 1976]Methoprene (another name for Juvenile Hormone) at one ppm or higher prevented emergence of adults of Oryzaephilus mercator (Fauvel), and O. surinamensis (L.) in treated rolled oats or cornmeal.” [Loschiavo 1976]. This study therefore shows that Precor (another type of JH) prevents the growth of insects.  In this experiment, I will be using the manduca sexta to replicate a similar experiment. The independent variable for the experiment is the food while the dependent variable is the caterpillar growth. The null hypothesis is by giving the caterpillar JH hormone, caterpillar growth will show no change, while the alternative hypothesis is that the caterpillar growth will change/ be affected. My hypothesis is if the manduca sexta consumes JH the growth will change.



Materials and Method:
There were 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars. I selected 4 of the caterpillars in the group will be the in the controll group. Each of the caterpillars in the controll group had 10 grams of food treated with 10 drops of diH20. 2 caterpillars each of the controll group were in a container separated by index card.  The other four caterpillars were in the experimental group. Each of the caterpillars in the experimental group also received 10 grams of food each but instead the food was treated with ten drops of Precor (concentration 1: 1250). There were 2 of the experimental group each in a container separated by an index card.  My group measured initial weights of each caterpillar before placing in containers, and then put the caterpillars in fridge and came back to for the next seven days to get the weights of the caterpillar.  Each day I placed ten drops of diH20 in the controll’s group food and 10 drops of Precor in the experimental group’s food each day.


Results:
The results of the growth rate between the controll group and experimental group is displayed in Figure 2. The average for the controll group is 4.6675 grams with N =8 with a standard deviation of 4.11.  The average for the experimental group is 2.04 grams, N=8, with a standard deviation of 1.23. Finally, in conclusion, the degrees of freedom is 14, the t-value is at 1.73, and the P-value is .104784.


Discussion:
The p_value is .104784 thereby showing that the information is not statistically significent. That being said, I fail to reject the null hypothesis and I can not accept the alternative hypothesis.  The explanation for why the controll group is bigger than the experiment is due to the fact it was not given Precor, so maturation was not inhibited. The experimental  group is so small due to the chemical ratio imbalance of the JH (precor) and ecdysterone.   Another reason that they are smaller is due to the critical period/ switch hypothesis, which states depending when an insect receives JH it will become another form of itself (Larva final-1 -> Larva final). In biology, a critical period is a maturational stage in the lifespan of an the manduca sexta in which the nervous system is sensitive to stimuli. Another study conducted that is analogous to my study is by S.R. Loschiavo testing the effects of synthetic IGR methoprene and hydroprene for survival [ Loschiavo: 1976]. JH or methoprene and hydroprene were used in the diet of the six species of stored product insects ( 1, 5, 10, 20 ppm). At 20 ppm, there was a prevention of emergence of pupae [Loschiavo: 1976].  Methoprene at 1ppm prevented the emergence of adults which is similar to my study as the JH affected caterpillar did not pupate or fully grow into an adult.  Overall the hypothesis stands true if the Manduca sexta is given Precor it will affect the growth but it will remain in the same stage. This all relates back to JH that regulates the type of molt and determines what the Manduca Sexta will become [Johnson: 2018].
