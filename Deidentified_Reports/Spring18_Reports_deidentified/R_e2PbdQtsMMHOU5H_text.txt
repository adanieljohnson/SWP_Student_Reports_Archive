Title: The Effects of Herbicide and Light on the Photosynthetic Rate of Stellaria media

Abstract:
Experiment 1 (herbicide): This experiment aimed to analyze the effects of the herbicide, Paraquat, on the photosynthetic rate of Stellaria media, commonly known as chickweed. Due to inhibitory effects Paraquat has in plants, it was hypothesized that Paraquat would decrease the rate of photosynthesis in chickweed. This was tested by grinding the chickweed and a grinding buffer to obtain chloroplast samples. One sample was exposed to Paraquat while the other was not. The absorbances of each sample was measured by a spectrophotometer over ten minute intervals for 30 minutes. After running a two-sample t-test, a p-value of .388 was obtained, showing that Paraquat did not significantly decrease the rate of photosynthesis in chickweed. 

Introduction:
Experiment 1 (herbicide): 

In photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to drive ATP production. When electrons within the photosystems of chloroplasts are excited, a concentration gradient is created and they are stored as high energy electrons in NADPH. In this way, plants are able to create glucose, which can be broken down and used for energy in the form of ATP. The rate of photosynthesis in plants can be effect by herbicides, such as Paraquat, a common herbicide used on weeds. Paraquat reacts with photosynthetic enzymes, forming radical molecules that break down the membrane of the cell. What would the effect of paraquat be on a common weed in North Carolina such as chickweed? We decided on studying chickweed because it is one of the invasive species of plants that are found in North Carolina. This study will determine if paraquat is an adequate herbicide for the citizens of the surrounding North Carolina regions. We believe that if Chickweed is treated with Paraquat, then its rate of photosynthesis will be significantly lower than the rate of photosynthesis of chickweed without paraquat. In a study by Qian, Chen, and Sun in Ecotoxicology, Chlorella vulgaris was exposed to varying concentration levels of paraquat (0.3 μM to 1 μM) for a total of 24 hours. A significant decrease in the total cell number in the algae was observed within the first 6 hours compared to the control group with no paraquat added. They also found a significant decrease in chlorophyll content when Chlorella vulgaris was exposed to 0.5 μM and greater [Qian et al: 2009]. Using evidence from this study, we believed that there would be a significant decrease in the photosynthetic activity of chickweed upon the introduction of Paraquat to the chloroplasts. This is why our experiment is relevant because we can determine if Paraquat is an effective herbicide for the citizens in North Carolina who are looking to kill off the invasive chickweed on their property. 

Experiment 2 (light):

In photosynthesis, plants use energy from sunlight to drive ATP production. When electrons within the photosystems of chloroplasts are excited, a concentration gradient is created and they are stored as high energy electrons in NADPH. In this way, plants are able to create glucose, which can be broken down and used for energy in the form of ATP. In another experiment using lettuce leaves, it was discovered that exposing these leaves to different color light resulted in an increase or decrease in photosynthesis. Sowbiya Muneer and his team discovered that the rate of photosynthesis was greatest when exposed to blue light, then red light, then lastly green light [Muneer 2014]. This begs the question, what would be the effect of different wavelengths of light on the photosynthetic activity of chickweed the same as it did for lettuce weeds? Plants respond differently to various light wavelengths due to the chlorophyll. Chlorophyll absorbs both red and blue light, but reflects green which is where plants get their pigmentation. It is believed that both blue and red light promote growth in different ways. Blue light is suspected to encourage leaf growth while red supposedly encourages flowering (Sæbø et al. 1995). Based on this information, we think there would be a change in the photosynthetic rate of chickweed when it is exposed to blue light (wavelength 490 nm), but a lesser change in red light (680 nm), and finally green (540 nm) light. 


Materials and Methods:
Experiments 1 (herbicide) and 2 (light): 

In this lab, a mortar & pestle, 250 mL beaker, and 5, 50 mL centrifuge tubes were packed in ice. Next, the stems were removed from a patch of chickweed. Once the leaves of the chickweed dried, they were added to to the mortar and pestle, along with 10 mL of cold grinding buffer. When the chickweed was grounded into to a thick paste, an additional 10 mL of cold grinding buffer was added.The entire sample was then strained through a cheesecloth into the 250 mL chilled beaker. 
50 mL of the remaining green liquid were transferred into a centrifuge tube marked “A,” which was spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant of “A” was then transferred into a second centrifuge tube marked “B,” avoiding the transfer of the debris at the bottom. Tube “B” was centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then poured into a 3rd 50 mL tube marked “C.” 
19 large test tubes were labeled and placed into a rack. Table 1 shows the amounts of each reagent placed into each tube. The tubes with chloroplasts were mixed immediately after it was added. The spectrophotometer was blanked using tube 0, and all of the absorbances of each tube were measured at time 0. The test tubes were then put into their specific environment, red, green, blue, or full light, and proceeded to wait 10 minutes.  We then recorded the absorbance for each tube, blanking in between each trial, and placing them back into their respective environments. We measured again at the 20 minute mark, along with the 30 minute mark, and calculated the % Change for each time interval using the equation % change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. We then plotted the the % change vs the time to determine which environment had the greatest % Change, meaning the highest rate of photosynthesis. We then used a one-tailed two sample t-test to determine if the effect of the herbicide was significant or not. An ANOVA test was also used to determine if the different light wavelengths had a significant difference on photosynthesis.


Results:
There is a general upwards trend for all the data sets except for the samples without any chlorophyll. It also appears that the environment that had the greatest rate of photosynthesis, the sample with the steepest slope, was chloroplasts in Red (680) data set, followed closely by chloroplasts in Full light. In contrast, the environment that inhibited photosynthesis the greatest, which had the flattest slope, was the sample with Chloroplasts with Paraquat, followed closely by Chloroplasts in Green Light (540 nm). Once an ANOVA test was run, it was found that there was not a significant difference (p-value = 0.316) in photosynthetic rate in chickweed based on the type of light wavelengths it is exposed to. Further tests also indicated that there was no significant difference between the type of light wavelengths. For the herbicide experiment, a two sample t-test was run in which the treatment sample was determined to not have a statistical decrease in photosynthetic rate compared to the control (t-stat = 0.968, df = 4, P = 0.388).


Discussion:
In this experiment we were trying to determine if Paraquat was an effective herbicide on Stellaria media, an invasive plant to North Carolina. It was hypothesized that chickweed treated with Paraquat would result in a significantly lower rate of photosynthesis than chickweed that was not exposed to Paraquat. The statistical results showed that chloroplasts treated with Paraquat did not significantly inhibit photosynthesis. This was determined by the results from a two-sample t-test, and because it obtained a p-value of .388 shows that it was not statistically different enough than the control at full light. We still stand by our hypothesis because in another study, they determined that with a concentration range of 0.02-0.2 mg/L of Paraquat severely inhibited Scenedesmus quadricauda, while a concentration greater than 2 mg/L of Paraquat completely inhibited growth and photosynthesis of the algae [Wong 2000]. With the results in Wong’s Experiment, provided the citizens of North Carolina with the information that if they want to exterminate chickweed from their property, then Paraquat is an effective herbicide. 

In our second experiment, we tried to determine if different colors of light had an effect on the photosynthetic rate of chickweed. It was hypothesized that the chickweed plants would have a higher photosynthetic rate in blue light, then red light, then lastly green light. Although, our data indicates that there was consistently a higher rate of photosynthesis at red light than there was at blue light, after running an ANOVA test it was found that light wavelength did not significantly affect the photosynthetic rate. We still believe strongly in our hypothesis because in other experiments, similar to the Muneer Experiment, found a higher rate of photosynthesis in blue light, than red light, and followed lastly by green light [Sæbø 1995]. Data from Muneer’s experiment and Sæbø is why we continue to believe in our hypothesis. This data is relevant to the citizens of North Carolina because it shows that chickweed is a resilient plant and can grow in many different light ranges. We believe that there was a couple flaws in our experiment that resulted in getting inaccurate data. When we subjected each chlorophyll solution to their specific light environments, we could not inhibit all the surrounding light from interfering with the solutions. We believe that the tubes were subjected to enough full light to cause this inaccuracy. Also we examining other studies, the researchers exposed the plants to different wavelengths for more extended periods of time than we were able to. This could have altered our findings as we could have not allowed enough amount time to determine if there was a significant difference in photosynthetic rate. For future experiments, we think we can improve the experiment by having more samples to subject to the specific environments. A larger data set will give us a more accurate data. Also, when subjecting the solutions to the specific light colors, we suggest putting them in a dark room with the color lamp, in order to restrict full light from interfering with the solutions.
