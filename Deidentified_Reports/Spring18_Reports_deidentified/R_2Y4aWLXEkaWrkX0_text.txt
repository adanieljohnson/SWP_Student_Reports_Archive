Title: The Effect of Lidocaine on Twitch Threshold in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Lidocaine is a commonly known anesthetic that blocks sodium ion channels in neurons. This experiment tested this by measuring the difference in twitch thresholds of (Rania temporaria) frog legs treated with and without a lidocaine solution. The thresholds were measured by determining the amount of voltage needed to create a contraction of the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. It was concluded that the voltage needed to begin a contraction in the controll group versus the voltage for the experimental group was statistically different. Since the muscles in the experimental group still contracted, it is clear that the lidocaine did not block all sodium channel activity. This can be attributed to the fact that channel blocking with lidocaine is frequency dependent. Since the leg was not being controllled by a nervous system and the membrane potential was synthetically created (through frog ringer solution) it can be assumed that only some of the channels were blocker, or rather, weakly blocked. This provided evidence to conclude that lidocaine does act as a sodium channel blocker and inhibits the firing of action potentials in some way.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is responsible for all voluntary (and some involuntary) movement in vertebrates and invertebrates. The start of muscle movement originates from neurons in the brain that carry down an action potential to the targeted muscle. This muscle is made up of many cells, called myofibers, grouped together. This bundle of fibers makes up a fascicle. Because the nervous system controlls of the muscles a meeting point between motor neurons and myofibers is necessary. This meeting point is called the neuromuscular junction. At the neuromuscular junction, the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine is released from the post-synaptic dendrite and causes the opening calcium ion channels in the muscle cell. This calcium triggers the binding of myosin to actin filaments inside the cell, causing the muscle to contract (Sadava et al., 2017; Johnson, 2018).  There are many factors that can disrupt this pathway, however. While fatigue or even disease can inhibit proper muscle contractions, this experiment will focus on another disrupter: the chemical drug lidocaine. Many medicinal drugs disrupt a neurological or muscular pathway as well. If these mechanisms are better understood through experiments, perhaps more drugs can be created and can help those with a disease or disorder.  Lidocaine is a common anesthetic that is used for medicinal purposes to numb a specific part of the body. Lidocaine is known to block sodium potassium channels, therefore immobilizing the action potentials before the reach the muscle cell (Ward et al., 2016). Since Lidocaine blocks sodium ion channels, it can be assumed that lidocaine stops all muscle contractions; however, there are some studies that state otherwise. One study (Silva et al.,1981) stated that lidocaine and another local anesthetic caused contractions in the human umbilical artery. Furthermore, another study (Altura, 1974) found this same effect in segments of cat and rat veins. While skeletal muscle and the small amount of smooth muscle in veins and arteries differ in some ways, it is possible that lidocaine could have a similar effect on both types.  In this experiment, we will be testing this possibility and the effect lidocaine could have on a skeletal muscle in a leg of a (Rania temporaria) frog. This frog is a good model organism to use for this experiment because it has an easily visible sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle. Furthermore, frog legs after death still maintain some membrane potential, explaining why the leg can still contract even though it is not controllled by the frog’s nervous system (Johnson, 2018). The independent variable in this experiment is the lidocaine given to the frog leg and the dependent variable is the magnitude of the twitch threshold. It is hypothesized that the frog legs will still contract even with the administration of lidocaine, but the lidocaine treatment will cause an increase in the twitch threshold, meaning that it will take more voltage to cause the contraction.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were skinned and dissected so that the sciatic nerve was visible, and the gastrocnemus muscle was unattached from the bone. The legs were consistently moistened with frog ringer solution. One leg at a time was set up to the iWorx-TA machine so that it was hanging from the string attached to the Achilles tendon. The gastrocnemus should be taut, but still relaxed enough so that contractions can be seen. The rest of the leg was pinned down onto the dissecting tray and sleeve electrode wires were wrapped around the gastrocnemus.  Before lidocaine was injected, the leg was tested to see its point of threshold, or the minimum voltage that the leg would respond to. This would act as our controll group.  After the controll values were found, approximately 3 Ml of the lidocaine solution was injected into the gastrocnemus. We waited 10 minutes and then tested and recorded the point of threshold. This process was repeated with the remaining two legs. We averaged all the controlls and the treatments (the three different frogs were used as biological replicates). For analysis, a two-sided t_test was performed to determine if the difference in the controll legs’ contraction was significently different than the experimental legs’ contractions. A bar graph was created to show the results.

Results:
In every leg that our group and other groups tested, the threshold was consistently higher after it was treated with lidocaine (Figure 1). This provides evidence that the lidocaine treatment either blocked some of the sodium channels or just made them less effective. This explains why more voltage was needed to elicit a response.  This difference between the voltage needed to create a response in the controll group and experimental group is considered significent. The p_value for the two-tailed t_test was 0.014. Since the p_value is lower than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis that states that lidocaine treated muscle has a higher threshold of contraction is supported.

Discussion:
The goal of this experiment was to determine how lidocaine affects the twitch threshold in the gastrocnemus muscle of (Rania temporaria). It was concluded that lidocaine disrupts the normal physiology of contraction. These results refute the research done by Silva et al. (1981) and Altura (1974) because the lidocaine did not amplify or benefit the contraction in any way. However, the results partially support previous research done by Ward and others (2016). They state that lidocaine stops the action potentials of nerves, making muscle contraction more difficult to accomplish. Since the frog leg was not attached to a nervous system, the research of Ward et al. (2016) only partially explains why the threshold needed to be stronger to show a contraction. The research by Woolf and Wiesenfeld-Hallin (1985) better explains this. They found that lidocaine, or any sodium channel blocker anesthetic, is frequency dependent. This means that the lidocaine inactivates sodium channels that are more active. They further state that lidocaine doesn’t fully block ESPS’s and transmission, but reduces them. The results of our experiment support Woolf and Wiesenfeld-Hallin’s (1985) research because we found that lidocaine suppresses the efficacy of sodium ion channels, rather than inhibiting them completely. This slight suppression is most likely due to the fact that the frog leg was dead and only “activated” by ringer solution. If lidocaine affects the most active sodium-channels, it is possible that the drug had a lower effectiveness since the sodium-channels were not controllled by a nerve, but rather by an ionic solution.  For future experiments, different sodium channel blockers could be tested. This would provide data to compare to the lidocaine data. Perhaps this would raise further questions about the different mechanisms and effects of varying sodium channel blockers. Furthermore, sodium channel agonists/openers could also be tested to determine the opposite effects of blockers like lidocaine.
