Title: The Effects of AzaGuard on Manduca Sexta  

Abstract:
In this study, the insecticide, Azaguard, was investigated by studying the effects of Azaguard on Manduca sexta, also known as the the tobacco hornworm. The hormone that Azaguard was expected to influence and target was ecdysterone, 20E, which is known to control molting. The experiment was a 7 day study; 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were measured and observed and thier the lengths and weights were recorded daily. It was predicted that AzaGuard, since it is an IGR , would make Manduca sext grow improperly because it blocks 20E thus making the caterpillars unable to molt. It was found that AzaGuard has a serious effect on the growth of the caterpillars. Over our 7 day test, the experimental group tended to lose weight and shrink in length. They often became discolored and became inactive. The data can not conclusively state that AzaGuard prevents molting because 2 of the 4 experimental groups molted during the experiment.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a pest and found throughout the United States. It has a 39-48 day life cycle divided into 4 parts: egg, larvae, pupae, and adult (Johnson, 2016). Within the larva stage, there are 5 instar stages that Manduca sexta must go through before molting into a pupae. In insects, molting is reliant on two hormones: brain hormone (BH) and ecdysterone (20E). BH is produced in the corpus cardiacum; The BH activates prothoracic glands which release ecdysterone, directing the precise timing of molting (Riddliford L.M, Hiruma K, Zhou X. Nelson CA. 2003). A rise in ecdysterone resultings in molting and is key contributor to the commitment pulse. During the 5th instar stage, a low level of juvenile hormone (JH) and an increased level of 20E result in a commitment pulse. The commitment pulse determines when a caterpillar is ready to become a pupae (Johnson, 2016).
The chemical used in the this experiment is AzaGuard. AzaGuard contains 3% Azadirachtin which is a Insect Growth Regulator, IGR, that blocks 20E thus making the caterpillars unable to molt between phases; it is commonly used as an insecticide. After consuming food containing AzaGuard, the Manduca sexta will fail to grow and molt properly. (BioSafe, 2011)


Materials and Methods:
To start the lab, we obtained 4 identical cylindrical plastic containers, labeling two of the as control and two of them as experimental. Next we placed an index card down the middle of each plastic container, splitting each container into 2 sections (4 containers, 8 sections). Then, we selected 8 caterpillars that were all similar in size and placed one caterpillar in all 8 sections. Next, we prepared the food for the caterpillars; we weighed out approximately 10g of food per caterpillar (80g for 8 caterpillars). With 40g of the 80g of the food, we made the control group’s food. For every 10 grams of the control’s food, we added 10 drops of water (40 drops of water for 40g of food). Next, we divided the 40g into fourths and equally distributed the food into 4 sections of the containers, making those sections our control group. With the last 40g of food, we created our experimental group’s food. For every 10 grams of the experimental food, we added 7 drops of AzaGuard (28 drops of AzaGuard for 40g of food). Next, we divided the 40g into fourths and equally distributed the food into 4 sections of the containers, making those sections our experimental group. For the next week, once a day, we kept track and recorded the mass and length of every caterpillar in an excel spreadsheet. We used a standard ruler (30cm or 12in long) to measure the caterpillars. We used an electronic scales to weigh the caterpillars. All equipment used was provided by the laboratory.


Results:
Using graph 1 and 2, a general trend found throughout the data was that the control group gained weight and grew longer till day 5. After day 5, the caterpillars in the control group ran out of food. Also, after day 5, the control caterpillars lost weight and grew at a slower pace. During the first 4 days, the experimental group also tended to gain weight and grew longer, but at a slower rate than the control group. After day 4, they lost or maintained their weight and shrank in length. To test the accuracy of the data collected, A two-tailed T-test was run and found the P values and standard deviations. The P value for the weight data is 0.0121 and for the length, data is 0.0316 thus the experiment had a 95% confidence value. All caterpillars started the experiment green and healthy. By day 3, one control molted and two experimental molted. After day four, the experimental group started looking a bit discolored and became inactive. This trend continued as the week progressed. After day 4, the control group were still green and active but they appeared bloated until day 5.

Discussion:
During the first 5 days the control groups grew steadily because they had a steady supply of food. The control groups appeared bloat around day 5 because they were able to eat at will. Without food, the caterpillars were forced to eat the index cards for food. The index cards were not as nutritious causing them to lose weight and making them grow less. The experimental group gained weight and grew in length the first 4 days because the experimental group did not eat enough food containing Azaguard. The molting done by the two experimental groups came as a surprise. This result is similar to study on how certain pesticides affect Spotted Wing Drosophila (SWD).  Azaguard was ineffective at suppressing SWD life cycle because it did not prevent the SWD from molting(Collins J.A, Drummond F.A. 2015).  The decline in the weight and length of the experimental groups after day four was due to the Azaguard. Azaguard made caterpillars eat less food than control groups because Azaguard is known to repels insects. The experimental group in 7 days only managed to consume 76.98% of their food, while the control ate a 100% their food by day 5. This would explain, the weight loss, shrinking, discoloration, and inactivity experienced by the experimental caterpillars (BioSafe Systems. 2011). Our data and trends found that Azaguard significantly effects Manduca sexta’s weight and length and that our data is statistically relevant. Both P values obtained, 0.0121 and 0.0316, show that we higher than 95% confidence interval. We can conclude that Azaguard reduces the growth of the caterpillars in both length and weight. We cannot confirm that Azaguard prevents molting by blocking the hormone 20E.
