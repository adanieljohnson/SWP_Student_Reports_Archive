Title: Energy Allocation in Radishes: Root-To-Shoot Height Ratios

Abstract:
Sunlight has a large impact on the lives of plants all over the earth. Energy allocation is a key factor in understanding how a specific plant's response might differ in certain environments. In this lab our group looked at energy allocation in radishes, and how it relates to the root-to-shoot ratios in several groups of seedlings. To set up this lab we placed one of our two groups in a sunny area, and the other under a shade cloth. We came back at least every other day to water both groups. The r:s weight/height ratios were measured in three random seedlings from both groups. We used a two-sample, one-tailed t-test. Our stats gave us the p-value for the root-to-shoot length ratio as 0.0913, and the p-value for the root-to-shoot weight ratio as 0.12 which are both insignificant at the 95% significance level. According to our results we were able to determine that the r:s ratios were not significantly larger in our natural group compared to our shaded group, so the hypothesis was not supported. Our data may not have been very conclusive, but if we were able to constantly produce statistically significant results by correcting our flaws then we might be able to learn if plants tend to allocated more resources to their shoot system when in light deprived environments.

Introduction:
Sunlight has a large impact on the lives of plants all over the earth. Energy allocation can be a key factor in understanding how a specific plant's response might differ in certain environments. In this lab our group looked at energy allocation in radishes, and how it relates to the root-to-shoot ratios in several groups of seedlings. One study done on several types of plants (Atwell, Kridemann, Turnbull:1999) compared plants in high-light conditions to plants in low-light conditions. The study found that the plants in low-light environments tended to allocated more resources to light-harvesting pigments. A very basic concept in botany is that the leaves and stems (shoot systems) of many plants are where these specific pigments are most present. Therefore, the plants in the study must have allocated more resources to their shoot system making their root-to-shoot ratio smaller. I hypothesized that, because of what we now know, our plants in the shade treatment will have a lower root-to-shoot height ratio while the sunny treatment will have a higher ratio (because their allocation to their shoot system will be relativistically lower than the shaded plants). The reason this experiment could be useful is because it could tell us more about how radishes (and other plants studied in our class) allocate their energy in ideal and non-ideal climates.

Materials and Methods:
To set up this lab our group was given four small soil buckets in which we buried and planted tens of radish seeds (evenly throughout the soil). The next step we took was to separate the buckets into groups of two (with two buckets each). We then placed one of the two new groups in a sunny area (within a greenhouse), and the other group into a shaded area (under a 75% shade cloth in the greenhouse). We came back at least every other day to water both groups. We then measured the root-to-shoot weight/height ratios in all the groups (must measure at least 3 or more radishes from each group) by severing the plant where these two systems divide. We collected the data and calculated our states using a two-sample, one-tailed t-test.

Results:
After running the t-test our p-value for the root-to-shoot length ratio was found to be 0.0913. In addition to that, we found the p-value for the root-to-shoot weight ratio to be 0.12 which are both insignificant at the 95% significance level. The p-value is slightly smaller in the length ratio compared to the weight ratio. Our mean weight/height ratios for the shaded group were 0.057 and 0.363 respectively, and the mean weight/height ratios for the natural treatment were 0.108 and 0.48 respectively. The standard deviations for the shade group were 0.024 (weight ratio) and 0.0597 (length ratio). The standard deviations for the light group were 0.0597 (weight ratio) and 0.1106 (length ratio). When we initially observed the plants on the day we collected data it appeared to the naked eye that radishes from the shade treatment were less "full" and appeared to be more string-like than their sunlit counterparts. Referring to Figure 3 this observation becomes clearly visible.

Discussion:
According to our results we were able to determine that the root-to-shoot height ratio was not significantly larger than our shaded group, so the hypothesis was not supported. Even though the average of the root-to-shoot ratio was numerically higher for the natural treatment, it was not so to a statistically significant level. However, I believe that if we repeated this study enough times, and we were consistent with gathering our data, it would prove our hypothesis correct eventually. The biological reasoning behind why our experiment did not go as planned could be explained by time. After around two weeks we didn't find any significant difference, but perhaps if we waited even more time and allowed more and more resources to be allocated in the shade treatment we would see more statistical significance between the two groups. Conversely, it is possible that if we gathered the data a week sooner than we did we might see a more rapid, early-onset of this resource allocation in the shaded treatment. It is likely that there was some human error in gathering the data for the lengths. We used a silver sharpie to mark off where the roots ended, and the shoots began, but after washing dirt off the roots most of the sharpie came off with it. At that point it was mostly a guess as to where this divide between the two occurred. I believe that if these confounding variables were better controlled in a repeat of the experiment, we would find statistically significant data. Our data may not have been very helpful in this experiment, but if we one day were to constantly produce statistically significant results then we might be able to learn if plants tend to allocated more resources to their shoot system when in light deprived environments. If that is so then we could find at what rates this might occur.
