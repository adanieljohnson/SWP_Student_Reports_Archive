Title: The Effect of IGR “Precor” on the weight growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on finding out the specific influencing effect of Juvenile containing Insects Growth Regulators on Manduca Sexta. Precor is chosen as the tested IGR in this experiment. The weight of the Manduca is the indication of the larval growth and development used in this experiment. Increase weight of Manduca that are given five drops of Precor is compared with the controlled group which is given five drops of distilled water. The hypothesis is that there is a significant inhibitory effect on Manduca in the treatment group compared to the controlled group. However, it appears to show that the inhibitory effect of Precor on Manduca is not that significant before four days after Precor was given, but the inhibitory effect after day 4 is absolutely significant between control group and treatment group. The specific time needed for the Precor to effect on the Manduca is found in this experiment. At the same time, T-test is utilized to examine the validity of the data. 

Introduction:
Injurious hazard is always concerned as one the most severe damage to a country, especially for the countries that have a high rate of agricultural economy. In the past several decades, scientists all over the world were trying to find out the most effective pesticides that could inhibit the injurious hazard from happening. Pesticides in times aimed at killing the insects in order to prevent crops from damaging. However, as the cultural and scientific development, more and more people realize the importance of the completion of the food chain. More scientists want to find out some pesticides that could keep the insects at the stage that are not considered as injurious thus prevent the hazard while maintaining the food-chain. As a result, IGR was developed, which usually contains JH (Juvenile Hormone). [G. B. Staal, 1975]

From previous studies done by other scientists, the function of JH in the Larva development cycle was defined as keeping the insects stay at the phase they were, prevent them from developing. [Nijhout H. Frederik, 1974] Thus, JH is commonly used in a lot of pesticides for the insects which are only concerned as injurious in the adult stage. However, though known hoe JH works to eliminate injurious, different pesticides influence Larva differently. In this experiment, IGR pesticide “Precor” was chosen from five most commonly used pesticides in daily life. 

After this experiment, the efficiency of Precor could be examined. By comparing different pesticides, the most effective pesticides could be discovered and being practiced more in daily life. The discouragement in development of Larva is expected, but the amount of the inhibition is going to be determined. 

The hypothesis of this experiment is that there is a significant inhibitory effect on Manduca in the treatment group compared to the controlled group.


Materials and Methods:
Materials:

Plastic Container	4	
Standard Caterpillar Food	560g(80g/day maximum)
Separation Paper	4	
Spoon	1
Precor	Plenty	
Electronic Balance	1
Distilled Water	Plenty	
Square Box	2
Burette	2	
Marker	1



Control Group	
10 grams of Standard Caterpillar Food with 5 drops of distilled water.	

Treatment Group
10 grams of Standard Caterpillar Food with 5 drops of Precor


Methods:
-	Used the Separation Paper to separate the four plastic containers into eight rooms
-	Used the Marker to mark each container with one control group and one treatment group, and numbered each container. 
-	Measured 10 grams of Standard Caterpillar Food for each room
-	Used the burette to add 5 drops of distilled water to all the control groups rooms
-	Used another burette to add 5 drops of Precor to all the treatment groups rooms 
-	Used the electronic balance to weigh out the weight of each caterpillar and put one in each room. 
-	Closed the container, and put the containers in the incubator which was set to 12 hours to light and 12 hours of darkness.
-	Took the caterpillars out, weighed them each day and recorded their weights for seven days
-	Made sure that the food inside each room was sufficient so that the caterpillars would not go to the other room of the container for food. 
-	Also, cleaned the rooms for the caterpillar by moving out their excrements 
-	After collecting all the data used the bar graph to represent the growth of caterpillars in different groups
-	Used the T-test to test the significance of the data difference from control group and treatment group
-	Compared the observed result to the Hypothesis to check whether it fitted 


Results:
Table 1 above shows the weight growth of the Manduca in Control group and Treatment group during a week’s experiment. Both of the two groups though provided different liquid components, all had an increase in the weight of the Manduca, and the weight growth exponentially occurs, first slowly and after Day 4, the weight rapidly increased. However, control group seems to have a more significant increase in weight compared to the treatment group.
Table 2 indicates the change in mass of each Manduca using the mass of Manduca on Day 7 minus that of Day 1. From the Mean Value gained from Table 2, it could be generally analyzing that the mass growth in Control group is higher than that in the treatment group. 
In Figure 1, the error bar is drawn using the data of ±1 SD; and from the graph, the error bar overlaps a little bit, which means that there are not huge significance between the control group and the treatment group in mass growth. 
All of the raw data gained from the experiment within seven days were used to take the T-test. After doing the T-test for the data gained, the degree of freedom in this experiment is 12, and the t-value is 0.366, while the P-value is 0.721.


Discussion:
The average weight of the Manduca indicates the growth of the Manduca since it needs enough weight to develop. Though the error bar shown in figure 1 seems overlapping, the conclusion could not be drawn as there was no significant relationship between the growth of Manduca with the use of Precor. Because from the data table 2, it shows that only three samples in each group have a significant difference in mass change with different groups. So, the connection between the decrease in growth of Manduca and usage of Precor was undeniable. Since other conditions in the experiment were controlled, and distilled water is only one of the most common substance that definitely would not cause the increase in body weight, it is reasonable to conclude that it was Juvenile Hormone that discouraged the Manduca in treatment group from developing. 

From previous studies talking about the efficiency of Juvenile Hormone on insects, it only showed the effects of Juvenile Hormone which should keep the Manduca at which state are already at. [Nijhout H. Frederik, 1974] From this experiment, it showed that Juvenile Hormone starts to react and prevent the Manduca development around the fourth day after the hormone was ingested by insects. This partially fits the hypothesis, because in first 4 days the effect of Juvenile hormone is not significant, while in the last 3 days, the effect is significant which fits the hypothesis. 

For further studies, a longer term of the experiment should be taken to view the whole process of the development of Manduca, from Larva to Pupa and even to adults. Since in this experiment, the significance of weight difference in Day 7 actually decrease a little compared to Day 5 and Day 6, and it may cause by the reaching of maximum weight of a Larva and starting to molt. As expected the time for molting should be different in control and treatment groups. 

After knowing the approximate time needed for Precor to have an inhibitory effect on Manduca, the time needed for other injurious could be tested. As a result, the most effective time period we should spread Precor to prevent injurious hazard could be calculated to inhibit the injurious more impactful.
