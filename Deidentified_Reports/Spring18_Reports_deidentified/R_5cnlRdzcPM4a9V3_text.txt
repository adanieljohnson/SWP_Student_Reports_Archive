Title: The Effects of Azadirachtin on Manduca Sexta Larvae Growth and Development

Abstract:
This report examines the effect of Azadirachtin Insect Growth Regulator on Manduca sexta larvae growth.  Four larvae were treated with the IGR while another set of four received no outstanding treatment.  By the end of 7 days, the treated larvae had undergone an average change in weight equivalent to less than half of that of the control group.  The experiment also sheds light on Azadirachtin’s antifeedant properties through a minor procedural breakdown.  

Introduction:
It has been extensively documented that the growth and development of insects, especially through molting processes are primarily controlled by hormones secreted from the brain [1].  The scheme gathered from later scientists was that prothoracicotropic hormone caused the prothoracic glands to secrete ecdysteroids which would lead to molting or metamorphosis depending on the stage in the insect’s development and the presence of the Juvenile hormone.   Renowned Zoologist, Carroll Williams is known as the first to have adopted the concept of controlling pest populations with Insect Growth Regulators, compounds that mimic the pest’s own hormones and lead to eventual reproductive failure in insects [2]. However, the specific IGR we tested on the Manduca Sexta larvae, Azadirachtin, has been found to affect insects in a variety of ways.  They function as antifeedants, insect growth regulators, and sterilants.  Interestingly, further work is still required to fully understand its entire physiological and biochemical course of action [3]. In this experiment, the biological interest was determining if Azadirachtin could function as a significant growth-inhibitor of Manduca Sexta larvae.  Based on previous research, the larvae growth should be significantly inhibited.  The null hypothesis that we tested was that administering the IGR would not significantly affect the weight of the larvae in comparison to the controlled larvae, and the alternative was that the IGR would cause significant abnormalities in the experimental larval growth, and they would, therefore, weigh less.

Materials and Methods:
Experimental Procedure: • Gathered 8 Manduca Sexta 4th instar larvae; 4 to be treated with Azadirachtin, and 4 to function as controls.  • Taped an index card separating a plastic container into two sections (one for control, one for experimental). Index card was folded about 1 cm on each end to aid in taping. Placed 2 larvae in a plastic container with a corresponding perforated lid. • Identified each larva with a name and wrote it in permanent marker on the container: control 1-4, or treatment 1-4 • Used a spoon to get and weigh 80 grams of larvae feed on a balance. • Then placed the food into a large plastic container and divided the food into 8 equal 10-gram portions for each larva using the spoon.  We used the balance again to ensure an equal amount of food for each larva.  • Placed 2 10-gram portions of larvae food in each container, one portion on each side.  • Using a transfer pipet, placed 8 drops on water onto each of the control larvae food. • Using a different transfer pipet, placed 8 drops of Azadirachtin onto each of the experimental larvae food.  • Using two new, different spoons (one for the control larvae and one for the experimental larvae), we mixed up and mashed the food and liquid components for each larva and combined it all into one large clump.  • We then placed the lid on each of the containers, and incubated them for 7 days. Also, although it was advised that the larvae be maintained by providing each with a newly saturated 10-grams of food each day, we decided to wait until the food was low.  Each larva was given a new batch of 10-grams of food on the 6th day, following the routine weighing.
A Two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the mean weights of the larvae from the experimental and control groups, and to see if the results for each experimental group differed significantly.  Also, the values for the change in weight for each larva in each group were combined in Excel to construct a figure that would allow direct comparison of the changes in weight of the two groups.  


Results:
General Trends: The sizes of both the control and treatment groups increased at similar rates during the first six days of the study, however, following the sixth day, there was a large increase in the weights of the control larvae—they all nearly doubled their mass.  There was a sizable increase in the weights of the treatment larvae as well following the sixth day, however, these increases paled in comparison.  By the end of the 7-day period, the average change in control weight was more than double the average change in weight of the treatment group; 19.92 grams vs. 9.44 grams, as shown in Figure 1.  Furthermore, based on the p-value of 0.000114 shown in table 1, the two groups are statistically different from one another.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment supported our hypothesis which was that the addition of the Azadirachtin to the food supply of the treatment larvae would significantly inhibit their growth and cause them to weigh less.  Azadirachtin can have a multitude of effects on insects, and one of which is antifeeding [Luntz, 2000].  Quite possibly, after our administration of food and the IGR on the treatment group, it could have led to this antifeeding effect.  Interestingly, following the sixth day on which the control larvae were also fed, they ate almost twice their weight in one day.  This large disparity in appetite across the groups was certainly not due to chance, as the t-test indicated.  As aforementioned in the methods and results section, there was a bit of a procedural breakdown; both groups were not given food daily.  This may have skewed our data prior to day 6.  This is likely the case since there was such a huge jump in weight for both groups following day 6.  Furthermore, the lack of variance between the two groups during the 6-day period could have simply been due to both sets of larvae not eating very much at all, or quite possibly the amount of Azadirachtin administered to the treatment group was just not enough to have a noticed effect within that time frame.  Our findings are additional evidence supporting the effectiveness of Azadirachtin, as well as the fact that insect growth and development are primarily controlled hormonally.  The next step in this study could be to take a more comparative approach to the effectiveness of using IGRs as insecticides specifically on Manduca Sexta larvae.  Azadirachtin could be compared to other IGRs to see if they affect growth and development uniformly, or if there is variation in effectiveness.
