Title: The effects of excess Juvenile Hormone on the growth of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.

Abstract:
This experiment consisted of increasing the level of Juvenile Hormone within a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar in order to determine if there would be a chance for the organism to pupate. This caterpillar is a known pest to farmers, and this experiment was conducted to see if hormones could affect the life cycle of the pest in order to determine if insecticides containing hormones could be effective. Juvenile Hormone is the hormone that varies in the caterpillar. As a larva, the level of juvenile hormone is at its highest. It slowly drops as the organism moves to the pupa point. In order for the organism to pupate, the level of juvenile hormone needs to drop completely. The hypothesis that the organism would not be able to pupate was supported.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta Caterpillars are known pests to farmers, especially tobacco farmers. The total lifespan of a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar is 39-48 days. The life cycle is egg⇾pupa⇾moth. [1] Ecdysteroids (E20) and Juvenile Hormone are the two hormones mostly in charge of development. The commitment pulse occurs when both hormones change in amount when it is signaled that the caterpillar is large and healthy enough to pupate. Specifically, there is a distinct drop in Juvenile Hormone and a rise in E20. [1] In this experiment, an insecticide that mimics Juvenile Hormone will be added to the food of certain caterpillars. This may affect the chance of the caterpillar reaching the pupa stage in its life cycle. The more that is understood about the effects of hormones on these pests may help create effective insecticides for farmers. I hypothesize that if given a highly concentrated amount of Martin IGR (Juvenile Hormone mimic) there will not be a chance for a commitment pulse so the caterpillars will not pupate.

Materials and Method:
1. Split 8 caterpillars of roughly the same weight into two groups (controll and treatment). 2. Write down the weight of each caterpillar and separate them into their own sections of a container.  3. Weigh out approximately 10 g of caterpillar food per caterpillar. 4. For the treatment group, add ten drops of Martin IGR (which mimics Juvenile Hormone) to each of the 10 g of food. 5. For the controll group, at ten drops of water for each ten grams of food. 6. Repeat the feeding process each day for a week and record the weight of the caterpillars each feeding. 7. Analyze data by using a graph and completing a paired T-Test.

Results:
Throughout the experiment, it was observed that the controll group grew fat, green, and healthy continuously. The treatment group added weight, but became aggravated and their color changed from green to a very pale white/green color.  The weight of the caterpillars in the controll group increased steadily. The treatment group gained weight in the beginning of the experiment, but there was a decline in the average weight gain towards the end of the experiment. The controll group seemed to be on their way to pupating, but none of the caterpillars pupated. For the statistical tests, a two-tailed p_value of 0.0247 was calculated and the t-value was 2.9775. The standard deviation can be seen by viewing the error bars in figure 1. The statistics disprove the null hypothesis stating that there would be no significent weight difference between the two groups.

Discussion:
With the results from this experiment, the hypothesis seems to be supported. None of the caterpillars had the chance to pupate, but the controll group was on their way to pupating based on their finals weights. The treatment group did not reach a weight in which they would have been able to pupate. In order to pupate, the caterpillar must reach the fifth instar larval period. This includes the caterpillar reaching a weight of about 11 grams. [2] The caterpillars that ate the food enriched with the Juvenile Hormone mimic did not reach this weight. This would cause the caterpillars to not pupate and either stay as a caterpillar or die. The controll groups final weights ranged from 10.7 g to 12.33 g.  An error in this lab could be due to missing a day of feeding. An alternative explanation for the recorded weights could be that the experiment was not carried out long enough. Future experiments should extend the period of examination to note any differences. If the study were to be repeated, larger amounts of Juvenile Hormone mimic could be added to observe the differences. Overall, the experiment’s results supported the hypothesis that adding Juvenile Hormone to the diet of a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar will cause the caterpillar to not develop properly.
