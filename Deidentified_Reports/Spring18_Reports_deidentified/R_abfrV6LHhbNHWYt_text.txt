Title: The effect of juvenile hormone via Martin's IGR on the development of the Manduca sexta caterpillar applied at the onset of the 5th larval instar

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, the tobacco hornworm, is characterized by distinct stages of life. Juvenile hormone (JH) is essential to proper development of the organism. We hypothesized that increased amounts of JH applied at the onset of the 5th larval instar, in the form of a mimic - Martin's IGR - would cause maturation into a 6th larval instar. We tested this by comparing the weight and length changes in a controll group versus a treatment group which received Martin's IGR integrated with its diet. Both groups of caterpillars showed an overall increase in both weight and length over the course of seven days. The results of the experiment indicate no statistically significent difference between the groups, indicating that an increase of JH at before the 5th larval instar does not result in maturation to a supernumerary nymph. However, previously performed studies have produced evidence to the contrary. If the experiment were carried out for several more days, the results may have then supported our hypothesis.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is in the Order Lepidoptera. It is considered a pest can cause damage to drops, though they do not carry any known human pathogens. Manduca sexta follow the Holometabolous life cycle, meaning they undergo four stages of life - egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The organism is good to use for our experiment because it is relatively easy to distinguish between instars, and the caterpillars could not seriously hurt us. Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids (20E) are important in the development of the caterpillars, and are necessary for the survival of the organism. The work together to controll the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the organism as well [Johnson: 2016]. A decreased level of JH is needed and involved in the metamorphosis from the caterpillar to the pupa stage [Nijhout: 1974]. Near the end of the 4th  larval instar, there is a large increase in 20E and the levels of JH begin to drop off slightly. During the 5th larval instar, JH levels drop very low, and a commitment pulse occurs, indicating to the caterpillar it is ready to pupate [Johnson:2016]. 
In this experiment, we will be looking at how JH levels affect the Manduca sexta's development. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) act on systems of insects in unique ways. One such way is by mimicking the function of JH. Abnormally high levels of JH have been shown to impact the molt between developmental stages [Krysan: 1993]. In order to test how JH affects the Manduca sexta caterpillars and its development, we will be using Martin's IGR, a chemical which mimics JH, integrated into the caterpillar's diets [Johnson: 2016]. We will specifically be looking at the effect of JH at the onset of the 5th larval instar, before pupation and eventual transition into adulthood. We hypothesize that increased amounts of Martin's IGR applied at the onset of the 5th larval instar will prohibit proper development of the Manduca sexta and cause maturation into a supernumerary nymph (6th instar). 

Materials and Method:
In order to carry out the experiment, we used eight Manduca sexta caterpillars which were all around the end of the 4th instar. We used four round, plastic containers with four perforated lids. Each container was divided into two habitats using an index card. One group of four caterpillars, the controll group (C0), was placed in two of the containers, one organism per habitat. Each caterpillar received 10 grams of food initially, with 12 drops of water and no Martin's IGR, for seven days. The other group of caterpillars, the treatment group (T1), was placed in the two remaining containers, one organism per habitat. Each treatment caterpillar received 10 grams of food initially, with 12 drops of Martin's IGR. Both C0 and T1 received 10 grams of more food with 12 drops of water or Martin's IGR, respectively, when the food supply was low enough that the organisms would run out by the next day. The groups were both kept in the same incubator conditions at 23Â°C in a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle for seven days. Each day, the caterpillars' weights and lengths were recorded. A statistical T-test was used to analyze the collected date to compare C0 and T1. 

Results:
There was a general increase in both weight and length for the Manduca sexta caterpillars in both the controll and treatment groups over 7 days. The average weight on Day 7 was higher for the controll group, while the average length on Day 7 was higher for the treatment group. The controll group experienced the highest values for both controll and weight over the course of seven days. The final averages of length, when using a t_test, resulted in p=0.45 and the final averages for weight resulted in p=0.47. 

Discussion:
The results of our experiment indicated that our hypothesis should be rejected. There was not a significent statistical difference between the controll group and treatment group of Manduca sexta caterpillars with regard to weight/length growth. In order to accept our hypothesis, we would have needed to see a statistically significently higher weight/length in the treatment group. This would indicate the caterpillars were not beginning to pupate during the 5th larval instar, but rather were carrying into a 6th instar as supernumerary nymphs. The data we gathered did not support this conclusion. 
However, although the data collected did not support our hypothesis, experiments done by other researchers has yielded results that support our hypothesis. In a study done by the University of Washington, it was determined that the application of a JH mimic before pupation prevented the Manduca sexta from adult differentiation, with a 50% effective rate when 3.3 ng of JH was applied per animal [Kiguchi: 1978]. A potential reason our results did not show the same effect could be that we chose larvae that were too early in the 4th instar. If the experiment had run a few days longer, perhaps the data we would have collected would have supported our hypothesis and shown evidence of a 6th instar. A next logical step to our experiment would be to test the effects of Martin's IGR on other insects that follow a Holometabolous life cycle. Martin's IGR has uses as a pesticide, and so the results of such a study could have real-world applications of further examining the effects of pesticides on crop development in agriculture, as well as the actual effects as an insecticide.
