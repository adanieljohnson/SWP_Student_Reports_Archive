Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca sexta Weight

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, are caterpillars that effect the environment when they are in their larvae stage. In the following experiment, the insect growth hormone, Precor, was analyzed to see whether it could hinder the development of Manduca sexta during their larvae stage. The experiment had a control group, no Precor, and a treatment group, with Precor, in order to analyze whether Precor affected the growth of the caterpillars. A statistical test, T-test, was used in order to see whether there was a statistical difference between the means of both caterpillars. Insect growth hormones may be the best way to save the environment.

Introduction:
The species studied in this experiment are Manduca sexta catepillars. These catepillars are part of the Order Lepidoptera, which also includes butterflies, moths, and skippers. It has common names such as a hawk moth and a tobacco hornworm. The average life cycle of Manduca sexta is between 19 and 23 days, and it can be longer or shorter depending on outdoor conditions. Manduca sexta go through a holometabolous life cycle, which has four life stages: egg or embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The larvae and adult forms of Manduca sexta look different due to body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis. In this experiment, a specific amount insect growth regulator (IGR) will be used to test its effectiveness on Manduca sexta weight. Insect growth regulators have been proven to affect physiological regulatory processes for growth and development. Synthetic IGR compounds have been produced based on the biochemistry and physiology of how insects develop. Insect growth regulators have been created to selectively interfere with processes regulated by juvenile hormones. Many IGRs are used with adult pesticides like pyrethrins and pyrethroids, and they are categorized as insect development inhibitors. Typically, IGRs prevent an organism from reaching adulthood or makes an organism turn into an adult before it can reproduce. The IGR, Precor, is used in the amount of five drops on each treatment Manduca sexta. Precor is a type of juvenile hormone modulator, and this experiment helps verify if Precor is effective at inhibiting or promoting Manduca sexta weight. This study addresses one main question. Does Precor effectively inhibit Manduca sexta weight? The null hypothesis is that five drops of Precor does not affect Manduca sexta weight, so weight does not change with five drops of Precor. The alternative hypothesis is that five drops of Precor affects Manduca sexta weight, so weight changes with five drops of Precor. In this experiment, it is predicted that the null hypothesis will be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis will be accepted. If Manduca sexta are given five drops of Precor, then each Manduca sexta in the treatment group will have a lower weight than each Manduca sexta in the control group on average.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, the hypothesis was tested by using five drops of Precor for one group of Manduca and five drops of water for a different group. Each group had four Manduca sexta. Four containers were gathered, and an index card was placed in the middle of each container to separate each container into two sides. Eight Manduca sexta were collected. One control Manduca sexta and one treatment Manduca sexta were placed in each container, keeping them separate. Each Manduca sexta was fed 10g of food per five drops of liquid. Each control caterpillar was given five drops of water and each treatment caterpillar was given five drops of Precor. Initial weights of each Manduca sexta were collected. Weights were then collected every day for seven consecutive days. Each caterpillar was fed 10g per five drops of water or Precor each day for seven days. Final weights were gathered on day seven.

Results:
The bar graph shows several trends in the data. It is clear that the control group weighs more than the treatment group on average after the seven-day time interval. This is the expected results since the treatment group is treated with the insect growth regulator, Precor, which is supposed to inhibit growth and development of Manduca sexta. It makes sense that the control group has a higher weight since they are given water instead of Precor, so this proves the procedure is successful. During the experiment, the t-test is used to analyze two population means using statistics to interpret the data. It is used to find any significant different in the means of the two populations. Once the t-value of the two populations is determined to be 0.38, further observations and conclusions can be drawn about the hypothesis.

Discussion:
The results from this study demonstrate the effectiveness of Precor on Manduca sexta. The bar graph depicts that the average weight of the Manduca sexta in the treatment group is less than the average weight of the control group. Based on this data, it is clear that Precor inhibited Manduca sexta development since the treatment group’s weight is less than the control group’s weight. The results open up room for further research in the field of insect growth regulators on just how effective insect growth regulators can be. The results also prove that metamorphosis is delayed since the control group grows more than the treatment group. Finally, the results prove that the original hypothesis is incorrect since the null hypothesis is accepted since the error bars overlap based on the t-value of 0.38, which is less than 0.50. The null hypothesis is supported.
