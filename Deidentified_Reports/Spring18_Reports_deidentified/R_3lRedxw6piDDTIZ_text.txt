Title: Effect of colored water on aggression in Betta splendens 

Abstract:
The impact of a different color environment on aggressive display in Betta splendens was analyzed in this experiment. It was hypothesized that a blue Betta splendens would exhibit less aggression towards a red Betta splendens in red colored water compared to clear water. Three different blue Bettas were exposed to a red Betta in both clear water and red colored water for five minutes during each trial. The following aggressive displays were counted: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and red mane. A paired t-test was used to compare the results. There was no statistically significant difference between the different color environments.

Introduction:
Betta splendens are common aquarium fish that are known for the intraspecific aggressive behaviors they display. These behaviors include broadside movements such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing as well as facing movements such as displaying a red mane [Johnson: 2018]. Dominance is important to the Betta splendens because of the need to protect their nests and territories in the wild. [Todd, et. al: 2008] This experiment was interested in how visual perception of color impacts aggression in Betta fish. Betta’s have good eyesight, displayed by their ability to recognize an opponent and exhibit aggressive behaviors. They are nearsighted, lacking depth perception, but they are able to see their surroundings in color. [“Betta”] Color is one of the many visual cues that any animal faces in the natural environment, and may impact how an animal perceives a situation or the response it chooses. Having the ability to see color can help an animal with tasks such as finding food or recognizing an opponent. We hypothesized that if placed in red water, a blue Betta would exhibit less aggression towards a red Betta based on the colored water impairing its ability to accurately perceive the threat of another male. 

Materials and Methods:
     In order to test our hypothesis, we needed to run two different trials with the same blue Betta splendens fish. In the first trial, three blue Betta fish were each exposed in individual trials to a red Betta fish in clear water for 5 minutes. A tank with dividers separating the two fish was used, so the Bettas were not in actual contact with each other, but could see their opponent through a piece of glass. We counted the number of times the blue Bettas displayed the following aggressive behaviors- pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and red mane. After 5 minutes, the partition was replaced so the fish could no longer see each other. 
      After the first trial with each blue Betta, a few drops of red food coloring was added to the water of both the red and blue Betta. The fish were given time to acclimate to the new environment before the second test was conducted. The fish were exposed to each other again for 5 minutes, and the same aggressive displays were counted. A paired t-test, comparing the number of times the aggressive behavior was shown in the clear water vs. the red water was utilized for each blue Betta, analyzed using a significance level of .05. 

Results:
In general the number of times each behavior was displayed was similar between the different trials. 
Figure 1 shows the results of pelvic fin flickering display in each fish between the two trials. Running a paired t-test with these results gives a t-value of .74 and a p-value of .54. Therefore, there is not a statistical difference between the two trials.
Figure 2 provides the results between each trial for the number of tail beats in each trial. A paired t-test gives a t-value of 3.87 and a p-value of .06. Again, these results do not prove to be statistically significant based on the alpha level of .05. 
Figure 3 gives the results of the number of red manes displayed by each blue betta fish between the two trials. A paired t-test of these results gives a t-value of .57 and a p-value of .63, which is not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
We would expect that coloration in the water may make it difficult for Betta splendens to perceive the threat of another male, the same color of the water, and thus lead to a decrease in aggressive displays. While the number of aggressive displays between each trial decreased in some cases, the results were not statistically significant for any of the behaviors. 
	Other studies have been done on visual perception in Betta splendens. Bando examined this through exposing the fish to various stimulus patterns. Models of the side view of a Betta splendens were presented to the fish. Aggressive responses were strong when there was a fine distribution of brightness and color, however they became weaker as the distribution became more homogeneous. These results indicate that distribution of brightness and color play an important role in the visual recognition of Betta splendens. [Bando: 1991] This disagrees with our results, as we would expect the aggressive displays to decrease significantly if the Betta could not accurately perceive of its opponent. However, this may be explained by habituation in the test subjects utilized in our study. The Betta splendens we experimented on had been used in many previous lab studies and underwent two trials of exposure in our study. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that they became habituated and thus acted less aggressively overall, explaining why there was no significant decrease between the two trials. 
A study conducted by Irawan and Afiati, however, provides results that agree with ours. This study examined aggressive responses in Betta splendens in various color environments. Red and black B. splendens were exposed to mirror images in different color environments. Frequencies in frontal and lateral display and frequency and duration of gill cover erection were not significant. [Bambang and Afiati: 2006] These results agree with the results of our study that there was not a significant decrease in aggressive behaviors between the two color environments. 
Our results may be explained by the fact that male Betta splendens can secrete testosterone when they experience an encounter with another male fish [Forsatkar, et. al: 2013]. Therefore, it is likely that a secretion of testosterone by the red Betta allowed the blue Betta to fully perceive the presence of an opponent. This would explain why the aggressive display in the blue Betta did not significantly decrease. 
Since our study was conducted on fish that had been used in a variety of previous studies, it would be beneficial to complete this experiment again. Using Betta splendens that had not been previously experimented on would most likely provide results that are more accurate. Additionally, it would be advantageous to complete the trials on more than three fish.
