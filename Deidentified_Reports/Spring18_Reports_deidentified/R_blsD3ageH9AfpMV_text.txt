Title: Manduca Sexta and Oral Administration Juvenile Hormone Analogs

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, has evolved a method for regulating development using Juvenile Hormone (JH). As the caterpillar develops, the amount of JH is reduced allowing these organisms to mature and become pests for crop farmers. JH analogs (JHAs), such as Precor, active ingredient methoprene, imitates high levels of JH in insects and stunts development. This study addressed whether oral administration of Precor in Manduca Sexta caterpillars would hinder the growth of the organisms. Our results suggest that Precor probably does not hinder the growth and development in Manduca Sexta through oral administration-possibly suggesting a mechanism to stave-off the effects of methoprene has evolved.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, has a lifespan between 30-50 days. During development, Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating the physiology of these insects. For instance, JH regulates metamorphosis by preventing Manduca Sexta from continuing maturation and forming a pupa to transition from a larval stage to an adult. As the insect develops through each stage, growing and maturing into an adult, the amount of JH is reduced (Niño et al.) The present study aims to address ways to modulate insect growth by studying the effects of different JH analogs (JHAs). 
A lot of research has been conducted on JHAs in pesticides (for example, see Ginjupalli and Baldwin). Precor, active ingredient methoprene, is a JHA that has long been used in pesticides because they are not of concern to human health (Kavlock and Ankley), JHAs are an attractive management options for farmers because they have low toxicity to mammals and an extensive history of controllling a variety of pests, such as cockroaches, mosquitoes, and fleas (Goodman, Potter, and Haynes). Specifically, by imitating high levels of JH, these analogs interfere with the development of normal reproductive adults by preventing the targeted insect from ever maturing (Goodman, Potter, and Haynes; Niño et al.), which can protect crops from current and subsequent pest populations. Thus, our belief is that high levels of JH hinders the growth and development of Manduca Sexta, as measured by individual organism's weight.
Our hypothesis is: Precor (methoprene), does not affect the growth of Manduca Sexta, so weight does not change when exposed to Precor.

Materials and Method:
To conduct our experiment, we first selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars from the Bio 114 lab that weigh between 0.75 and 1.75 g. From there we divided the caterpillars in two groups (an experimental and a controll), placing one from each group into each container, which was separated by an index card. For each group of caterpillars we gave one of two diets: the controll group had 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet-recommended by the manufacturer, with 4 drops of DI water; and the experimental group had 10g of GLM diet, supplemented with 4 drops of Precor (active ingredient methoprene). After the initial preparation, we kept all of our caterpillars in the same incubator, after properly labeling their containers with the group name and ID number.

Results:
On average, the controll group weighed more than the experimental group. The controll group's average weights for containers 1-4, respectively, were: 3.057g +/- 0.975; 2.0457g +/- 0.452; 2.16g +/- 0.415; 1.596g +/- 0.304. The experimental group's average weights for containers 1-4, respectively, were 2.04g +/- 0.456; 1.104g +/- 0.582; 2.424g +/- 0.726; 0.9238g +/- 0.1078 (Figures 2 & 3). The average difference in weight between caterpillars in the controll and experimental groups was 0.592g. The paired t_test using the difference in weight yielded a p_value of 0.2584 (Figure 3).

Discussion:
The p_value of 0.2584 is far above the significance level of 0.05, which indicates that we must accept the null hypothesis. With that in mind, however, after completing this experiment, we discovered that our protocol called for fresh food to be given each day. Another result of this miscommunication is the observation that the subjects lost weight starting on the 6th day and continuing to the 7th. Accordingly, a possible reason that the p_value is so high is because the subjects may have had an insufficient food supply. Thus, the observed difference, while not statistically significent, may actually be due to the addition of Precor. Under this assumption, findings (Niño et al.; Goodman, Potter, and Haynes) that JHAs interfere with the development of normal reproductive adults prove accurate. 
	Alternatively, the results observed in this experiment may be attributed to random chance-as suggested by the high p_value. If that is the case, perhaps Manduca Sexta has evolved an immunity to the effects of Precor. Additionally, there are confounding variables that may further explain the high p_value, including variations in duration spent in the containers with food due to different prep times and different team members efficiency at weighing the caterpillars.
