Title: The Effect of Light Quality on Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of different colors on light on the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea chloroplast. We were able to measure the rate of photosynthesis by examining the absorbance of each chloroplast; lower recorded absorbances mean higher rates of photosynthesis. We hypothesize that our results will show higher photosynthesis rates in red and white light and lower rates in blue and green light. In order to conduct the experiment, we first enriched the chloroplasts and then tested each 3 mixtures (12 total) under blue, red, white, or green light and recorded the absorbance of each mixture every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. Our data resulted in a F-value of 5.05, total degrees of freedom of 11, and a p-value of 0.03. While our p-value was less than 0.05, our results were statistically insignificant because there wasn't a significant difference between the % change in absorbance of red and white light compared to blue and green light. Our data showed that white light had the highest rate of photosynthesis, followed by red, blue, and finally green light.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis consists of two parts: light independent reactions and light dependent reactions. The light dependent reactions contain the protein complexes photosystems I and II; both of which aid the transport of electrons and help generate a proton gradient. Generally, after the electron in photosystem I becomes excited, it is eventually handed off to the electron acceptor NADP+. The typical process involving the transport of electrons to electron acceptors is called the Hill reaction [Johnson AD: 2018]. In order to measure the electron transport process, NADP+ can be switched with the electron acceptor DCPIP [Johnson AD: 2018]. By itself, DCPIP is oxidized and has a blue color, however, when it's reduced, it turns clear. This change in color allows use to measure the reduction of DCPIP as a change in absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson AD: 2017]. By measuring the change in absorbance of each mixture, we can draw conclusions about the rate of photosynthesis of the chloroplasts; the lower the absorbance, the greater the rate of photosynthesis. When exposed to varying colors of light, plant leaves exhibit different photosynthetic rates. Green light tends to be reflected by plants and small amounts of green light are absorbed by chlorophyll pigments [Johkan: 2012]. In contrast, red light has proven to be efficient in increasing photosynthesis because its wavelength of light matches the absorbance peaks of chlorophyll pigments [Darko: 2012]. Additionally, tobacco leaves exposed to blue light were found to have lower amounts of chlorophyll A and B in comparison to leaves exposed to red and white light [Yang: 2017]. We want to determine how varying colors of light (blue, green, red, and white) affect photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea. We hypothesize that the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts exposed to red or white light should be higher than chloroplasts exposed to blue or green light. 

Materials and Methods:
We chose 4 large Spinacia oleracea and then deveined them. We then added the 4 deveined leaves and 10mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 (grinding buffer) into a mortar and ground it into a thick paste. We then added 10 more mL of grinding buffer and strained the Spinacia oleracea slurry through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a beaker.  We spun the slurry in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rpm and 4°C and poured the supernatant into another tube to be put it in the centrifuge for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm and 4°C. After that we added 20mL of grinding buffer to the chloroplast pellet and mixed it together. Next, we created 1 blank and 12 test tubes containing 100  L of chloroplasts, 6 mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL of 100mM phosphate at pH 6.5 (reaction buffer). We added the chloroplasts to the test tube last and mixed each tube immediately after adding them. We transferred each of the mixtures into the spectrophotometer cuvettes and divided them into 4 groups of 3, based on which color of light (red, blue, green, or white) they would sit under. After doing so, we blanked the spectrophotometer and recorded the initial absorbance of each sample 3 times, every 10 minutes. After collecting all the data, we performed an ANOVA to compare the percent change of initial absorbance to final absorbance after 30 minutes. 

Results:
Our data showed that the mixture treated with white light resulted in the highest % change absorbance. The mixture treated with red light resulted in the second highest % change absorbance, followed by blue light, and green light resulted in the lowest % change (Figure 1). The degrees of freedom among groups was 3 and the degrees of freedom within groups was 8, the F-value was 5.05, and p- value was 0.03.  

Discussion:
Although our results showed that our p-value was 0.03, they are insignificant because our data did not show a significant difference between the photosynthesis rates of chloroplasts exposed to red or white light and those exposed to blue or green light. The Tukey-Kramer test showed that there was a significant difference between the average absorbance % change of white and green light. However, trial 2 of green light was an outlier, with a lower change in absorbance than the other trials. This could account for the perceived significant difference. As expected, the results did show a slight increase in the photosynthetic rates of mixtures treated with white and red light. More specifically, our data showed that white light resulted in the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by red light, blue light, and finally green light. Red and white light should show a higher absorbance because the chloroplasts readily absorb their wavelengths of light, while chloroplasts reflect more green light. A study on the photosynthetic rates of tobacco leaves showed that in comparison with white light, tobacco plants treated with other monochromatic light (red, blue, green, yellow) resulted in lower photosynthetic rates, likely due to stomatal limitations [Yang:2017]. Additionally, red and blue light tends to show higher absorption because it lines up directly with the absorbances of chlorophyll a and b as well as the carotenoids [Yang:2017]. The pigments and carotenoids show absorbance peaks between 400-500nm (blue light) and 630-680nm (red light) [Yang:2017]. Because white light is a mixture of all colors of light, it is absorbed by the chlorophyll pigments at low and high wavelengths and should result in the greatest rate of photosynthesis [Lodish:2000]. Meanwhile, green light is shown to have lower photosynthetic rates, limit plant growth, and have lower amounts of rubisco than blue, red, or purple light [Yang:2017]. If we were to repeat this experiment again, we could increase the number of replicates exposed to each color of light and increase the amount of time the mixtures are exposed to the light. The more replicates tested and the longer the mixtures are exposed to the light, the greater the chance we could find a significant difference between the photosynthesis rates of white and red light and the photosynthesis rates of green and blue light. Furthermore, we could double or triple the number of chloroplasts we add to the mixture to see if that creates a larger % change between absorbance rates. Lastly, the results of this experiment can be applied to future growth and development of plants grown for food. For example, red light has been shown to help stimulate the production of antioxidants and stimulate general growth of plants [Olle: 2013]. In contrast, blue light has the ability to help increase biomass [Olle:2013]. Knowing which color of light contributes to which portion of plant growth can help us alter growth rate.
