Title: Reduction in Visibility has no Effect on Aggression in Beta splendins

Abstract:
Beta splendins fighting fish use color identification as a catalyst to their infraspecific agnostic behaviors. Agonistic behaviors in Beta splendins fish include facing behaviors, broadside behaviors, and darts, each of which is used by male fish generally towards other males, and can be elicited in one male by their presence in another male [Elcoro: 2008]. Throughout the experiment, we sought to asses the impact of visibility on Beta splendins’ displays of agonism. We hypothesized that if we placed two Beta splendins fish in a tank of clear water, separated from each other by a transparent divider, then they will exhibit higher levels of aggression than when they are once again exposed to each other in a tank of dyed blue water. We believed the reduction in visibility would decrease the impact of visually triggered aggression. We exposed to male Beta splendins to each other in 6 trial sessions, with three sets of fish. We then repeated this process in dyed blue water. Aggressive behaviors were monitored over a 5 minute trial period. Following our trials, it became evident that there is no significent difference suggesting that reduced visibility affects agnostic behavior in Beta splendins. 

Introduction:
Many species of fish use color identification as a visual cue to their infraspecific agnostic behaviors. Fish exposed to robotic facsimiles of their own species spend the most time interacting with fish models that resemble realistic colorations of there own species, suggesting color plays a central role in facilitating social interaction [Polverino: 2013]. Broadening our understanding of the relationship between environmental conditions and behavior is essential in understanding the adaptive functions of physiological features in organisms.Throughout our experiment, we sought to gauge whether a reduced visibility environment would lessen the agnostic behavioral tendencies of Beta splendins fish in situations where two male fish are visible to each other. We quantified acts of aggression displayed by fish in normal visibility settings and reduced (dyed) visibility settings by compositing total acts of aggression committed by both fish in each pair into an “aggression score,” weighing darts as 50% as aggressive as facing and broadside behaviors. We used a paired t_test to assess whether there was any significent difference in the amount of aggression displayed in the normal visibility setting versus the reduced visibility setting. 

Materials and Method:
To execute this experiment, we used one fish tank, subdivided into three sections by 2 sets of dividers. Each set of tank dividers consisted of one opaque and one transparent divider the could be removed independently of each other. We began the experiment with the tank filled with clear water. We obtained 6 blue male Beta splendins fish and divided them into groups of two. Each member of each group was placed on either side of a divider in the tank such that they were in the section adjacent to their group member. After being give a five minute rest period, the opaque barrier was removed, leaving the transparent barrier between the two fish. Over a trial period of five minutes, facing behaviors, broadside behaviors, and darts were recorded. After each group’s 5 minute trial period, three drops of blue dye were added to the tank water and stirred until the tank water in the two trial sections were equally blended. Each fish group was again added to the tank, allowed a 5 minute rest, then exposed to each other via the removal of the intermediate opaque barrier. Aggressive behaviors were once again recorded. After each group’s trial in colored water, the records of aggressive behavior were aggregated into a composite score in which darting behaviors were weighted as being 50% more aggressive than broadside and facing behaviors. The resulting composite aggression score was used to gauge wether any significent difference existed between aggression levels in clear water and in blue water. We used a paired t_test to assess statistical significance.

Results:

On average, each group exhibited more aggression during the reduced visibility test than during the regular visibility test. However, the second trial group’s 296% increase in aggression during the reduced visibility test likely influenced the data greatly (Figure 1). Each other test group displayed less aggression during the reduced visibility test than during the normal visibility test (Figure 1). However, we found no significent difference at the .05 level to suggest that the reduced visibility environment affected aggression in Beta splendins fish. Our statistical test indicated that d.f.=2, t value= 0.17, and p=0.88, suggesting there to be no significent difference at the .05 level. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that fish in a reduced visibility blue environment would exhibit less aggression than when in a clear environment, was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the .05 level, suggesting that the presence of dye in the environment does not effect aggression in Beta splendins. It is possible that the dye had no effect on the vision of the fish, thus failing to inhibit their ability to identify and interact with other fish. Additionally, past investigations have found color to be a less significent visual cue as fin vibrations and size [Johnson: 1973]. This could suggest that the fish were still able to identify opposing individuals as infraspecific males and thus exhibited normal levels of aggression. Understanding the beta fish’s visual capabilities in the context of environmental variation and the relatedness of vision and behavior could further our understanding of the adaptive functionalities and evolutionary success of eyesight in certain fish.
