Title: The Effects of Water Clarity on Aggression in Betta splendens

Abstract:
Through the study of animal behavior, scientists have been able to determine how creatures interpret the world. Observing agonistic performances can help determine when animals feel the most threatened or challenged. We examined the aggressive tendencies of male Siamese fighting fish, or Betta splendens, to determine whether water clarity influences their behavior. To do this, we separated two males with a glass partition and counted the different aggressive displays in clear water and then in turbid water. After three tests per water type, we equated the agonistic behaviors to scores according to the increases of hostility and gave each test a score of aggression. Higher scores indicated more agonistic behavior. We predicted that the Betta fish would perform aggressive movements in clear water because they would be able to see better and determine whether the opposing fish was a threat. We expected the murky water to obstruct the visibility of the fish and, therefore, its ability to establish the size, strength, hostility, and breed of its foe. In clear water, we expected that the fish would feel more intimidated because it would be able to see that the opposite fish was another male Betta that was threatening. 

Introduction:
Abstract Cont:
Over the course of three five-minute tests, we found that the clear water tests resulted in high aggressive scores than turbid water. Therefore, our hypothesis was supported, and the results were significant. 

Intro:
Ethology, or the study of animal behavior, is a form of observation that combines laboratory methods with theories from ecology, genetics, and evolutionary biology to evaluate how behavior has been shaped be selection and evolution, as well as understand the purpose for the behavior. Ethologists study behaviors like aggression through the evaluation of animal actions to determine how animals perceive the world, not as humans interpret it. One particular behavior that is studied is aggression. Through aggressive behaviors, to assert dominance or territory, animals can do bodily harm to one another, negatively affect potential reproductive success, instigate starvation, and even cause death [Marler: 1976]. Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish, are known for their displays of aggression. The fish were always noticed for their aggression, in fact, they were originally kept and bred for fighting in contests in Siam [Lucas: 1968]. This lab observes their behavior, specifically that of males, in the presence of each other. We will be watching for broadside and facing movements as signs of agonistic, or aggressive, behaviors. We will determine when the males feel the most threatened and react aggressively in clear water and murky water tests through the observance of their different displays. We will quantify the agonistic tendencies to recognize the differences in increasing aggression. In theory, a Betta would feel more threatened by another male fish that is acting aggressively, especially if one fish is bigger than the other. Size typically indicates strength, so a fish would be more at risk if its opponent is larger. Betta fish can survive in areas with turbid water; however, murky water would impede on the eyesight of a Betta, making it harder to determine the size and aggression of its opponents. If the Betta cannot see whether another fish is larger or even another Betta, it would seem appropriate that it would not demonstrate aggressive tendencies as often toward the potential threat. I predict that male Betta splendens will act most aggressively toward another male Betta fish in clear water because they can see each other well, while in turbid water, they will not be able to tell whether the other fish is a threat to them.

Materials and Methods:
With one tank of clear, filtered water, we added two male Betta fish that were separated by a white partition. Then we removed the white partition, leaving only clear glass separating the males for five minutes. We observed their behaviors for pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, erect pectoral fin, gill cover, and red “mane” displays. We recorded each time there was a demonstration of these aggressive behaviors. We closed off the partition and let the fish rest for at least five minutes and did this three times. We completed the same steps with the same fish, but in murky water (we made the water turbid by adding dirt without fertilizer to the tank). After, we counted the number of displays of aggression and combined them for both fish. Next, we awarded points, increasing by one, for each increasingly aggressive display. This would mean 1 point for pelvic flickering and erect pectoral, 2 points for tail beating and gill coverage, and 3 points for tail flashing and red “manes.” To condense the data, we took the average score of all three tests for clear water and then the average score of the three tests for turbid water. Higher scores, or measures of aggression, mean more aggression. We recorded the data in a paired t-test and determined if there is a significant correlation using an alpha level of .05.

Results:
The Betta splendens displayed more aggressive behavior in clear water. As shown in the following table, the clean water aggressive tendencies scored an average of 93.333 with a standard deviation of 18.372, while the average score of aggression for turbid water was only 45 with a standard deviation of 12.675. There was a difference of 48.333 points of aggression between the two water treatments. Though standard deviation for turbid water was lower, both standard deviations were relatively high, being over 19% of the overall score. When all the information was considered, the difference in aggression was significant with a P-value of .025 (t=6.234, df=2, p&lt;.05).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that male Betta splendens would act most aggressively toward each other in clear water was supported. The male Betta fish scored a higher aggressive total in clear water than turbid water. The aggressive behavior scores more than doubled from turbid to clear water, going from 45 to 93.33 as shown in Figure 1. According to the paired t-test, the results proved to be significant with a p-value of less than .05, so the data is relevant. The possible reasons for this include the fact that visibility was impaired in the murkier water. As a result, the fish could not see their opposers to determine the size of the threat. If the fish cannot identify a threat, there would be no reason to expend the energy on agonistic behaviors. Additionally, the turbid water could have been harder to swim through because the water was denser. This would mean that the fish would apply a greater deal of energy just to swim than they would in clear water, and would, therefore, not have as much energy to allocate toward aggressive behaviors. An experiment was conducted that showed that oxygen consumption was positively correlated with displays of aggression [Castro:2006]. In the turbid water, dirt formed a layer over the top of the water, making it harder for the Bettas to go to the surface for air. This would mean that they would not have as much oxygen to perform the aggressive behaviors as they would in clear water, which would additionally detriment their scores. However, the standard deviations for this experiment were not low, so there was a lot of variation in reaction across trials. This experiment only used two fish that, in theory, would tire after all the extraneous activity. This experiment would have benefited from more of the same trials using different pairings of fish. This would solidify the data across the breed of fish and, most likely, minimize the standard deviation. Overall, the fish acted as had been expected: more aggressively in clear view of their opposers and less aggressively in obstructed water.
