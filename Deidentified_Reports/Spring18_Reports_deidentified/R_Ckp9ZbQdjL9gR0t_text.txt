Title: The Impact of Blocking Acetylcholine on Muscle Contraction in Rania pipiens Legs

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of blocking acetylcholine in a Rania pipiens frog leg.  This experiment tested whether Sevin, an acetylcholine blocker, caused a difference in contractions at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus in Rania pipiens frog legs.  This was done by testing the minimum point of contraction in a frog leg without Sevin and then injected with Sevin.  This was repeated with three more frog legs.  I hypothesized that that blocking acetylcholine in Rania pipiens frog legs will prohibit an action potential from reaching a muscle and thus causing a contraction at a higher minimal threshold of voltage stimulus.  The results concluded that there is a statistical difference in contractions at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus between Rania pipiens frog legs injected by Sevin vs those not injected by Sevin can be proven in this study.

Introduction:
In vertebrates and invertebrates hundreds to thousands of myofibers compose skeletal muscle [Johnson:2018]. Skeletal muscles are supplied by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are in gray matter of the spinal cord [Johnson:2018].  Axons of these motor neurons go into muscles and branch to individual myofibers at places called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2018].  Nerve impulses at these neuromuscular junctions cause the release of acetylcholine, an organic chemical, which binds with a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber which opens sodium channels to create an action potential [Johnson:2018].  The action potential then spreads and causes the release of Ca2+ which activates the contraction of the muscle fiber making it shorten [Johnson:2018], [HaMlin:2000].  Acetylcholine being inhibited in the muscle has been known to increase the latency period and increase the time and voltage needed in order for acetylcholine to bind to receptors and allow for contraction [HaMlin:2000].  The amount of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is also decreased [HaMlin:2000].

Our experiment will be focused on blocking acetylcholine in a Rania pipiens frog leg.  The Rania pipiens frog is known also as the northern leopard frog and is a type of leopard frog from the true frog family [O'Donnell:2012].  The Rania pipiens frog is an ideal organism for the experiment because of its easy accessibility in the United States and good endurance for its muscles for muscle physiology, and it also it has been used for a long time with many studies to examine the nervous system [O'Donnell:2012].

The experiment will be done so by stimulating a Rania pipiens frog leg to record the magnitude of its contraction, and then repeating the process by injecting the chemical Sevin, an acetylcholine blocker, which inhibits the release of acetylcholine.  I hypothesize that blocking acetylcholine in Rania pipiens frog legs will prohibit an action potential from reaching a muscle and thus causing a contraction at a higher minimum threshold of voltage stimulus.


Materials and Method:
4 Rania pipiens frog legs were to be used in the experiment.  Each frog leg had the gastrocnemus muscle separated by cutting the Achilles tendon, and then the muscle was tied to a force transducer at a ninety-degree angle with the rest of the leg pinned down.  The sciatic nerve was then isolated and stimulated to record the magnitude of the minimum point of contraction.  Then after recording the minimum point of contraction and three myograms, the average of the three trials was taken.  Then, with the same leg, 0.1Ml of a 2% solution of Sevin (the acetylcholine blocker) was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and after 5 minutes of allowing the treatment to be absorbed, the minimum point of contraction is recorded again with the same process of averaging the three trials (myograms).  This procedure is done in this experiment with 4 frog legs.  Then after getting repeating the process 4 times, the 4 averages of the 4 legs of the controll group (no Sevin) are averaged together, and the 4 averages of the 4 legs of the treatment group (Sevin injected) are averaged together.

Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the contraction at the average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the Sevin chemical treatment groups is higher than of the controll groups.  The average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the controll group is 0.0825 0.034V compared to the higher average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the treatment group at 0.1375 0.025V.  This difference was proven to be statistically significent as the two groups were statistically different from one another after conducting a paired t_test which had a p_value of 0.038.

Discussion:
My hypothesis seemed to be supported by my results at first glance with the contraction at the average minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of the controll group is 0.0825V compared to the much higher average of the treatment group at 0.1375V, and my hypothesis was statistically supported by the paired t_test which came out with a p_value of 0.038 which is below the significent level of 0.05.  Therefore a statistical difference between Rania pipiens frog legs injected by Sevin vs those not injected by Sevin can be proven in this study.  The statistically supported difference between the contractions shows that Sevin successfully inhibits the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and thus prohibiting an action potential from reaching a muscle and causing a contraction.

HaMlin performed a similar study looking at the effect of acetylcholine receptor inhibitors and its impact on the latency period of the contraction of the gastrocnemus of the tested frog [HaMlin:2000].  The goal of the study was to look at how the chemicals effect the rate by which acetylcholine molecules are able to reach receptors, open sodium channels, and simulate contraction [HaMlin:2000].  The study was not statistically proven in that if an inhibitor is added to the gastrocnemus of the frog then the latency period will increase, but the results did show a slight difference and allows for further studies to test the effects of acetylcholine on other aspects of muscle contraction [HaMlin:2000].

The next logical step for this study would be to run another experiment again diving deeper into Sevin's blocking of acetylcholine.  Now because we know that Sevin has a significent effect on the contraction of minimum thresholds of voltage stimulus, we can run a second experiment testing the differences in the minimum thresholds of contraction with different amounts of Sevin injected in order to further understand Sevin's blocking of acetylcholine and its impact on muscle contraction.

Overall, the experiment provides an excellent way into examining the role acetylcholine plays in muscle contraction [Johnson:2018].  This experiment is particularly important because the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens is very similar to the gastrocnemus muscle in humans.  This allows experimenters to generalize findings to humans and get an idea of how the gastrocnemus muscle works with acetylcholine as well as all other muscles in the human body.  Understanding what weakens the force of muscle contraction can be applied to find out what increases the force of muscle contraction.  Understanding this concept can be important for finding treatment for individuals with neuromuscular diseases.

Figure 1: The effect of the treatment (Sevin vs Control) on the contraction at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus of Rania pipiens frog legs.  The treatment group (blue bar) is the frogs legs when they are injected with the Sevin chemical, and the controll group (orange bar) is the frog legs when they are not injected with anything.  Four frog legs were each stimulated to find the contraction at the minimum threshold of voltage stimulus without anything injected and with the Sevin chemical injected, and the averages from the voltage numbers for each treatment were taken.  Each bar is the mean of the minimum average voltages from the controll and Sevin chemical groups; error bars are  0.034V for the controll bar and  0.025V for the Sevin chemical bar.
