Title: The Effects of Martin’s IRG on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment was to examine how the presence of Martin’s IGR, a synthetic juvenile hormone (JH), impacted the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta. The two predominant hormones involved in maturation of insects are JH and Ecdysterone. JH is responsible for regulating the form of molt of the insect. It is present in larvae stages and disappears after pupation. Ecdysterone, the secondary hormone, is responsible for maintaining timing of molting, and is always present. It was hypothesized that the presence of Martin’s IGR in the insects’ food would result in a significently decreased weight and length compared to the caterpillars without the hormone. Eight caterpillars were split into two groups of four, one controll and one experimental, and were fed the same diet except the treatment group received ten drops of the hormone in their food instead of water. For eight days, the caterpillars were weighed and measured and observations regarding appearance/activity were noted. The hypothesis was supported as a result of the biological manipulation of the hormones and its effect in the development of the Manduca Sexta. This study was conducted to test and explain ways to inhibit the caterpillars from becoming crop eating adults. 


Introduction:
The subject manipulated in this study was the Manduca Sexta. Manduca Sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworms have an average life span of about 39 to 48 days. Their life cycles are comprised of four major life stages: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult [Nijhout: 1975]. The two main hormones responsible for growth and maturation in the Manduca Sexta are the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone [Johnson: 2016]. Thus, being that they are holometabolous insects and use these two hormones, they act as a model organism when testing the effects of JH at different life stages. The purpose of this lab was to further our understanding and knowledge of the role of the three main hormones that effect insect development, molting, formation of the pupa, and the emergence of adults for in regulates the release of Ecdysterone by prothoracic glands. Ecdysterone is secreted by prothoracic glands and regulates the timing of molting as well as additional functions in adult insects. Juvenile Hormone is produced mainly by the corpus allata and regulates the type of molt [Johnson: 2016]. Another underlying principle was the Critical Period-Switch Hypothesis and the different life phases of holometabulus insects, insects that undergo complete metamorphosis. According to the Critical Period-Switch Hypothesis, when Juvenile Hormone (JH) levels are high at the critical periods, the insect becomes another of what it is. In other words, if the insect is a 5th instar, it becomes a supernumerary 6th instar [Williams: 1974]. In this experiment, Martin’s IGR, a synthetic juvenile hormone was administered to the experimental Manduca Sexta caterpillars and their growth and development was monitored over the span of eight days. This experiment utilized a dilution of 4Ml of Martin’s IGR in 100Ml of water. Half of the caterpillars were fed a normal diet that did not contain the synthetic JH, while the other half was fed food supplemented with the Martin’s IGR. The caterpillars given the synthetic hormone will be smaller than the controll group because their growth and transformation into pupa will be inhibited. The reason this study was conducted was to obtain a better understanding of how to keep these caterpillars from turning into adults, or at least altering their adult form. The reason this is the goal is because Manduca Sexta are known to consume large quantities of leaf material [Schittko and Preston 2000]. 


Materials and Method:
First, we obtained eight randoMly selected, same instar Manduca Sexta caterpillars. We weighed (g), measured (cm), and recorded the masses and lengths of each caterpillar. Four fount plastic containers and perforated lids were collected and prepared. Notecards were used to evenly separate the containers into two identical living areas. To ensure clarity, each container was labeled on the outside with the group name, caterpillar ID, whether the group was controll or treatment, and the lab section. 

To prepare the food for all groups, 80 grams of food was weighed in a square container. The food was then divided into two 40 gram portions. Forty drops of deionized water was added and mixed into one portion and forty drops of the Martin’s IGR dilution (4Ml of Martin’s IGR in 100Ml of water) was added and stirred into the other. Ten grams of the stirred food was weighed for each caterpillar (controll group received food mixed with water, treatment group received food mixed with the JH dilution). Each ten-gram portion was massed and was then balled up and placed in its respective container.  

The remaining food was massed and then replaced every day, following the above procedure. The containers were also cleaned daily and the masses and lengths of each caterpillar as recorded along with observations about their appearances and overall activity. 

We calculated the average percent growth of the controll group versus the experimental group. The caterpillars were kept in a 37 degree Celsius incubator and all other conditions remained constant. The experiment was carried out under these conditions for 1 week. A 2-sample-t_test was performed to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the average ending weight and length of the controll group versus the average ending weight and length of the treatment group.  


Results:
Over the span of the experiment, the controll caterpillars were all noted to be bright green, plump, and active. The treatment caterpillars became increasing less active and more pale every day. It was also noted the the treatment caterpillars were thinner and less firm.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported in that the controll group caterpillars appeared more alert, were on average heavier, and longer, and also consumed more food on average than the experimental group. In accordance with the resulting data, it can be inferred that the use of the Martin’s IGR resulted in significently lower weighs and lengths in the experimental group compared to the controll group which did not receive the hormone. The results of the experiment reflected similar effects to those displayed in Case Study Two, in which the presence of blue flossflower, Ageratum houstonianum, a plant known to contain methoprene, was supplemented to a group of experimental caterpillars. Methoprene is an example of biomimicry in that the leaves produce an imitated juvenile hormone that stunts the growth and transformation of the caterpillar from becoming pesky, plant eating adults. The results of the study proved that the flowers indeed inhibited the caterpillars. The treatment group saw on average lower masses and lengths, and one caterpillar fed the leaves even died [Johnson: 2016]. In this study, the results paralleled those of Case Study Two. The Martin’s IGR acted as inhibitors. The caterpillars given the drops in their food appeared weaker, weighed less, and were shorter. It can be inferred that the results of our experiment occurred due to the presence of the hormone at critical periods during the lifecycle of the Manduca Sexta. The juvenile hormone made it so that the treatment caterpillars were not able to grow, develop, and prepare for the pupal phase. Thus, their hormone imbalances resulted in unhealthy supernumerary instars [Retnakaran: 1973]. The controll group, which did not receive the hormone continued to grow and prosper throughout the duration of the study. Data proves that the average weight of the controll group on the final day was 10.56g 0.46, while the average weight of the experimental group on the final day was only 9.00g 0.69. Moreover, the average length of the controll group on the eighth day was calculated to be 7.650.37 and the treatment group 7.070.21. Statistically speaking, the two-sample t_test supported our hypothesis that the caterpillars given the hormone would be stunted. The low p_values derived from the test determined that there was far below a five percent chance that our data occurred purely by chance for either measurement. Therefore, the manipulation of hormones, and thus the growth and development cycle of Manduca Sexta caterpillars, resulted in significently lower weights and lengths of the controll and treatment groups. Thus, it can be concluded that manipulation of JH is a good way to controll the insects from becoming normal adults that eat crops. Giving the hormone stunts the development and makes it so that the insect cannot reach adulthood, or in the case that the insect does reach adulthood, its genes are modified enough to where they will no longer be pests to crops. Thus, if this study were to be replicated, the procedure should not be modified seeing that the data produced valid results.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The graph below depicts the average weight (g) of the controll group compared to the average weight of the treatment group throughout the eight days of the experiment. It is evident that after day three, the controll group (plotted in orange) takes a consistent lead over the treatment group (grey). The deviation between the two groups slowly, but steadily increases with each day to follow. Standard deviation for each group is also given every day.

Figure 2. This graph plots the average length (cm) of the controll group against the average length of the treatment group. Although the riff between the two groups is not as large as the graph portraying the differences in masses between the groups, it is again evident that after day three, there is a noticeable departure. After day three, the controll group on average, is consistently larger than the experimental group. The graph includes standard deviation for both groups each day.
