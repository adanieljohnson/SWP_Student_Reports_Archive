Title: The Effects of Methoprene on Manduca sexta Weight and Development 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to observe the effects of methoprene, an artificial hormone that inhibits pupation, that imitates the function of the Juvenile hormone, on the weights of Manduca sexta.  The Manduca sexta have been used since the 1960s due to them being an ideal model for observing molting and metamorphosis. There were two groups of Manduca sexta that were observed, one was a control group that consumed caterpillar food, and the treatment group consumed caterpillar food with a dosage of methoprene. They were observed for 7 days and were kept at a constant temperature. Our group hypothesized that the Manduca sexta control group would gain weight significantly compared to the control group.  After a t-test, the P value was 0.552, meaning that the weight differences between both groups were not significant.

Introduction:
Hormones regulate the development of plants and animals. Today’s observations will take into account the development of the Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta have been used since the 1960s due to it being a prime model to gaining the understanding of physiological and hormonal controls that regulate molting and metamorphosis.[Kingsolver:2007]. Due to Manduca sexta having a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that they have four major life stages which consist of egg, larva, pupa, adult, they undergo molting, insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer.Manduca sexta go through a process that last about 45-48 days to reach the end result of becoming an adult moth. The  five larval instars stages before molting occur during the larva stage for the Manduca sexta.[Johnson:2018]. To undergo these changes hormone-based signaling  is responsible for the change in physiology of the Manduca sexta and other insects and vertebrates. There are main hormones insects are the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone (20E),   A hormone known as Juvenile Hormone or JH, regulates the type of molt the Manduca sexta will be. Ecdysterone(20E) regulates timing of molting. [Johnson:2018]. Both of these hormones work together to regulate growth and if one is not present then the insect will die.  From Kingsolver’s experiment on Manduca sexta, it is known that their growth and development is affected if their diets are manipulated. Insect growth regulators affect the overall physiological processes that are vital in the development of the insect and its offspring. We will be introducing an IGR, insect growth regulator, inhibit the growth to maturity in insects, known as methoprene. This IGR will be added to the food of a small population of Manduca sexta, and it will mimic the function of the JH hormone.We will observe whether the independent variable of methoprene present causes a change in their stage of maturity, and will be measured by the independent variable of weight over 7 days. The methoprene inhibits the pupation of the Manduca sexta, causing it to remain in the instar phase. This can be inferred due to previous research that states that if JH levels are low, pupation will commence and vice versa. (Kingsolver, 2007). As a group, we hypothesize that the Manduca sexta group with methoprene added to their diet will have a significant increase in weight compared to the control group, which does not have methoprene. 


Materials and Methods:
While wearing latex-free vinyl gloves, eight Manduca sexta were placed in a weigh boat, each one was weighed individually in grams on a scale. Each Manduca sexta’s weight was recorded on day one. Four Manduca sexta’s were randomly separated from the other four. One was the control group, the other was the treatment group. The control group of four Manduca sexta was then divided into subgroups of two placed into a plastic container with a divider, separating one side from the other. The containers were labeled one through eight. The first four were the control group while the last four were the treated Manduca sexta.  One Manduca sexta was placed on each side of the divider. This was done for both the control and treatment group. Setting the Manduca sexta aside, 80 grams of caterpillar food were collected. The 80 grams were divided into two groups, 40 grams each. In a separate container 40 grams of caterpillar food was prepared for the control group, by adding 20 drops of distilled water.Each drop from the transfer pipet is 0.03 ml. 5 drops will be added to each diet (0.15 mL)  This was mixed thoroughly with a spoon until the water was no longer visible. The other 40 grams were placed in another plastic container but 20 drops of methoprene were added and thoroughly mixed until methoprene was no longer visible.Each Manduca sexta was given 10 grams of their respective food. They were then placed in an incubator for seven days. Every day their weights were recorded and the food was replaced once it appeared that it had dried out throughout the week. To calculate the mean, and other statistical data by doing a one sample t-test.


Results:
From the data collected and after being run through a one sample t-test, the control group mean was 7.65 ±1.19, and the treatment group mean was 8.19±1.19. The treatment group had a slightly higher mean but the same standard deviations. From the one sample t-test, the t-stat=t-stat=-0.629,df=6, P=0.55. The dependent variable is larger than the 95% confidence interval. (P=0.05 or less).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our statistical findings due to our P-value being over the 95% confidence interval of 0.05, meaning that there is no significant difference between the weights of the control and treatment groups. This enables us to accept the null hypothesis and reject our own hypothesis.We expected there to be a drastic weight gain due to the JH mimic, methoprene, altering the growth of the Manduca sexta, and causing them not to pupate.  We accept there was no significant difference between the data from both groups. There possibly could have been very little methoprene to actually affect the growth of the Manduca sexta, due to the finding the JH hormone does affect growth but given in large amounts that exceed 5 micrograms of methoprene.The Manduca sexta from Kingsolver’s experiment that was treated with methoprene on average grew almost 50% percent larger than they normally would.[Kingsolver:2007] None of our Manduca sexta pupated during our experiment, from our an article by Kingsolver, low JH results in pupation, there was not a significant change of weight due to there not being enough methoprene in our Manduca sexta food.[Kingsolver:2007] During the experiment the Manduca sexta food was prepared due to the food becoming dry, there could have been an inaccuracy when the food was being made, and overall impacting the growth of the Manduca sexta. In future experiments with the Manduca sexta, methoprene will be added in at a higher dosage at a higher concentration to see the effects of the substance on the growth of the Manduca sexta. Due to Manduca sexta considered as being a pest, our outcome from our experiment would not be able to hinder the overall full development of the insect. There are multiple factors that contribute to the development of the Manduca sexta such as neural components and hormonal components.[Johnson 2018]

Figure Legends: 
The graph demonstrates the average weights of the Manduca sexta control group and treatment group. The mean for the control group was 7.65 grams, and the mean for the treatment group was 8.19 grams. The error bars demonstrate the standard deviations of both groups. The standard deviation of the control group was 7.65 ±1.19 and the treatment group was 8.19±1.19.

Using a one sample t-test to compare the mean weights of the control and treatment groups, from the data we concluded that mean of the control group and treatment group were different in weight. (t-stat=-0.629,df=6, P=0.55). The dependent variable came out to a P-value greater than the 95% confidence interval (P=0.05 or less).
