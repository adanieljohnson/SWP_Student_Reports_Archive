Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if an small supplement of Juvenile Hormone to the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars would have an effect on their maturation and pupation. We hypothesized that larval pupation would be delayed in a group of caterpillars fed a small supplement of JH in relation to a controll group not fed that supplement. The background for this experiment was based on the knowledge of hormones as signaling molecules as well as the purpose of JH to prevent pupation in m. sexta caterpillars. This experiment collected data from 8 caterpillars weighed and measured every day for a week, 4 of which were fed a normal diet and 4 of which were fed a supplement to their normal diets of Precor (JH). The results of this experiment supported our hypothesis. Visually, the caterpillars in the treatment group resembled those in lower stages for maturation while the controll group had progressed, and the treatment group was, on average, larger than the controll group (P values for weight and length were 0.07 and 0.014 respectively). Also, the P values from the T-Tests were relatively low, suggesting that it is unlikely that those findings were due to something other than the added JH in the treatment group’s diet.  In this experiment, the pupation of m. sexta

was delayed due to the addition of JH to their diets. 

Introduction
Hormones are signaling molecules. They are released from one cell or gland into the bloodstream where they eventually reach their target(s) that they affect in some way. One example of the effect of hormones in humans is puberty where hormones cause growth and development. In Manduca sexta caterpillars, JH is a hormone that inhibits the maturation into adulthood by delaying pupation. It is explained in one study as JH is a hormone that responds to levels of Ecdysterone to decide what progression occurs at the time of molting (Truman, 2002). Some people are now asking about the use of these hormones in commercial uses in the form of pesticides. Our question involves the amount of JH that will have an effect on the timing of pupation, but in m. sexta caterpillars. We will have a controll group, fed a normal diet, and an experimental group that will be fed a small supplement (12 drops per forty grams of food) of JH to see if this amount will still delay pupation. We hypothesize that larval pupation will be delayed in the m. sexta caterpillars fed the diet with the 3 drop supplement of JH per 10 grams of food. 

Materials and Method:
We first obtained 80 grams of normal food for m. sexta caterpillars and split it into two equal portions of approximately 40 grams each for the controll and treatment groups. We then added 12 drops of water to the controll group’s 40 grams of food and 12 drops of Precor to the treatment group’s food and stirred the food. After that, we selected 8 manduca sexta caterpillars and weighed and measured the length of each of them. We then put them in separate rearing tubes formed by placing and taping a notecard into the middle of each container, so that two caterpillars could fit in each container. At this point we labelled each container with our initials, lab group and caterpillar number and group (controll or treatment). We gave each caterpillar 10 grams of its diet (controll with no added JH or treatment with added JH in the form of Precor). Throughout the week, we kept all the caterpillars in an incubator so they were exposed to the same environmental conditions and we weighed and measured each of them every day (for a total of 8 days) feeding them as needed (3 times total). The Precor that was used was a 1: 1250 dilution. We recorded visual observations as the week progressed and, after all of the data was collected we performed a 2 sample T-Test for the average length and weight of the controll and treatment groups. 

Results:
The values of the two-sample t_test performed generated values for both weight and length. For weight, the mean was 3.7, degrees of freedom were 7, t stat was -2.11, and p value was 0.07. For length, the mean was 5.6, degrees of freedom were 7, t stat was -3, and p value was 0.014. Throughout the week, caterpillar number 3 in the controll group was smaller than all the others. In addition, the caterpillars in the treatment group did not have the black markings on the back Aside from caterpillar number 3, the caterpillars all gained weight and length throughout the week, with the treatment group gaining weight and height faster than the controll group and ending up larger and longer at the end of the week. 

Discussion:
In this experiment, the added JH in the form of Precor in the diet of the m. sexta caterpillars, did appear to delay or slow down the pupation of the caterpillars in the treatment group. This conclusion is based on the P values from the T-Tests for length and weight. The P value for length is approximately 0.01 and for weight is 0.07. That means that there is less than a 1.4% chance that the results showing that the length of the caterpillars changed due to the addition of JH in the diet were caused by chance. For weight, there is a strong correlation, based on the slightly higher P value and so it is 7.3% likely that the results for weight are representative of changes caused by JH and not because of chance. This, according to Truman’s article, suggests that, because our hypothesis is supported by the data collected and is likely due to the addition of JH to the diets of the treatment caterpillars, that change is likely correlated to a change in the timing of metamorphosis, specifically with JH hormone, pupation. In addition, the treatment caterpillars were larger than the controll group and they did not have the black markings on their backs. These points indicate that the treatment group of caterpillars stayed in 1st or 2nd instar phases, only growing larger while the controll group began to progress on to further maturation (2002). JH decides whether a larva progresses into another instar phase or if they will pupate. Because these results show elevated JH, the caterpillars, with the elevated JH, would not have matured further and pupated, but would just develop into another instar. Our only issue with data involved caterpillar number 3 in the controll group. It is considered an outlier as there was obviously something wrong with its health upon observation. It was not eating and so was not developing, skewing the data slightly. The other caterpillars in the controll group did, however, support our hypothesis.
