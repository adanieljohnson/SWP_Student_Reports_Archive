Title: The Effects of Caffeine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Calcium is a necessary iown for contractile mechanism and allows the actin to slide through the myosin filaments. Caffeine is a chemical that blocks the reuptake of calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, interfering with the normal muscle contraction mechanism. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that injecting caffeine directly into the gastrocnemius muscle will result in uncontrollable contractions of the muscle. To test this hypothesis, myograms were recorded for three gastrocnemius muscles of Rana pipiens before and after injecting 0.1 mL of caffeine. The three tested muscles experienced chemically induced tetany after the injection of caffeine. Under these conditions the muscles showed uncontrollable contractions without relaxation periods. These results support the hypothesis that caffeine will interfere with normal pattern of muscle contraction.

Introduction:
In both vertebrates and invertebrate’s skeletal muscles consist of thousands of myofibers. Myofibers are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. These individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissue forming functional groups. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into the muscles and stimulate several individual myofibers, at points called the neuromuscular junctions. A process known as excitation-contracting coupling allows the nerves to stimulate muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. This process allows an action potential to reach the neuromuscular junction and acetylcholine neurotransmitter is released into the muscle fibers. The acetylcholine binds to the receptors in the muscle fibers and this causes of an opening of sodium channels. The influx of sodium ions causes a second action potential in the muscle and this depolarization stimulates the release of calcium, allowing the muscles to contract with the use of ATP. Since it is difficult to record the contraction of a single myofiber, a myogram could be recorded to monitor what is happening at the macroscopic level of the entire muscle. Within a single muscle twitch, a myogram has three different stages. The first stage is the latent stage, the time of the start of stimulation till contraction begins. The second stage is the contraction phase, where contraction begins and reaches its peak. The last stage is the relaxation phase, the part where the contraction phase goes back down to a relaxed state. Both the second and third stages lengths differ between various muscles [Johnson: 2018].
Caffeine is a chemical that blocks the reuptake of calcium to the sarcoplasmic reticulum leading to continuous contraction [Konishi & Kurihara: 1987]. It was hypothesized that injecting caffeine directly into the gastrocnemius muscle will cause uncontrollable contractions of the muscle.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs from Rana pipiens were collected and placed on a dissecting pan. The skin of each frog leg was removed to expose the gastrocnemius muscle. Then, the gastrocnemius muscle was suspended from a transducer and the other parts of the leg were pinned in place on the dissecting pan. The exposed frog muscle was kept moist by continuously pouring Ringer’s solution on the leg. Myograms were recorded by attaching the muscle to a force transducer and then we can record the force generated over time. Three myograms from each leg were recorded for the control condition with no caffeine injected and for the treatment condition after the injection of 0.1 mL of caffeine. Data were recorded from the computer program, LabScribe. 

Results:
The three tested gastrocnemius muscles showed a normal temporal pattern of contraction followed by a relaxation period before the treatment was applied. Once the frog muscles were injected with caffeine, a significant increase in the amplitude of contraction was observed (t-stat= 10.657, p value= 0.009) (Figure 1). Overall, all of the tested frog legs experienced chemically induced tetany after caffeine injection.

Discussion:
The results obtained in the personal study supported our hypothesis. The three tested muscles experienced chemically induced tetany after injection of caffeine. This possibly occurs because the injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscles affects the reuptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing the cytoplasm concentration of calcium and consequently leading to an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle [Konishi & Kurihara: 1987]. In a previous study, caffeine was used to induce tetany in the soleus bundle of a rat. [Fryer: 1988]. They found similar results to ours when looking at the force of contraction. The force increased significantly at higher doses of caffeine.
