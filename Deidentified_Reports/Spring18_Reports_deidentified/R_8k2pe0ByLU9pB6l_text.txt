Title: The Effects of Increased Juvenile Hormone Concentration on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of synthetic Juvenile Hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca sexta caterpillar’s development. We tested two different groups using the synthetic chemical Martin’s IGR on the treatment group and distilled water with caterpillar food for the control group to see how the development of the caterpillars would vary. We then observed and recorded the results of our experiment over the time span of a week. Our results indicate that the average mass of the control group was higher than that of the treatment group. Thus, indicating that our null hypothesis was rejected and using a two-tailed p test and a t-value, it became evident that the results of our experiment were statistically significant. Looking back entirely on the experiment, our data was interpreted to show that because of such a high dose of Martin’s IGR, it caused the treatment group caterpillars to be significantly underdeveloped compared to the control group. 


Introduction:
A typical life-cycle of a Manduca sexta Caterpillar is 39-48 days long. During this period, they will develop and molt to eventually become moths. Before pupating, they will undergo usually 5 developmental stages, or instars. The two hormones involved in this transition are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysome (E-20). In our lab specifically, we are going to only focus on JH, as it controls the type of molt the caterpillar undergoes. For a caterpillar to undergo a commitment pulse (the period before they pupate and after the 5th instar period) the JH hormone must remain at a low, constant concentration with a spike in E-20 concentration [Johnson, 11-12]. Systematically increasing the treatment groups concentration of JH by feeding them high doses of it in their food is how we measured the effects of this hormone on these caterpillars. Because the Juvenile Hormone is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, it becomes a vital ingredient in seeing how its functions vary among species. Looking at a similar study focusing on Juvenile Hormones, this article analyzed the differences in JH concentrations in a variety of species, rather than focusing microscopically on an individual animal. This different perspective made it possible to target the hormone’s locations throughout an organism and then extract the hormone from a variety of species and in different anatomical locations of the animal [Gilbert, Schneiderman: 1960]. With further investigation, the study then was able to determine further functionalities of the hormone and how they may be used for each species benefit. While this specific study was more surgical and over a broader range of animals, it still illustrated the importance of this hormone in pupation (insects) and even in vertebrate’s developmental time periods: which then further enhances the importance of concentrations of hormones needed for optimal development and how too much can be harmful.  
Knowing all of this, we hypothesize that if there is no constant reduction of JH, the caterpillars will never pupate into moths because the JH concentration will be too high: they will continue to molt into 6th and 7th instar caterpillars.


Materials and Methods:
Split up 8 Manduca sexta Caterpillars into 4 groups of 2. There will be 4 caterpillars that will be designated the control group and 4 caterpillars that will be designated the treatment group. Each caterpillar will be fed everyday 10 grams of caterpillar food (80 grams of food total). The control group will have their food mixed with 40 droplets of distilled water and the treatment group will have their food mixed with 40 droplets of Martin’s IGR chemical. Every day, these caterpillars must be fed with the same amount and same food solutions. After each time they are fed, weigh each caterpillar and record weight into data table. Record any precarious observations or take note of any significant differences. Analyze the data collected and run a two-tailed p test and calculate a t-value to determine statistical significance. 


Results:
Our data was collected over a period of a full week. We measured the weight of each caterpillar and recorded the data in a table. When looking specifically at the difference between average masses between our control group versus our treatment groups, the masses of our control group were higher than those of our treatment. This can be seen when looking at the average mass of the control group which was approx. 4.955 grams and the treatment group which had an average mass of approx. 3.358 grams (Figure 2). Along with this, there was discoloration in the treatment groups, as they were significantly paler than the control groups. As far as the statistical significance went for this lab, we calculated a two-tailed p-value of 0.0247 and our t-value was 2.9775. The standard deviation for each group is shown as well in each column represented by the error bars. These statistics indicate that our null hypothesis of seeing no significant difference in mass between the two caterpillars was there for rejected. 


Discussion:
Our null hypothesis was indeed rejected, showing that there in fact was an observable and significant difference in masses of the two groups of caterpillars. The first observation that was seen was the reduced growth in the caterpillars in the treatment groups. This appears to be due to the inhibitor of JH which was fed to the treatment groups. Rather than molting into the 6th and 7th instars like we hypothesized, the caterpillars in the treatment group looked malnourished and weighed less than the control group [Johnson, 2018]. Even though the caterpillars were fed the exact same amount of food each day, the treatment group grew much larger and were much more developed. This could be because such a high dose of any hormone to an animal can be detrimental to the life of said animal. The high dose of the chemical Martin’s IGR didn’t keep them molting into further instars, but rather just overloaded the caterpillar with the hormone JH, causing reduction in growth and development that was observed.
When comparing our lab design to others outside of the class, it can be seen that there were similarities in results with ours in other’s labs regarding JH in Manduca Caterpillars. One thing that was noticed was that the color in the treatment groups was a lighter pigment of green and they were paler. This could be due to the Martin IGR chemical used which is a chemical in many common pesticides. By feeding them this highly concentrated dosage, it can be seen that the JH hormone not only affects the growth and development, but also the color pigmentation of the caterpillars. This was further proven as I was looking into other evidence to support this claim. In a study working with the same chemicals, it describes the similar effects that we observed in our lab [Truman, Riddiford, Safranek: 1973]. In the article, it talks about how the color change in caterpillars is largely due to endocrine responses that are inhibited by chemicals (such as Martin’s IGR used here). These responses are producing an insufficient amount of melanin, a hormone which controls skin pigment in most animals. Because of an overloading of the hormone JH, it causes the caterpillar to stay in an underdeveloped state and after severe deformity, will ultimately lead to death. This is yet another subtle observation worth noting that can be seen when the concentration of Juvenile Hormone was increased. This allows for us to make the general conclusion that hormones intended for one function frequently alter other aspects of an animal’s life: in this case, color deficiency. Knowing how this chemical works on animals considered “pests”, like Manduca sexta Caterpillars, we can further examine ways to either get rid of them, or keep them in a stage where they are no longer considered a problem.
