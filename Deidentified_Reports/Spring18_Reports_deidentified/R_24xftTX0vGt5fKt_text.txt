Title: The effects of Azagaurd on Growth Hormones in Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab was to observe the effects of Azaguard, an insecticide, on the growth and molt of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Azaguard interferes with an insect’s ability to molt. It was hypothesized that if Azaguard is fed to the caterpillars, they will weigh less. Four caterpillars were fed a regular wheat-germ-based diet while four other caterpillars were fed the same food mixed with Azaguard. The caterpillars were monitored daily. Each day the untreated caterpillars weighed more than the treated caterpillars. The results were found to be statistically significant with the p value being 0.0385. The Azaguard inhibits the molt of the caterpillar so that it can not reproduce and continue to be a pest. 

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators (IGR) affect certain psychological processes involved in the development of insects. IGRs are not toxic and many synthetic versions have been made. They can potentially either interfere with or over-activate certain regulatory processes involving hormones. This lab studied a Manduca sexta caterpillar. This organisms are often studied in the lab because of their short life cycle, large size, and ease of rearing (Villanueva 1998).  The purpose of this lab was to observe the effects of Azaguard, an insecticide, on the growth and molt of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. Azaguard is an insect growth regulator that prevents molting between larval, pupal and, nymphal stages by increasing the amount of juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone, made in the corpus allatum of the brain is secreted to control an insect’s type of molt, or shedding of their skin to allow for growth. The purpose of this experiment was to see the effect of Azaguard on the weight of a Manduca sexta caterpillar. A t-test was used to indicate whether or not these results were statistically significant, meaning that it indicates whether or not Azaguard has an effect or if occured by chance. It was hypothesized that if Azaguard is fed to the caterpillars, they will weigh  less. The dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillars and the independent variable was the amount of azaguard added. 

Materials and Methods:
Obtain four plastic containers with a lid. Tape an index card across the center to act as a barrier between the two sides of the container. Label the containers groups 1-4. Label one side control and the other treatment. The control group was fed a normal 10g diet of wheat-germ-based food. 10g of food was placed in each container on the control side. 10 drops of 1: 1250 concentrated Azaguard was added to 10g of food. 10g of this treatment diet was placed in each of the four containers on the treatment side. Obtain 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and place one in each side of the containers. Place lids on containers and put in a temperature controlling unit. The caterpillars were monitored daily for 7 days. They were weighed each day to monitor growth.  A two sample t-test was used to analyze the results of weight of caterpillars. 

Results:
The average weight each day for both the control and treatment groups is shown above. Starting at day 3 there begins to be a larger difference between the two groups. Over the course of the week that difference grows larger and larger. The average weight of the treatment caterpillars begins to decrease starting at day 5.  The average weight of the control was found to be 2.68g and the average weight of the treatment group was found to be 1.48g. The mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.32, df = 12, P = 0.0385).  

Discussion:
The results supported the hypothesis that if Azaguard is fed to caterpillars they will weigh less.  On each day the average weight of the untreated caterpillars was greater than the average weight of the treated caterpillars. Because the results are statistically significant, this means that the Azraguard did have an effect on the caterpillar’s growth that was not just due to randomness. Azaguard works by interfering with an insects ability to molt. The results gathered indicate that consumption of Azaguard inhibit growth of the insect. This would not enable them to reproduce which would alleviate the spread of these pests in a garden.  If the experiment was to be reproduced, researches should obtain similar results.
