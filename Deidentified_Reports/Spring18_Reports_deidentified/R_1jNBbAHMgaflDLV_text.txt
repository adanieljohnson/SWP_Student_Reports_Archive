Title: The effects of caffeine and IBMX on the aggregation and growth Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate slime mold that has the capacity to react to detrimental external conditions, and both move or aggregate in new areas. This process is potentially mediated by extracellular cAMP signaling for the activation of adenylate cyclase and then the consequent degradation of cAMP by phosphodiesterase, given the role it plays in similar slime molds. Physarum polycephalum were placed in a water agar plate that had been coated in caffeine and IBMX, and their area of growth over thirty-six hours was compared to that of P. polycephalum in a purely water based agar environment. It was hypothesized that the addition of IBMX and caffeine would cause an increase in aggregation and a decrease in outward growth. The area of growth was not significently different between the controll and experimental groups. The difference in growth was potentially ascribed to the attempt at aggregation between the two organisms placed in the agar, or that if the cAMP pathway was constantly on there would be a greater need for food sources for energy. It is hoped this experiment may be expanded over a greater time period and with systematic administrations of the caffeine and IBMX solution, in the hopes of understanding further this cellular pathway and organism.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate slime mold that undergoes simultaneous mitosis across all of its nuclei within the cytoplasm of a singular cell membrane. This species is heavily observed for its pronounced responses to the environment, its mobility, and its cell transduction pathways that are similar to that of human eukaryotic cells. With respect to its movement, the P. polycephalum moves by contracting cross sectional tubules across the leading portion of its cell membrane in the direction of desired movement, specifically at a rate similar to that of general particulate dispersion [Alim: 2017]. In the presence of an external stressor, such as food depletion or light, the organism will break apart into numerous swarm cells that may be carried to more favorable locations and then aggregate into a singular slime mold [Reid: 2016]. This aggregation has been shown to be the result of the release of cyclic AMP from the starved or endangered swarm cells, triggering the cAMP pathway of neighboring cells [Shaffer: 1975]. This pathway involves a G-protein coupled receptor transducing the extracellular signal, triggering the activation of the enzyme adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase produces the secondary messenger of cyclic AMP within the cytoplasm, which is used by effectors such as phosphokinase A, to phosphorylate transcription factors and enzymes. In order to not cause a sustained reaction, phosphodiesterase will actively degrade the cAMP towards normal levels [Boswell: 2006]. In another study, the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum showed high levels of cAMP secreted during the aggregation and fruiting body phases of its life cycle [Schapp: 2014]. For Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP targets via phosphorylation a number of protein kinases, including protein kinase A-C, which causes for full gene expression for the production of the extracellular cAMP receptor cAR1, cAMP phosphodiesterase, and adenylate cyclase A [Schapp: 2014]. These in conjunction cause a relay of cAMP pulses through the cell, cause a chemotaxis for other cells, and initiates the gene expression of aggregation genes [Schapp: 2014]. Similar observations were made in a later study for Dictyostelium minutum, in the role of cAMP pulse excretions being the cause of chemotactic movement towards other D. minutum [Schaap: 1984].As mentioned above, the striking similarities in the signaling mechanism for the P. polycephalum to more complex eukaryotic cells, allows for the examination of the effects of various cellular functions on a more manageable scale. Through the examination of caffeine and IBMX as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, the role that cAMP plays in the growth and aggregation of slime molds can be examined. Caffeine and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine(IBMX) have both been seen to inhibit phosphodiesterase activity, which would thus create more free cAMP in the cytoplasm of the cell at any given time. This could then be applied to the manner in which these molecules would effect the cAMP dependent pathways on more complex organisms. It was hypothesized that if Physarum polycephalum was transplanted into an environment that was saturated in caffeine and IBMX, the inhibition of the degradation of cAMP would cause increased aggregation locally and decrease growth outwards. This means that the P. physarum would not expand outwards in search of other stimuli, but rather continue to make one mass of organism on its original cube. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment required six water agar plates, marked along the middle of the back of the plate with a black line and two roughly one centimeter squares. From each of these squares, the corresponding water agar was cut and removed to give to open spaces in each plate, using a spatula that was sterilized in an ethanol bath and then flame dried. Three of the plates were to serve as a controll while the other three were to be experimental trials. The three controll plates had just enough (approximately 5Ml) deionized water applied to submerge the surface of the agar plate. The three experimental plates had a mixture of a 1:20 dilution of 20mM IBMX and 100mM caffeine in deionized water applied in the same manner. The plates were allowed to sit for ten minutes prior to inverting the dish. Any excess moisture was removed, as any excess moisture may cause the inhibition of growth for the organism. From a prepared stock Physarum polycephalum agar plate, twelve one-centimeter squares of slime mold were cut using a sterilized spatula. The Physarum polycephalum stock plate was made by transplanting two cubes of grown P. polycephalum from a previous plate, into a water agar plate with oatmeal flakes, and allowing them to grow in darkness in an incubator. Using sterilized forceps, each of these cubes were placed in the holes that were cut in the experimental and controll plates. To each of these added cubes, a piece of oatmeal was placed directly atop the specimen. The plates were then sealed with tape, the time was denoted, and the plates were wrapped in labeled aluminum foil. These plates were placed in the incubator. At twelve hour increments, the plates were removed from the incubator and photographed. Using J Image, the growth and aggregation were measured through an analysis of pixels of the photo. The results of this experiment were analyzed using a two-tailed t_test, examining the area of growth of the slime molds.



Results:
The results of this experiment can be seen in Figure One. The controll plates had a mean growth of area covered of 50.173 +/- 70.297 mm^2. The experimental plates that had been treated with caffeine and IBMX had a mean growth of overall area of 193.59 +/- 203.065 mm^2. The controll and experimental trials were shown to not be significently different (t(4)= 2.776445, p=0.312035.)

Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support our hypothesis that the addition of caffeine and IBMX to the Physarum polycephalum environment would cause an increase in aggregation and a decrease in growth. The mean values for the controll and experimental groups were found to not be significently different, and thus the null hypothesis was not rejected. Although there was no significent difference, the mean growth of the slime mold for the plates treated with the phosphodiesterase was greater than that of the controll group. Potentially, as cAMP is not being degraded in the cell, it’s constantly signaling down its pathways [Martinez: 2014]. This can be seen in a study done on human diseases, where cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors proved helpful in allowing for more cellular activity in sick individuals, allowing for increased cellular response to pathogens [Martinez: 2014]. In a similar sense for the P. polycephalum PKA-C may be constantly activated, allowing for continuous gene expression of the aggregation genes such as discoidin [Schaap: 1984]. Thus, the increase in energy production means that the need for a food source was more rapidly discovered. In conjunction with that, the physical growth of the strands themselves were different in their direction. The one controll plate that grew, grew directly outwards towards the wall, while the two experimental trials that grew were in the general direction of the neighboring Physarum polycephalum blocks. This to some extent could be attributed to the concept of extracellular cAMP production causing the P. polycephalum to attempt to aggregate. As there was a reduction of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibition, there would have been more cAMP that could have been released. This signals for cells to aggregate in response to a detrimental environment. A study found that the addition of caffeine and its inhibitory effects on cAMP phosphodiesterase of Dictyostelium discoideum caused overall smaller aggregation sizes and slower cellular growth [Jaiswal: 2018]. This could explain that the cells did not centrally aggregate in large clumps but rather grew outwards.  There were definitely sources of error in this experiment. Initially it can be observed that each Physarum polycephalum was not uniform across all the blocks added to the plates. This creates a situation where some cells start with a greater number of nuclei to replicate of or greater initial resources. Thus some cells can tend to grow faster or aggregate to a greater extent over the time period. This could be fixed through either microscopic observation to find similar pieces of P. polycephalum, or by cutting the transplanted pieces from similar areas or strands of the initial stock species. In the addition of the treatment or controll saturation, there is a potential for excess moisture being left on the plate, causing the numerous plates with no growth at all. Included in this idea is that the drying with a kimwipe could have removed some of the treatment, thus reducing its effect on the experimental set up. For further investigation, the Physarum polycephalum should be administered the caffeine and IBMX in a different manner as well as over a longer period of time. With respect to the administration of the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, by reapplying the treatment at each time interval would guarantee some longevity to the hopeful effects of the treatment. With this, observing the plates over a longer period would allow for more growth and hopefully more indicative behavior of some trend or tendency.  Through further investigation the caffeine and IBMX treatment, other variables may be tested in their interaction with them, such as temperature, concentration, or competition with other inhibitors. This research would yield a greater understanding of how different drugs that interact with the cAMP pathway can effect various properties of plasmodia and other simple organism. This can then be applied to looking at more effective ways of stopping the spread of dangerous organisms that may be detrimental to human health or to reduce their efficacy in the body.
