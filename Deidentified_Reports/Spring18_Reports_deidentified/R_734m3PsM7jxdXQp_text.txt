Title: The effect of juvenile hormone on larval Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This study investigates the role of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the life cycle of a Manduca sexta by testing the effects of adding excess JH to the food of larval Manduca sexta.  We hypothesize that if larval Manduca sexta were fed methoprene, brand name Precor, then they would fail to pupate and therefore continue to molt into additional larval instar stages.  To test this hypothesis eight caterpillars were separated into two group, control and treatment.  The treatment group was fed food with added methoprene whereas the control was fed food containing no methoprene.  They were weighed for 8 days and their weights were recorded.  It was concluded that the treatment group larva grew much slower than the larva in the control.  However, the hypothesis could not be supported because the null hypothesis could not be proven false.  The caterpillars did not have time to pupate and, therefore, it could not be concluded whether or not the Juvenile Hormone prevented the treatment from pupating.

Introduction:
The insect, Manduca sexta, is part of the Lepidoptera order which includes skippers, butterflies, 
and moths [Johnson: 2016].  The Manduca sexta begins as an egg, transitions to a larva where it typically has five instar stages, then becomes a pupa, and eventually an adult [Johnson: 2016].  The timed lifecycle of a Manduca sexta makes it an ideal organism to test when the role of hormones is in question. The timing of the lifecycle of Manduca sexta is regulated by a hormone secreted by the Prothoracic Gland, Ecdysterone (20E).  Whereas, the type of molt, what the insect will become, is regulated by Juvenile Hormone (JH) produced by the Corpus Allata [Johnson: 2016].  When the Manduca sexta weighs about five grams, there is a rise in Ecdysterone and a drop in Juvenile Hormone levels [Nijhout: 1974].  This is known as the commitment pulse and indicates that the caterpillar is ready to pupate [Johnson: 2016]. This experiment tests the effect feeding methoprene, the Juvenile Hormone found in blue floss-flower, has on the weight of Manduca sexta.  Discovering the effects of excess Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta will further explain the role of JH in the lifecycle of many different insects.  We hypothesize that if larval Manduca sexta were fed methoprene than they would fail to pupate and therefore continue to molt into larger larval instar stages.


Materials and Methods:
To carry out the experiment eight Manduca sexta were separated into four different containers, each container separated in two.  Four caterpillars were assigned to the control group and four were assigned to the treatment group.  The caterpillars were weighed prior to the experiment and their weights were recorded.  Forty grams of food was then massed for the control group and twelve drops of distilled water was added to the food.  The food was separated into four different portions of equal size and fed to each of the caterpillars in the control group.  Another forty grams of food was massed for the treatment group and twelve drops of Precor, a type of Methoprene, was added to the food.  The Precor mixture added was 2 drops Precor to 48 drops water.  Once again, the food was separated into four different portions of equal size and fed to each of the caterpillars in the treatment group.  The caterpillars were kept in an incubator to control their environment.  Each day for seven days, the caterpillars’ weights were massed and recorded.  On days one, four, and six the food appeared dry and was replaced by newly mixed food.  On day eight, the caterpillars were disposed of properly so as to avoid harming the environment.  After sufficient data was collected, the weights of the control group and treatment group were compared using a two sample T-test.  


Results:
Overall, the data collected during the experiment shows that the Manduca sexta caterpillars in the control group grew faster than the caterpillars in the treatment group.  In addition, it was observed that, during the first three days of feeding, there was a minimal change in weight of caterpillars in both the control and treatment groups.  On the fourth day of feeding the majority of caterpillars in both groups began to show more significant weight gain.  However, the larva in the treatment group continued to grow more significantly.

After performing a two-sample t-test using the averages and standard deviations of the weights of both the control and treatment groups, it was determined that the t-value is 2.23172 and the p-value of the results is 0.067107.  Because the p-value is greater than 0.05 or 5% it is concluded that the data is not significantly different, and there is no difference between the means.  This means that the data collected during the experiment does not allow the hull hypothesis to be rejected. 


Discussion:
Overall, our results did not support our hypothesis because the null hypothesis could not be rejected.  The experiment was not long enough to receive statistically significant results.  The Manduca sexta larva used in the experiment were not in the 5th instar stage when the experiment began.  Therefore, they did not have time to pupate during the eight-day experiment.  However, based on a study completed by Nijhout and Williams, had the caterpillars weighed around five grams and been in the fifth instar stage when the experiment began, the treatment caterpillars would have continued to grow and the control caterpillars would have pupated around the fifth day of the experiment [Nijhout: 1974]. 
If this experiment were to be completed again, at the start of the experiment the caterpillars should have all weighed around five grams and been in the fifth instar stage, about four to five days away from pupation.  The experimenter should pay close attention to the outer appearance of the caterpillar to observe weather or not the larva has pupated.  When the control caterpillars pupate, that Juvenile Hormone levels have dropped and the Prothoracic Gland has released Ecdystrone [Nijhout: 1974].  Because the treatment caterpillars would be receiving excess Juvenile Hormone, they would not experience a drop in JH or a rise in Ecdysterone and they would not pupate [Nijhout: 1974].  This experiment is applicable today because if it were continued for a longer period of time it could prove whether or not methoprene would serve as a good insecticide.

Figure Legends: 
Table 1. shows the average weights of the Manduca sexta in the control and treatment groups each day of the experiment.  The difference between the average weight of the treatment group from day 1 to day 8 is 5.73g.  Whereas, the difference between the average weight of the control group from day 1 and day 8 is 9.28g.  This shows that the control group grew faster than the treatment group. 

Figure 1.  This graph represents the average weight gain of the control and treatment  groups.  It is clear by looking at this bar graph that the control group had a more significant change in weight.  The error bars represent the standard deviation, how far the data deviates from the mean, of each group.
