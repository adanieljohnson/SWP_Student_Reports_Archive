Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on the Growth and Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
In this lab, we investigated the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth and development of Manduca sexta, or otherwise known as tobacco hornworms. More specifically, we focused on discovering the effects of this growth regulator on the life cycle of the M. sexta. Ecdysone is an important developmental hormone found in a vast number of insects; therefore, to exaime the role of ecdysone in insects, we raised eight hornworms and treated their food source with Martin’s IGR (Insect Growth Regulator). Four of the hornworms were a part of the experimental group so their food was treated with Martin’s IGR, while the other four hornworms consumed normal food without the growth regulator. We observed these hornworms for a week and recorded their masses and lengths daily. We hypothesized that the hornworms being fed the treated diet would grow less in mass and length when compared to the hornworms being fed the normal hornworm diet. A two-tailed T-test revealed that Martin’s IGR does have a significant impact on the growth of M. sextas. Therefore, from this experiment we determined that Martin’s IGR blocks the activity of the juvenile hormone in the development of insects. 



Introduction:
Manduca sexta, otherwise known as tobacco hornworms, are large greenish-blue caterpillars that have a development cycle of 39 to 48 days. These caterpillars form from eggs and then go through a series of five larval stages before they reach pupation. In the pupal stage, the caterpillars spend about three weeks. After the pupal stage, the caterpillars then become an adult and turn into moths. During these different stages the life cycle, hormones found within the caterpillar are responsible for triggering the next stage of development. More specifically, for the M. sexta, the major hormones that trigger the stages of development are prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Johnson : 2018]. Therefore, if these hormones were to be inhibited or disrupted within the life cycle, it may hinder the caterpillar’s ability to reach the next stage of development. In this lab, we focused on investigating how Martin’s IGR can affect the activity of ecdysterone and juvenile hormone within the caterpillar’s life cycle. The many different types of insect growth regulators (IGR) are seen as safe alternatives to common organic pesticides [Staal : 1975]. These insect growth regulators can disrupt the major stages of development which include the end of the fourth stage of the larvae life span, the commitment pulse, and the pupal stage. Ultimately, altering the activity of these hormones within the caterpillar’s life span will tremendously impact their ability to develop and sustain life. From exploring the role of these hormones in M. sextas, we hypothesized that if caterpillars were given Martin’s IGR through their food source, then their growth would be inhibited and they would generate lower average masses and lengths than caterpillars being feed a standard tobacco hornworm diet. 



Materials and Methods:
To initiate this experiment, we obtained eight Manduca sexta larvae that were all relatively the same size. We acquired 4 caterpillars that were about 4.5 centimenters in length, and 4 caterpillars that were about 4 centimeters in length. We also determined that all of the caterpillars were also similar in weight, measured in grams. Once we chose the caterpillars, we divided them into an experimental group and a control group. For the experimental group, we placed two 4 centimeter caterpillars and two 4.5 centimeter caterpillars. For the control group, we also placed two 4 centimeter caterpillars and two 4.5 centimeter caterpillars. Then we obtained 4 plastic containers and placed a paper divider in the middle of each container to divide the caterpillars. Two containers were labeled experimental and the other two were labeled control. The caterpillars were placed in their containers according to their assigned groups and their food was prepared. Each caterpillar obtained 10 grams of caterpillar food. For the caterpillars in the control group, their food was mixed with 5 drops of water each. For the caterpillars in the experimental group, their food was mixed with 5 drops of Martin’s IGR each. The caterpillars were then left to be observed daily for a week straight. If food ran out, new food was supplied to the caterpillars. At the end of the observation week, the caterpillars were measured and weighed and the raw data was analyzed using two different two-tailed T-tests. 



Results:
Our data revealed that the average weight of the control group of M. sexta was 8.350.435 grams. The average weight of the Martin’s IGR experimental group of M. sexta was 7.10.87 grams (See Figure 2). The average length of the control group of M. sexta was 3.180.63 centimeters. The average weight of the Martin’s IGR experimental group of M. sexta was 3.00.41 centimeters (See Figure 1). A two-tailed T-test was used to analyze the weight and length differences individually. The two-tailed T-test for the weight differences revealed a significant difference (t=2.54, df=6, p=.044). The two-tailed T-test for the length differences did not reveal a significant difference (t=.333, df=6, p=.75).  

Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment, we discovered that Martin’s IGR did effect the ability of the Manduca sexta to gain weight, but it did not affect the caterpillars’ ability to grow in length. Our results supported the first part of our hypothesis, which predicted that the average weight of the experimental caterpillars would decrease. For the second part of our hypothesis, we predicted that the average length of the experimental caterpillars would decrease, but we did not find a significant difference between the two groups so that part of the hypothesis could not be supported. Although our experiment was carried out fairly successfully, there was possible room for error. For example, when some of the caterpillars chewed through the paper barrier. Therefore, the experiment could’ve been more successful if the barriers between the caterpillars were created with a more durable material. In addition to this, when we tried to measure the length of the caterpillars most of the caterpillars would try to curl up in order to defend themselves, and it would lead to inaccurate measurements of length. Another observation we made was the discoloration of the caterpillars in the experimental Martin’s IGR group. We observed that the experimental group generated a pale pigment (See Figure 3). This observation led us to believe that there were intrinsic effects occurring in the caterpillars in addition to the alteration of hormones in the caterpillars. A similar study investigated the effects of the insecticide bistrifluron on the life stages of cotton caterpillars [Kim : 2007]. Although the larvae in this study experience a hundred percent mortality within the first 24 hours, the caterpillars revealed development altercations at each larval stage just like the caterpillars within our study. Ultimately, our study revealed that Martin’s IGR does, indeed, carry a negative impact on the caterpillar’s ability to grow and sustain life. Since tobacco hornworms are considered to be pests as larvae, Martin’s IGR is ineffective in terms of getting rid of a pest because it keeps the caterpillars in the larvae stage. Overall, this experiment revealed that insect growth regulators can, indeed, inhibit the developmental stages of an insect’s life cycle by interfering with their natural hormones.
