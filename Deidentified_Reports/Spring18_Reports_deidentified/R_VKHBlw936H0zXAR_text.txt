Title: The negative effect of the introduction of food on time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior of Betta splendens

Abstract:
The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), commonly known as the betta, originated from Southeast Asia. In the presence of other males, the betta fish tend to flare their fills and finds and change color. Their intraspecific behaviors include two main types of movements: broadside movement and facing movements. Our experiment measured how the presence of food would distract the fish and affect their aggressive behavior. Our hypothesis was that the introduction of food would decrease the amount aggressive behavior displayed by the betta fish. To test this, we were assigned two male Betta splendens (Fish 1/Red and Fish 2/Blue) of similar size and we placed them in a fish tank separated by a sheet of glass. We then measured how long each fish exhibited aggressive behavior, either front-facing or broadside agonistic behavior. When no food was introduced into the fish tank, both fish exhibited considerably more aggressive behavior on average , 29 +/- 16.5 sec (Red) and 41.3 +/- 24.2 sec (Blue), compared to the 5.67 +/- 8.96 sec (Red) and 2.67 +/- 2.31 sec (Blue) of aggressive behavior when there was food present in the tank (Figure 1, Figure 2). However, both of these data sets are statistically insignificant because of the p-values for both fish being much larger than our alpha ...

Introduction:

The study of animal behavior, or ethology, combines observational skills from natural history, laboratory methods, and insights and theories from ecology, genetics and evolutionary biologists. Understanding physiological purposes of certain behaviors can give use ideas of how they may have been shaped by natural selection and evolution. The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), commonly known as the betta, originated from Southeast Asia. In the presence of other males, the betta fish tend to flare their fills and finds and change color. Previous experiments have been run to study their patterns of visual communication.  This regulates social interactions, specifically those associated with aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition. The betta was used as a model organism because their behavior in the presence of other members of their own species (intraspecific behavior). They are also a popular fish in the aquarium trade. Their intraspecific behaviors include two main types of movements: broadside movement and facing movements. Ethologists often refer to these aggressive behaviors as agonistic behaviors. The betta fish can either ignore the other’s agonistic behavior, match it, flee it, or submit. The betta fish’s responses to the threat can decrease over time due to habituation, which can be defined as the decline of a response to a constant stimulus. We decided to create an experiment that measured how the presence of food would distract the fish and affect their aggressive behavior. Another part of the betta fish behavior that we will be using for this experiment is that the presence of anything at the surface of the tank will cause them to search for food. We hypothesized that the introduction of food would decrease the amount aggressive behavior displayed by the betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
We were assigned two male Betta splendens (Fish 1/Red and Fish 2/Blue) of similar size and we placed them in a fish tank separated by a solid barrier as well as a sheet of glass. Then, we removed the solid barrier, leaving the glass between the two betta fish. For five minutes, two members of the group measured how long each fish exhibited aggressive behavior, either front-facing or broadside agonistic behavior. After the five minutes elapsed, we put back the solid barrier and allowed the fish to rest. We then repeated this process two more times, so we had three values for time spent performing aggressive behavior for each fish. After allowing the fish to rest for five minutes after the third trial, we then introduced a scoopula full of fish food in both sides of the tank.  And again, we removed the solid barrier and recorded for five minutes how long each fish exhibited aggressive behavior in the presence of food. After the five minutes elapsed, we put back the solid barrier and allowed the fish to rest. We then repeated this process two more times, so we had three values for time spent performing aggressive behavior for each fish in the presence of food, as well. Our significance level, or alpha, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, and was set to 0.05.

Results:
When calculating the average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior of Fish 1 (Red), the trend observed was that trend observed was that the average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior in the control group, 29 +/- 16.5 sec was higher than the experimental group, 5.67 +/- 8.96 sec, (T-value = 1.586, degree of freedom (df) = 2, p-value = 0.253), thus statistically insignificant (Figure 1). The same trend was observed when calculating the average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior of Fish 2 (Blue). The average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior in the control group, 41.3 +/- 24.2 sec was higher than the experimental group, 2.67 +/- 2.31 sec, (T-value = 2.93, degree of freedom (df) = 2, p-value = 0.101), thus also statistically insignificant (Figure 2). There was a lot of variability in the time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior for both the control and experimental groups for both fish.

Discussion:
Our data on the average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior of Fish 1 (Red) and Fish 2 (Blue) of the three trials of the control (no food) and experimental (food) groups was supported by our results, but not statistically significant. When no food was introduced into the fish tank, both fish exhibited considerably more aggressive behavior on average , 29 +/- 16.5 sec (Red) and 41.3 +/- 24.2 sec (Blue), compared to the 5.67 +/- 8.96 sec (Red) and 2.67 +/- 2.31 sec (Blue) of aggressive behavior when there was food present in the tank (Figure 1, Figure 2). However, both of these data sets are statistically insignificant because of the p-values for both fish being much larger than our alpha value, (T-value = 2.93, degree of freedom (df) = 2, p-value = 0.101) and (T-value = 1.586, degree of freedom (df) = 2, p-value = 0.253). While statistically insignificant, the apparent negative effect of the introduction of food on time spend exhibiting aggressive behavior can be explained biologically. The presence of anything at the surface of the tank will cause the betta fish to search for food, which also floats on the surface of the water. The food provides energy for the fish if eaten. So, it makes sense for the fish to expend some energy to capture the food for increased amount of energy they will receive in return if they eat the food. This greater energy return is not available when performing aggressive behavior. It is advantageous for the betta fish to expend energy for aggressive behavior against another male of the same species since they can avoid immediate conflict and death. The large standard deviation in the mean of the three trials of the control and experimental groups can be explained partly by habituation. In the initial trials, the fish spent more time exhibiting aggressive behavior, even though they were separated by the glass barrier. Over time, they spent less time flaring their gills and fins, and more time swimming around their area of the tank. Habituation is a beneficial behavior in this case because it allows the fish to decrease their energy expenditure when they realized that the other fish presented no real threat [Peeke: 1973]. More studies should be done to reach a better conclusion on the effect of food on aggressive behavior of fish. These future experiments could have more accurate and more precise measurements in the measuring of how long each fish was exhibiting aggressive behavior. In this experiment, the measurements were largely dependent on each person’s definition of aggressive behavior.

The average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior of Fish 1 (Red) of the three trials of the control (no food) and experimental (food) groups is shown above. The trend observed was that the average time spent exhibiting aggressive behavior in the control group was higher than that of the experimental group. A one-tailed paired t-test resulted in (T-value = 1.586, degree of freedom (df) = 2, p-value = 0.253). The error bars represent the standard deviation in the mean of the three trials of the control and experimental groups.
