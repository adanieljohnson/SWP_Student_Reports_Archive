Title: Effect of opponent’s size on the agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Agonistic behavior is a fundamental aspect of ecological theories on intraspecific and interspecific interactions. The main objective of the study was to determine the effect of opponent’s size on agnostic behaviors. It was hypothesized that Betta splendins is more likely to display agnostic behavior sooner and with long duration when confronted with a larger conspecific individual than a smaller one. Comparing the two groups, there was a significent increase in time span of operculum expansion under exposure to a larger conspecific individual. Although there is a large percentage decrease in time for occurrence of first agnostic behaviors, it failed to reach significance (p&gt;0.05). This result opposed the hypothesis because of the small sample size, and the effect of size on aggression remains to be explored.

Introduction:
Betta splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, received this popular name due to their obvious tendency to attack conspecifics. To be more specific, they flare gills and fins and changing color to fighting colors like intense red or blue when exited by other individuals of the species. Its agnostic behaviors could be categorized into two types of movements: broadside and facing movements. Typical broadside movements are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing in increasing order of aggressiveness [Johnson: 2017]. And pectoral fin erection, spreading opercula, and protrusion of branchiostegal membrane are representative facing movements, arranged from lowest to higher aggressiveness [Johnson: 2017]. The intensity and frequency of agnostic interaction vary according to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors that have been shown to affect aggression are size, sex, and hunger state, while the extrinsic ones are status and individual recognition, and resource availability, etc [Clayton: 1967]. In this investigation, I examined the effect of opponent’s size on agnostic behaviors. To be more specific, my hypothesis was that Betta splendins is more likely to display agnostic behavior sooner and with long duration when confronted with a larger conspecific individual than a smaller one. The smaller or bigger fish was the independent and categorical variable, and the timing for the first agnostic behavior and the duration of operculum expansion were the dependent and measurement variables. Betta splendins were suitable subjects because of their recognizable aggressiveness and appropriate size. 

Materials and Method:
All sets of observations should be minimum of 5 minutes. One small, one large, two middle-sized red male fish were randoMly selected and a water tank with three partitions, each divided by a glass and opaque board, was prepared. A small, middle-sized, and large fish were individually placed in each partition (make sure the middle-sized one is in the middle partition). The opaque board between the small and middle fish was removed, as soon as the stop watch was started. The time for the occurrence of the first agnostic behavior, the frequency and time span of operculum expansion, and sequence of any other recognizable broadside and facing movements were recorded into notebook in a full display. After that, the board was replaced and the board between middle and large fish was removed. Same observation and recording was repeated for this matching. At the end of each match, at least 5 minutes was guaranteed for adaptation and recovery from the previous intraspecific interaction. Also, fast movements or loud noises was avoided to minimize the disruption towards the subjects. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the middle-sized fish displayed agnostic behaviors, specifically pelvic fin flickering, much sooner when confronted with a larger conspecific individual (36s) than a smaller one (53.5s). But comparing the two groups, the paired t_test revealed that p= 0.288&gt;0.05 (t_stat = 2.06, d.f. = 3).  Figure 2 showed that the duration of operculum expansion increased as the size of the conspecific individual increased. The paired t_test suggested that p= 0.0342&lt;0.05 (t_stat = 18.6, d.f. = 3).  

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a significent decrease in time for occurrence of first agnostic behaviors and a significent increase in time span of operculum expansion under exposure to a larger conspecific individual would be shown. The data for operculum expansion supported this hypothesis as the p value (0.0342&lt;0.05) indicated the size of another fish has significent effect on the duration of operculum expansion.  But the other part of data opposed this hypothesis and showed that there was no effect of size on the timing of first threat behavior, as the value for the group with the larger fish were not significently lower compared to the one for the smaller group (p&gt;0.05). 
The practical significance of the result is vague and questionable, since there was a relatively large decrease in time for the first agnostic behavior (48.6%) in response to a larger individual compared to a smaller individual. This was possibly because of the limited sample size of subjects and the presence of confronting variable like color of the samples, so improvements could be made by testing on a larger number of Siamese fighting fish and making sure the similarity of their colors. 
The higher likelihood to display agnostic behavior when confronted with a larger conspecific individual was mainly caused by relationship between size and resource holding power. In nature, an advantage in size directly confers an advantage in resource holding power (RHP) to the larger individual [Bergman: 2003]. To be more specific, a larger individual holds more valuable resources like mates, food, or shelters. And as the winners of such interactions gain access to more valuable resources,  some smaller individuals may risk the chance for injury and increase energy expenditure for agnostic behaviors like long and intense fights towards a larger individual. Thi is why as RHP disparity (size difference) increases, conflicts sometimes become more intense and longer [Bergman: 2003].

The effect of size is comparable in different species. A study by Bergman explored the size effect on duration of agnostic interactions among a crayfish species Orconectes rusticus. And it turned out that the duration of agnostic interactions (n = 117) was longer when the size differential between opponents was larger (P &lt; 0.05). Encounters were longer when opponents were size-matched within 10%, whereas fights with a size difference greater than 10% did not exceed 4 s [Bergman: 2003]. However, many other crustaceans choose to minimized the duration of aggressive interaction, facing a larger size-match individual. And this can be well explained by the intention to  increase their overall fitness by reducing their risk of predation, minimizing energy costs, and emigrating to find a new resource [Clotfelter: 2006].
Even though there are strong evidence proving the effect of size on aggressive behavior, it must be examined both in the laboratory and in the field to better understand the factor that influence Betta splendins aggression.
