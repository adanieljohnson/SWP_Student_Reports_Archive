Title: Analyzing the Effects of Calcium Channel Enhancers on Muscular Contractile Strength

Abstract:
	Vertebrate muscles are innervated by neurons that stimulate muscle fibers by transmitting an action potential throughout the membrane of the cell. The resting potential of this membrane is slightly negative, so ions are required to both maintain this charge as well as rapidly alter it in the instance of an action potential. In this experiment, we altered the concentration of calcium ions in order to examine their effect on the strength of muscular contractions. We used a calcium channel enhancer (A23187) to alter the calcium concentration in the muscle, and used electrical stimulation of the muscle to cause muscular contraction. We hypothesized that an increased calcium concentration would result in a stronger muscle contraction. The results of our experiment determined that there was not any statistically significent difference between the contractile strength of muscles treated with calcium channel enhancers and muscles that were not treated. 

Introduction:
	The anatomy of a frog suggests the importance of the lower body muscles in its survival and function. The frog moves by hopping, which requires force generated by the muscles of the leg. Because of this, frog legs have relatively large and accessible gastrocnemus muscles. These muscles are innervated by the sciatic nerve, which runs through the entire frog leg. The sciatic nerve develops an action potential that cascades through the nerve and stimulates the muscle at a neuromuscular junction. The stimulation by the nerve causes an alteration in the membrane potential of the sarcomeres. The ions that play a role in this membrane potential are sodium ions, potassium ions, calcium ions, and chloride ions (Carlo, Pura, Magaly, Marino, 2016.). When contraction occurs, the hormone acetylcholine is released by the neuron and binds to receptors on the muscle cell. An action potential then invades the muscle cell opening calcium channels, allowing for calcium ions to flood out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium then binds to contractile proteins, which eventually leads to the contraction of the sarcomere (Rios, 2018.). It is very clear that calcium ions play an extremely important role in the contraction of muscles. Our aim was to find out whether or not calcium had an effect on the contractile strength of the muscle, or if it was only implicated in causing a muscular contraction. In other words, we were investigating whether or not an increase in the activity of calcium channels would increase the amount of calcium released, and cause a difference in the strength of a muscular contraction. We hypothesized that by increasing calcium channel enhancers, the muscular contractions would be stronger. 

Materials and Method:
	We began this experiment by preparing two frog legs. To prepare the legs, we “degloved” the frogs, by removing the skin on each leg to expose the muscular tissue. We then separated the gastrocnemus muscle from the Achilles tendon and broke the fascia connecting it to the tibia and fibula. The gastrocnemus was then suspended from the ITXA myogram recorder. The computer was then set up and placed on the “FrogNerveMuscle” settings. Silver wire was tied around the top and bottom of the gastrocnemus muscle, and electrodes were clipped on to the wire using alligator clips. The silver wire allowed for direct muscle stimulation, essentially bypassing the function of the nerve and neuromuscular junction. A threshold for stimulation was found by slowly increasing the amplitude of the stimulation by the electrodes, until finding the minimum amount required to cause the muscle to contract. Each leg served as it’s own controll group and treatment group. To begin, we stimulate the first leg four times, at 125% of the threshold amplitude. Each time, we recorded the amplitude of the contraction using the myogram. We allowed the muscle to rest for 30 seconds between each contraction. We then injected 0.2 Ml of “A23187” a calcium channel enhancer. We stimulated the leg four more times, with the same amplitude and rest period. We recorded the contractile strength for each contraction. We then repeated this process with the second leg. We used a two sampled t_test to test for statistical significance between the strength of muscular contractions and an increase in calcium channel activity. 

Results:
In order to analyze the data we acquired, a two sampled one-tailed t_test was used. The contractile strength was found by measuring the amplitude of each muscular contraction on the myogram produced by the ITXA. The t_test determined that there was no statistical significance between the contractile strength of the controll and that of the treatment group (d.f. = 14, t stat = 1.33997155, p_value​ = 0.10079941). There is no trend that is clear or present in this data, as there was only a very slight difference in the contractile strength of each leg before and after the treatment of calcium channel enhancer. There was a large difference in the threshold and contractile strength of each leg. There was also a slight decrease in contractile immediately after the injection of calcium channel enhancer. 

Discussion:
	Our statistical test determined that there was no statistical difference between the treatment and controll group’s strength of contractions (Figure 2), therefore we must reject our biological hypothesis and accept our null hypothesis. The evidence of this can also be seen in the bar graph in the results section, where the error bars very clearly overlap (Figure 3). The treatment of the frog leg gastrocnemus muscle did not increase the contractile strength of the muscle as we predicted. We justified our hypothesis by claiming that an increase of the calcium channel activity would cause an increased amount of calcium ions to be present and therefore would cause a stronger contraction. in the introduction, the mechanism behind muscular contraction was explained (Carlo, Pura, Magaly, Marino, 2016.). It is possible that increasing calcium channel activity before stimulation could have affected the resting membrane potential, causing it to be more positive because calcium is a positive ion. this might change the threshold required to cause a muscular contraction, but in this experiment,​ we were only testing the strength of the contraction. The muscular contractions might have been slightly weaker between the controll group and treatment group. However, each leg served as both the controll group and treatment group, so it is important to consider the role of muscular fatigue. Since the treatment contractions came after the first four controll contractions, the muscle fibers could have been experiencing fatigue, causing the contractions to be slightly weaker. It is also important to consider that we only used two frog legs in this experiment. Each leg was very different, so it would have different values in terms of thresholds, contractile strengths, etc. Since only two legs were used, it is difficult to analyze such a small amount of values for contractile strength. If this experiment were to be repeated, it would be very important to use a much larger quantity of legs, as this would provide a larger database, and lead to more easily analyzed results. It would also be important to stimulate both the muscle and nerve, in two separate steps of the experiment.
	Conclusively, this experiment determined that while enhancing the activity of calcium channels in the frog gastrocnemus might have an effect on muscle contraction, it does not have any significent effect on the contractile strength of individual muscle contractions.
