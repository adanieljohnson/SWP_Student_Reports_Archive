Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Solution on Rana pipiens Skeletal Muscle Contraction Threshold and Amplitude

Abstract:
The Rana pipiens frog provides a great way to study basic muscle contraction in invertebrates. Here we study how the gastrocnemius muscle contracts by looking at the threshold for contraction, as well as contraction amplitude. We will be studying the effects of added acetylcholine on the twitch threshold and contraction amplitude, acetylcholine usually acts as a neurotransmitter in the neuromuscular junction, signaling a muscle contraction. We hypothesized that the acetylcholine will reduce threshold and increase amplitude. To do this we will find these values for two untreated frog legs and then treat each leg with acetylcholine and then again find these values. From this experiment we find that the addition acetylcholine provides no constant trend between the two legs. We had a p-value of .685547 for average twitch threshold and .517846, thus meaning we found no significant data to support the hypothesis. Overall the experiment showed no trend for either category and thus our hypothesis that the twitch threshold would decrease, and that twitch amplitude would increase due to addition of acetylcholine, is refuted.

Introduction:
We are studying the contraction of skeletal muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius muscle, in the Northern Leopard Frog, scientifically known as Rana pipiens. This specimen is an ideal study specimen as we can easily isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and easily stimulate the nerve by isolating the white sciatic nerve [Johnson:2018]. Muscles contract when a nerve signal reaches the neuromuscular junction, releasing acetylcholine and sending an action potential throughout the muscle, releasing calcium ions which bond to troponin on actin, revealing myosin binding sites and allowing myosin to bind to the actin, a breakdown of ATP then causes the muscle to contract [Kuo: 2015].  In our experiment we will be adding the acetylcholine to the muscle and testing its effect on the contraction threshold and contraction amplitude of the muscle. From the known information, we can hypothesize that the addition of acetylcholine will lower the energy threshold to start a contraction as well as increase the overall contraction amplitude at different voltage inputs. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform this lab, we will obtain two legs from a single Rana pipiens frog and a force transducer. We will then prepare the leg by removing the skin, isolating the sciatic nerve, cutting free the distal end of the gastrocnemius muscle and connecting the the muscle to the force transducer. During this preparation and throughout the experiment the muscle will be kept wet with Ringerâ€™s solution. We will then place electrodes in contact with the sciatic nerve. We will then preform control testing for each leg by first sending signals at .1V and increasing in .1V intervals (all over variables constant) until a contraction is found. We will then find the contraction amplitude control by sending signals into the muscle at 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 5V. The contraction amplitude will be recorded at each value, as well as for the threshold values. Each muscle will then be treated with .1mL of 10mg/mL solution of acetylcholine. The muscle will then sit for 5 minutes to allow the solution to spread. After this five-minute period, both threshold and amplitude tests will then be repeated in each leg for the treatment aspect of our experiment. We will analyze our results using a paired t-test for both average threshold and average twitch amplitude.

Results:
We can look at our data to see that that there is little trend that runs between the two legs between the control and treatment groups. For the contraction threshold we see that in leg 1 the threshold required is .35V for the treatment group as compared to .17V in the control, in leg 2 the threshold is .2V for the treatment group and .8V in the control (Figure 1). When a paired t-test is performed for the threshold values we get 1 degree of freedom, a t-value of .538462, and a p value of .685547. When looking at the average amplitude of maximal twitch we see that for leg 1 the average contraction amplitude in treatment group was .2462V (standard deviation +/- 0.025576552) and that of the control was .229V (standard deviation +/- 0.008602325), in leg 2 we saw that the average contraction amplitude was .177V (standard deviation +/- 0.00551362) in the treatment group and .7904V (standard deviation +/-  0.018650469) in the control (Figure 2). For the paired t-test between these average values we found 1 degree of freedom, a t-value of .945449, and a p value of .517846

Discussion:
Our data from this experiment provides little significant data as we see a p-value of .685547 for the threshold results and a p-value of .517846. These values are both well above .05 meaning that our results were insignificant. This also means that our data does not support our hypothesis that the acetylcholine will reduce threshold and increase contraction amplitude. Our results show an increase in threshold for the treatment group in leg 1, but a decrease in threshold in the treatment group for leg 2 (Figure 1). We can see that these trends are opposing to each other and do not show any significant information. The increased threshold for the treatment test of leg 1 could likely be due to muscle fatigue, coupled with the acetylcholine not yet bonding with the muscle to assist in sending the signal. The decrease in threshold in leg 2 could be attributed to the acetylcholine effectively bonding to the muscle, thus assisting the action potential in firing. For the overall contraction amplitude, the results show a slight increase in contraction amplitude in the treatment group when compared to the control for leg 1 and a significant decrease in contraction amplitude for the treatment when compared to the control in leg 2 (Figure 2). The increase in contraction amplitude for leg 1 can be explained by the idea that the acetylcholine eventually binded to the muscle surface, helping to send the action potentials and thus creating a contraction of higher amplitude. The large decrease from muscle 2 could be attributed to the fact that the acetylcholine did not bind onto the muscle and thus the added weight from the water, coupled with the lack of help from acetylcholine led to the overall amplitude being suppressed.  While we can individually provide possible reasons for our results, the trends seen between twitch threshold and the amplitude of each twitch contradict each other in what they mean overall for the muscles in each leg, this means that we cannot provide one singular reason for our overall results. Explanations could be that acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by the nerve onto the muscle and simply binds to the muscle resulting in channels opening, creating the excitation part of an action potential [Kuo: 2015]. This could mean that adding acetylcholine would simply cause a small contraction upon being added and will give no impact on how the muscle contracts when we add our own stimulus. Errors of our experiment include not injecting the acetylcholine at the correct angle, slight human mistakes in how much acetylcholine is injected, and not setting the muscle completely vertical during testing. The changes we see in our data could be due to other factors such as error, added weight to the muscle, and fatigue. Overall, our results showed a variety of trends that are can be explained by various factors. These results provided no conclusive evidence and our hypothesis cannot be supported.
