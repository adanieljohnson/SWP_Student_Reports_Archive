Title: The Effect of Hormones on the Life Cycle of a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
In this experiment, we will test the manipulation of hormones in the Manduca sexta because their physiology allows us to deduce information about endocrinology and development [3]. In an eight-day experiment we will use a control group versus an experimental group that is given azagaurd 1:1250 an ecdysterone inhibitor. At the end of the eight days we got an average of 10.15 pounds in weight for a caterpillar in the control group and 1.762 pounds in weight for the experimental group.  This large difference in weight alongside a t-test value of 10.9702 gave us statistical evidence that the difference in weight was due to the hormone not random error.  Allowing us to conclude that ecdysterone inhibitor prevent the caterpillars from naturally going through its lifecycle and inhibits its growth because it needs spikes in order to go to the next instar phase.


Introduction:
A Manduca sexta, also known as a hawk moth in the adult stage, is a moth that resembles a hummingbird because of its heavy-body [1]. Tis species is often used as the test subject for studies on insects because of its physiology, so we research them to learn about the endocrinology and development [1]. This caterpillar is also used to investigate the interaction of hormones alongside the environment in the life cycle of instars and pupation [1]. The Manduca sexta moth transforms from egg to caterpillar the finally an adult in a cycle that lasts from around 39 to 45 days [2]. The caterpillar goes through 5 instar larva phases then it has a commitment pulse [2].  The commitment pulse signals to the caterpillar that it is ready to pupate [2].  The caterpillar then remains a pupa for 19 to 23 days [2].  The life cycle is controlled by two hormones called ecdysterone and juvenile hormone [2]. There are spikes of ecdysterone before the larval eclosion but the amount of juvenile hormone is decreasing as the Manduca sexta is going through its life cycle [2]. In our study, we want to test if the manipulation of one of these main steroids can affect the growth and life cycle of the caterpillar.  For instance, in a study using juvenile hormone, they found there was evidence of a change in growth and that the most effective way was inserting the hormone into the blood slowly so that it was metabolized slower [3]. More specifically, we will be using azagaurd 1:1250, which is an ecdysterone inhibitor, and monitoring the caterpillars weight daily to track the progress. 


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we collected homes for each of the 8 caterpillars and separated them into four per group. The first group was our control group which was given 10 grams of Caterpillar food each and using a pipet we dropped 10 drops of distilled water into the food. The second group was our experimental group which we gave 10 grams of food to each but we used another pipet to drop 10 drops of azaguard 1:1250 solution. We then mixed up the food so that the caterpillars were exposed to food that had equal amounts of hormone inhibitor. All of the caterpillars were put into their breathable containers and labeled so that we could measure their growth in weight each day. During the 8-day period that we were observing them the containers remained in a controlled incubator which gave them 12 hours of light and 12 of hours dark in a 24 hour period.  Every day not at a specific time we weighed the caterpillars and cleaned their homes and remade 10 grams of food with the same liquids used in their original food. This was done every day for 8 days straight before we made our conclusions. Then the group used a t-test to determine if there was statistical evidence. My groups hypothesis is that the control group will grow significantly more in size, which we will measure by their weight, than the control group. 


Results:
The general trends you notice from the data collected is the control group grew in weight much more over 8 days than the experiment group of caterpillars. This is supported by our t-test because the high value tells us that it is statistically significant difference which means it cannot be attributed to random error but is attributed to the hormone inhibitor. The control group had an average weight of 10.15 pounds whereas the experimental group gave us an average weight of 1.762, resulting in a t-test value of 10.9702.


Discussion:
In this lab, we tested to see if the manipulation of hormones in the Manduca sexta caterpillar would affect the growth of the caterpillar. So, we gave our experimental group azagaurd 1:1250, which is an ecdysterone inhibitor. Our hypothesis tested to be correct, which was that the control group would grow in weight more than the experimental. We thought this would be the case because the caterpillars must undergo a spike in ecdysterone before an instar [2]. Therefore, if the caterpillar was lacking in this hormone it would fail to go through the instar and grow in order to eventually pupate.  In conclusion, we can deduce that ecdysterone affects the growth of a manducta sexta in a negative way.
