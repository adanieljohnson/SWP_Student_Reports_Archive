Title: Frog Leg Response to Electrical Stimulation to the Nerve Before and After Introduction of Calcium Channel Blocker

Abstract:
Calcium is a key ion in the function of muscle filaments, triggering the movement of myosin heads. Disrupting the movement of calcium across membranes in the cell would certainly effect the functionality of muscle fibers. My group tested the changes in threshold amplitude and strength of a Rania pipiens, or the northern leopard frog’s Gastrocnemius leg muscle before and after being injected with calcium channel blocker. We hypothesized that introducing the calcium channel blocker Lanthanum Chloride would cause the muscle to weaken due to not being able to uptake enough calcium. We found that the calcium channel blocker seemingly caused the muscle to contract harder, although results are not conclusive.


Introduction:
My lab group studied the effects of injecting calcium channel blocker into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens, or northern leopard frog. The northern leopard frog is well suited for lab testing because they survive well in captivity and have easily manipulated leg muscles while still having a similar anatomical muscle structure to humans. By stimulating the sciatic nerve with electrical impulses, we will be able to cause the muscle to contract and study the difference between a normal gastrocnemus muscle contraction and one with the calcium channel blocker introduced. When a motor neuron is stimulated, it transports an action potential down its length, branching off to contact multiple myofibrils within the target muscle at neuromuscular junctions. The action potential spreads down the myofibril then into T-tubules, releasing calcium from sarcoplasmic reticulum contained within the myofibril. These calcium ions bind to troponin, exposing the myosin binding sites on the actin. The myosin heads can then bind then pull on the actin, shortening the filament, leading to contraction. These calcium ions are then reabsorbed into the sarcoplasmic reticulum through calcium ion channels, allowing the muscle to relax. As Epstein explains, the calcium channel blockers like lanthanum Chloride get into Calcium ion channels by imitating Ca2+ but can’t get through, clogging the channel, preventing Ca2+ from entering [Epstein: 1982]. As explained by Elliot, the mechanism for the relaxation of muscles by calcium channel blockers is that by blocking calcium uptake into the myofibrils, we limit the amount of calcium in the cell, limiting the strength of Ca2+ triggered actions, decreasing the strength of contraction [Elliott:2011]. For this experiment, we predict that when a calcium channel blocker is introduced, the muscle will not be able to output as much force as the controll.


Materials and Method:

Materials and Method
We will start by acquiring 2 recently liberated frog legs. Begin dissecting these legs over a dissection plate by pulling the skin from the top of the thigh down to then off the foot. Then separate the sciatic nerve from the inner thigh carefully by hand. Separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the leg by cutting the membrane between it and the bone with scissors then detach it at the bottom with a cut through the Achilles tendon. Pin the leg down then set up force transducer over the dissection plate on a stand. Tie a string between the force transducer and the Achilles tendon making sure it is at a 90o angle and taught. Set up stimulator and associated program then attach stimulating silver wire probes. Put the silver wires so they are both touching the sciatic nerve. Run a test gradually increasing voltage until response registered, finding the lowest voltage to get a response and the strength of that response. Then inject the leg with calcium channel blocker, wait ten minutes, then again find the lowest voltage to get a response and the strength of that response. Repeat this process on a second leg. Obtain results for similar experiment run by other groups. Preform a paired T-test on the data.

Results
From the results of the tests run by my group and one other group, we obtained the threshold amps required to get muscle stimulation before and after Calcium channel blocker injection and the strength of those twitches before and after injection on four different frog legs. From our general observations, the twitch strength of the muscle at threshold amplitude increased from an average of .4295v (.352 SD) to .5575v (.383 SD) with an average difference of .128 after the calcium channel blocker was introduced as seen in figure 1. The only muscle to decrease in threshold strength was on leg 1, however, this leg did have a higher twitch strength after injections when stimulated to the same amplitude as before, having a .0804v twitch before injection and a 1.002v twitch after injection when .04v. final numbers however were derived from threshold twitch. Based on our P value of .505 for this data, there is a fifty/fifty chance these results are due to chance making our data not statistically significent. The threshold amplitude required for stimulating the muscle also increased from an average of 0.1475v (.08 SD) to 0.15v (.12 SD) which would indicate that calcium channel blocker increases the threshold required, however, with a P value of .95 there is a 95% chance these results are due to chance, making this data extremely insignificent. we also had three degrees of freedom and a T value of 0.756 for both the twitch strength and threshold amplitude data sets.


Discussion:
Our initial hypothesis is rejected due to our results not reflecting our prediction. We predicted the calcium channel blocker would prevent the myofibrils from up taking Ca2+ necessary to undergo a full contraction, however, the data seems to indicate the opposite effect occurred. While much of the literature points to calcium channel blockers causing relaxation as clinically tested by Rich, our data, while not significent, warrants investigation [Rich: 1992]. One possibility my group did not consider was the rate that the sarcoplasmic reticulum would take calcium back up. By blocking the calcium channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, we may have allowed free Ca2+ ions more opportunities to bind to troponin instead of being reabsorbed, creating a stronger contraction. The twitch strength was always found at threshold frequency, which differed between pre and post injection. This could have contributed to a larger difference between twitch strength due to a different amplitude inputs. Having 2 independent variables in this lab, threshold amplitude and threshold twitch strength, disrupted the accuracy of much of the data. If I was to redo this experiment I would test twitch strength at a constant voltage. While threshold amplitude did seem to rise based on the averages of the data, there was only a single leg at a higher threshold amplitude after injection as seen in table 1. A .95 P value makes it almost guaranteed to have been due to chance. This experiment shows how hard it is to predict the way a chemical will interact with a biological system.
