Title: The effect of water clarity on the agnostic facing behaviors observed between Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Observational animal behavior is one of the main ways that we expand our knowledge on a species. Specifically, one efficient way to learn about a species is to see how they respond to external stimuli and conditions. With this, we wanted to see how different water conditions would affect the aggressive behaviors of Betta Splendins, or Betta fish. I hypothesized that the Betta fish would display less aggressive behaviors in the murky water than they would in the clear water due to visual impairment in the murky water. To test this, we observed the facing behaviors between 3 different fish in clear water and in murky water conditions. Using an original scoring scale to quantify these behaviors, we found that the Betta fish had significently lower aggression scores in murky water conditions. These results supported my hypothesis, which lead me to accept the alternative hypothesis. 

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior brings together observational skills from all different settings. Whether information is found through laboratory method, natural history, ecological theories, or through many other environments, it is important to not think of animal behavior in isolation. Specifically, it is important to recognize the differences between animal behavior from species to species. It is misleading to observe the behavior of two species that display behavior vastly different, such as humans and fish, using the same quantifying system. With this in mind, in order to efficiently study the agnostic behaviors in Betta fish, an original quantifying system was made. 
	Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fish that originated in South-East Asia. Their natural environment includes shallow murky waters, near dense vegetation fields, such as rice paddy fields [Jaroensutasinee:2005]. These fish are known for their aggressive behaviors, coining the name “fighting fish”. They are also known for their vibrant color changing that occurs in response to the presence of other members of their species. With this knowledge at hand, we explored the visual communication that indicates aggressive behavior between Betta fish in an environment similar to their natural environment and in an  artificial environment. 
	In a prior study done on intra- and interspecific aggressive behavior in Siamese fighting fish, it was concluded that the behavior of the fighting fish is motivated by visual exploration as well as by aggression [Johnson: 1973]. With this information, I hypothesized that the fish would experience less aggressive behaviors toward one another in murky water than in clear water. I predicted that when their vision was impaired by the impurities in the water, behavioral responses would not be as apparent. In other words, if the Betta fish could not see each other clearly, they would not visually communicate, and therefore not display many agnostic facing behaviors toward one another. 
	Overall, this study is important because the knowledge that we gain on animal behavior can improve our understanding and interactions with many other species. 



Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, an aquarium was obtained with 3 male betta fish separated from each other by opaque partitions. The fish were numbered 1-3. The opaque partition was removed between fish 1 and 2, allowing them to see each other while staying physically separated by glass. Closely observing how the fish reacted to each other, each facing behavior displayed was written down. After 5 minutes of observation, the opaque partition was placed back into the tank so fish 1 and 2 could no longer see each other. While the fish rested for 5 minutes, the final scores for fish 1 and 2 were calculated using the following scale: Pectoral fin erection= 1 point, Gills spread over opercula= 2 points, Red mane flashed= 3 points. The point values were multiplied by the number of times the facing behavior occurred. The final scores for fish 1 and 2 were recorded in our lab notebooks. 
After making sure 5 minutes had passed since fish 1 and 2 saw each other, the opaque partition was removed between fish 2 and 3. The same observational procedure for fish 1 and 2 was followed for fish 2 and 3, and the final scores for fish 2 and 3 were recorded. 
After carefully switching fish 2 and 3 so that fish 1 and 3 were now next to each other, 5 minutes were given for fish 3 to get settled down from the switch. After 5 minutes had passed, the opaque partition between 1 and 3 was removed, and the above procedure was repeated. 
After recording the scores of fish 1 and 3, soil was added into the aquarium. This was enough soil to make the water visibly murky, but not enough so that the fish could no longer be seen. After allowing the fish 5 minutes to get used to the new environment, the entire above procedure was repeated. With the 6 scores collected for clear water and the 6 collected for murky water, a two-sample one tailed t_test was preformed to effectively analyze and compare the data between the two water conditions. 


Results:
One of the notable observations during this experiment was that in the murky water conditions, the fish did not seem to acknowledge each other for extended periods of time. When aggressive behaviors were displayed, they were displayed for short intervals and then the fish would rest for a little before displaying another behavior. This contrasted the clear water behaviors, where the fish seemed to take little to no break between displaying facing behaviors.  
Statistically, our results show an average score of 56.8¿15.9 for the clear water conditions. For the murky water, our results show an average score of 30.2¿22.4. This is shown in Figure 1.
In addition to the raw data showing that the clear water interactions have an average higher aggression score, the one tailed t_test preformed concluded that this difference is significent (t_stat: 2.37, d.f.: 10, p: 0.04). This means that on average, in clear water the fish had a significently display of aggressive behaviors than in the murky water.

Discussion:
Overall, our results supported my hypothesis. I hypothesized that the fish would not display as many aggressive behaviors toward each other in the murky water as they would in the clear water, and our significent results supported this. One reasoning for this may be that the fish could not see each other as well, and therefore did not feel the threat or presence of another fish. This absence of visual threat is an efficient explanation for the decrease in display of facing behaviors. In other words, if one of the fish swam to a distance where they could no longer be seen, the opposing fish may have thought the threat was gone and concluded their aggressive behaviors for the time being. This impaired vision at certain distances may explain why in the murky water the fish acknowledged each other only for short periods of time.
 Similar to our results, a study done on the role of vision in fish behavior concluded that treatments skewing the brightness or texture of water changes the way a fish behaves [Guthrie: 1986]. This is because fish depend heavily on vision as a source of sensory information. Specifically, Betta fish depend on their vision to see the presences of other members of their species, which ultimately leads to proper communication.
Moving forward, if we were to advance this experiment, I would want to observe the effects of different levels of murkiness on facing behaviors. Specifically, I would want to measure the effects that specific concentrations of soil added to the water would have on Betta fish aggression. I think that measuring a range of murkiness would provide us with more information on how much water clarity effects Betta behaviors, which could ultimately lead to a better understanding of how Betta’s interact with their environment. 
Overall, this study is important because the knowledge of how Betta fish respond to different water conditions could potentially lead to improvements in the way we understand and interact with this species. Specifically, since Betta fish are such popular domesticated aquarium fish, observing what environment they do best in can improve how we care for them as pets.
