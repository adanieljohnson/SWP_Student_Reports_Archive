Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on the Growth and Development of Manduca sextas

Abstract:
In this lab, we investigated the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth and development of Manduca sextas, or otherwise known as tobacco hornworms. More specifically, we focused on discovering the effects of this hormone on the life cycle of the M. sexta. Ecdysone is an important hormone found in a vast number of insects; therefore, to test the effect of ecdysone on insects we raised eight hornworms and treated their food source with Martin’s IGR. Four of the hornworms were a part of the experimental group so their food was treated with Martin’s IGR, while the other four hornworms consumed normal food without the hormone. We observed these hornworms for a week and recorded their masses and lengths. We hypothesized that the hornworms being fed the treated diet would grow less in mass and length when compared to the hornworms being fed the normal hornworm diet. The two-tailed T-test revealed that Martin’s IGR does have a significent impact on the growth of M. sextas. Therefore, from this experiment we determined that Martin’s IGR blocks the activity of the juvenile hormone in the development of insects. 


Introduction:
Manduca sextas, otherwise known as tobacco hornworms, are large greenish-blue caterpillars that have a development cycle of 39 to 48 days. These caterpillars form from eggs and then go through multiple larvae stages before they reach pupation. In the pupal stage, the caterpillars spend about three weeks. After the pupal stage, the caterpillars then become an adult and turn into moths. During these different stages the life cycle, hormones found within the caterpillar are responsible for triggering the next stage of development. More specifically, for the M. sexta, the major hormones that trigger the stages of development are prothoracicotropic, ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone [Johnson : 2018]. Therefore, if these hormones were to be inhibited or disrupted within the life cycle, it may hinder the caterpillar’s ability to reach the next stage of development. In this lab focused on investigating how Martin’s IGR can affect the activity of ecdysterone and juvenile hormone within the caterpillar’s life cycle. The many different types of insect growth regulators (IGR) are seen as safe alternatives to common organic pesticides [Staal : 1975]. These insect growth regulators can disrupt the major stages of development which include the end of the fourth stage of the larvae life span, the commitment pulse, and the pupal stage. Ultimately, altering the activity of these hormones within the caterpillar’s life span will impact their ability to develop and sustain life significently. From exploring the role of these hormones in M. sextas, we hypothesized that if caterpillars were given Martin’s IGR through their food source, then their growth would be inhibited and they would generate lower average masses and lengths than caterpillars being feed a standard tobacco hornworm diet. 


Materials and Method:
To initiate this experiment, we obtained eight Manduca sexta larvae that were all relatively around the same size. We acquired 4 caterpillars that were about 4.5 centimenters in length, and 4 caterpillars that were about 4 centimeters in length. We also determined that all of the caterpillars were also similar in weight, measured in grams. Once we chose the caterpillars, we divided them into an experimental group and a controll group. For the experimental group, we placed two 4 centimeter caterpillars and two 4.5 centimeter caterpillars. For the controll group, we also placed two 4 centimeter caterpillars and two 4.5 centimeter caterpillars. Then we obtained 4 plastic containers and placed a paper divider in the middle of each container to divide the caterpillars. Two containers were labeled experimental and the other two were labeled controll. The caterpillars were placed in their containers according to their assigned groups and their food was prepared. Each caterpillar obtained 10 grams of caterpillar food. For the caterpillars in the controll group, their food was mixed with 5 drops of water each. For the caterpillars in the experimental group, their food was mixed with 5 drops of Martin’s IGR each. The caterpillars were then left to be observed daily for a week straight. If food ran out, new food was supplied to the caterpillars. At the end of the observation week, the caterpillars were measured and weighed and the raw data was analyzed using two different two-tailed T-tests. 



Results:
Our data revealed that the average weight of the controll group of M. sexta was 8.350.435 grams. The average weight of the Martin’s IGR experimental group of M. sexta was 7.10.87 grams. The average length of the controll group of M. sexta was 3.180.63 centimeters. The average weight of the Martin’s IGR experimental group of M. sexta was 3.00.41 centimeters. A two-tailed T-test was used to analyze the weight and length differences individually. The two-tailed T-test for the weight differences revealed a significent difference (t=2.54, d.f.=6, p=.044). The two-tailed T-test for the length differences did not reveal a significent difference (t=.333, d.f.=6, p=.044). These statistics reveal that the Martin’s IGR may disrupt the caterpillars’ ability to gain weight, but it does not affect the growth of the caterpillars in terms of length. 


Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment, we discovered that Martin’s IGR did effect the ability of the Manduca sexta to gain weight, but it did not affect the caterpillars’ ability to grow in length. Our results supported the first part of our hypothesis, which predicted that the average weight of the experimental caterpillars would decrease. For the second part of our hypothesis, we predicted that the average length of the experimental caterpillars would decrease, but we did not find a significent difference between the two groups so that part of the hypothesis could not be supported. Although our experiment was carried out fairly successfully, there was possible room for error. For example, when some of the caterpillars chewed through the paper barrier. Therefore, the experiment could’ve been more successful if the barriers between the caterpillars were stronger. In addition, when we tried to measure the length of the caterpillars most of the caterpillars would try to curl up in order to defend themselves, and it would to inaccurate measurements of length. Another observation we made was the discoloration of the caterpillars in the experimental Martin’s IGR group. We observed that the experimental group generated a pale pigment (See Figure 3). This observation led us to believe that there were intrinsic effects occurring in the caterpillars in addition to the alteration of hormones in the caterpillars. A similar study investigated the effects of the insecticide bistrifluron on the life stages of cotton caterpillars [Kim : 2007]. Although the larvae in this study experience a hundred percent mortality within the first 24 hours, the caterpillars revealed development altercations at each larval stage just like the caterpillars within our study. Ultimately, our study revealed that Martin’s IGR does, indeed, carry a negative impact on the caterpillar’s ability to grow and sustain life. Since tobacco hornworms are pests are larvae, Martin’s IGR is ineffective in terms of getting rid of a pest because it keeps the caterpillars in the larvae stage. Whereas, mosquitos, for example, are pests so an effective IGR would keep mosquitos in the larvae stage and ultimately preventing them from becoming pests.
