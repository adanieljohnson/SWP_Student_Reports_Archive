Title:  The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In this experiment, we will be observing the effects of Juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which population can occur. In order to do this, we will have a control and an experimental group. Each caterpillar in the experimental group will receive 10g of IGR treated food. On the other hand, the control group will receive 10g of food with only DI water added to it. In order to analyze our data we will be conducting a two-sample t-test. We are testing to see if the Juvenile hormone alters the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. We will observe any increases in growth, as well as, any physiological changes of each caterpillar. 


Introduction:
The most important aspect of this lab and the respective growth of our model organisms is hormones. Hormones are responsible for puberty in humans, as well as, the development and life cycles of insects. For example, two hormones that directly affect insect development are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone work together to control growth, molting and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta. With this said, these hormones are important because without one of them, the insects will most likely not fully develop, or could result in their death. In a study of the effects of juvenile hormone on larval development and metamorphosis it was found that, “These studies suggest that excess JH may affect adult development of imaginal structures if present at the onset of postembryonic cell proliferation of the imaginal discs or histoblasts. Thus, commitment for adult differentiation must occur early during this proliferative phase” (Riddiford LM). Furthermore, in one case study focused on better controlling insect pest with the help of insect growth regulators (IGRs). The IGRs are used as a way to affect the insect’s growth and development. These regulators have an affect on certain physiological regulatory processes essential to insect development. A test was administered on cultures of linden bugs, which, in turn, resulted in low egg hatch rates, and later failed to mature into adults. With this said, insect growth regulators became a successful alternative to toxic insecticides (Johnson AD). In addition to the linden bug, an experiment was conducted on the Manduca sexta caterpillars, our model organism for the lab. The Manduca sexta starts as an egg, then goes through the 5th larval instar, as a caterpillar, pupates and finally becomes an adult, in the form of a moth. In order to pass from one life stage to another the organism must molt and go through the process of metamorphosis. Our model organism’s growth and development is similarly affected by hormone-based and neuro-based signaling. Therefore, in addition to the linden bug, the Manduca sexta is also affected by Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone.  In order to conduct this experiment, we will treat an experimental group with 5 drops of Juvenile hormone, allowing us to compare these results to the control group, which will receive no added hormones to their food. Throughout the span of 7 days of daily feeding, we will track and record the growth and physiological changes of each caterpillar.  We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which pupation can occur.


Materials and Methods:
Each caterpillar apart of the experimental group will receive 5 drops of 1:1250 Dilution of IGR with DI water to their 10g of food every day. On the other hand, the control group of caterpillars will only receive an addition of 5 water drops to their daily food. In order to carry out this experiment, we will dedicate four Manduca sexta caterpillars to the control group, and four Manduca sexta caterpillars to the experimental group. Each caterpillar will be placed in its own section of a container. For seven days straight, we will feed each caterpillar 10g of their respective food, depending on if they are in the control or experimental group. Each new day, we will dispose of their old food, and replace it with new food. For our data collection, we will measure the weight of each caterpillar, weight the leftover food and make direct observations on physiological changes and morphology. To analyze our date we will be conducting a two-sample t-test. Two-sample t-tests are used to compare the means from two groups of data; specifically, the mean of a control group to the mean of an experimental group. Furthermore, we will either be rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis depending on our results. 


Results:
After conducting the experiment, we noticed that by increasing the percent of JH in their food, it made the caterpillars have physiological changes. Through observation, we noticed that the experimental group went from a bright green/blue color to a pale green color. On top of this, after seven days, the experimental caterpillars became swollen and had white legs instead of their original black legs. The control caterpillars maintained their bright green/blue coloration and still had black legs. Both groups of caterpillars gained weight, however, the experimental group had a larger increase in weight.  In relation to our results, we were able to do further calculations and obtain the P-value, 0.75, and the T-value, 0.33. 


Discussion:
For this experiment, our hypothesis was that an increase of Juvenile Hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which pupation can occur. After conducting our experiment, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change, due to the fact that out p-value was 0.75. Our expectation was that an increase in JH would cause the caterpillars to have gone back to instar again. The caterpillars did obtain both weight gain and changes in coloration, however, there was not enough evidence to prove that the JH caused an alteration in their life cycle. The control group was expected to turn a yellow-brown color, indicating that they were ready to pupate and turn into adults. With this said, the control caterpillars did not experience this change. We believe that the reason the experiment went wrong, was the fact that the 5% addition of JH was not enough for a significant change to occur. In a study about juvenile hormone’s role in molting, pupation, and adult development it was discovered that, “the absence of juvenile hormone proves to be an obligatory feature of the initial phase of adult differentiation. If active corpora allata are implanted into a pupa so that adult development is initiated in the presence of juvenile hormone, the pupa develops and molts into a creature which is a mixture of pupa and adult. The higher the titer of juvenile hormone, the more extensive is the preservation of pupal character” (Carroll). Overall, the JH must be at a low level at the commitment pulse in order for it to mature into an adult.

Figure 1. This figure represents the average weight increases of the Manduca sexta caterpillars depending on the respective treatment given. From this graph, it is easy to compare the control and experimental groups, considering one can see that the experimental group consistently had larger daily weight gains.
