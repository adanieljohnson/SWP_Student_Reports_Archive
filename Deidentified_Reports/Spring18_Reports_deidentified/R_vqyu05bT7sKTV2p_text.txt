Title: Lack of change in agnostic behavior of Betta splendins in the presence of shelter

Abstract:
Animal behavior is a crucial part of survival and reproduction, and is just as important as physiology from an evolutionary standpoint. Agonistic behavior is aggressive behavior used as a competitive mechanism to improve chances of reproduction. The purpose of this experiment was to observe the behavior of Betta splendins both with and without the presence of a shelter option, and determine if there was a difference in the amount of agnostic behavior present. It was hypothesized that fish with access to shelter would display agnostic behavior for less time than if there were no shelter. The behavior of three replicates of pairs of Betta fish was observed in 5 minute intervals without shelter and then with shelter. The average fraction of time spent being agnostic was slightly higher with shelter than without. It was concluded that there was no significent difference in agnostic displays of behavior with the option of shelter vs. without it. These findings rule out positive or negative shelter as a reason for agnostic behavior in male Betta fish.


Introduction:
Behaviors that improve survival or reproductive fitness are extremely important adaptations in any species. Betta splendins are an ideal species to analyze when studying animal behavior because they exhibit many prominent behaviors in response to certain stimuli; specifically, agnostic, or aggressive behaviors. These agnostic behaviors arise in Betta splendins in intraspecific interactions, as male Betta fish tend to be very aggressive. This aggression is a competitive adaptation that improves the reproductive success of male Bettas as they physically compete for female mates [Chen, 2016]. It has both costs and benefits, as agnostic behavior is very expensive, but if this use of energy works out in a fish’s favor, they decrease their competition for a female mate and increase their chances of passing on their traits. The purpose of this experiment was to assess how the presence of a shelter affects the amount of time agnostic behavior is active. Shelter was chosen as a test variable because it has been observed in the past that fish tend to use shelter as a hiding place. The presence of shelter gives Betta fish the option to hide when confronted with an enemy, and it is worth exploring whether Betta fish still engage in agnostic behavior, or utilize a hiding place. It was hypothesized that fish with access to shelter will display agnostic behavior for less time than fish without shelter, as they will utilize the shelter present as a hiding place instead of expending energy on agnostic behavior.


Materials and Method:
Two male Betta splendins were acquired and put in a divided tank with an opaque separator for five minutes to allow adjustment time. The opaque divider was then lifted to only leave a transparent divider. For 5 minutes, the behavior of both fish was observed, and the time of each fish spent behaving agnostically was timed. At the end of the five-minute period, the opaque divider was returned to the tank and a shelter was put in each side of the container, followed by a 5 minute rest and acclimation period. The opaque divider was lifted again, and each fish was once again observed for the time spent behaving agnostically. This process was repeated twice more with a new pair of fish for each trial. The ratio of time of agnostic behavior out of the five minutes of observation was calculated for each fish of each trial. A paired t_test for significance was run testing the agnostic time ratios of fish without shelter to fish with shelter, with α=.05.


Results:
It was found that the time spent engaging in agnostic behavior was higher with the shelter than without (Figure 1). Using a paired t_test, it was found that there was no significent difference between time of agnostic behavior between the controll (n=6, x=.418, SD=.40) and shelter (n=6, x=.458, SD=.34) conditions (p=.69, d.f.=5 , t=.42).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that male Betta fish will be less agnostic in the presence of a shelter was not supported. In fact, the average time spent on agnostic behavior was higher on average for fish in the presence of shelter. This result likely occurred for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was found out after the experiment was conducted that Betta splendins do not typically utilize any form of shelter. Since the natural habitats of Betta fish are rice paddies, drainage ditches, river basins and small streams [Monvises, 2013], they are not adapted to live in environments with shelter-like structures. There were also many confounding variables that may have contributed to these results. The Betta fish used had already been used in previous experiments, so that may have altered their true reaction and intraspecific interactions, as they may have been habituated to the environment and knew the other fish was not a threat to them. Conversely, since the fish interacted twice within a fifteen-minute period, it may also be possible that this had an effect on their interactions, and made the fish more likely to act agnostically the second time because they were expecting a fight. This experiment and ones similar to it are very important to the study of animal behavior. Behavior is not just an indication of how species interact with one another, but all behaviors are genetic or adaptive, and can aid in the process of tracing ancestry and identifying favorable traits in a species [Alton, 2013]. An extension of this study could include creating new experimental conditions, like observing interactions with or without food present, with or without the presence of a female, or perhaps in a variety of light conditions, to name a few. There are many different factors that impact animal behavior in their environments, and it is important to explore many possibilities to get a better understanding of how a certain species may behave in a variety of conditions.
