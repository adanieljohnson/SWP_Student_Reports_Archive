Title: No correlation between color of Betta Splendens and intraspecific agonistic behavior 

Abstract:
Betta splendens (betta fish) are known to show signs of aggressive behavior, agonistic behavior, when in the presence of male or female betta fish. In threatening environments, they will display specific movements to show aggression. The behaviors displayed are classified by different levels of aggression and put into two categories: broadside movements and facing movements. In the experiment conducted, it is being tested whether blue fish are inherently more or less aggressive than red fish. This is being tested by exposing red betta fish to other red betta fish (separated by glass), and blue betta fish to other blue betta fish (separated by glass). By doing so, the number of times aggressive behavioral movements are performed will be recorded and averaged over a series of four trials per each color beta fish. In this experiment only facing movements will be studied - pelvic fin flaring (less aggressive) and branchiostegal membrane flaring (more aggressive). A two-sample t-test will be used to compare the facing movements in both red and blue betta fish. By the end of the experiment, it was concluded that the data supported the hypothesis, and there is no correlation between aggression and the color of betta fish when in the presence of one another. 

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. Behavioral studies have been conducted on Betta splendens (betta fish), also knowns as Siamese fighting fish, to categorize levels of aggression and agonistic behaviors (Regan, 2015). Originating in southeast Asia, these small fish display levels of no aggression to extreme aggression in the presence of other betta fish. Their intraspecific behavior is measured in categories: broadside and facing movements. The two categories, both broadside and facing, contain sub-levels of aggression. The sub-levels determine the type of aggression a betta is displaying: no aggression, moderate aggression, or extreme aggression in the movements they perform with specific body parts. To study betta fish, an experiment involving the intraspecific behavior between red and blue betta fish was examined in a laboratory setting. This process was repeated for each pair of red betta fish and each pair of blue betta fish. There were four pairs of each color fish, respectively. To measure aggression, only the frequency of pelvic fin flaring (moderate aggression) and branchiostegal membrane flaring (extreme aggression) were recorded between paired red betta fish and paired blue betta fish. The experiment was designed to test if blue betta fish would display more aggression in the presence of another blue betta fish or if red betta fish would display more aggression in the presence of another red betta fish. It was hypothesized that there would be no correlation in the levels of aggression based on the color of the betta fish. The results supported the hypothesis that there is no correlation between aggression and the color of betta fish when in presence of one another. 

Materials and Methods:
The first trial consisted of two betta blue fish in the presence of another. To begin the experiment, there were eight blue bettas and eight red bettas in separate tanks. Two of the eight betta fish (of the same color), were exposed to each other in a fish tank with a glass separator to avoid physical contact. They were exposed to each other for five-minute intervals. The behavior of blue betta fish was recorded over a span of four five-minute trials per each pair of blue betta fish. In between each trial the fish tested were replaced with another pair of blue betta fish. The number of pelvic flares and branchiostegal membrane flares was counted and recorded. The numbers were then averaged, a composition of all four trials. The same process was repeated with red betta fish. A two-sample t-test was used to statically determine the correlation of paired blue or red betta fish. P-values were calculated for the red and blue betta fish facing movements: frequency of pectoral fin movements and frequency of branchiostegal membrane flaring.

Results:
The data supports the hypothesis of aggression – there is no correlation between aggression and color. The p-values for the levels of aggression were high. Figure one shows the frequency of pectoral fin movements with a p-value of 0.22. Figure two shows the frequency of brancheological membrane movements with a p-value of 0.16.  Since the p-values are both greater than the significance level, the probability of the experimental outcome is largely due to chance.

Discussion:
The data did support the hypothesis, and there is no correlation between the color of betta fish and intraspecific aggression. According to the data, both p-values were above the significance level, indicating that the experimental results are largely due to random chance. Both paired red and blue betta fish show no indication of patterned aggression for the duration of the four, five-minute trials. It is possible that color and aggression in betta fish evolve independently and there will never be correlation between the two characteristics. This impacted the betta’s health significantly, thus negatively influencing the data collected. While the betta fish tested did not show high levels of aggression in the presence of other betta fish, they are known to be aggressive fish with special and unique parental care behavior (Forsatkar, 2017). 
	In an experiment conducted in 2017, male betta fish showed high levels of aggression in the presence of bubble nests, female betta nests. In this experiment gill flaring (high level of aggression) and fin spreading (moderate level of aggression) were studied. It was concluded that in order to protect territory, around the bubble nests, Siamese fighting fish show patterns of aggression towards intruders. This includes aggression towards both sexes. In another experiment, color polymorphism was looked at in teleost fish. In this experiment teleost fishes were observed to have changed their color pattern rapidly that related to phontypic plasticity that links with aggressive behavior (Besson, 2018). Color of teleost fish showed a correlation to aggression. 
	Overall, the experiment conducted on betta fish did support the hypothesis but could be altered by adding territorial influence (bubble nests) or adding a female betta to the experiment. Another alternative would be, instead of using beta fish, to use teleost fish to investigate the color of fish and aggression.
