Title: Phenotypic Variation in Root-to-Shoot Ratios of Buckwheat Plants

Abstract:
This experiment examines the root-to-shoot ratios of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), a semi-succulent plant. My hypothesis that plants grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil was not supported. Buckwheat was planted in six pots: two with sand, two with soil, and two with a 50/50 mixture of sand and soil. After two weeks, root: shoot ratios were determined for length and weight. The results show a pattern where sand and mixed pots generate buckwheat with heavier roots. If a plant expends more energy on longer, or heavier roots, they may not have enough energy left to have more leaves for capturing sunlight for photosynthesis. Plants that are grown in sand and the mix of soil and sand allocated longer roots to reach the water that sank to the bottom of the pots. This experiment applies to the broader context of sea level rise and erosion. Plants in coastal areas grow long roots into the sand in order to hold dunes together. By studying root-to-shoot ratios of different species of plants, we can determine which plants are suitable to preserve beaches and coastal areas.   

Introduction:
Phenotypic variation in plants is flexible so they can allocate resources within the context of their environments. One example of phenotypic allocation is plants extending their roots to increase the root-to-shoot ratios when water is scarce or nutrients are low. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a semi-succulent plant that produces nutritious triangular seeds. In another experiment, root growth was favored when N, P, or S were the major growth constraints. The opposite pattern obtained when K, Mg, and Mn restricted growth. Shortage of Ca, Fe, and Zn had almost no effect on the root: shoot ratio. (Ericsson: 1995) Phenotypic allocation is important to study because it can determine the plasticity of a species in an environment which may become crucial due to climate change. Climate change is perpetuating food scarcity around the world and in the future, people my need to find new and innovative ways to produce food in the evolving climate. My hypothesis is that plants grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil. Additionally, the water may sink to the bottom in sand since sand particles are larger than soil particles and the roots may have to grow longer to reach it. The independent variable is the soil, sand, or 50/50 mixture of sand and soil that the plants are grown in and the dependent variable is the root: shoot ratio. 

Materials and Method:
First, we collected six pots and filled two with only sand, two with soil, and two with a 50/50 mixture of sand and soil. Next, we watered each pot thoroughly and poured an even amount of miracle grow over each pot. Then, we evenly planted a hand.f.ul of buckwheat seeds in each pot. For the next two weeks, we watered the plants each day. In order to be consistent with watering, we watered the plants around noon each day. After the two-week period, we emptied the pots one by one into a warm water bath to separate the individual buckwheat plants. We gently pulled the roots apart and lay the individual plants on a paper towel to dry. Next, we cut the plants to separate the roots from the shoots and measured each in centimeters. Finally, we ran an ANOVA test followed by a Tukey-Kramer test to test for significance. 

Results:
Figure 1. shows the weight ratios for root-to-shoot in grams for three groups: controll (soil), mixed (50% sand 50% soil), and sand. The mean for the controll (n=3) is 0.097 with a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.041. The mean for the mixed (n=3) is 0.302 with a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.075. The mean for the sand (n=3) is 0.310 with a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.079. P= 0.014. The difference between the controll and mixed is significent, and the difference between the controll and sand is significent. However, the difference between the mixed and the sand was not significent. Figure 2. shows the length ratios for root-to-shoot in centimeters for three groups: controll (soil), mixed (50% sand 50% soil), and sand. The mean for the controll (n=3) is 0.844 with a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.301. The mean for mixed (n=3) is 0.880 with a standard deviation of plus or minus 0.383. The mean for sand (n=3) is 0.846 with a standard deviation of 0.171. The results have a pattern that shows the sand and mixed pots generating buckwheat plants with heavier roots. Upon visual observation, the buckwheat in all six pots looked similar with many green sprouts with long, thin stems as pictured in figure 3. There were no noticeable differences between plants in the six pots. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that plants grown in sand will have a higher root: shoot ratio for weight and length due to the lower nutrient density in the sand vs soil was not supported. Instead, the results have a pattern that shows the sand and mixed pots generating buckwheat plants with heavier roots. Although the roots were heavier they were not necessarily longer in comparison to the shoots. The biological reasoning for this could be because the shoots have leaves. With phenotypic allocation, plants do not want to expend too much energy on unnecessary structures. If a plant must expend more energy on longer, or heavier roots, they may not have enough energy left to have more leaves for capturing sunlight for photosynthesis. The weight of the leaves would have more of an impact on the calculations than the weight of the leaves since the leaves are large in comparison to the rest of the plant, however they do not necessarily add height. The plants with longer roots were planted in the sand and mixed pots. They had fewer leaves and therefore the root: shoot ratios were higher for the plants with longer roots. The water sank to the bottom of the pots with sand and mixed and therefore plants had to expend more energy to reach the resources they needed with the roots. The reason that there was no significent difference between the mixed and the sand but there was a significent difference between the mixed and the soil could have been because the mixed with the soil had did not enough soil to keep the water from trickling down to the very bottom of the pot. The soil particles are very fine, however, the sand particles are very large and they may have created enough open spaces for water to continue to fall to the bottom of the pots. 
	As climates across the world are changing, seawater levels are rising. Sea level rise poses threats to all aquatic plant community types in the vicinity of the oceans, and changes in weather patterns and salinity will affect many. (Short, et al.: 2016) Many sand beaches are eroding due to sea level rise and plants are placed in sand in order to keep dunes intact and to keep beaches from washing away. These plants grow long roots into the sand in order to hold dunes together. They are able to grow these long roots because the water sinks deep into the sand and the plants must allocate in order acquire the nutrients. By studying root-to-shoot ratios of different species of plants, we can determine which plants are suitable to preserve beaches and coastal areas.
