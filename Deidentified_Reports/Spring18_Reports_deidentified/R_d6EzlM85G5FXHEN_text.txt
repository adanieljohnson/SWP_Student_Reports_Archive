Title: Impact of Martin's IGR on the Growth and Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
IGR’s or Insect Growth Regulators, are compounds that mimic or inhibit certain hormones of insects required for proper growth. In this experiment, Martin’s IGR was used to mimic the effect of Juvenile Hormone on the growth and development of Manduca sexta. By doing a small amount of Martin’s IGR to their diet, we were able to determine the extent to which excess JH can negatively impact the growth of Manduca sexta. The hypothesis of this experiment is that a small amount of Martin’s IGR will in fact result in smaller, less developed caterpillars. After a week of massing the the control group of caterpillars (no Martin’s IGR) and the experimental group (Martin’s IGR added), it is clear that the IGR did in fact slow the growth of the caterpillars, even making the experimental group look pale and unhealthy.


Introduction:
Insect Growth Regulators, or IGRs, are chemical compounds that can either mimic or inhibit certain hormones of insects which can result in inhibited growth and development of those insects, so much so that researcher Carroll Williams coined the term “Third Generation Pesticides” to describe them. [Oberlander, 2000]. Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the Tobacco hornworm, is a well studied insect that feeds on tobacco leaves, going through five instars of development before molting into a moth. Their large size and short development make them ideal insects to be studied, including the effects that IGRs have upon them. [Reinecke, 1980]. One commonly available IGR, Martin’s IGR, mimics the effects of JH, or Juvenile Hormone, a long chain of organic molecules produced in the Corpus Allata. JH, crucial for the development of Manduca sexta, regulates the “type” of molt that the worms undergo. In other words, JH regulates which of the five phases of molting will occur [Johnson 2016]. Going forward, the alternate hypothesis of this experiment is that even a small amount of Martin’s IGR added to the diet of Manduca sexta will be harmful to the growth and development of these organisms. The null hypothesis is that there will be no substantial effect on the growth and development of these worms.


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight Manduca sexta with weights 0.75 g to 1.75 g will be separated into two groups. Each group of caterpillars will be split in two containers, with an index card separating each caterpillar in each container. In other words, 2 control caterpillars are placed into one container, with an index card separating them. The other 2 control caterpillars are placed in another container, etc. One group, the control group,  will be fed a standard diet of 10 grams Great Lake Mandica diet per worm, with 8 drops of water added, recommended by the diet manufacturer. The other will undergo the same protocol, but with 8 drops of Martin’s IGR added to the food of each of the four experimental worms’ food. The worms will then be stored in an incubator at 25 degrees C. Everyday for a week, the worms will be massed, observed for any physical changes, and given a fresh 10 grams of food (with the experimental group given 8 drops of Martin’s IGR each). At the end of the week, the masses of the eight worms will be compared, as well as their physical appearance. Using this data, one will be able to determine whether or not the hypothesis stated above is true. A two-sample T test will then be used to determine whether or not the null hypothesis is true.


Results:
After a week of study, the differences between the two groups of worms are clear. The control group (not IGR added) had, on average, substantially higher masses than the control group, which was given the Martin’s IGR each day. There was a constant increase in mass among both groups of caterpillars, with the control group growing faster than the experimental. The average results can be seen in Table 1 below. Also notable was the physical appearance of the worms: the experimental group was visibly smaller and much paler in color than the control group.The result of the two-sample T test was 0.41697419.


Discussion:
Given the data and the result of the two-sample T Test, the experiment seems to have proved the alternate hypothesis as true. Essentially, it seems that even a small amount of Martin’s IGR has a negative impact on the growth of Manduca sexta. The experimental group had smaller masses overall and looked less healthy in appearance.  Given the simplicity of the experiment, it is highly unlikely that any mistakes were made. The experiment, however, could be repeated again to verify its accuracy. If one desired to determine if a smaller amount of IGR would be beneficial to the worms, they could perhaps repeat the experiment using four drops of Martin’s IGR rather than 8, and repeat until a preferable amount, if any, is found. However, it seems apparent that even small amounts of IGR is harmful to Manduca sexta, and the implications of this finding could be related to endocrine systems of other organisms. It seems that, given these specific results, no organism should be given or made to produce excess hormones, for doing so could have serious impacts on their growth, development, or physiology as a whole.
