Title: The Effect of the Introduction of Copper Sulfate to the Soil on Plant Growth and Root to Shoot Ratio in Vigna Radiata 

Abstract:
Copper has been seen to cause both beneficial and detrimental effects to plant growth and photosynthesis. This experiment attempted to determine the effect of the addition of copper on the growth of a plant, and it was predicted that the root to shoot ratio would decrease and that the plant growth as a whole would increase. However, the data did not suggest this. There was no statistically significant difference between the root to shoot ratio, and in fact there was a statistically significant decrease in plant growth by mass caused by the copper introduced to the soil. 

Introduction:
Copper has been proven to be both harmful and beneficial to the growth of a plant. Copper intake significantly reduced the CO2 uptake by the plant due to stomatal closure, as well as impairing root growth when present in the soil [Vinit-Dunand, 2002; Sheldon 2005]. However, copper is a primary element in the protein called plastocyanin, which plays a role in the electron transport chain, as well as playing a role in the production of amino acids [Horváth, 1997; Festa, 2011]. Thus, it is valuable to know whether the introduction of copper into the soil would be beneficial or detrimental to plant growth and what its affect would be on the root:shoot ratio. To this point, we hypothesize that the introduction of copper will decrease the root to shoot ratio (because we predict the roots will decrease in size and the shoots increase when the copper treatment is applied) as well as the overall size (mass and length) of the plant. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to test the hypothesis, we set up three treatment groups and three control groups, each containing approximately 50 mungbean (Vigna Radiata) seeds, planted in vermiculite soil. Each pot was watered daily-to the point that water dripped through the bottom of the pot-with the treatment group receiving 50 mL of 10 micro-molar CuSO4 daily. Then, following two weeks of growth, the plants were then removed from the dirt by placing the root clumping into a tub of water, in order to remove the dirt, and then randomly selecting 5 samples per pot, which were then used to record the data. Of the groups, the largest plant was measured and recorded, and then the group was weight and the mass recorded for all six groups. We then ran a set of two-sample t-tests to determine whether the difference in the root to shoot ratio and the difference in plant length were statistically significant.

Results:
The results of this experiment seem to be predominately inconclusive, but in terms of the effect on the mass of shoots, copper had a statistically significant negative affect. Though the graph of the root to shoot ratio does suggest an increase in the root to shoot ratio (as suggested by Figure 1), the difference is not statistically significant, as the p-value under a two-sample t-test with four degrees of freedom (  = 0.05) was 0.082 and 0.407366 (mass and length respectively). However, the experiment did reveal a statistically significant decrease (see Figure 2) in the mass of shoots (and by extension the total mass of the plant), as the p-value was 0.0101, less than the significance level (  = 0.05), and thus giving sufficient evidence that copper has a negative effect on the mass of the shoots in V. Raiata.

Discussion:
Because there was a statistically significant decrease in the total mass of the plant; the hypothesis that copper in the soil would improve the growth of the plant has sufficient evidence to be rejected. The data does not give a conclusion either way on the change in the root shoot ratio for either, but the p-value was very close to the rejection region for the R:S ratio based on mass, and therefore it would be worth doing furthering testing with a larger sample size in order to determine whether there is in fact no difference or our sample sizes were just too small. There did not seem to be any significant difference in the length of either the root or shoot, nor in the mass of the roots. The fact that the copper reduced the shoot mass gives credence to the data that suggests that copper shuts the stomata [Vinit-Dunand 2002], as well as suggesting that this detriment has a more negative affect on the plant then any benefits to photosynthesis would have. For further testing, it would be good to increase the sample sizes, as well as add more treatment groups with varying levels of copper, in case certain levels are beneficial while others are detrimental.
