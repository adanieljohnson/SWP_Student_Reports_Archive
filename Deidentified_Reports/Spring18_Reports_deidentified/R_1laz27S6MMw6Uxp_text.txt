Title: The effects of Lidocaine on the Gastrocnemius Muscle contraction in Rania pipiens 

Abstract:
Rania pipiens legs go through muscle contraction like most other vertebrates. Muscle contraction happens when action potentials release Acetylcholine, leading to the increase in calcium ions. Contraction ends when the calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Lidocaine blocks the sodium gates from opening, so contraction should not occur as it does when Lidocaine is not present. We believe that by injecting Rania pipiens legs with Lidocaine (into the Gastrocnemius Muscle), it will cause the muscle to contract less than when Lidocaine is not present. Our results show that when Lidocaine is present, we can not confidently conclude that there is a difference in muscle contraction when Lidocaine is and is not present (paired t_test: p= 0.368). These results show us that with more testing, Lidocaine can possibly be used in order to slow down muscle contraction in animals, and this can be very important in the treatment of problems where muscles are contracting too frequently. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle is important because it allows vertebrates to move by muscle contraction. Muscles are able to contract because action potentials cause the release of Acetylcholine. The release of Acetylcholine causes sodium gates to open, and more action potentials are produced. These action potentials cause the release of calcium ions into the muscle, which causes the muscle to contract. Contraction ends when calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2018].  In this experiment, we will be examining the effect of Lidocaine (a sodium channel inhibitor) on the contraction of a Rania pipiens (frog) leg (especially looking at the Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius Muscle). We use this animal because it is relatively easy to expose the Gastrocnemius Muscle and Sciatic Nerve. Previous studies have examined the effects of Lidocaine on the tracheal muscle in pigs, and what effect the Lidocaine has on muscle contraction. The results found that the Lidocaine decreases muscle contraction and causes muscle relaxation because the concentration of calcium present during contraction decreased. [Tetsuya: 1993]. We believe that because the sodium channels are inhibited when Lidocaine is injected, the Gastrocnemius Muscle will contract less than when the leg does not have Lidocaine in it because action potentials will not be able to be produced, therefore decreasing the amount of calcium pumped into the muscle. 

Materials and Method:
We prepared two Rania pipiens legs by removing the skin, exposing the Sciatic Nerve, and detaching the Gastrocnemius Muscle from the rest of the leg. We then set up the leg to the force transducer as shown in Figure 1. We used the iWorx software to send the stimulus into the Gastrocnemius Muscle to make it contract. We found our minimum stimulus to be at an amplitude of 2 Volts. From there, we measured the voltage of the three contractions. We then injected the leg with 0.1 Ml of 25 mM Lidocaine, and we measure three contractions of the muscle at the same minimum stimulus. We repeated this process with our second Rania pipiens leg, but the minimum stimulus was at an amplitude of 0.5 Volts, and we measured the voltage of the three contractions. We injected the leg with the same amount of Lidocaine as we did for the first leg, and we measured three contractions. The independent variable in our experiment was whether the leg had been injected with Lidocaine or not. The dependent variable was the voltage of the contraction we recorded. We used a paired t_test in order to determine the statistical significance of our results. 

Results:
Our Rania pipiens leg showed no difference in the strength of contraction before and after being injected with Lidocaine (Figure 2; Paired T-test: p=0.368; t=1.53; d.f.= 1).  The difference between the response voltage for the first leg pre-and-post injection was -0.131 V, and the difference between the response voltage for the second leg pre-and-post injection was -0.625 V.  Both legs did show a decrease in voltage after the Lidocaine injection (Figure 3), but not enough of a difference to show a statistically significent difference between the two groups. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our results. We believed that the Lidocaine would cause the Gastrocnemius Muscle to contract less than when the leg was not injected with Lidocaine. Our p_value (p= 0.368) does not confirm that there was a difference in the experimental and controll groups. Our results differ to those found in previous studies where the muscle contracts less because action potentials cannot be produced when the sodium channels are blocked [Tetsuya: 1993]. The first Rania pipiens leg we used had some problems, as we could not get the muscle to contract because the Sciatic Nerve was too small to deliver the stimulus to the muscle. As a result, we had to put the stimulus directly into the muscle instead of the stimulus going through the nerve first. This could be the cause of a bigger difference in our second Rania pipiens leg (that we could properly deliver the stimulus to) and the first Rania pipiens leg. Our results show that Lidocaine could potentially be useful in the treatment of problems where some muscles contract more than they should. The Lidocaine is able to block the sodium gates, so the motor neurons will not depolarize, and action potentials will not be able to be produced, which causes smaller contractions, which could be useful in the treatment of some muscle problems. [Johnson: 2018]. However, in order to confirm this conclusion, more testing would have to be done. Our experiment could have been improved by running more trials with more frog legs.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This is one of our Rania pipens leg. The Gastrocnemius Muscle is the part of the leg that is being held up. The force stimulus probes were placed directly into the muscle in order to make the muscle contract properly. The Sciatic Nerve is not entirely visible in this photograph, but it is a white nerve located behind the Gastrocnemius Muscle. 
Figure 2. Two Rania pipiens legs were injected with 25 mM of Lidocaine. The response voltage of the controll (that was not injected with Lidocaine) and treatment groups is shown. Before the injection, the response of the muscle contraction was 0.4295 V (the average of 0.221 V and 0.638 V). After the injection, the response of the muscle contraction was 0.0515 V (the average of 0.09 V and 0.013 V). The p_value of the paired t_test was 0.368, showing that there was no difference between the controll and treatment group. 
 Figure 3. Two Rania pipiens legs were injected with 25mM of Lidocaine. The Gastrocnemius Muscle contraction was measured with the same stimulus before and after the Lidocaine was injected. These were the averages and standard deviations for the three trials we ran for each group. The average response for the leg 1 controll group was 0.22V +/- 0.0146V, the average response for leg 1 experimental group was 0.09V +/- 0.0151V. The average response for the leg 2 controll group was 0.638V +/- 0.0062V, and the average response for the leg 2 experimental group was 0.013V +/- 0.001V.
