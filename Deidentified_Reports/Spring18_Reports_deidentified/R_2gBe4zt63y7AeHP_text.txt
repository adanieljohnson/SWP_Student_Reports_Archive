Title: Presence of Juvenile Hormone on the Growth of (Manduca sexta) Larvae

Abstract:
The experiment conducted studied the effects of juvenile hormone (JH) on the growth of (Manduca sexta), a type of caterpillar. The experiment was conducted to determine if the presence of JH would inhibit the growth of the caterpillars as they prepared to enter into another instar. It tested eight caterpillars, that were split into two separate groups and received different kinds of food/diet. The experimental  group was presented with a diet that contained addition amounts of JH for each caterpillar. The caterpillars were kept in a constant environment of approximately 25℃ and were kept in containers of the same size. The insignificance of the experiment states that the experiment is not scientifically proven. 

Introduction:
(Manduca sexta) rely on ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) for survival. Both hormones controll the growth of the caterpillar as it processes through its instars and makes it pupa. There are several commonly used chemicals that act as JH substitutes or repressors. The addition of such chemicals would cause the molting of the caterpillar before the 5th instar to change. 20E controlls the timing of the molt, while JH changes the type of molt. “Application of juvenile hormone (either JH I or a mimic, epoxygeranylsesamole) just before the onset of ocellar retraction at the beginning of the prepupal period prevents this precocious adult differentiation” (Kiguchi,1978). If additional JH is placed into the diet of caterpillars, then the caterpillars will grow slower, if at all, as they will not advance into the next instar of their cycle. 


Materials and Method:
1. 	Selected eight caterpillars, before their commitment pulse (11-14 days old), and separate them into two groups of four.
2. 	Placed a controll and a treatment in a container that is separated and labeled with an index card. Repeated with the three other containers.
3. 	Feed each set of caterpillars one of four diets, each varying with the concentration of added JH. 10 g of premade food with approximately 10 drops of water to soften. 
Control: Food that was given to the class that was previously prepared
Experimental: The normal food with two drops, four drops, six drops and eight drops of AzaMax added (In place of 10 drops of water, replace with the drops of AzaMax, i.e., 2 drops of AzaMax with 8 drops of water). 
4. 	Placed all four containers into an incubator that kept the caterpillars at a constant environment of 25ºC.
5. 	Measured and recorded the weight of the caterpillars daily.


Results:
The results of the experiment did not show an overall, general trend, however, many smaller trends can be noticed. Such as, over the seven-day period, the controll group was on average 84% larger than the experimental group. Also, the controll group tended to be more active and more likely to attempt to attack the experimenter than the experimental group. The caterpillars presented with normal blue, green color and none of them molted. As expected, the controll group was not only larger, but had a slightly more vibrant color than the treatment group. A two sample t_test was ran and it was founded that the mean of the controll group was not significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=.31, d.f.= 12, P=.76).


Discussion:
  The hypothesis of this experiment, although proven by the experiment that the controll group did in fact grow more slowly, has to be rejected due to human error and significance. The results concur with the hypothesis in that the experimental  group did not grow near as large as the controll group and the vast difference in size (Figure 1.) The increase in JH would help prohibit the caterpillars from entering their next instar and would cause them to decrease in size. The human error that occurred in the experiment was that the caterpillars were not given new food every single day. This means that the food that had been left in their containers would have dried out or could have been contaminated, resulting in false results. This can be presumed because thea one day that the food was changed, due to the food having all been eaten, the controll group had nearly doubled in size (Figure 1). Another error occurred when the test subjects made their way onto the opposing side of the container. This occurred twice; on day two, treatment 3 crawled onto controll 3’s side, and on day 5, treatment 4 crawled onto controll 4’s side. There was no way to figure out which caterpillar belonged on that side originally, besides measuring their weights and placing the most probable on the side.  
	The significance of the experiment is another factor as to why the hypothesis had to be rejected. With a P-value of 0.76, the experiment is proven not statistically significent and the hypothesis must be rejected (Figure 2).  The statistical significance speaks to whether or not the experiment has any real value. A P-value of less than or equal to 0.05 would allow the experiment to be significent because it would mean that 99.5% of the time, the experiment would yield the same or extremely similar results. 
	In previously studied experiments where the results were deemed significent, it was determined that the controll group would grow faster than the experimental. Also, “During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)...The actual release of PTTH occurs at the very first photo-periodic gate after the JH has disappeared from the haemolymph. A functional failure of this normal mechanism is apparently responsible for the developmental standstill of Lepidoptera which diapause as mature larvae” (Nijhout, Williams, 1974).  The experiment states that the presence of JH would inhibit the caterpillar’s ability to advance in instar stages. The insignificance and grave human error prove enough to reject the hypothesis in the conducted experiment , although previous experiments and research support it.
