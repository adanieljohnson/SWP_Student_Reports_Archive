Title: The Effect of Nicotinic ACh Receptor Antagonist on the Minimum Threshold of Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
In the following experiment, the effect of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist on two different frog legs is demonstrated. A frog leg generally undergoes muscle contraction when an action potential is generated and calcium is released into the sarcoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. If the nicotinic postsynaptic receptors are inhibited, it is predicted that muscle contraction will decrease and the minimum threshold of contraction will increase. From the experiment, it is determined that nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist increased the minimum threshold of muscle contraction. Because of this, the results support the hypothesis. The null hypothesis was rejected after achieving p-values of 4.35 E-9 for frog leg one and 8.04 E-8 for frog leg two, which are both less than 0.05.


Introduction:
In this experiment, exercises are completed to test the effectiveness of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist on a frog leg. This is done by isolating the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg. [1] A frog leg is used to demonstrate the specific properties of neuromuscular control. The iWorx data system is used to show clear and accurate results. The independent variable is the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist and the dependent variable is minimum threshold. Two frog legs are used are used to show two different trials of the experiment. Nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist is predicted to increase the minimum threshold of muscle contraction since the antagonist will not allow the ACh receptor to function. In other words, the nicotinic postsynaptic receptors are inhibited. In past experiments, nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist reduced amplitude and inhibits muscular contraction [2]. Once the postsynaptic receptors are inhibited, ACh cannot bind to its receptor, and muscle contraction will lower since an action potential is not generated. It is hypothesized that if a frog leg is treated with nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist, then the minimum threshold of muscle contraction is increased. The alternative hypothesis is that nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist affects the minimum threshold of muscle contraction, so the threshold of muscle contraction may be varied by nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. The null hypothesis is that nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist does not affect the threshold of muscle contraction, so the threshold of muscle contraction is not varied by nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. It is predicted that the alternative hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected. A T test and statistics are used to analyze the data.


Materials and Methods:
Two frog legs were prepared and rinsed with frog ringer solution. Each leg was skinned and the skin was pulled down towards the foot. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. The nerve was freed from the connective tissue using a dissecting needle and forceps. A frog leg was hung up by a cloth string. Gray wire was wrapped around the top and the bottom of the gastrocnemius muscle. Black and red clips were attached to the gray wire. The threshold of muscle contraction was found for leg 1. The same was done for leg 2. Each leg was then injected with 2 mL of 1 mM tubocurarine and waited 10 minutes. The threshold of muscle contraction was found for each treatment leg. A t-test was used to analyze two population means using statistics to interpret the data. It was also used to find any significant different in the means of the two populations.

Results:
Both figures show general trends in the data. In both figures, the treatment group has a higher minimum threshold of muscle contraction than the control group. This makes sense since the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist is supposed to raise the threshold since muscle contraction is decreased. In other words, more voltz is required to stimulate muscle contraction in the treatment groups. This proves that the procedure is successful. Once the p-value of each frog leg is determined, further observations and conclusions can be drawn about the hypothesis. The mean minimal threshold of contraction for the first frog leg control group was 0.144 g+/-0.00547 g. The mean minimal threshold of contraction for first frog leg experimental group was 0.236 g+/-0.00547 g, which was significantly different from the control (p=4.35 E-9, t=26.56), due to the p-value below 0.05. The mean minimal threshold of contraction for the second frog leg control group was 0.194 g+/-0.00547 g. The mean minimal threshold of contraction for second frog leg experimental group was 0.252 g+/-0.00447 g, which was significantly different from the control (p=8.04E-8, t=18.34), due to the p-value below 0.05.

Discussion:
The results from this experiment demonstrate the effectiveness of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist on the minimum threshold of muscle contraction in frog legs. The minimum threshold of muscle contraction is predicted to increase for the treatment group since the muscle needed a higher voltage to stimulate. The antagonist blocked the receptors, so calcium could not be released into the sarcoplasm. Based off of the data from both frog legs, the null hypothesis is rejected since both p-values are less than 0.05. This is as predicted since nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist prevented ACh from binding to its receptor. In a similar experiment conducted by Verónica Nassar-Gentina, Luz Catalán and Mario Luxoro, it was found that the nicotinic receptor antagonist inhibited ACh-induced calcium secretion from cultured porcine chromaffin cells [3]. Aothern experiment conducted by PJ Blommaart proved that high concentrations of  guanethidine block nicotine-induced relaxations of muscle strips in rats. It was later shown that this blockage occurred at the nicotinic ACh receptor. [4] In the future, more trials should be run when conducting this experiment. It is important to understand the effect of this antagonist through many trials since it may not be effective every time. From the experiment, it is shown that the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist had a strong effect on each frog leg.
