Title: Measuring the Effect of AzaGuard on the Growth Rate of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment covered the effect of that hormone blockers, specifically AzaGuard, have on the life cycle of Manduca sexta.  AzaGuard works by lowering the level of ecdysterone in the insectâ€™s body, thereby inhibiting its growth and preventing it from moving on to the next stage in its life cycle.  Our hypothesis was that the insects who consumed the AzaGuard would fail to molt and as a result die.  We began by splitting 8 of these insects up into 2 groups where one group was fed food not containing AzaGuard and the other group was fed food with AzaGuard.  We recorded their measurements in weight and length and compared the two groups at the end of the 7-day experiment. After comparing the results, it was evident that AzaGuard did in fact hinder the growth of the Manduca sexta because the average growth of the controll group was much higher than the average growth of the experimental group. My hypothesis was incorrect in that I predicted the animals who consumed the AzaGuard would eventually die.  This did not turn out to be true but a longer experiment could prove my hypothesis correct. 

Introduction:
	Every organism in the world goes through a life cycle. The one constant to organismal life cycles is that they are controllled and regulated by bodily hormones.  Insect life cycles are beneficial to study because they go through very distinct stages that can be manipulated with the addition or inhibition of specific hormones.  The Manduca sexta is an insect that feeds mainly on the tobacco plants of farmers.  The benefit of using this insect is that previous studies have revealed the specific stages and hormones involved in its life cycle.  It has 5 larval stages which are separated by molts, and is primarily regulated by the 2 hormones Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. [Johnson: 2018]. Before the 5th larval stage the Manduca sexta undergoes what is known as a commitment pulse.  At this point, the level of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the body is lowered which signals that the larvae are ready to molt and start the pupil stage.  Only once JH is lowered in the endocrine system can the insect begin the transition to the adult stage. [Hatem: 2015]. When JH levels drop, the prothoracic gland will release ecdysterone in order to trigger the molting process.  We decided to test the question of what would happen if ecdysterone levels failed to increase.  In order to test this, we introduced the Manduca sexta to AzaGuard, a hormone blocker of ecdysterone.  The effects on the growth of the Manduca sexta were able to be compared to a normal growth rate by use of a controll group consisting of insects not exposed to the AzaGuard.  My prediction is that the insects that consume the AzaGuard will have their molting process inhibited, causing the Manduca sexta to die. 
[Johnson: 2018]


Materials and Method:
	We began by separating the Manduca sexta into two distinct groups.  Four animals were assigned to the controll group and the other four animals constituted our experimental group. Each insect was placed into a container but received either the controll diet, or the experimental diet.  That caterpillars in the controll group were given 10g of food with 10 drops of distilled water added, while the caterpillars in the experimental group were given 10g of food traced with 7 drops of AzaGuard in it.  Every day for the next 7 days the animals were weighed by scale and measured to determine length.  At the end of the study a two-sample t_test was used to compare the findings from the controll group and experimental group for differences in weight and length.  In addition to recording values for weight and length, we measured the weight of the food for each caterpillar at the start of the experiment and at the conclusion of it.  This was to compare which animals ate more of their diet and which ate less. 


Results:
	According to our measurements, the average weight and the average length of the Manduca sexta in the controll group increased significently over time.  In contrast, the average weight and length of the experimental group increased minimally from the initial day.  Also, when comparing the amount of food ate between the two groups, the controll ate more food and at a faster pace.  By day 5, each caterpillar in the controll ate all 10g of their food allotment. No caterpillar in the experimental group had even finished their food by the end of the experiment.  Our two-tale t_test results showed that our P-value was 0.012 and our standard deviation was 1.039.  This is meaningful because it shows our data was statistically significent and had a 95% confidence interval.  


Discussion:
Based on the data collected by our group, what we expected to happen did occur.  The Manduca sexta that consumed the AzaGuard failed to grow in comparison to the controll group and thereby could not move to the next phase of their life cycle.  This happened because the AzaGuard prevented the release of ecdysone into the bloodstream by the prothoracic gland.  The presence of this hormone is what signals to the brain that it is time to consume large amounts of food in preparation of pupation, the stage in between larva and adulthood.  The fact that the caterpillars who were not given the variable of AzaGuard continued to grow in weight and length strengthens this concept because there was nothing there to block the secretion of ecdysterone.  However, as you can tell by looking at the data, the growth of these caterpillars seemed to drop off at the end of the week.  I believe this is only because they ran out of food by day 5 and had nothing else to eat to continue their steady growth.  The other part of my hypothesis included that the Manduca sexta that consumed AzaGuard would eventually die.  This did not turn out to be true, making my hypothesis not completely accurate.  One way to further this experiment is to continue it for a longer period of time to see if eventually the Manduca sexta died as a result from long-term exposure to AzaGuard.  In total, it is clear that the presence of a hormone blocker significently impacts the life cycle of a growing Manduca sexta as it prohibits key periods such as the commitment pulse.
