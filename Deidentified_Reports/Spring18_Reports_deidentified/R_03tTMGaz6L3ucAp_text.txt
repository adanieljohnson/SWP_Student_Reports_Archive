Title: Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The aim of this lab was to test the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction, specifically in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. We hypothesized that adding caffeine to the gastrocnemius would lead to stronger muscle contractions. We measured the amplitude voltage of a muscle to an electric stimulus to the gastrocnemius muscle. We used the same leg for the control (no injection), and treatment (injected with caffeine) groups. We found that once the muscle was injected with caffeine, it underwent chemically induced tetany, and felt hard and tense to the touch. However, our data was not statistically significant and was unable to support our hypothesis.

Introduction:
In vertebrates, skeletal muscle is composed of myofibers, cylindrical groups of multi-nuclear cells [Johnson: 2018]. In the fibers motor neurons, located in the grey matter of the spinal cord, stimulate muscle contraction through neuromuscular junctions. This process is initiated by a stimulus, and then initiates an action potential which travels down the icon to the synapse, where it releases neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ACh then initiates an action potential in the muscle fiber, causing Ca2+ to be released from the SR (sarcoplasmic reticulum), triggering the sliding of myosin and actin filaments, causing contraction. Summation occurs when action potentials generated by motor neurons is added to produce muscle tension. Within summation, there is temporal and spatial summation. Spatial summation is the condition when a number of motor neurons fire at the same time, causing a greater force. Temporal summation is when a neuron fires repeatedly, helping the threshold to be reached quicker. Both summations cause a twitch - when axons are stimulated often and repeatedly enough and build upon each other to create a sustained contraction. At the point where maximum force is created, tetanus results. However, the muscle eventually runs out of ATP and myosin and actin separate. The muscle relaxes, called fatigue. Fatigue is distinct from the relaxation stage of contraction because even the muscle cannot be re-contracted when it is fatigued [Johnson: 2018]. Caffeine is the drug that we will use to test muscle contraction strength. Caffeine is a xanthine alkaloid which acts as a central nervous system stimulant by reducing drowsiness and restoring alertness [Olorunshola: 2011]. For our purposes, we will use the leg of a Rana pipiens, specifically the gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve. We hypothesize that if caffeine is directly injected into the gastrocnemius, the flow of calcium ions in the muscle will be optimized. thus, the muscle will have more intense contractions. 

Materials and Methods:
We used three Rana pipiens legs to test the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction. Each leg was used as both a control and an experimental group, as we treated each leg after the control tests. We removed the skin of the leg off of the muscle using forceps and a scalpel, then separated the inner thigh muscles using a dissecting probe, to reveal the sciatic nerve. We then removed the nerve from its connective tissue using dissecting needle and forceps. Then, we suspended the gastrocnemius muscle using a stand and thread. We attached stimulatory electrodes to the sciatic nerve and put the force transducer on the leg. Starting with the first control leg, we used varied stimuli voltage to find the threshold voltage at which we first see the muscle twitch. We then increased the voltage to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 volts, and recording the magnitude of the amplitude (response) of the twitch. After the control legs were tested, we injected the gastrocnemius of the leg with a 0.1 mL solution of caffeine and conducted the same steps as the control leg. We will record six myograms for each leg (one for control and one for the experimental group). A two-paired t-test will be our statistical test.


Results:
Figures 1 demonstrates that the measurement of amplitude of contraction during the treatment was generally less intense than that of the control group. At no point does the amplitude of the experimental contraction become greater than the control amplitude of contraction. The two-paired t-test that we used to interpret our results. The mean amplitude voltage of response for the control stimulus voltages 0.4V, 1.0V, 2.0V, 3.0V, 4.0V and 5.0V were 0.177 ±0.195V, 0.370 ± 0.279V, 0.422 ± 0.285V, 0.484 ± 0.313V, 0.586 ± 0.432V, and 0.450 ± 0.203V, respectively, and 0.056 ± 0.057V, 0.204 ± 0.174V, 0.282 ± 0.242V, 0.326 ± 0.207V, 0.338 ± 0.217V, and 0.347 ± 0.225V, respectively for the treatment, yet the p value was 0.155184 for our experiment. On the other hand, during the course of the experiment, I noticed that the muscle injected with caffeine contracted more intensely than during the control phase of the experiment.

Discussion:
The data does not support my hypothesis. I hypothesized that injecting the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens would lead to strong muscle contractions. Yet as the two-paired t-test reveals, our data was not able to support that hypothesis. The p-value for our t-test was 0.155184, which misses the significance threshold. Although the individual contractions during the caffeine injection phase of the experiment were weaker, there was chemically induced tetany which made the muscle feel hard and tense to the touch. Once the gastrocnemius was injected with caffeine, the muscle immediately went into chemically induced tetany, when the muscle undergoes summation until it reached the maximum sustained contraction: tetany. In our raw data, the value for chemically induced tetany is the response that the leg held during the course of the experiment, and the response voltages are contractions upon the tetany voltage. Yes, the amplitude of contraction was smaller, and that does not support my hypothesis, but looking at the myogram, it is clear that the voltage of the contractions recorded by the force transducer are stronger than the ones of the control, (and are continuous with no relaxtion), even though the increase of voltage from tetany is negligible. A study found that with increasing doses of caffeine, the strength of skeletal muscle contraction increased [Olorunshola: 2011]. This indicates that that there is a relationship between caffeine and strength of muscle contraction, but I will have to change the way we conducted the experiment differently. I think that increasing the strength of the dosage of the caffeine injection could give us more pronounced results from the control. I could also try the experiment again to increase the number of replicates with the existing method. Based off the results of this lab, to take this experiment to the next step, I would like to investigate how chemically induced tetany affects the capabilities of the muscle. For instance, I would investigate if muscles in tetany fatigue quicker than muscles that are not in tetany.
