Title: Raphanus raphanistrum move to Aruba as they discover sand does not impact resource allocation.

Abstract:
In this lab we tested resource allocation by measuring weight and length of plants in different growing mediums.  Plants were grown in sand and soil respectively for two weeks then measured and root:shoot were determined.  We hypothesized that plants grown in sand would allocate more resources for root growth resulting in a higher root:shoot.  This hypothesis was rejected as we found that there was no large difference between the two mediums in terms of weight and length of the plants.  It was concluded that if a plant has all of the abiotic factors needed, it will not allocate additional resources no matter where it is growing.  


Introduction:
Biotic and abiotic factors impact everything in a plant’s life.  Biotic interactions shape the community, whereas abiotic factors dictate much more.  Sunlight, nitrogen, water, and other nutrients are limited and vary environment to environment.  Resource limitation is a way of establishing which species can live in certain places.  If a species can live in specific conditions of a region, they will establish themselves.  This will then allow other species to join the community due to a change in the environment due to the first species.  For example, if the sunlight is extremely harsh a species that does well in full sun will thrive.  Once they are established, there will be less sunlight underneath them allowing for other species to benefit off of their shade and grow as well.  Resource limitation also encapsules trade-offs and resource allocation.  Selective pressure leads species to make trade-offs and expend more resources or energy on a specific life history or structural growth.  To do this, though, the plant must cut back on resources or energy to other sections of itself.  Resource allocation is that pattern in with the species uses its limited resources.  “A species’ pattern of allocation is genetically determined, but is not completely fixed” [Johnson: 2006].  Plasticity also is a determinant in how well the species can adapt and survive when their resources are limited.  Plants will vary how they allocate resources between their different parts, depending on what is limited.  Leaves are the main photosynthetic organ and when allocation is increased, so is the growth rate.  Stems support the shoot structure, are involved in light capture, and they compete by lifting leaves.  Roots are the sole absorptive organ and anchor the plant.  Overall, “allocation takes place in such a way as to maximize fecundity and overall lifetime fitness” [Bazzaz: 1997].
In terms of our experiment, we looked at resource allocation in the form of root to shoot ratios in Raphanus raphanistrum.  Soil and sand were the two growing mediums used.  Soil is made from clay, sand, and silt.  It absorbs water well and holds in nutrients without them being flushed out quickly.  Sand, on the other hand, does not retain water or nutrients.  It was expected that the Raphanus raphanistrum grown in sand would have a higher root:shoot than that in soil due to a limited amount of water.  Since the roots are responsible for absorbing water, resources must be allocated to them in order to grow and absorb a larger amount of water. The Raphanus raphanistrum in soil would not have to allocate resources because they are getting proper nutrients and amounts of water.  


Materials and Method:
In this experiment we tested two groups.  Three plants were put into soil with an additional 10-15 Raphanus raphanistrum seeds, and the same was replicated for sand.  Miracle grow was placed on each condition for an equal chance at nutrients.  The two conditions were placed inside a greenhouse under the same sunlight conditions.  Everyday for two weeks the plants were watered with tap water, then we harvested the plants to measure root:shoot.  The ten plants from each condition were weighed together then cut at the root shoot junction.  The shoots were then all weighed together then subtracted from the total to determine the root weight.  Then, the root:shoot weight ratio was determined and recorded.  The longest root and shoot in each condition was measured in centimeters and then the root:shoot length ratio was determined.  We then used the means that determined the ratios to make a graph.


Results:
]	The difference in the root:shoot wight and length ratios is not that notable.  The sand root:soot weight mean is 0.3313333333±0.06789207121 with the soil root:shoot weight mean is 0.373±0.03395585369.  The root:shoot length means are as follows: sand is 1.139666667±0.5046388147 and the soil is 1.333333333±0.1096965511.  Between the two conditions the weight and length means were not far enough from each other to notice allocation differences, as shown in Figure 1.


Discussion:
Although we expected the root:shoot ratios for sand to be greater than that of soil, that is not what we found.  Our hypothesis was rejected and a null hypothesis was supported in terms of the sand.  There was no vast difference between root:shoot weight and length ratios between the different mediums.  This is interesting because in dry climates with little water plants tend to grow deep roots to access more water.  Even though the sand does not absorb water and nutrients, rather they drain right through the sand, the roots did not need to allocate resources to grow deeper, longer roots. This could be due to our own errors.  Since the sand was watered daily and kept in a container it might not had the proper amount of time to drain as it does in nature.  Therefore, the water and nutrients were readily available for the plant.  Contrastly, the soil is what we expected.  A low root:shoot ratio explains that they got the proper nutrients from the soil.  This improves understanding of resource allocation by allowing us to see that if all the abiotic factors are present, the specific growing medium is not relevant.  The plants will not allocate resources if they do not need to.  In Gleeson’s paper on Plant Allocation (1994) they found that there was no difference between allocation in a field versus a greenhouse.  Although we tested different things, the same conclusion can be drawn.  In both environments there were plenty of abiotic resources therefore allocation and growth were not affected.
