Title: The Effect of Precor Hormone on Manduca sexta Weight

Abstract:
The experiment conducted below was created to test the effects of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) on the development of Manduca sexta organism. The concentration of Precor hormone methoprene from previous studies helped with the hypothesis that 0.15mL 4% of methoprene would decrease the Manduca sexta’s weight. Four caterpillars were set up as a control group and four caterpillars were set up as an experimental group. The control group used distilled water in their food diet while the experimental group had the concentration of methoprene in the food. The weight of the caterpillars was recorded after eight days and with statistical testing, it was concluded that the hypothesis was not supported in this experiment. The concentration of 0.15mL 4% methoprene increased weight in the caterpillars and allowed pupation to continue.  


Introduction:
Hormones control growth, development and behavior in living organisms. In insects specifically, hormones such as the Juvenile hormone are necessary for the insect to move through all life stages [Johnson: 2018]. The Manduca sexta (Order Lepidoptera) is an example of holometabolous life cycle – their cycle contains four stages before peeking into adulthood. Two hormones that can be used on the Manduca sexta organism are ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile hormone (JH). The ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting while the Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt. The Juvenile hormone ensures growth in the larva but it decreases level during the pupation stage. The Juvenile hormone is effective in blocking adult differentiation only when it is present during the first five days of adult development [Williams: 1961]. It is vital for insects to fulfil their complete development into adulthood. One of the stages in which the Manduca Sexta goes through – pupal – corresponds to the testing of JH effects. According to previous research, increasing the Juvenile hormone will decrease the weight of the insect. JH is highest immediately after ecdysis and remains relatively high until after initiation of the last larval molt – during this time that the molting is initiated, the JH concentration is equivalent [Fain: 1975]. This research used a concentration of 2e10-8 mL JH on the larvae. Using similar values of the hormone will cause a decrease of caterpillar weight. An imitator of the natural insect hormone JH is methoprene which is a growth regulator that prevents the larvae from becoming adults. If we treat the experimental Manduca sexta with methoprene level of 0.15mL 4%, then their weight will decrease while the controlled group will continue to pupate. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, we divided our eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups and place them into plastic containers. The containers had a taped down index card to create two sections in each container. Holes on the top of the container lid were left uncovered. The control group was fed 10mg of food with 0.15mL of distilled water. The experimental group was fed 10 mg of food with 0.15mL of 4% concentration of Precor methoprene. Each of the four containers were kept under the same conditions of 25 ° C with 12 hours of dark/12 hours of light. For 8 days, we recorded the weight of each caterpillar every day. On the last day, a 2 sample one-tail T- test was completed. 


Results:
Our data shows that the Manduca sexta organisms increased in weight from the 0.15mL 4% concentration of methoprene. The average weight for the control group was 1.30g ± 1.02 and the average weight for the experimental group was 1.42g ± 0.70. After conducting the T-test, the P value found was 0.857, which shows that our data is statically insignificant. 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis of adding 0.15mL of 4% concentration of Precor methoprene to Manduca sexta’s food was not supported because the organisms gained weight throughout the experiment. A previous article stated that 2e10-8 mL concentration of JH would cause sensitization to the pupation stage of the Manduca sexta (Fain: 1975). From that, we concluded a higher concentration of JH imitator – methoprene – would then cause a decrease of weight since methoprene is a pupation inhibitor. Throughout this experiment, the Manduca sexta continued to pupate and gain weight. Other research found showed that a JH concentration of 10 µg (0.01mL) for seven days also allowed the caterpillars to gain weight and continue in pupation [Satyanarayana: 1994]. The values from this research were very close to the values we used in our experiment so it can be concluded that the concentration of JH used was not enough to inhibit pupation. Our P value of 0.857 shows that the two set of data are not statistically significant which also concludes that both our experimental group and controlled group gained the same amount of weight – the concentration of methoprene had no effect on pupation. For further investigations, the concentration of JH should drastically increase to ensure its role of inhibiting pupation.

Figure 1. Average weights of both the control group and the experimental group were 1.30g ± 1.02 and 1.42g ± 0.70. Both groups increased in average weight over the course of this experiment. There was no significant difference in ending weight between both groups. Statistics from the 2 tail one-tail T- test show: 0.857 P value, 1.88 T Stat, 6 degrees of freedom.
