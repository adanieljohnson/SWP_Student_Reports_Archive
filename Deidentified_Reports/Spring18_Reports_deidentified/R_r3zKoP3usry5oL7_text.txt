Title: Two aggressive behaviors of blue male Betta splenden’s were not effected by red-water condition, while 1 aggressive behavior was effected by condition 

Abstract:
In this experiment we are observing the aggressive behavior of blue, male Betta splenden fish towards red, male Bettas. The behavior is observed in both clear water and red water to see if the vividness of the red fish affects the amount of aggressive behavior in the blue fish. We observed 3 different behaviors in the blue Betta: pelvic fin flickering, red mane display and tail-beating. In the end of the experiment, we saw that red water has no affect on pelvic fin flicker and red mane display, but red water does have an effect on tail-beating in blue, male Betta fish. 

Introduction:
Animal behavior is equally an interesting topic and difficult to study because motivations for behavior in animals cannot be explained the same way human behavior is explained. Human behavior is explained mainly by emotional and social cues, which can be talked about; humans can verbalize why they act a certain way. To explain animal behavior, the behaviors must first be isolated and classified. Male Betta fish are known for displaying aggressive behavior when in the presence of other male Betta fish. Aggressive behaviors in Betta fish have been put into two categories; broadside movements and front-facing movements [Johnson: 2016]. However, recognizing aggressive behaviors does not give any insight to the causes of that behavior. Behaviors have both mechanistic causes and social causes, and, in this experiment, we are concerned with whether the vividness of a male Betta’s scales cause a higher reaction of aggression in other Betta fish. 
In a study done at the University of Minnesota, researchers found a correlation between fish color and aggressive behavior in fish, there was a positive correlation for blue and red fish; the brighter the fish were, the higher the relative rate of aggressive behavior and they darken their scales when in display and fighting modes [Grabowski & Thompson: 1968] [Lucas: 1968]. Betta splenden’s have fairly sharp eyesight and can catch prey at a high rate, but this was seen through eye movement in fish, they can track very well, but their color vision was not recorded [Nascimento, et al., 2015]. 
	Using the information from the literature, we 
We hypothesize that when a red and a blue Betta fish are put in a tank of red-dyed water, the behavior of the blue fish will be higher than when the fish are in normal, clear water. 


Materials and Method:
To conduct the experiment, we had 3 blue male Betta fish and 3 red male Betta fish in two different tanks. We separated each tank into 3 different sections, with clear and opaque barriers. The opaque barriers are in place to keep fish from seeing each other and decreasing habituation, while the clear barriers are to prevent physical fighting between the fish.  In tank one a blue fish (Blue #1) is placed in the middle section of tank, with two red fish on either side, depicted in Table 1. In tank two, a red fish is placed in the middle section, with two blue fish (Blue #2 and Blue #3) on either side, shown in Table 2. 
After the fish were in their respective sides of the clear water and started the experiment by raising the opaque barrier between Blue #1 and Red #1, leaving the clear barrier. We counted the number of times the blue fish displayed aggressive behaviors in a five-minute period. We watched tail beating, pelvic fin flickering and red mane display. After the five-minute period, we replaced the opaque barrier and repeated the process with the Blue #2 and Blue #3. In tank two, we waited five minutes between trials to ensure the red fish did not become habituated. While we were not counting the behavior of the red fish, we did not know and were not testing whether the behavior of the red fish was significent to the behavior to the blue fish, so we allowed the red fish a settling period. After we finished the clear water trials, we began the red-water trials.
We used one drop red food coloring to dye the water; gently stirred to evenly distribute to color in the whole tank. Then we repeated the process, counting the behaviors of the blue fish when both fish are in the red water, with the five-minute settling period between Blue #1 and Blue #2. 
	After the frequencies of the behaviors were tallied, we conducted a paired t_test, comparing each behavior (tail beating, pelvic fin flickering, and red mane display) of the individual fish in the clear water to the behaviors of the individual fish in the red water.  
	H0 = red-dyed water will not affect the behaviors of blue male Betta fish
	Ha = red-dyed water will affect the behaviors of blue male Betta fish 
	α = 0.05


Results:
Figures 2 and 3 both show the total number of times that the 3 blue fish exhibit red mane and pelvic fin flickering behavior respectively. Both graphs show a small difference between the two different conditions, which further illustrates the lack of significance of the red water. In comparison, Figure 1 shows a much larger difference between the two conditions; tail beating in the red water occurs less than tail beating in the clear water.
When we look at the overall number of behaviors, we see that tail beating in clear water reaches an average of about 36, whereas the pelvic fin flickering averages about 12 and red mane an average of 9 times in 5 minutes. 
Based on Table 3 and Table 5, because the p_values of 0.78 and 0.68, respectively, are higher the α-level of 0.05, the red-dyed water has no apparent significance on red mane display or pelvic fin flickering on blue male Betta fish. However, based on Table 4, because the p_value of 0.0035 is lower than the α-level of 0.05 the red-dyed water has an effect on the tail beating of blue male Betta fish. Because our null hypothesis was that the red water had no effect on any of the behaviors, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, we have to adjust our hypothesis to talk about the individual behaviors. For pelvic fin flickering and red mane display, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and in tail-beating, we reject the null hypothesis. 


Discussion:
 If all of the behaviors had high p_values, then we could say for sure that the red water had no effect on aggressive behaviors in male Betta splendins, but we have a divide; two of the behaviors are not affected, but one of them are. One of the reasons this could be is that we do not have enough data for the pelvic fin flickering and red mane. The other is that there could be a preference for certain behaviors that we are not aware of. 
The higher average of tail-beating in the fish could account for the low p_value; the pelvic fin flickering and red mane display did not occur as often in either situation, so they would have had to almost stop all behavior for us to see significent difference in the red water behavior. If we looked at another classic, aggressive behavior in Betta fish that occurred a lot, we might see that the red water does make a difference. In a previous study we conducted, we observed and counted the number of times the fish spread their gills (operculum spreading, for the sake of simplicity) and those numbers were fairly high. In the case of the pelvic fin flickering and red mane, there was not a lot of data to begin with, so that might have affected the results we got. If, in addition, we looked at operculum spreading in our two different conditions, we might see a significent difference in the occurrence of the behavior because it happens more often in the first place. We also could have observed for a longer period of time and seen more occurrences of the behaviors. 
In another experiment, we could use more fish and longer periods of time in order to collect more data. We could also conduct an experiment to see if fish have a preference to a certain behavior, and if we determine that there is a preference, then we could conduct our current experiment again, with the red water, to see if there is a difference with behavior in red water and in clear water.
