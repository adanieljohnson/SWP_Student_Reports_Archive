Title: Effects of Ecdysone Inhibition on Manduca Sexta Larval Growth

Abstract:
This experiment focused on the development of the Manduca Sexta larvae. Two groups were allowed to grow under ideal lab conditions, with one group being given azaguard 1:1250, an ecdysone hormone inhibitor. As this hormone is one of the two hormones responsible for the development of manduca sextae larvae, we predicted that this would have a negative effect on the organisms’ growth. This hypothesis was proven correct by the collected data. The experimental group grew only 17% as much as the control group, and a t-test performed on the collected data gave a p-value of less than .0001. Therefore, this experiment was successful in supporting its hypothesis that inhibiting ecdysone hormone would interfere destructively on the growth of the Manduca Sexta larvae.

Introduction:
The development of the man who suspect that is predominantly controlled by two hormones,  juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Carefully balanced relative fluctuations of these two hormone families dictate the progression of growth of the Manduca Sexta through the postembryonic stage to the pupal stage. This interendocrine regulation is delicate and complex and is influenced by a multitude of physiological processes. The coordination of the productivity of the endocrine glands, regulators, and relative changes in hormone concentration occurs in the brain, and is itself a developing process [1]. Juvenile hormone remains fairly high as the insect goes through its larvae development, and spikes in ecdysone push the larvae through progressive instar stages. However, in the final stage, the level of juvenile hormone falls, and the spike in ecdysone therefore propels the insect into the pupal stage, partially due to the fact that this release causes the epidermal cells to begin initiating toward pupal differentiation [2]. This is known as the commitment pulse, and is meant to occur after a sufficient amount of food has been consumed and the larvae has reached a sufficient size that it will have enough energy to survive through the following pupal stage into adulthood [3].
In this experiment, we will be inhibiting the ecdysone hormone through the use of azaguard 1:1250. This should interfere with the growth and development of the larvae because this is one of the two hormones upon which this process is dependent on, and the production of these hormones at specifically coordinated time intervals in specific ratios in order for the development to occur regularly. Therefore, our hypothesis is that this inhibitor will decrease the total growth in weight of the manduca sexta larvae. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, eight caterpillars of roughly the same size were selected and weighed out. These caterpillars were split into two groups of four, a control group and experimental group. The control group was split into four separated habitats, each of which were cleaned out everyday when the caterpillar was weighted. Additionally, each day a fresh supply of food was added, which consisted of 10 grams of pre-prepared food with 10 drops of water. When not being worked with, the caterpillars remained in a temperature controlled incubator with 12 hour alternating light and dark periods. The experimental group received the same treatment, but rather than 10 drops of water in the food, 10 drops of ecdysone hormone inhibiting azaguard 1: 1250 solution were added. The increase in weight of each was tracked over a period of 8 days, and at the end of this period the total weight gain was calculated. The average of the total weight gain of each group was calculated as mode of comparison between the two groups. To verify that this difference was statistically significant, a t-test was performed on the data. 


Results:
p-value = less than .0001


Difference in Total Weight Gain: 8.3875 g 
t-value = 10.9702
Degrees of Freedom = 6


This bar graph shows the difference between the average total weight gain of the caterpillars over eight days in the control and experimental groups respectively. The difference between the weight gain of these two groups was 8.3875. Using a t-test to compare the differences in these weight gains, a p-value of less than .0001 was found, meaning that the results are extremely statistically significant. 


Discussion:
This experiment clearly demonstrated that the inhibition of the ecdysone hormone drastically decreases the growth of the Manduca Sexta in the larger stage. The experimental group’s weight increased only 17% as much as the control groups over a full week when being exposed to a chemical that decreased this hormone. The difference in size between the caterpillars subjected to the experimental and control treatment after the duration of the experiment was so large that even based solely on observation before being weighed this was clear. However, the weights were measured and the differences calculated in order to analyze if these differences were statistically significant enough to prove that the treatment had a real effect. The p-value was incalculably small by the program used, being reported as less than .0001. A p-value this small indicates that the variable treatment did have an effect, supporting the hypothesis that the inhibition of ecdysone would decrease the growth in weight of the larval manduca sexta. This can be explained by reasons acknowledged formerly in the introduction.
