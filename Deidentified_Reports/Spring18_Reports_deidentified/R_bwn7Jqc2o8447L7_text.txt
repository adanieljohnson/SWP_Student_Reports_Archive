Title: A study of the effect of Martin’s IGR upon growth of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
This lab report reviews the effect of a growth-imitating hormone on a specific insect, Manduca Sexta, as the experimental model. Martins’ insect growth regulator was used mixed with caterpillars’ food, affecting caterpillars’ weights and appetites. In order to study the effect of Martins’ IGR on insect growth and the hypothesis of feeding Martins’ IGR discourages insects’ growth, eight caterpillars were divided into control and treatment group and fed in receptively for seven days. Basing on our experimental data, sample T-test was run to determine the significance of our experiment. In accordance to the p-value, our experiment was significant.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we chose Manduca Sexta as our experimental model and for testing hypothesis of growth of insects because it is a typical pest and does no harm to human. In general, the growth of insect is primarily manipulated by three hormones: growth hormone, ecdysone and juvenile hormone. The growth hormone is produced by the corpus cardiacum and regulated the releasing of ecdysone. Ecdysone, as known as 20-E, secreting by the prothoracic gland, regulates the timing of insects’ molting in developmental stages [Johnson:2016]. Juvenile hormone, producing mainly by the corpus allata, controls the type of molting of insects which high level of juvenile hormone prevent insects from molting into adult but instars and accelerates their death. 
	In our experiment, we studied and focused on the effect of high level Ecdysone upon insects’ growth by mixing Martins’ IGR with caterpillars’ food. Martins IGR, a Control Solutions inc. product, is an insect growth regulator that imitates juvenile hormone and affects insects’ growth by inhibiting metamorphosis of caterpillars from larvae to adult stage with low mammalian toxicity. Caterpillars’ mortality will occur before reaching their adulthood as JH imitating hormone interferes with normal growth and development [Abrol: 2014]. Our hypothesis is that with same time period, caterpillars feed with Martins IGR food will not molt into complete form of adults and develop smaller weights than the control caterpillars. 


Materials and Methods:
1.	Prepare eight healthy Manduca Sexta caterpillars from the incubator.
2.	Divide eight caterpillars into control and treatment group with four caterpillars per group. 
3.	Weigh and record the initial weight of each caterpillars. Do not measure the length of caterpillars because of inaccuracies and variations depending on how they squeeze their bodies. 
4.	Weigh approximately 40 grams of caterpillar food on electronic balance.
5.	Add 40 drops of distilled water by pipet in the pre-weighed caterpillar food and stir
6.	Divide the pre-weighed control food into four junks that each weigh approximately 10 grams.
7.	Weigh 4 portions of approximately 10 grams.
8.	Add 10 drops of Martins IGR by pipet in approximately 10 grams of caterpillar food and stir.
9.	Feed each caterpillar with approximately 10 grams of food. 
10.	Repeat step 1 to step 8 for day 2 to day 7.
11.	Run sample t-test basing on data collected.


Results:
The average weight increase of control caterpillars is 9.6125 and 6.99 for treatment caterpillars (Figure4) as the control caterpillars displayed greater weight growth. Figure1 illustrates the average increase in caterpillars’ weight per day with slow rise in the first three days and big rises from day 4. The final average weight of control and treatment caterpillars is 10.72 grams and 8.035 grams respectively. Change in weight of control caterpillars was higher than that of treatment caterpillars from day 1 to day 7 (Figure1). Figure2 and figure 3 display the change in each caterpillars’ weight for seven days as all caterpillars had great body mass increase. At last, we got a pretty fair p-value (Table 1).

Discussion:
As we run the two-sample t test, we got a final p-value of 0. 050485 which exceeds 0.05 just a little bit. This value implies that while our results were not statistically significant but biologically significant and our hypothesis might have been supported. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.44, df = 8, P = 0.05505). Despite caterpillars consuming the control food had a bigger increase in body weight and body size than that of treatment caterpillars, it doesn’t necessarily support our hypothesis that Martin’s IGR regulates the caterpillars’ growth by limiting its body mass. By this data, control caterpillars displayed greater appetite than treatment caterpillars. As JH imitating hormone has direct fatal influence in insect development [Abrol: 2014], Martin’s IGR had some effect upon Manduca Sexta’s growth in our experiment. We suspect that as days progress the juvenile hormone mimicking chemical start to inhibit growth by limiting appetite thus resulting in reduced food intake. 
Furthermore, our study could be improved by recording the amount of food consumed by caterpillars and poops they released. Because caterpillars do not consume all 10 grams of food we prepared each day, measuring the amount of food consumed could illustrate the relationship between appetite and growth of caterpillars.
