Title: Effects of Precor on the Length and Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillar Larvae

Abstract:
Insects utilize a variety of chemicals to regulate their metamorphic stages, the main one for development and growth are hormones. Manduca sexta caterpillar larvae were examined in this experiment in a controllled lab setting. It was hypothesised that an increase in the insect hormone, the juvenile hormone, would stunt the growth of the caterpillar. In the experiment, a chemical mimicker called Precor was used as a substitute to see if larvae could be stunted and prevented from developing. Several sets of caterpillars were seperated in the same environment with one containing caterpillar food with Precor while the other group had normal caterpillar food. Manduca sexta did not show a significent response with the treatment of Precor in their diet. There was noticeable variance in the results. The results for the Manduca sexta caterpillar larvae were unexpected but it may be due to the fact that the caterpillars had escaped their tubs at one point as well as not being fed on a daily basis. 


Introduction:
Hormones are chemical signals in an organism, dictating growth as well as development. Hormones bind to a variety of different receptors to stimulate a change in the organism. For insects, their development, including their molting and maturation are a result of the juvenile hormone. In manduca sexta caterpillars, their lifestyle has five instar stages, the pupa stage, and the adult stage. The hormone that regulates the molt time of the larvae is called Ecdysterone. A drop in the juvenile hormones in the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae signals the organism's body to prepare for the pupa stage. (Gäde 1997) For the experiment, the dependent variable is the caterpillar length and weight. The independent variable would be the amount of Precor in food and days in observation. The null hypothesis is if the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae consume the food with Precor (a JH mimic), then they will be unaffected by the addition of the mimicker. The alternative hypothesis is if the manduca sexta caterpillar larvae consume the food with Precor (a JH mimic), then they will be unaffected by the addition of the mimicker. The null statistical hypothesis will be if manduca sexta caterpillar larvae are fed Precor (a JH mimic) drops in the their food, then the length and weight of the larvae will not change between the controll group and the treatment group. The alternative statistical hypothesis is if manduca sexta caterpillar larvae are fed Precor (a JH mimic) drops in the their food, then the length and weight of the larvae will change between the controll group and the treatment group.


Materials and Method:
Firstly we divided the groups of Manduca sexta larvae into groups of two with the JH mimic (Precor) and controlls (Regular Food), overall, there were eight caterpillars in total. Four for the controll and four for the JH mimic. In each of their own living spaces, we gave the controll group ten grams of regular caterpillar food. The treatment group had ten grams of food with Precor (JH mimic). Over seven days, the caterpillar larvaes had their weight and length recorded with a ruler and a scale. For each of the days, the old food was removed and replaced with new food. The weight and lengths were compared at the end of the seven days to see if the Precor would affect the caterpillars. Finally we presented the data in an organized table and made a graph of it in order to better compare the difference. 


Results:
Our data states that there is mild effect of Precor on the growing larvae. Due to the variance in length and weight, there is not a clear trend available to interpret. However, both Figures 2 and 3 show that the treatment caterpillars were both larger and longer than our controll. Our caterpillars did not experience significent stunting because there were both large and small caterpillars for both the controll and treatment. Two controll caterpillars were larger than their counterpart treatments and two treatment caterpillars outweighed their counterparts as well. This may be due to the fact that they could have crossed the barrier that separated them, leading to the consumption of the wrong food source. They were also only feed on two of the seven days (Saturday & Monday)  we observed them and the lack of fresh food everyday could have affected their weight and length. Overall, the caterpillars did not show a significent or notable trend that could count as the Precor acting on them. 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis, most likely due to the fact that the caterpillars did not receive adequate food as wells as them escaping into the opposite pen. Several of our caterpillars ate through the barrier and made it to the other side, likely consuming the food meant for the other caterpillar. Normally, the juvenile hormone (JH) mimic should have stunted the caterpillars growth as seen in the blue floss flower study. There is a similar mimicker of JH in the floss flower study and as proven, this mimic should stop the larvae from pupating due to the biological repression of growth from constant JH exposure. This only works in high amounts of JH because mild exposure can actually promote growth. (Gäde 1997) Theoretically, the JH mimic should have worked for the larvae in stunting their growth, thus proving that Precor is a viable substitute to pesticides. By developing a JH mimic, hormonal pesticides can be used instead of chemical ones, reducing the need for chemically sustained foods.
