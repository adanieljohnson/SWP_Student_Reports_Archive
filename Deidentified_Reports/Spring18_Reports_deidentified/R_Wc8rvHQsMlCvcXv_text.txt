Title: Effect of trifluoperazine on [Physarum polycephalum] chemotaxis movement towards glucose

Abstract:
Trifluoperazine is a drug commonly used to treat psychotic disorder and anxiety. It functions as a calmodulin antagonist. Calmodulin is an important protein targeted by calcium ions and is involved in actin-myosin interaction. In this experiment, Physarum Polycephalum is used to test the effect of trifluoperazine on their migration towards glucose, since they generate motive force through relaxation and contraction of actin filament. Antagonist (0.167mM) soaked in filter paper was set between the organism and glucose. The distance migrated was measured in straight route towards glucose. The experiment results showed trifluoperazine has significently negative effect on Physarum polycephalum chemotaxis behaviour towards glucose. This experiment shows us possible side effect of using trifluoperazine as medication since the model organism, Physarum Polycephalum, shares many similarities in cell signaling pathway with human.

Introduction:
Both unicellular and multicellular organisms need to be responsive to their environment for living. Unicellular organisms can detect environmental cue, for example light, temperature, pH and food sources. Multicellular organisms are responsive to both the surrounding and their body environment, both influences cell activities greatly. A signal is sent out from cell to cell in order to cooperate their function and behaviors. Cell signaling not only serves important role on cell differentiation, growth, division and death, but also influences organisms' behavior and physiology as a whole. Signal molecules are produced by signaling cells and transmitted (through extracellular signaling) to target cells in four possible ways: endocrine (hormones used, travelled through circulatory system), paracrine, synaptic and contact dependent. Receptors are proteins on or inside the cell that recognize specific type of signal molecules, only the cells with appropriate receptors can process the signal and trigger further responses.   
Physarum Polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium organism, that has multiple nucleus in one plasma membrane. The fact that all nucleus undergo mitosis simultaneously suggests communication/ signaling process between nucleus. Physarum Polycephalum is chosen since it is accessible, inexpensive to keep in lab and easy to observe. Physarum Polycephalum also shares a lot of similarity in cell signaling process with many multicellular organism, even more specifically, with human being. Base on previous study, Physarum Polycephalum achieve mobility by changing "organization of bundles of actin" [Ishikawa, 1991]. It shows different pattern of phototaxis and chemotaxis behavior. Experiments and previous studies, both indicate a positive chemotaxis of Physarum Polycephalum towards glucose. Physarum Polycephalum also exhibits intelligent behaviors[Carlile, 1970], for example, solving maze and finding the most efficient way to multiple food sources  [Nakagaki, 2001]. The underlying mechanisms of these intelligent behaviors remain uncertain. These features make Physarum Polycephalum a very interesting experimental organism to be tested.  Different from multicellular organisms, Physarum Polycephalum does not have nerve system or endocrine system. It only transmits signal in paracrine and contact-dependent ways.

GPCR and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase are two of the most common types of cell surface receptors. Both of them can activate phospholipase C, which breaks down a phospholipid molecule from membrane and produces DAG and IP3. IP3 will trigger the release of Ca²⁺ ions from smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Calcium ions function as second messenger that activates proteins like Protein Kinase C and Calmodulin.  In vertebrates, the contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle is regulated through change in Ca²⁺ concentration and binding of Ca²⁺ to calmodulin. Presence and absence of Ca²⁺ regulate the binding and releasing of calmodulin to/ from caldesmon, leading to muscle relaxation and contraction. A protein, 210kDa, with similar function to caldesmon was purified [Ishikawa, 1991] from Physarum Polycephalum. With Ca²⁺ present, Ca²⁺ and calmodulin bind to 210kDa, which makes actin filament bundling disappear; when Ca²⁺ level drops, bundle becomes visible. According to Ishigami's study in 1986, the disappearance and reappearance of actin bundle suggests contraction and relaxation. Repeating of actin filament contraction and relaxation cycle enables Physarum Polycephalum to crawl. 
Trifluoperazine is an antipsychotic used to treat psychotic disorder and anxiety. It functions as an antagonist to calmodulin. It has been found in studies [Parajape,1990] to have an inhibitory effect on formation of germ tube. And according to calmodulin's function in Physarum Polycephalum migration, once calmodulin is inhibited, binding of caldesmon will be prevented, which will decrease or even stop Physarum Polycephalum migration. Since Physarum Polycephalum shares numerous similarities with human cell signaling pathways, this experiment may indicate possible side effects of Trifluoperazine on human muscle movement.  In this experiment, the effect of Trifluoperazine on Physarum Polycephalum’s food chemotaxis behavior is tested. A major decrease in Physarum Polycephalum movement (dependent variable) in response to trifluoroperazine treatment (independent variable) is expected based on current knowledge we have about model organism. The null hypothesis is Trifluoperazine does not have a significent negative effects on Physarum Polycephalum's food chemotaxis behavior towards glucose. Variables like temperature, light, humidity and pH level are all controllled.

Materials and Method:
We used 6 100mm 2% agar water Petri dish, three replicates were tested for each group. Labeled the petri dish with starting times, assay groups and drew two 1cm × 1cm square at the bottom. Sterilize and cool the spatula and forceps every time before use to minimize contamination. Cut out two 1cm*1cm square (with about 3cm between two wells) from all 6 plates and removed it from the dish. Sterilized spatula was used to cut six 1cm × 1cm square slabs from glucose-agar plate. We used sterilized forceps insert the glucose-agar plate media into the 6 empty wells on the plates. Cut 6 pieces of Physarum Polycephalum culture with sterilized spatula at once, to minimize contamination.   Cardboard filter papers were cut into six pieces of the same size. Physarum polycephalum was placed in the well on left, with glucose in the well on the right, with the filter paper in the middle on the line drew, with equal distance (1.5 cm) towards each well. For experimental group, we soaked three pieced of filter paper into the 0.167mM of Trifluoperazine used and placed the filter paper in the between the glucose agar and Physarum Polycephalum culture. For controll group, we soaked filter paper with distilled water. Tapped the lid of the petri dishes, then wrapped the plates with foil. The plates are all putted into incubator with set temperature 37℃, humidity and with no light. Left the samples for 36 hours.  Distance of migration was measure from the middle of Physarum Polycephalum culture square to the furthest position it had migrated to. The distance Physarum Polycephalum migrated towards glucose is measured in straight-line.  One tail unpaired T-test was carried out between the mean? distance moved by Physarum Polycephalum culture in controll and experimental group with a time period of 36hrs to examine if calmodulin antagonist has significent negative effect towards Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis movement towards glucose attractant.

Results:
In the experiment, we observed Physarum Polycephalum in all samples migrating towards glucose. Although none of the Physarum Polycephalum passed through the filter paper successfully in experimental group. One sample in controll group did not pass the filter paper. The sample in controll group that failed to pass the filter paper was suspected to be an outlier. A modified Thompson Tau test was used to test if sample 2 of controll group is an outlier. For a sample size of 3, tau=1.1511, tau × standard deviation=1.826, which is smaller than δ = |1.50- 3.91|= 2.41.  This sample is an outlier, so we rejected it.   As shown in Figure 1, distance migrated (/cm) of controll group is greater than that of experimental group. Control group average distance of migration =5.12+/-0.805, while since all samples of experimental group has reached but failed passed through the filter paper, average distance migrated = 1.50 (standard deviation= 0).   To test for significent negative effect of Trifluoperazine on by Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior (towards glucose), t_test was used, since they are different experiment groups and we predicted the effect of Trifluoperazine to be strongly directional. From the t_test carried out, p=0.0231 smaller than 0.05. P value obtained shows a significent difference between distance migrated by the Physarum Polycephalum with and without the antagonist, Trifluoperazine. Trifluoperazine decreased the distance migrated significently.

Discussion:
T-test supported the hypothesis: Trifluoperazine lead to significent decrease on Physarum Polycephalum's food chemotaxis behavior towards glucose. It also supports the result from figure 1, which shows a great difference between average distance migrated.  The outlier rejected from the controll group, where the Physarum Polycephalum was not able to pass the filter paper, may be caused by the setting of the experiment apparatus. The p_value obtained from one-tail unpaired t_test is smaller than 0.05, null hypothesis rejected.  In controll group, the two samples that reached glucose went around the filter paper: small gaps presented between the edge of the plate and the filter paper, as suggested in Nakagaki's maze experiment, the Physarum Polycephalum was able to find the small gap and went around. The model organisms in experimental group was also intending to go around the filter paper in the same manner, however, none of them succeed. This suggests that their behaviors were possibly inhibited by the presence of antagonist.  The filter paper available was too thick compare to that was designed in the experiment. The two samples that successfully passed through that filter paper barrier shows that, despite the unexpected thickness of the filter paper, the reason why all of the Physarum Polycephalum in experimental group did not pass may still be the presence of antagonist was inhibiting the extension of actin filament, instead of due to the physically barrier. However, the outlier of controll group suggested that there could be possibilities, the filter paper still has influenced Physarum Polycephalum migration physically.  To improve this experiment, a Trifluoperazine agar plate would be made. Instead of using a filter paper, which may exert physical resistance to Physarum Polycephalum's movement, a long section (diameter of the plate, a long section of medium cut from one end to the other) of the Trifluoperazine-agar medium will be cut off and inserted in between the Physarum Polycephalum culture and glucose. Also, for further experiments, more replication should be carried out, a sample size of 3 on each assay is very limited. Especially when there is an outlier in the data group. By repeating the sample experiment with higher replicates may increase data reliability.  In conclusion, Trifluoperazine has a significently negative effect on Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior. Since Trifluoperazine inhibited model organism's migration by targeting at a highly conserved signaling pathway, Trifluoperazine should not be only influencing Physarum Polycephalum chemotaxis behavior, but all kinds of migration behavior of model organism in general.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Effect of trifluoperazine on [Physarum polycephalum] movement towards glucose. Shows average distance migrated by Physarum Polycephalum with and without Trifluoperazine present. [Physarum polycephalum] in controll group with trifluoperazine absent have a greater average distance migrated than model organism in experimental group (with presence of trifluoperazine) did. 3 replicates were tested in each group, experiment carried for 36 hrs. Distance of migration were measured in straight line towards glucose attractant. Each bar is mean distance of migration of 3 replicates from each experimental or controll group; error bars are ±2 s.d.
