Title: Impact of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction of a Rana Pipiens Frog Leg

Abstract:
In this experiment, we will be testing the effect of Caffeine on the Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscle contraction. We hypothesize that the Caffeine will cause the leg muscle to go into immediate tetany. We will be conducting a paired t-test on three frog legs. First, we will test all three frogs with the control design of no stimulus and then we will test all three frogs with the experiment design of Caffeine and compare the averages. We will be looking at the amplitude, voltage, and time of each contraction. Our calculations concluded a high p-value of 0.211 and a t-value of 1.81 with a standard deviation of +/-.03 when looking at amplitude. Our results, conclude that when testing amplitude, the results are not significantly significant; however, when looking at tetany the results prove to be significant that caffeine allows for chemically induced tetany. 


Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are triggered by motor neurons which release an action potential that releases acetylcholine into the motor end plate. Acetylcholine institutes depolarization within the sarcolemma. In response, depolarization causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions. Calcium ions are then in charge of initiating muscular contractions. Muscle contraction is terminated when repolarization of the sarcolemma and T-Tubules begins, which closes the voltage-gated calcium channels. Tropomyosin will cover the binding sites on the actin strands, leading the contraction to come to an end.  In relation to this experiment, one case study conducted by R. Rudel looked at changes in twitch and tetanus contractions of isolated frog leg muscle fibers and looked at varying durations and strengths of an applied stimulus. The study found that as the strength of a prolonged stimulus was progressively increased, the time to peak was decreased and the first phase of relaxation was accelerated (Rudel,1969). The gastrocnemius in the Rana Pipiens frog leg reacts to this process of muscle contraction. One way to alter muscular contraction is chemically induced tetany. Tetany occurs when there is a lack of calcium ions during the muscular contraction. The lack of calcium ions results in the nerves to send repeated contractions. Caffeine inhibits the release of calcium ions. We are approaching the experiment by treating three frog legs with both the control and experiment. The experiment test will include injecting the gastrocnemius with caffeine. We hypothesize that injecting caffeine will result in immediate tetany in the Rana Pipiens frog leg.


Materials and Methods:
In order to analyze the effect of Caffeine on frog leg muscle contraction, we will be injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with Caffeine. We will be doing a paired t-test which means all three frogs will receive both the control and experimental design. The control design will be looking at a normal muscle contraction with no stimulant. The experimental design will include being injected with the 200 mM concentration of Caffeine. We will be looking at the amplitude, voltage and time it took for a contraction, and compare the control and experiment. In order to track these values, we will be using the IWorx software that shows the latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. We will place the probes under the sciatic nerve and isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and adjust the amplitude and voltage and shock the muscle in order to view the contraction. Refer to Figure 1 to see the gastrocnemius muscle isolated and the sciatic nerve placed over the probes. 


Results:
When looking at the experiment we noticed that the control design caused a normal contraction including a latent period, contraction phase, and a relaxation phase. On the other hand, the experimental design reacted differently when injected with Caffeine and did not experience a relaxation phase after contraction. All of the experimental frog legs continuously contracted. The average voltage before injection was 0.256 and the average voltage after injection was 0.7 +/-.03. Our calculations concluded a high p-value of 0.211 and a t-value of 1.81 with a degree of freedom of 2 (Figure 2). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that adding Caffeine would cause the gastrocnemius to go into immediate tetany. Due to our p-value being 0.211, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change when looking at amplitude. Our data was not significant enough to conclude a relationship between amplitude and caffeine. However, our result did prove significant because all of the experimental frog legs experienced chemically induced tetany. The caffeine inhibited the calcium levels and therefore caused immediate tetany. Hassel looked at tetanus toxins in his case study. He found that the tetanus toxin blocks the vesicular release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, leading to the disinhibition of the lower motor neurons. With this said, Botulinum toxin inhibits acetylcholine release and muscle activity, which in response, reduces tetanus symptoms (Hassel,2013). This case study proves that it is possible to inhibit tetanus responses and therefore concludes that chemically induced tetany is possible. Our results, conclude that when testing amplitude, the results are not significantly significant, however, when looking at tetany the results prove to be significant that caffeine allows for chemically induced tetany.

Figure 2 Legend: This graph shows the average amplitude reached by both the control design and experimental design. The error bars show the standard deviation from the mean amplitude. The treatment or experiment group reached a higher average amplitude. Our calculations concluded a high p-value of 0.211 and a t-value of 1.81. Standard deviation is +/-.03.
