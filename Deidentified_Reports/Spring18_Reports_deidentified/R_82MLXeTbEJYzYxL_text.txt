Title: The effect of Martin’s IGR, an analog of juvenile hormone, on growth and development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
This experiment focused on the effects of JH on the life cycle of manduca sexta.  Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt in the caterpillars and ecdysone regulates the molts in caterpillars. We hypothesized that by increasing juvenile hormone the growth of the caterpillars would be less than the caterpillars that had no added JH. In our experiment we used Martin’s IGR, an analog of JH, and added it to the food of the caterpillars in the experimental group. After 7 days we weighed and measured the length of our caterpillars.  The statistical tests run in this experiment deemed our results to show no significent evidence of increased JH led to decreased growth and development.  The results found showed that JH alone is not responsible for a decrease in growth and development.

Introduction:
The goal of the experiment was to learn about hormones and how manipulating the levels of a hormone can have an effect on the organism.  During the lifecycle of the Manduca sexta JH and ecdysone fluctuate to signal different changes in the caterpillars life.  Ecdysone regulates the timing of molting by spiking up right before a molt to signal a molt.  JH regulates the type of molt experienced by the caterpillar and when the caterpillar is ready to turn into an adult. JH is high until the larval enclosure and stays very low except for a small jump after the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2018]. The commitment pulse occurs when the caterpillar has grown enough and has adequate nutrients to turn into a pupa and occurs at a point right after the 5th larval instar and is indicated by a small jump in ecdysone[Johnson: 2018].  After the commitment pulse the caterpillar turns into a pupa, which will start developing into an adult.  It is for that reason that some insecticides utilize IGR, an analog of JH, to prevent insects from reaching adulthood so that they cannot successfully reproduce or develop into pests [Thompson: 2005]. In another experiment where IGR was used in bee colonies it was found that when IGR was applied there was a decreased population due to fewer sexually mature bees being present [Thompson: 2005].  We chose to test the effects of Martin’s IGR, an analog of JH, on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We will be treating the Manduca sexta with an analog of JH, Martin’s IGR, which we hypothesize will show similar results of lessened growth and development in the caterpillars treated with JH.  We hypothesize that if Martin’s IGR (analog of JH) has an effect on the growth and development of the caterpillars then they will not grow as large as the caterpillars that did not receive the added hormone.

Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars that were similar in weight and length were selected for this experiment.  Then at random 4 caterpillars were chosen for the controll group that was fed 10 grams of food with 6 drops of water added to it and 4 caterpillars as the experimental group fed 10 grams with 6 drops of Martin’s IGR. Two caterpillars from the same treatment group were placed in their own labeled enclosure made out of plastic containers with a notecard separating them and gave them each 10 grams of the designated food.  They were kept in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius with 12 hours of light and 12 hour darkness. Each day their length, weight, and visual appearance was recorded.  Every other day they were given new food and the old food was disposed of.  After 7 days their final weight, length, and visual appearance was recorded. After the data was collected, averages with standard deviation were found and a 2 tailed T-test was run for length and weight. The p_values for the 2 tailed t_tests were recorded.

Results:
Figure 1 illustrates the the total change in weight after eight days for the Manduca sexta caterpillars treated with distilled water and Martin’s IGR.  Caterpillars treated with Martin’s IGR showed a trend of lower weight gain than the caterpillars from the controll group.  However, the difference between the two groups was shown to not be statistically significent (t_stat=1.46, p_value=0.196).  Figure 2 illustrates the total change in length after eight days for the Manduca sexta caterpillars treated with distilled water and Martin’s IGR.  Caterpillars treated with Martin’s IGR showed a slightly lower length change over the eight days than the caterpillars from the controll group.  However, the difference was not statistically significent (t_stat=0.238, p_value=0.891).

Discussion:
Overall, our data did not support our hypothesis that increased JH would cause caterpillars to be shorter and have a lower mass.  Our tests both had a p_value greater than 0.05 so our data was insignificent.  In another experiment caterpillars were starved once they reached a certain mass before the commitment pulse to see how it would affect their levels of JH to prove that JH affected growth and development [Browder: 2001].  JH was shown to increase after food was taken away due to the caterpillar not being strong enough for the commitment pulse.[Browder: 2001] This experiment shows that JH has an affect on growth and when development occurs.  The results from the Browder starvation experiment supported our original hypothesis because it shows that JH is produced to prevent growth and a molt associated with further development when the organism isn’t ready[Browder: 2001] .  If we were to do the experiment again we would add more drops of Martin’s IGR to make sure the hormone is affecting the organism because in our experiment we potentially used too low of a dose.  We would also monitor their growth over a longer period of time so that there would a better opportunity for them to grow and develop.  Only letting them grow for a week may have limited the difference between the two groups.  If we were to change a variable it would be the type of hormone used because our results showed that JH was not a primary cause of lack of growth and development.  Ecdysone may have had a more noticeable impact on the caterpillars.  This experiment is relatable on a broader scale to many insecticides.  There is a market for products that can get rid of pests naturally and without harming those in contact with them.  JH is a component of many of those products and is used to  prevent larval insects from developing into adult pests.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1:The graph above shows the average weight of the controll and experimental caterpillars so that they can be compared more easily. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the data.  The controll caterpillars had a higher average weight by 0.95g which appears to potentially be significent
Figure 2: Average Weight of the Control and Experimental Caterpillars   The graph shows the average length of the controll and experimental caterpillars so that they can be compared more easily. The error bars represent the standard deviation of the data.  The controll caterpillars had a slightly higher average, but it was not significent and may have been up to chance.
