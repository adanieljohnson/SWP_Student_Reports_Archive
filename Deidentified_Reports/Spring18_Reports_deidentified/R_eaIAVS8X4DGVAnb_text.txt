Title:   The Effect of Martin’s IGR on Fifth Instar Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone determines what an insect will become in terms of metamorphosis. Synthetic JH, such as Martin’s IGR, has been made to mimic the youthenizing effects of this hormone. High levels of JH cause the insect to become another of what it already was instead of maturing into the next phase of metamorphosis, a pupa. For this experiment, 8 Manduca Sexta larva were selected in the 5th instar and fed either food infused with water or food infused with the synthetic JH Martin’s IGR. Although the treatment group was hypothesized to morph into 6th instar supernumerary nymphs due to their exposure to Martin’s IGR, the results were deemed statistically insignificent. 


Introduction:

The Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, is a holometabolous insect belonging to the order Lepidoptera [Johnson: 2016]. The four stages involved in the holometabolous lifestyle are egg, larval instars up to the 5th instar, pupa, and adult moth.  It only spends about a third of its entire lifetime in this larval stage. Most of the Manduca sexta’s life is spent in the transition phase between the adult and larva called the pupa. Transitioning into these different life stages, in particular pupating, involves molting, or when an insect’s epidermal cells secrete a new, thicker layer of skin in order to prepare for adulthood [Johnson: 2016]. The hormone that controlls this process is called ecdysone. Most importantly, the hormone that controlls what the Manduca sexta will become in terms metaphorical development is called juvenile hormone.  Levels of this hormone effect insects because it delays the development, increasing the time until the commitment pulse [Wastson RD: 1988]. Once the larva reaches the commitment pulse, at the beginning of the 5th instar, it will molt indefinitely [Johnson: 2016]. According to the critical switch hypothesis, high juvenile hormone levels will cause the Manduca sexta to become another of what it already is instead of molting into an adult; whereas low levels of JH are necessary for normal metaphorical development [Kiguchi: 1978].  There are synthetic forms of juvenile hormone, for example Martin’s IGR, that have this same effect on insects. The hypothesis of this experiment was that synthetic juvenile hormone, Martin’s IGR, would cause the 5th instar Manduca sexta to transform into a 6th instar supernumerary nymph instead of molting into an adult. 


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, 8 Manduca sexta larva in the beginning fo the 5th instar were selected and randoMly placed into either a controll or a treatment group, each containing 4 caterpillars. After recording their mass and length, they were put into homes, which were prepared by placing an index card in between a plastic container. Four of these containers were used to house the 8 caterpillars. Next, caterpillar food was prepared by first weighing out 80 grams and then splitting this 80 grams into groups of two, each containing 40 grams. Ten drops of water was added to the controll group’s 40 grams of food. Similarly, 10 drops of Martin’s IGR was added to the experimental group’s food. After grinding each of the separate groups’ food into a large smooth lump, 10 grams of the controll food was placed into their respective homes based off of controll or experimental. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator receiving 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness at 25 degrees Celsius. They received new food every other day and measurements of weight and length were taken daily. To test the results, two singular variable T-tests were conducted. 


Results:

As seen through table 1, the controll group grew slightly longer in length than the treatment group. In contrast, however, the treatment group grew larger in mass by about .10 grams on average.
The controll group shows an increase in weight each day until day 6, in which the larva have reached their max weight. The controll larva began to decrease in weight around day 6. The treatment group shows an increase in weight until day 5 when the larva have reached their max. There is a plateau here until the weight decreases during day 8. 
Again, the same pattern applies with both the controll and treatment groups’ average length increasing over the span of 6 days, seeing a decrease for both groups during days 7 and 8. There is more fluctuation amongst the treatment group, especially during day 6. The controll group’s growth remains fairly linear. 

In general, both the weight and the length have increased over the span of the 8 days. The fluctuations in length are most likely explained by human measuring error and difference in experimenter. 


Discussion:
It was predicted that the controll group would molt because those larvae were not exposed to the synthetic juvenile hormone. This controll group would then pupate on time. Since the experimental group was exposed to the synthetic juvenile hormone, it was hypothesized that this group would grow larger in mass and length than the controll group because they would have morphed into a 6th instar nymph. Not only did a caterpillar in both the controll and the experimental group molt, but also the controll group was actually larger than the experimental group as seen through table 1. Additionally, in reference to the T-test, the p_value for the length between the controll and treatment group was 0.94,  meaning these results are not statically significent. This p value indicates the differences in between length for the controll and IGR treatment group were most likely a coincidence and therefore deemed statistically insignificent. The p value for the weight between the controll group and the Martin’s IGR treatment group was .91 meaning that these results are again significently insignificent. One must reject the hypothesis due to the results shown in chart 1. The values between the controll and the treatment group for both weight and length are simply too similar to suggest that Martin’s IGR caused the larvae to morph into the 6th instar supernumerary nymph. Also, there was an issue with the experiment that could have altered the results. For example, it was not a sure fact that the caterpillars were selected in the 5th instar. There was no definite way to distinguish between instars. Therefore, a caterpillar could have been selected that was already past the commitment pulse, which would explain why a treatment larva molted. If caterpillars were actually selected in the known 5th instar, then theoretically they should not have molted. Additionally, if the experiment were to be done again, the larvae would be brushed off slightly before massing them to eliminate any extra mass that could be attributed to the food they were hanging on to. Performing this action would provide more accurate data, and in-turn could produce a different result.
