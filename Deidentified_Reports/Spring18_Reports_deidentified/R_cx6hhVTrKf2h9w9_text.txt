Title: Impact of Martin’s IGR on Growth and Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of insect growth regulators (IGR) on the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Hormones such as JH play a role in caterpillars progression into adulthood.  It was hypothesized that the introduction of Martin’s IGR into the diet of the caterpillars would increase length and mass, thus preventing maturity into adulthood. Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were separated into a control group and an experimental group based upon the presence of IGR. The mass and length of each caterpillar were recorded daily for one week. After a week of observation, individuals from both groups showed no difference in terms of length and mass. It can be concluded that our results did not support the hypotheses.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, a member of the Sphingidae family are holometabolous meaning that their life cycles involve fours steps: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. In the lifecycle of the Manduca sexta, progression from one stage of life to the next requires molting, a process through which epidermal skin cells shed and create a new outer layer [Johnson: 2018]. After each molt, the Manduca sexta, increases in size and nears adulthood. In the lifecycle of the Manduca sexta, caterpillars go from 1 instar to another through the molting process which is regulated by hormones.  Hormones play a colossal role in an insect's progression through theses stages of development. Specifically, Juvenile Hormone (JH). If JH is present at molting, insects will molt into larger larva form. If JH is absent and Ecdysterone is present, the insect will molt into a pupa and proceed toward adulthood.

            The present study shows the effects Martin IGR, a chemical insect growth regulator, in the food of  Manduca sexta caterpillars. Martins IGR (independent variable) has the ability to interfere or enhance functions regulated by JH, which can severely affect insect growth and development [Tunaz: 2014]. Martins IGR’s impact on the mass and length of Manduca sexta caterpillars (dependent variable) allows us to better understand the relationship and impact of hormones in the life cycles of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Manduca sexta caterpillars are great organisms to use in this experiment due to their neatly and explicitly staged life cycles and relative ease in data collection. I hypothesize that the addition of Martin’s IGR into the Manduca sexta diet will increase length and mass, thus preventing commitment pulse-access, and prevent maturity into adulthood.



Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars, ranging from 0.5- 1.5 grams were evenly divided into 2 groups: control and Martin’s IGR. The control group was given the Great Lakes Manduca diet (GLM) with 6 drops of water. The experimental group was given the GLM with 6 drops of Martin's IGR. Each caterpillar was given 10 grams of each corresponding diet, which can be replaced if completely consumed. All of the Manduca sexta caterpillars were placed in the same incubator and under the same conditions (12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness). Each caterpillar mass and length were recorded daily for eight days. A two 2 sample t-tests were used in order to test for the statistical significance of the control and experimental data from both recorded masses and lengths. 



Results:
In figure 1, the plot shows that there is no difference between the average length of the caterpillars. Figure 2 also shows that there is no difference between the average mass of the caterpillars. The general trends in Table 1 portray a small difference between the averages of data collected for the control and experimental group for length of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. The two two-sample t-tests produced p-values of 0.796 (length) and 0.961 (Mass). These values indicate that there is no statistical significance.


Discussion:
After all the observations and statistical calculations have concluded, it can be determined that the results attained refute the original hypothesis. In addition, the hypothesis was not statistically supported. A study regarding the impacts of IGR on mosquitos shows that pre parasitic exposure to IGRs has no effect on the size of male mosquitoes [Suman: 2013]. Previous results in mosquitoes show that the exposure of IGR to male mosquitoes does not impact the size of male mosquitoes.

One likely source of error is recording an accurate length and mass of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. When recording the length of the caterpillars, some would refuse to stretch to their full lengths so inaccurate readings are likely to have occurred. In addition, the fecal matter of the Manduca sexta caterpillars would often stick to the bottom of them. If unremoved, they could skew the mass reading which would yield inaccurate data. If this experiment were to be repeated again, I would double the amount of time I would record data in addition to employing stricter methods of massing and taking the length of the caterpillars. I would also increase the dose of IGR in the experimental diet. Currently, only 0.6% IGR was present in the food. The 6 drops (equating to 300 µl) and the 10g of GLM (equating to 50 mL) means that the presence of IGR in the GLM is 300 µl/50 mL of food. This is a minuscule amount and more IGR would allow for better results.

Although the hypothesis was refuted, this experiment is a great way to portray relationships between the endocrine system and the life cycles of insects such as the Manduca sexta caterpillars. It also allows for a deeper understanding of central physiological regulatory processes that are essential to normal insect development [Tunaz: 2004].
