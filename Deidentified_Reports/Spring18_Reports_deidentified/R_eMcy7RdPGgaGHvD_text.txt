Title:  Effects of Ecdysone Blocker, Aza Max on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20E) are two important hormones that regulate an insect’s physiological development. The two hormones collaborate to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis of an insect. Our experiment is proposed to test the effects of Aza Max, an ecdysone blocker, on the Manduca sexta Caterpillars. Eight 4th to 5th instar Manduca  larvae were divided into a controll group and a treatment group. We collected data of each caterpillar’s weight and recorded observations for a week. Two sample t_test is applied to analyze data. The results lead to conclusion that under Aza Max treatment or absence of ecdysone hormone(20E), the caterpillars show slower growth and tend to remain in their larva state for a longer period of time than those under normal condition.

Introduction:
Biological research over the last two decades has resulted in the discovery of chemically novel pesticides that mimic the function of the two insect growth and developmental hormones, the steroidal 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and the juvenile hormone (JH). Juvenile hormones regulate an insect’s physiological development by promoting growth of the larva and inhibiting metamorphosis. JH’s inhibiting effect on insects’ metamorphosis makes it an effective pesticide. According to the study conducted by Thomas G. Wilson, JH is necessary in insect development but becomes toxic when present during metamorphosis (Wilson, 2004). Application of JHA to white puparia which have just entered metamorphosis results in metamorphic disruption. The other hormone, ecdysone (20E) is important in regulates a larva's timing of molting.  The level of juvenile hormone drops low in 5th instar larva, and a small rise in ecdysone (20E) occurs, which is called commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is produced when the larva is big enough to pupate. The level of 20E rises in response and juvenile hormone drops to really low. Following the rise of 20E, sequential changes happen and pupation or metamorphosis is at beginning state. Our experiment is proposed to test the effects of Aza Max, a type of ecdysone blocker, on Manduca Caterpillars. We selected 8, 4th to 5th instar Manduca sexta larvae and divided them into 2 groups. The larvae in the controll group are fed by diets with water, and the rest in the treatment group receives same portion of Aza Max solution. We recorded weights of the caterpillars and observations for a week and developed statistical results based on the data. Our alternate hypothesis is claimed that there will be statistically significent difference between the controll and experimental group in the time it takes to pupate.

Materials and Method:
We selected 8, 4th to 5th instar Manduca sexta larvae and divided them into 2 groups. Their weights were measured. Each two caterpillars were placed in one container, separated by an index card. Each caterpillar in the controll group were fed by 10g of normal Manduca caterpillar diet containing 7 drops of water. Each caterpillar in the treatment group were fed by 10g of normal Manduca caterpillar diet containing 7 drops of 1: 1250 Aza Max solution. Both groups were kept in incubator at 25 Celsius degrees, 12-hour dark cycle. We measure the weights of all caterpillars every day for a week, and recorded observations. After 7 days, we recorded the final weight of each caterpillar and organized our collected data.   Two-sample test is utilized to compare the difference between the weight on the first day and the weight on the last day of each caterpillar. 

Results:
In the controll group, we observed that two caterpillars showed changing in color. One caterpillar turned brown from bottom to top, but was the lightest in the group. The other grew whitish on head and was big in size. The controll group has an outlier that gained little weights compared to others in the group. The rest in the controll group grew slightly yellowish and gained weights. In the treatment group, we also observed an outlier. One caterpillar was heavier than the rest in the group, while the rest in the group was small in weight compared to those in the controll group. Only the outlier in the treatment group showed slight change in color. Figure 1 and 2 suggest that the average weight of caterpillars in controll group is larger than that of treatment group. Caterpillars of treatment group showed slow growth and remained small in size, except for the presence of the outlier.  Our two sample t_test results have values of d.f. = 6, t-value = 1.294, and p_value = 0.2430 (p>0.05). However, if we switched the outliers in both groups, we would get  controll average change in 8 days that equals 6.61 (n=4, SD = 1.2492) and treatment average change in 8 days that equals 0.86 (n=4, SD = 0.5760). T-test result would be d.f. = 6 , t-value = 8.36 and p_value = p < .001. If we switched the outliers, the resulting values would support our alternate hypothesis. 


Discussion:
The analysis of data supports a trend that caterpillars in the treatment group, which were fed diets with Aza Max, grew slower than those in the controll group. In the treatment group, 3 of the 4 caterpillars gained less weights than all caterpillars in the controll group (see table 1). In addition, no caterpillar in the treatment group showed sign of color changing. Our hypothesis is not supported by our data results. No pupation was observed throughout the experiment. According to our null hypothesis, there is no significent difference between the controll and experimental group in the time it takes to pupate. However, the lack of observation on pupation leads no supporting data to test the hypothesis. If we continued our experiment for a longer time, we would possibly collect important data on caterpillars’ pupation time, which help to test our hypothesis. Though our hypothesis fails to be tested, the results render us insights into the effects of Aza Max on caterpillars’ growth and development. According to another study published by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry, the researchers conclude that insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect certain physiological regulatory processes essential to the normal development of insects. (Tunaz 2004). In the article, the IGRs are referred to substances that disrupt processes regulated by insect hormones such as the juvenile hormone (JH). The Aza Max solution applied in our experiment blocks ecdysone (20E), which collaborates with juvenile hormone(JH) and  is important in regulates a larva's timing of molting.  In 5th larva, the level of juvenile hormone drops low, and a small rise in 20E occurs, which is called commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is produced when the larva is big enough to pupate. The level of 20E rises in response and juvenile hormone drops to really low. Pupation or metamorphosis is triggered following sequential changes led by commitment pulse. A conclusion is drawn from our results, that under Aza Max treatment , the caterpillars are slower in growth and tend to remain in their larva state for a longer time than those under normal condition due to excess juvenile hormone and absence of 20E that is necessary for pupation.

Figure 1:  Effects of ecdysone blocker on growth of Manduca caterpillars. Eight 4th to 5th instar Manduca sexta larvae were divided into a controll group and a treatment group. Caterpillars in the treatment group were treated with 1: 1250 ecdysone blocker, Aza Max. Average weight of caterpillars  for each group in 7 days were measured (controll avg and treatment avg). Weight of each caterpillar was measured every day over the week. Each bar is mean average change of 1 gram for caterpillar from controll group or treatment group; error bars are +1.77 g for average change of weight in controll group and +0.94 g for average change of weight in treatment group.
