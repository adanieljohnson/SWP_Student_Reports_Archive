Title: The Effects of the Insect Growth Regulator Precor on Manduca sexta Caterpillar Weight

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are used to target growth hormones in insects to prevent infestations. Juvenile hormone (JH) is one group of growth hormones affected by IGRs, so the growth of an insect will be affected if IGRs are consumed by insects. Altering juvenile hormones in the insects will lead to changes in metamorphosis because JH prevent insects from reaching adulthood. The pest controll Precor is used in this experiment to test the effects of its active ingredient, methoprene, on caterpillar growth. The hornworm caterpillar, known as the Manduca sexta, is broken into controll and treatment groups. The treatment group is given food with Precor mixed into it, while the controll is given food with no Precor. The weight of the caterpillars is document over a span of seven days. This study analyzed if the caterpillars exposed to Precor would have a mean weight statistically different than the mean weight of the controll group which only had water mixed into the food. After seven days of analysis, we concluded that the pest controll does not affect growth of the Manduca caterpillars. The mean weights were relatively close all seven days, so there isn't a statistical difference in the controll and treatment groups.

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators are substances that affect the physiological development of insects by targeting growth hormones such as juvenile hormone (JH). IGRs can interfere with or over-activate the production of juvenile hormones in the insects. Juvenile hormones are key hormones in the development and reproduction of insects, and an overproduction of JH caused by IGRs can lead to the inhibition of metamorphosis out of the larval stage [Shinoda: 2016]. The active ingredient in Precor, which is the IGR used in this experiment, is methoprene [Greene: 2005]. Precor was chosen for this experiment because methoprene acts as an IGR which should affect the release of juvenile hormone in the caterpillars, and it is not fatal to insects, for it only prevents maturation. Precor is normally used against moths, beetles, mosquitoes, and on furniture indoors to prevent flea infestations, so this experiment have Precor mixed into the caterpillars' food [DoMyOwn: 2018]. We want to know if Precor will be an effective IGR on caterpillars when mixed into their food and if the active ingredient in Precor will be an effective JH. This experiment compares the weight of caterpillars exposed to Precor through food consumption and caterpillars not exposed to Precor. Manduca caterpillars are used in this test because their life cycle and growth speed are short enough to analyze over seven days. After seven days we expect the mean weights of the caterpillars exposed to Precor to be statistically different from the weight of caterpillars not exposed to Precor. 

Materials and Method:
The hypothesis will be tested by comparing the mean weight of Manduca caterpillars after seven days. There will be two groups of caterpillars with four in the controll group and four in the treatment group. The independent variable is the amount of liquid, either Precor or water, mixed into the food, which is measurable and continuous. The dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars, which is also measurable and continuous. Four containers will be used, and a divider will be placed in each container so two caterpillars can live separately in the containers. In the first and second containers, two caterpillars in the controll group will be weighted and placed inside each container. Ten grams of food is mixed with five drops of water for each caterpillar in the controll group. In the third and fourth containers, two caterpillars from the treatment group will be weighted placed inside each container. Ten grams of food will be mixed with five drops of Precor for each caterpillar in the treatment group. The weight of each caterpillar is taken and recorded into a data table. Each Manduca caterpillar are weighted once every day at the same time using a scale. The containers with food and caterpillars are placed in an incubator during the seven days. At the end of the experiment, the data will be analyzed using a two-sample t_test by comparing the mean weights of the controll group and the treatment group for the seven days. Based on the analysis of the average weights, we can see if a change in weight occurs between the controll and treatment groups as a result of Precor added to food or just water. 

Results:
Figure 1 contains data from the weights of each caterpillar over the seven-day experiment. Figure 2 is a chart representing the mean weights of the treatment and controll groups for the seven days. The controll group mean weight was 2.59 grams and the treatment group mean weight was 2.61 grams, so they are not statistically different from one another. Over the span of seven days, the mean weight of the controll group increased by 2.73 grams and the mean weight of the treatment group increased by 2.64 grams. The mean weight for the controll group was higher than the mean weight for the treatment group on Days 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. However, the difference in mean weights for all seven days between the two groups was always less than one gram. Error bars are placed in the chart to show the standard deviation of the weights of the caterpillars from each group. The error bars in Figure 2 indicate that there is a substantial variability among the weights for each day, and the weights are more spread out from the mean.



Discussion:
The final results from this study do not support the research hypothesis because there is no significent difference between the mean weight of the controll group and the mean weight of the treatment group. We fail to reject the null hypothesis on the basis of a P-Value equal to 0.99. The active IGR, methoprene, did not show significent effect on the caterpillars exposed to Precor versus the ones in the controll group who just had water mixed into their food. While completing the experiment, our data could have been different if we fed the caterpillars every day because the treatment group would have received a higher dosage of methoprene. Growth patterns could have shown substantial change with higher levels of methoprene affecting juvenile hormones inside the insects. Based on this study we can conclude that Precor might not be an effective pest controll on caterpillars by means of exposure through food consumption, since weight disparity among the two groups that was expected did not occur. A previous study from the Journal of Economic Entomology looked at the effects of synthetic IGRs on insect growth of six different insect species. Methoprene was one of the IGRs used in the experiment, and the results from the study showed that when mixed into food, methoprene prevented multiple species from entering adulthood [Loschiavo: 1976]. The methoprene caused certain "morphogenic malformalities" in the insects and any insects that did reach the larvae stage were abnormally large. The difference in results from that experiment and this one could be from differences in length of time the insects were fed methoprene. Moreover, some pest controlls will not be effective on all insects, and certain pesticides might take longer to change the growth patterns of insects.
