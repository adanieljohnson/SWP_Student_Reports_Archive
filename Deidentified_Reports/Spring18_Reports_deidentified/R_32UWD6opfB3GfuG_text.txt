Title: How Allocation of Resources Alters the Root to Shoot Ratios of Raphanus raphanistrum Grown in Sand and Soil 

Abstract:
Plants allocate their resources and adapt their growth to attain the necessary means for photosynthesis in different environments. Though not all plants can adapt at every season and in every location, they are capable of adjusting to survive. The root to shoot ratio, which demonstrates growth regarding resource allocation, will be higher in plants with a larger root biomass than shoot biomass. We examined the ability of radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum) to adapt their growth in sand versus soil. To do this, we grew two samples of plants, under the same environmental conditions, in soil or in sand. Two weeks in, we uprooted the plants and took measurements of their root and shoot masses and lengths. We predicted that plants grown in sand would have a higher root to shoot ratio because they would need to grow out their roots further than soil plants would to attain water and nutrients. We expected sand to be less nutrient rich and worse at retaining water than soil. However, we found that over a two-week period, the soil grown radishes had a higher ratio. The sand held more water than we had anticipated which would have limited the need for root growth. However, wet sand packs, which would make root growth harder than that in soil. 

Introduction:
Abstract Cont:Overall, our results show that radishes distribute more of their resources to root growth in soil and shoot growth in sand over a time span of two weeks.
Intro:
Plants require resources to photosynthesize and survive, like water, CO2, nutrients, and sunlight. However, these external resources are limited and while some environments will be rich in certain resources, they can be lacking in others. Therefore, plants will adapt their growth to obtain the necessary amounts of the limited external resource. Additionally, plants have a given amount of [internal] resources at any given point and it allocates these resources to different structures [Weiner: 2004]. Plants will distribute their time and energy to search out or preserve the limited environmental resources, while minimizing energy used to attain abundant resources. Consequently, the plants will be more successful in adapting to some environments while they are unable to sufficiently adapt to others. This lab observes the root to shoot ratio of Raphanus raphanistrum (radishes) grown in the University Greenhouse to determine how their resources are allocated in two different and controlled environments. The root to shoot ratio divides the root biomass by the shoot biomass and depicts results that depend on separation of photosynthate that is influenced by environmental stimuli [Rogers, 1995] which demonstrates the plants’ ability to acquire different resources in given settings. In theory, plants allocate more energy to root growth where water or nutrients are far underground or scarce and less resources to shoot growth where sunlight is abundant. This lab will look at the effect of sand on resource allocation as opposed to typical soil. Sand would be similar to very loose top soil that water would run through easily, therefore, not retaining water well. Additionally, sand does not contain the same rich nutrients and fertilizers that soil does. In theory plants would have to grow their roots farther down and out to reach enough water and nutrients in sandy areas. Contrastingly, in soil, plants would not have to allocate as many resources to root growth because water is retained, and nutrients are readily available. I predict that plants grown in sand, with controlled levels of CO2, water, and sunlight, will have a higher root to shoot ratio than plants under the same conditions but grown in soil because the sand plants will need to grow out their roots to attain nutrients and water that is easily attained in soil.

Materials and Methods:
We planted six trays of radish seeds; three trays were soil and three trays were sand. For the next two weeks, the plants were watered every day. Starting with the sand trays, we carefully took the plants out of their trays so as not to break the roots. We broke apart the vermiculite in a water bucket and rinsed the dirt off five individual plants from the first sand tray. After patting them dry, we massed the whole five plants and recorded the data. Then we chose the longest plant of the five to measure the root and shoot lengths at their maximums and recorded the data. Once the plant was measured, we separated the plants by cutting them at the junction. We, then, massed the five shoots collectively and recorded the data. To get the root mass, we subtracted the shoot mass from the whole mass. We did the same for the rest of the sand trays and then the soil trays. We recorded the data in the following tables and excel graphs with standard deviation, as well as created a two-sample t-test with an alpha level of .05.

Results:
The radishes had higher root to shoot ratios in soil than in sand. As shown in the tables below, the mass root to shoot ratio of sand was .331 with a standard deviation of .068 and .373 with a standard deviation of .034 for soil. The length root to shoot ratio for sand was 1.14 with a standard deviation of .504 and 1.33 with a standard deviation of .109 for soil. As figure 1 shows, all the measurements had low standard deviations except for the sand length ratio because one plant in replicate 1 had a long root length of 14.12 cm (Table 1) which effected the deviation calculation. When all replicates were considered together, the difference for the length ratio was not significant with a P-value of .55 (t= .66, df=4, p&gt; 0.05). additionally, the difference for the mass ratios was also insignificant with a P-value of .39 (t=.95, df=4, p&gt; 0.05).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that sand would grow plants with higher root to shoot ratios than plants grown in soil was not supported. In both cases, mass and length, the soil produced higher root to shoot ratios. The sand retained water better than what was expected so the roots of the plants did not have to grow to extraordinary lengths to obtain water. The sand was also expected to be less nutrient rich, which would have, in theory, increased root growth to seek out nutrients. A study about plant growth in costal sand dune soils, suggested that deficiencies in nutrients, like phosphorous and nitrogen, limit the growth of annual plant species [Kachi and Hirose: 1983]. So, it would be expected that plants would allocate their resources to root growth to maximize nutrients obtained for potential growth. Yet, that did not hold true in this experiment. As shown in Table 1, the root to shoot mass ratio was .331 for sand and .373 for soil (Table 2). The root to shoot length ratio for sand was 1.14 (Table 1) and 1.33 for soil (Table 2). This means that the roots of the sand plants were growing less in relation to the shoots than the plants from the soil. However, the ratio for length proved to be insignificant data, even though it matches the trends of the mass ratio. Besides attaining water, this could have happened because the sand became very compact making it hard for the roots to extend. This shows that sand plants did not need to, or could not, allocate their resources in ways to attain more water and nutrients. However, as the plants grow larger, they would need more resources which could change the root to shoot ratios. This experiment should have been held over a longer period to see how the plants would have developed as they grew larger, inevitably needing more resources. In this case, it is possible that the plants would have shown a different ratio because it is possible that the sand would not have contained enough nutrients for the larger radishes. However, though, to photosynthesize in this experiment, the sand plants did not allocate their resources in the same ways as the soil plants did.
