Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to measure the effect of 1 Ml of caffeine on the amplitude of a skeletal muscle contraction in a Rania Pipiens frog, provided the Wake Forest Biology Department. In skeletal muscle, the binding of calcium and troponin allows the occurrence of a muscle contraction.  This study is interested in the effect of increasing calcium amounts via caffeine injection. Caffeine causes an increase of calcium in the muscle by opening the calcium gates in the muscle fiber. We hypothesized that the presence of caffeine in the frog muscle would increase muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus as a result of increased calcium levels. Two different frog legs were used to test this hypothesis. The gastrocnemus was cut apart on each leg and the sciatic nerve was exposed and stimulated, first without the presence of caffeine and then with the presence of caffeine. The amplitude response of the muscle was measured using the iWorx data system. A paired t_test was used to evaluate if the resulting data was significent. The p_values were found to be 1.62E-, 1.46E-11, 1.38E-10 at 0.5V, 1.0V, 1.5V respectively. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system consists of skeletal muscles and allows orgamisms to respond to both internal and external environments. During a muscle contraction response, acetylcholine (Ach) binds to receptors on the muscle fiber. Sodium channels open up in response and generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. Calcium (Ca2+) is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium in the sarcoplasm binds to troponin, exposing myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. Once this happens, the myosin heads bind to actin and release phosphate, causing a power stroke or muscle contraction [1]. If the calcium is returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle relaxes.The generated force in a during this process produces muscle tension known as summation. Summation can eventually result in tetany, a state of maximal sustained contraction. Muscle contraction can be affected by physical conditions such as stretching, fluid around myofibers, or the chemical environment in the muscle [2]. Although it is difficult to record contraction and relaxation of a single myofiber, we can observe this process macroscopically. This observation occurs via a myogram recording, in which a muscle is attached to a force transducer, and an amplitude response is recorded. A typical myogram includes a latent period (the period between stimulation and contraction), a contraction phase (muscle shortens due to chemical change within fibers), and a relaxation phase (return to former relaxed phase). [2] This lab is interested in the effect of caffeine injection on muscle contraction, modeled using a frog sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus muscle. We hypothesize that injecting caffeine into the muscle will increase the amount of calcium released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and increase skeletal muscle contraction as a result. This hypothesis is being tested on the muscle of Rania Pipiens, provided by the Wake Forest Biology Department. This is a good model organism because the muscles are very similar to muscles in general and the size of the leg is easy to work with. In order to measure our results we used iWorx software to measure the contraction response amplitude to a given stimulus at voltages of 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V. 

Materials and Method:
We obtained two frog legs from a Rania Pipiens via the Wake Forest Biology Department. In order to reach the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus, the skin of the legs was removed using only an experimenter's hands. After the skin was completely removed, the sciatic muscle was found by seperating the muscle using tweezers. Then, the nerve was pulled from the muscle in order to be exposed and the achilles tendon was detached from the gastrocnemus via applied pressure on the muscle gap. Using scissors, the muscle was cut down to the toes and a string was attached around the muscle junction using a loop system. The opposite end of the string was used to attach the muscle to the muscle force transducer, making the gastrocnemus muscle perpendicular to the table. Using needles in the tibia and femur, the leg was stabalized before contraction. Light tension was created using the precision tension knob on the muscle force transducer. Two electrode probes were inserted into the gastrocnemus on either side of the muscle. The muscle was then stimulated three times at voltages of 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V. After recording the amplitude of response for each contraction, the voltage was returned to 0V. The muscle was then injected with 0.3 Ml of 100mM caffeine in three different regions, using 0.1 Ml in each region. The muscle response was recorded again at volts of 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V. This experimentation was repeated again in the second frog leg and the results were recorded. For this data we used a paired t_test because we measured the same group twice, before and after caffeine injection. 

Results:
The muscle contraction of the frog sciatic-gastrocnemus muscle was impacted by the injection of caffeine. The mean amplitude of the controll group was significently higher than the experimental group at every voltage. At 0.5 V (t stat=7.71, d.f.=10, and P=1.62E-5). At 1.0V (t stat=33.18, d.f.=10, and P=1.46E-11). At 1.5V (t stat=26.44, d.f.=10, and P=1.38E-10). The controll group responded with an average of amplitudes of 1.05V, 1.48V, and 1.56V at a stimulation of 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V, respectively. The experimental group responded with an average of amplitudes of 0.004V, 0.009V, and 0.025V at a stimulation of 0.5V, 1.0V, and 1.5V, respectively. Figure one shows the comparison between the controll group response to stimulation versus the experimental group response to voltage following caffeine injection. This figure shows that the amplitude was higher for the controll group at every voltage level

Discussion:
This study demonstrates the effect of caffeine injection on a frog leg. The controll group demonstrated a smaller amplitude response (Fig 1), which suggests that the muscle was already contracted before the stimulus was applied, as a result of the caffeine injection. These results support our hypothesis that injecting caffeine would result in an increase in force of contraction. A higher amplitude response indicates a quicker response change in the controll group and a longer contraction phase is indicated by a lower amplitude in the experimental group. The lower amplitude response of the experimental group indicates that the frog leg was experiencing contractions prior to the application of the stimualted contraction. There were no major errors in this experiment. In order to improve this study, the experimental design could include different amounts of caffeine injections. Olorunshura and Achie (2011), investigated the effect of caffeine on the amplitude and rate of skeletal muscle contraction using frog sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus muscle model. Their study found that there is a dose dependent increase in skeletal muscle contraction when using caffeine injections in frog legs [3]. Replicating this study design would allow further investigation of the rate of skeletal muscle contraction based on the chemical environment of the muscle. This addition to the experiment would be beneficial to investigate the importance of concentration of calcium in muscle contraction, and could either support or refute the previous study. Furthermore, this study could be improved by also injecting inhibitory chemicals into the frog leg to investigate the effect this would have on inhibiting calcium release and the result of the amplitude of muscle contraction. These findings could eventually be applied in a real-world application to assist individuals who experience difficutly with muscle contraction.
