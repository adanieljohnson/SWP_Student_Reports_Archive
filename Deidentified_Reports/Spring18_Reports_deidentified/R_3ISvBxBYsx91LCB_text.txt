Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
At neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscles, action potentials from motor neurons cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve. ACh binds to receptors of the muscle fiber’s membrane, opening sodium (Na+) channels. The depolarization of the membrane causes an action potential to spread through the muscle fiber, stimulating the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ca2+ then instigates the chain of events that enables a muscle to contract. It was hypothesized that direct injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens leg would cause uncontrollled contraction of the muscle. Myograms were recorded before and after injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle and their peak amplitudes were measured. The results indicated that the average amplitude of the myograms prior to injection was significently lower than that after injection.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system of vertebrates and invertebrates relies on mechanisms that allow response times to occur in milliseconds. Skeletal muscle, which is part of the neuromuscular system, is made of up to thousands of myofibers – cylindrical, multi-nuclear aggregations of fused cells. The skeletal muscle proper is composed of functional groups made of myofibrils and connective tissue. Motor neurons innervate skeletal muscles at points called neuromuscular junctions, where the axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle [Johnson: 2018].  At the neuromuscular junction, action potentials from the motor neuron cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve. ACh then binds to receptors of the muscle fiber’s membrane which opens sodium (Na+) channels. The depolarization of the membrane causes an action potential to spread through the muscle fiber, stimulating the release of calcium (Ca2+) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Ca2+ then instigates the chain of events that enables a muscle to contract [Johnson: 2018].  The effects of the neuromuscular system can be easily observed via the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of a Rania pipiens leg. This experiment specifically focused on the gastrocnemus muscle and the effect of caffeine on its contraction. Caffeine prompts responses in a multitude of cell types by eliciting the mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular organelles, in this case, the SR [Kramer: 1994]. Caffeine increases the SR’s permeability [Shirokova: 1996] and activates SR Ca2+ release during depolarization [Klein: 1989]. When Ca2+ is released into the sarcoplasm, the muscle will contract until Ca2+ is no longer present. It was hypothesized that direct injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle in a Rania pipiens would cause uncontrollled contraction of the muscle.

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens legs were used as the controll. The skin was removed, and the gastrocnemus muscle was exposed on each leg. A string was tied to the end of each muscle and the leg was suspended. The tissues were consistently kept moist with frog Ringer’s solution. The stimuli threshold was determined for each leg using pin probes connected directly to the gastrocnemus muscle and a real time data acquisition device, the iWorx system. Three myograms were measured for each leg at a value above this threshold in order to ensure a response was measurable. The peak amplitudes during the contraction phase were specifically noted. Each gastrocnemus muscle was then directly injected with 0.1 Ml of caffeine. Three myograms were measured for each leg after injection at the same voltage determined by the stimuli threshold. The peak amplitudes during the contraction phase were specifically noted. A paired t_test was used to determine if the results were statistically significent.

Results:
The general trend of the data showed that the average amplitude of the myograms obtained after treatment caffeine injection (0.914 +/- 0.184 V ) was significently higher than that of the average amplitude of the myograms obtained before injection (0.079 +/- 0.051 V) (t_test: p= 0.009) (Figure 1). The amplitude is indicative of the strength of the contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. The controll-leg myograms prior to treatment showed normal contraction periods preceded by a latency phase and followed by a relaxation phase. The legs injected with caffeine were tense to the touch and visibly taut. The latency and relaxation phases were far less distinguishable – the muscle contracted as soon as it was injected with caffeine before a stimulus pulse was applied and did not have a recognizable relaxation phase.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicate that the hypothesis should be accepted. When caffeine was applied to the muscle it activated the release of Ca2+, initiating the contraction of the muscle to the point of chemically-induced tetany. When the pulse stimulus was applied, the muscle was never able to contract beyond 0.001 mV of the already stimulated amplitude, demonstrating the muscle was at its maximum contraction. Other studies have shown similar results, with the injection of caffeine inducing a rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+ by the time of pulse application [Shirokova: 1996]. Caffeine has been demonstrated to induce a rapid increase of Ca2+ levels in conjunction with sustained inhibition of uptake back into the SR [Kramer: 1994].

Figure 1.  Averages and standard deviations of myogram amplitudes of three gastrocnemus muscles in Rania pipiens. The mean of the myograms obtained after treatment caffeine injection was 0.914 +/- 0.184 V, which is statistically significently different than the mean of the myograms obtained before injection 0.079 +/- 0.051 V (p = 0.009). Error bars represent +/- one standard deviation.
