Title: Neutral effects of IBMX and caffeine on Physarum polycephalum aggregation

Abstract:
Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes utilize signal transduction pathways, systems of interconnected biochemical processes, to trigger important reactions that help them adapt to the surrounding environment. Signal transduction pathways utilize secondary messengers, such as the adenosine triphosphate derivative Cyclic adenosine monophosphate, to elicit desired reactions. This experiment studies the effect phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and caffeine have on the aggragation of P. polycephalum.  By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, P. polycephalum should not be able to degrade its cAMP secondary messenger pool, causing aggregation, clustered growth, to increase around the site of a chemoattractant. It was found that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and caffeine had no significent effect on the rate of aggregation. These results contradict with previous studies which have found that increasing the concentration of cAMP increases aggregation of P. polycephalum.


Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways are systems of interconnected biochemical processes, used in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, that transform a stimulus into a biochemical signal to trigger important reactions and processes. In bacteria specially, signal transduction method are important in allowing adaptation in response to environmental change through processes such as phototaxis and chemotaxis [1].  A signal transduction pathway is activated when a ligand binds to a receptor. Dependent upon the type of receptor, its activation triggers the creation of various secondary messengers, such as nucleotide derivatives and membrane lipid derivatives, utilized to elicit desired reactions [2]. Once the desired reaction has occurred, the signal transduction pathway needs to be turned back off. This is often achieved by either degrading the secondary messenger pool, or by desensitizing the receptor [2]. Physarum polycephalum, a cellular slime mold, utilizes many different secondary messengers in its signal intracellular transduction pathways, one of the most important being Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)—a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [3]. 

In P. polycephalum, the secondary messenger cAMP is involved in the controll of movement. Previous literature has depicted a general trend showing that high levels of cAMP, caused by addition of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase, increase P. polycephalum motility, while lower levels of cAMP lead to lower motility of P. polycephalum [4]. The signal transduction pathway that utilizes cAMP is activated by a G-stimulatory protein, which then activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, causing it to convert ATP to cAMP [2].  cAMP then goes on to bind regulatory subunits on inactive protein kinase A (PKA), inducing a conformation change which frees the two catalytic subunits in their active form [2]. These active subunits go on to phosphorylate various targets involved in motile functions of P. polycephalum, causing the slime mold to grow—typically towards a chemoattractant. In order to stop growth, this signal transduction pathway must be turned off. This is done by using phosphodiesterase to degrade cAMP [2].

This experiment aims to determine what would happen if cAMP was never degraded, by utilizing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) to prevent degradation of the secondary messenger pool.  Based on previous knowledge of this signal transduction pathway, it is hypothesized that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX will cause a significent increase in the aggregation, clustered growth, of P. polycephalum around the site of an oatmeal flake which acts as a chemoattractant.	




Materials and Method:
P. polycephalum was chosen as the model organism for this experiment due to its rapid growth rate and thick strands which allows for easy measurement. The P. polycephalum utilized in this experiment had been cultured in lab 5 days before the experiment and kept in an incubator at 37C. The P. polycephalum culture was prepared using a 100mm water-agar plate with two 1mm P polycephalum blocks, and oatmeal as food. In this experiment, water agar plates were used instead of another agar variant because water agar adds no nutrients, therefore providing no additional incentive for the P. polycephalum to aggregate.  To begin the experiment, six 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar medium were obtained. Three controll plates were then coated with water, and three experimental plates were coated with a mixture of 1mM IBMX and 20nM caffeine. The plates were left to sit with the coat for 10 minutes to ensure proper absorption into the gel.  After 10 minutes, the coat was poured carefully into the sink and the plates were dried using Kimwipes. Flat-tipped forceps and a flat metal spatula were then sterilized using ethanol and an alcohol lamp containing 95% ethanol. Instruments were sterilized between each step of the experiment.  Two 1 cm squares were then cut in each plate, corresponding with the 1cm squares drawn, using the sterilized flat-tipped forceps and flat metal spatula, and replaced with 1 cm squares of P. polycephalum from the stock plate. One flake of oatmeal was then placed on top of each 1 cm block of P. polycephalum to provide a chemoattractant. The initial area of each P. polycephalum was taken. Afterwards, all six plates were wrapped in tinfoil, to prevent phototaxis, and placed in an incubator set at 37C to insure temperature stability. The mold was then measured at 12 hour intervals, to assess the area of aggregation, for a total period of 36 hours. After all data had been collected, the area calculating software iCalcTM was used to determine the growth of each sample. The percent change was then calculated using the formula shown in Figure 1. Two tailed t_tests (assuming equal variances) were then run to determine whether or not the results from the experiment were significent.  The critical value by which statistical significance was determined was 0.05. 

Results:
Overall, the experimental plates aggregated more than the controll plates, indicating that the IBMX and caffeine did have some effect on P. polycephalum growth. However, there was no significent difference between the controll P. polycephalum plates coated with water and the experimental P. polycephalum plates coated with caffeine and IBMX (t (4) =-1.47, p = 0.22). 


Discussion:
Overall, there was no statistically significent evidence supporting the hypothesis that the addition of phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX will cause an increase in the aggregation of P. polycephalum. The results of the experiment were inconclusive and produced no observable general trends. While both Experimental 1 and Experimental 3 both aggregated over the 36-hour time frame, they grew away from the chemoattractant, the oatmeal flake, rather than aggregating around it. There was also a large variance between their percent change, and such a large variance made it difficult to compare with only two replicates. The results from this experiment differ from those in past literature. A similar experiment conducted using P. polycephalum found that the autocrine production cAMP leads to aggregation and that autocrine production of extra-cellular cAMP phosphodiesterase plays an important role in controllling the rate of said aggregation [5]. cAMP leads to aggregation by binding and activating catalytic subunits on protein kinase A (PKA) which continue on to phosphorylate important targets involved in motile and aggregation ability in P. polycephalum. Based on the results of this experiment, our P. polycephalum should have shown increased aggregation around the site of the chemoattractant, as cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase was inhibited.  Previous studies also may explain why the P. polycephalum aggregated away from the chemoattractant rather than around it. A previous experiment studying how different chemoattractants affected the rate chemotaxis in P. polycephalum found IBMX to be a moderate chemoattractant [6].  If the IBMX did act as a chemoattractant in this experiment, it would explain why the P. polycephalum grew outwards instead of aggregating around the oatmeal flake, because the entire area of the experimental plates were coated with IBMX, whereas the oatmeal flakes were only placed on top of the original sample of P. polycephalum.  
 
Both the experimental group and the controll group contained outliers. Control 3 grew between hours 24 and 36. This signifies that it was likely contaminated by either the unsterilized flat-tipped forceps or flat metal spatula, or that the plate was exposed to light between hours 24 and 36 and underwent phototaxis.  Experimental 1 experienced no growth over the 36-hour period. This could indicate that the plate was not completely dried after coating with IBMX and caffeine, causing the P. polycephalum to die. If the experiment were to be performed again in the future, it would be beneficial to choose a different phosphodiesterase inhibitor to ensure that the oatmeal was the only chemoattractant located in the plates. It could also be beneficial to wrap the plates in two layers of tinfoil, rather than just one, to ensure that the P. polycephalum is not exposed to light. In future experimentation, it could be beneficial to test the plates in different temperatures to determine its effects on rate of aggregation. Overall, the experiment displayed that inhibiting phosphodiesterase, causing an increase in cAMP, most likely had some effect on the aggregation of P. polycephalum.
