Title: Resource allocation plant lab report 

Abstract:
	This lab report outlines an experiment carried out that was designed to illustrate and measure the real world phenomenon of phenotypic variation. An experiment was carried out in which the root to shoot ratio of mung beans was compared where one group of beans where watered with salt water and another with regular water. This lab aims to illustrate how an organism reacts to changes in its environment through the expression of a phenotype. 


Introduction:
Phenotypic variation is a common behavior in which an organism is able to change certain characteristics of itself in response to certain environmental variables. For instance, a study in 2017 study into the effects of tree species, water temperature and predation on caddisfly tested the effects of each variable on the caddisfly’s ability to build protective larvae cases1. The caddisfly when put under certain environmental stresses were forced to make trade offs diverting energy from behaviors such as reproduction to the construction of larvae cases when the threats of predation where higher. Plant species go throw similar changes in phenotypic expression for example cactus species have extremely long roots for two reasons, to firMly anchor themselves in the relatively less dense sand of the desert and also to reach deep reserves of water2. On the other end of the spectrum are woody vines that spend little time in the production of roots and more on the production of its shoots allowing for a wider surface area. This is important as vines are inhabit dense forest areas where sunlight is a less readily available resource than in an open field, this increase in area allows for my sunlight to reach the vine and the ability for The vine to syphon off resources form other organisms around it. The variables in an environment affect the traits an organism exhibits.In this lab, we are concerned with how the species’, Vigna radiate (Mungbeans), allocation to shoot and root production changes as the concentration of sodium in ground water is higher. Specifically, I believe that when the concentration of sodium is higher in soil, the plant will divert more energy into the production of roots as apposed to its shoot as it uses its roots to mine for necessary ground resources.


Materials and Method:
In order to test resource allocation in mung beans, six samples of plants where grown, three where to be treated with regular tap water, and three to be treated with a solution of tap water and sodium. Each set of plants where prepared in equal sized pots that contained the same soil and relatively similar amounts of mung bean seeds, also they were both treated with the same amount of miracle grow. For the next two weeks, the plants were kept in a greenhouse where they were watered everyday, the controll group with its tap water, and the experiment with its salt water. After two weeks of growth, a plant was taken out of its pot in order to measure the weight and length of its roots and its shoots. From each pot, two individual plants where taken: in total there was six controll plants and six experimental plants. In order to take the measurements, the plant was taken out of its pot and rinsed in order to remove any soil that was attached to its roots. After this the whole plant was measured and weighed after which, the root was separated from the shoot and likewise was weighed and measured. After the measurements were recorded, the mean and standard deviation of each were calculated and also the ratio of root to shoot length and weight were calculated. This was calculated in order to compare the compositional make up of the plant. The mean and SD of the R:S ratios were also calculated. To compare each data set the R:S ratios both height and weight were run through a two-sample T-test.


Results:
The results of the experiment showed that on average, plants watered with regular tap water grow more roots than shoots as opposed to the experimental group. The controll plants in this case outgrow the experimental group in all instances as the controll plant group seemed to be more healthy than the experimental group. The R:S ratio as shown in the graph above, favored the controll group over the experiment in both length and weight. This, however, does not prove statistical significance. After putting the data through a two-sample T-test, there proved to be a statistical difference between the R:S ratio for both the experiment and the controll in weight(t_stat = 0.59, d.f. = 10, P = 0.574) and length(t_stat = 0.63, d.f. =10, P = .54).


Discussion:
The difference between average R:S ratios indicate that the hypothesis proposed at the beginning of this experiment was wrong and that plants with higher concentration of salt in ground water do not prioritize root growth over shoot growth. This could be a sign that If the soil is of low enough quality and while still providing an anchor point for the plant, roots are de prioritized as resources available through the shoot would be easier to attain. This Is important to consider in that changes in environmental resource concentration can easily disrupt and organisms viability in an environment, for instance in 2013 study, water temperature disrupted the metabolic process of some species of phytoplankton which had the negative affect of increasing nitrogen concentrations in water systems3. Plants have a similarly important part to chemical process on land that especially in its roots. Like plankton, plants have an important role to play in nitrogen cycles on land, this usually occurs in the roots, if the roots where to be altered like in the conditions of the experiment this could lead to effects on the wider environment. This is just one example of the consequences that might arise due to environmental change and phenotypic variation.
