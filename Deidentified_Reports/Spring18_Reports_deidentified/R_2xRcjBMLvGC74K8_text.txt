Title: The effects of murky water on aggressive behavior in Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins sp.)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of murky water on aggressive behavior in Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins sp.). Betta fish display aggressive behaviors, defined as broadside and facing movements, in response to other members of their own species. We predicted that male domesticated Betta would display more aggressive behavior in clear water, their domesticated habitat, compared to murky water, their natural habitat. To test this, we counted the number of aggressive behaviors displayed by pairs of Betta fish in both clear and murky water. Although the Betta fish in clear water displayed more aggressive behaviors than the Betta fish in murky water, our results did not support our hypothesis (t_stat=2.321, d.f.=2, P=0.073). We therefore cannot say that Betta fish in clear water will display more aggressive behaviors than Betta fish in murky water.

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins sp.) display intraspecific behavior, as their behavior depends on the presence of other members of their own species. Their intraspecific behavior regulates social interactions, aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition. The movements of Betta fish can be described as broadside or facing movement. Broadside movements consist of pelvic fin flickering, tail flashing, and tail beating. Facing movements consist of pectoral fin erection, spreading gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes (red mane) [Johnson: 2018]. Studying the behavior of Betta fish is useful as it can help us to better understand fish behavior as a whole. Gaining a more comprehensive understanding about fish behavior, specifically social interactions, aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition, could be beneficial when trying to figure out how to conserve an endangered species. 

In this experiment we will be examining the aggressive behavior of domesticated Betta fish in clearwater, their domesticated habitat, and in murky water, their natural habitat. Aquaculture geneticists have traditionally argued that artificial selection for fast growth in domestic environments might lead to more competitive interaction, such as aggression [Ruzzante: 1994]. A previous study on aggression in Betta fish found that domesticated Betta were significently more aggressive than wild type Betta during mutual viewing tests [Verbeek: 2007]. We therefore predicted that male domesticated Betta would display more aggressive behavior in clear water, their domesticated habitat, compared to murky water, their natural habitat. 

Materials and Method:
We observed the total number of aggressive behaviors displayed for each of the three pairs of Betta fish in clear water. The behaviors observed were tail flashing and display of the red mane. We placed a pair of Betta fish in a tank that meant they were physically, but not visually separated. We observed the fish for 5 minutes, followed by a 5 minute rest period. Then we repeated this process for the two other pairs of Betta fish. 

We then observed the same three pairs of Betta fish in murky water using the same procedure as above. 

Statistical Test:
Once results were recorded for all three pairs of Betta fish, we used a paired one tailed t_test to analyze our data. We used a paired one tailed t_test because our hypothesis predicts that the total number of displays of aggression will be statistically greater in clear water compared to murky water. 

Results:
Looking at Figure #1 we can see that the average number of aggressive behaviors displayed per pair of Betta fish is higher in clear water than in murky water (t_stat=2.321, d.f.=2, P=0.073). Clear water pairs of Betta fish had a s.d. of 2.082 and a mean of 18.667. Murky water pairs of Betta fish had a s.d. of 4.163 and a mean of 12.333. Betta fish displayed aggressive behaviors in both clear and murky water (Figure #1). 

Discussion:
Our statistical results do not show that the number of aggressive behaviors displayed in clear water are significently greater than the number of aggressive behaviors displayed in murky water. Although we observed a higher number of aggressive behaviors in clear water compared to murky water, our hypothesis was not supported. In a study on brook trout, experimental evidence suggested that there were higher levels of agnostic behavior among domestic than among wild fish, in this experiment a higher frequency of nipping behavior was observed in domestic fish than in wild fish. However this was only observed in one of the two replicates tested [Ruzzante: 1994]. This shows that Betta fish will not necessarily show more aggressive behaviors in their domestic habitat, clear water, compared to their natural habitat, murky water. 

Previous studies that have examined aggressive behaviors in domesticated and wild Betta fish have also come up with insignificent results, showing that there is not yet a clear understanding of whether domestication causes an increase or decrease in aggressive behaviors [Ruzzante: 1994]. Juvenile Atlantic salmon that were reared in a hatchery showed similar kinds of antipredator behavior to wild fish [Huntingford: 2004], this suggesting that Betta fish would show similar behavior in their domestic habitat, as they would in their natural habitat. Domestication could lessen the capability of fish to carry out basic survival strategies, such as displaying aggression in order to survive [Olla: 1998], suggesting that Betta in their domestic habitat, clear water, could display less aggressive behaviors. From looking at previous studies, along with the results of our own experiment, we cannot say that Betta fish will display more aggressive behaviors in their domestic habitat, clear water, compared to their natural habitat, murky water. 

If we were to do this experiment again, I would like to observe the displays of aggressive behavior of Betta fish in the presence of food. I think that the presence of food in each of the Betta tanks would increase the displays of aggressive behavior in both clear and murky water. Aggression in domesticated Betta fish may increase when there are limited resources available, such as food [Ruzzante: 1994]. It would be interesting to see if there was a greater number of aggressive behaviors displayed by Betta fish in either clear water or in murky water. Or if the presence of food causes the number of aggressive behaviors to be the same in clear and murky water. 

This experiment was useful because it provided information about the aggressive behavior of Betta fish. This information is helpful because gaining an understanding of fish behavior as a whole could help with the conservation of certain fish species. Understanding the intraspecific behavior of fish could help with regulating social interactions, species recognition, and sexual interactions when trying to preserve a specific species.
