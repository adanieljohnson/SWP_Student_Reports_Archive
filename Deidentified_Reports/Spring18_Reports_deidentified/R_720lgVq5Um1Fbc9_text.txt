Title: Impact of Juvenile Hormone on Maduca Sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we will be testing the effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Manduca sexta caterpillar. We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile Hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from maturing to a stage in which pupation can occur. We will be separating our experiment into a control and experimental group. The experimental group will receive 10g of food each treated with the IGR treatment. The control group will be receiving 10g of food each treated with DI water. In order to analyze our data, we will be using a two-sample t-test. We are testing to see if the Juvenile Hormone alters the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. We will be looking at growth and physiological changes in each caterpillar.


Introduction:
Hormones are chemical substances that serve as messengers that affect processes such as growth and development, reproduction, and sexual characteristics such as puberty. The growth and development within an insect’s life cycle is also regulated by hormones. Both Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone work together to control growth and time of molting relating to metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. These hormones are essential to the full development of these caterpillars.  In relation to this experiment, one case study looked at the influence insect growth regulators (IGRs) have on controlling insect pest. IGRs directly affect certain physiological regulatory processes that are necessary for insect development. Linden bugs given the IGR treatment showed low egg hatch rates, and later failed to mature into adults. The experiment confirmed that insect growth regulators can be an alternative to toxic insecticides (Johnson AD). A study conducted by Yamamoto on the juvenile hormone regulation of Drosophila aging, concluded that Juvenile Hormone alone is sufficient enough to extend the lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster. The reduced Juvenile hormone showed limitations to reproduction by stopping the production of yolked eggs, which is due to the necessity of juvenile hormone for the post-eclosion development of the vitellogenin-producing adult fat body (Yamamoto). In understanding the Manduca sexta it is important to know that the caterpillar starts as an egg, goes through the 5th larval instar as a caterpillar, and then pupates and becomes an adult in the form of a moth. To complete this process, metamorphosis is essential as well as molting. Similar to the linden bug from the previous case study, the Manduca sexta is proven to be affected by both Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone.  We are approaching the experiment by treating the experimental group with 5 drops of Juvenile hormone which will then allow us to compare these results to the control group. The control group’s food was solely treated with water. We will be continuously tracking the growth and physiological changes of our caterpillars within 7 days.  We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile Hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from maturing to a stage in which pupation can occur.


Materials and Methods:
In order to analyze the effect of Juvenile hormone, we will be placing 5 drops of 1:1250 Dilution of IGR with DI water into the 10g of food of each experimental caterpillar each day. In contrast, the control group will be getting 5 drops of DI water added to their 10g of food every day. Four Manduca sexta will be assigned to the control group and four will be assigned to the experimental group. Each caterpillar will be placed in a plastic container. For a duration of seven days, we will be feeding each caterpillar 10g of their treated food, whether it be solely the DI water treated food or the IGR treated food. Each day we will properly dispose of the old food and replace it with the new treated food. We will measure the weight of each caterpillar as well as the weight of the leftover food. In addition to the measurements we will record direct observations of the physiological changes and morphology of each caterpillar. To address our results, we will be conducting a two-sample t-test, which compares the means from two groups of data. With this said, we will either reject or accept the null hypothesis with the results we are given.


Results:
When looking at the experiment we noticed that the increase in the percent of JH in the food made the caterpillars experience physiological changes. The experimental group went from a bright green/blue color to a pale green color. At the end of the experiment, the experimental caterpillars were swollen and had white legs. Contrary to this, the control caterpillars maintained their bright green/blue coloration and showed black legs. While both groups gained weight, the experimental group had a larger and more noticeable increase in weight. Our calculations concluded with a high p-value of 0.75 and a t-value 0.33. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was that an increase of Juvenile Hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from maturing to a stage in which pupation can occur. Due to our p-value being 0.75, we failed to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change. We expected that the JH increase would cause the caterpillars to have gone back to instar again. Although the caterpillar’s experiences growth and color change, there was not enough evidence to prove that the JH caused an alteration in their life cycle. The control group was expected to turn yellow-brown meaning they were ready to pupate and then turn into adults, however, our group did not experience this change. In order to not face complications in our lab, we should have added more JH to the experimental groups food and in response we would have been able to see more physiological differences amongst the control and experimental groups. It is evident that the JH must be at a low level at the commitment pulse in order for it to later become an adult. A study confirming the importance of juvenile hormone signaling on insect larvae and metamorphosis concluded that JH is mandatory for “the ability of penultimate and last-instar Manduca larvae to prolong their feeding time in response to starvation, such that the critical body weight is achieved. When deprived of JH, starved larvae fail in this compensatory feeding and pupate after a fixed period of time irrespective of their size,” (Smykal). Although our study showed inefficient data, this study confirms that JH does affect physiological changes in the Manduca sexta.
