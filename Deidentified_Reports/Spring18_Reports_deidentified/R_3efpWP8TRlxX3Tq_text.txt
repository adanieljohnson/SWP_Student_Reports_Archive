Title: Betta splendins Display Aggressive Interspecific Behavior Towards Poecilia reticulata

Abstract:
Previous studies have shown that aggressive behavior is displayed towards both aggressive and non-aggressive fish species. Several factors such as tank size, physical appearance of competitor fish, and the method by which the behavior is measured determine the intensity of the aggressive behavior of Betta splenden. In our experiment, we hypothesized that, if a male Betta is in the presence of a non-aggressive fish species, then the studied Betta will not exhibit aggressive behavior to the same degree as it will towards another Betta. The behavior of a male Betta by itself and a male Betta in the presence of a non-aggressive Poecilia reticulata were examined and given a behavior score. It was found that the aggressive behavior was greater for Betta with the guppy than the Betta itself. According to the statistical analysis, the difference in mena behavior scores was significent (one-tailed paired t_test: t=6.83, d.f.=2, P=0.0208). The tank size and appearance of the guppy may contribute to the aggressive interspecific behavior displayed by the Betta. The relatively small tank size may have also contributed to the statistical significance. More energy would be used by the Betta to warn an aggressive fish species since there is a higher chance of injury and death.

Introduction:
Betta splenden, a Siamese fighting fish, are common aquarium fish that originated in southeast Asia. Betta display intraspecific behavior, or behavior towards those of its own species, that include two types of movements: broadside and facing. Betta display this behavior to show aggression, sexual activities, and species recognition. There are three types of broadside movement in increasing intensity: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. There are also three types of facing movement in increasing intensity: erecting pectoral fins, spreading gill covers (operculum), and protruding branchiostegal membranes. Other agnostic, or aggressive, behaviors include raising dorsal fin, lowering head, arching back, darkening skin, and darting. 
Poecilia reticulata, also known as a guppy, is a very common tropical, freshwater, fish species that originated in northeast South America. A guppy is a suitable species used to observe the interspecific behavior of a Betta because it is a non-aggressive fish species.
In a study done by Johnson, a Betta was exposed to a five different fish species: blue gourami, paradise fish, dwarf gourami, giant gourami, and catfish. The amount of time agnostic behaviors were displayed was recorded and it was found that the Betta showed these threatening behaviors with the same effect for the all four of the five different species except in the presence of the catfish [Johnson: 1973]. In another study done by Miley, Betta were isolated from another Betta, given prior exposure to another Betta, or given prior exposure to a paradise fish for 10 days. The Betta were then exposed to another Betta, a paradise fish, and a mirror image. The duration of aggressive behaviors displayed was measured and it was found that there is no significent difference in mean duration of agnostic behavior displayed between intraspecific and interspecific interactions [Miley: 1977]. Cain, in her experiment, observed the interspecific behavior between a Betta and both aggressive and non-aggressive fish and concluded that agnostic behaviors were greater towards aggressive fish. However, she also found the difference in both duration and response type was not significent between intraspecific and interspecific interactions [Cain: 1980].
In this experiment, the interspecific behavior between an aggressive fish species, Betta splenden, and a non-aggressive fish species, Poecilia reticulata was examined. In order to understand Betta interspecific behavior, we hypothesize that, if a male Betta is in the presence of a non-aggressive fish species, then the studied Betta will not exhibit aggressive behavior to the same degree as it will towards another Betta. 



Materials and Method:
As a controll, a male Betta kept in a small tank was observed by itself for five minutes. To observe the interspecific behavior of the Betta in the presence of a guppy, the same male Betta and a guppy were separated with a clear barrier in the same tank. The behavior of the Betta was observed for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes, the fish were separated by an opaque barrier and given a 5-minute rest period. The 5 minutes of observation and 5 minutes of rest was repeated three times. In order to score the intensity of the behavior displayed by the Betta, a key was developed (Table 1). A one-tailed paired t_test with a significance level of 0.05 was used to analyze the data. 


Results:
The mean behavior score of Betta splenden in the presence of Poecilia reticulata (mean score=25.7, SD=6.51) was greater than that of the Betta splenden alone (mean score=0, SD=0) by 25.7. According to a one-tailed paired t_test, the difference in mean behavior score between the Betta splenden in the presence of Poecilia reticulata and the Betta splenden alone was significent (Figure 1. t=6.83, d.f.=2, P=0.0208). When observing the Betta behavior, the displayed aggressive behavior was similar to the previously observed behavior towards another Betta. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, stating that we hypothesize that, if a male Betta is in the presence of a non-aggressive fish species, then the studied Betta will not exhibit aggressive behavior to the same degree as it will towards another Betta, was not supported. In our experiment, the Betta splenden did exhibit aggressive behavior in the presence of Poecilia reticulata and the behavior was given a score of 25.7. According to statistical testing, the difference between the behavior score of the Betta in the presence of the Poecilia reticulata and the Betta itself was found to be significent. 
Betta splenden display aggressive behavior as a way of warning potentially threatening organisms, both of its own species and of others. Although this behavior requires a significent amount of energy, it is beneficial in that there is a decreased chance of injury or death. If agnostic behavior is not displayed before attack, the chances of injury or death increases. 
Johnson’s study showed that Betta displayed slightly more aggressive behavior towards an aggressive than a non-aggressive fish species. This shows that Betta do not entirely display agnostic behavior to any species of fish, but use more energy in defending itself against aggressive fish [Johnson: 1973]. This finding correlates with that of our study in that aggressive behavior was, in fact, shown towards a non-aggressive fish species. In order to compare the difference in intensity of behavior displayed, another study would have to be conducted. Miley found that the Betta’s response to the mirror image of itself and to a paradise fish were very similar. The factors that contribute to this finding are chemical cues, tank size, and the method by which the Betta behavior was measured. It was found that tank size and behavior duration are inversely related [Miley: 1977]. In our study, since the tank was relatively small, this could have contributed to the strong agnostic response of the Betta towards the guppy. Cain suggests the the physical features and type of response of the opponent fish determines the duration and intensity of the Betta’s response. This is why Betta display agnostic behavior more often toward aggressive than non-aggressive fish species, but the duration of time these behaviors were displayed was similar [Cain: 1973]. The appearance of the guppy, its size, shape, and color, used in our experiment may have contributed to the response displayed by the Betta. 
In a future experiment, a different method of measuring behavior will be used to study the interspecific behavior of Betta splenden in the presence of both non-aggressive and aggressive fish species.
