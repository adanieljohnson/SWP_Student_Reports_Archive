Title: The Effects of Lidocaine, a Sodium Blocker, on the Threshold of Muscle Contraction of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
 In this experiment we determined how the injection of lidocaine, a sodium blocker, would affect the threshold of the muscle contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipien. We were given three frog legs which we used to determine the threshold before and after the injection of lidocaine. We used a paired t- test to determine the statistical significance of our data We were able to determine that while our results were not statistically significant our alternate hypothesis is not necessarily incorrect.

Introduction:
In this lab we examined the response of the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of the Rana pipien to a stimulus with and without the addition of Lidocaine which blocks the sodium channels in the muscle. By blocking the sodium channel, the depolarization of the action potential is blocked therefore, the threshold should be lowered. A sodium blocker is commonly used in the form of lidocaine as a local anesthetic to numb a certain area. Sodium blockers are often used in dentistry when parts of the mouth needed to be numbed. For this lab we are testing the effects of lidocaine on the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve and the response threshold of a frog leg. Similar studies have shown that by inhibiting sodium channels one also lowers the excitability of the muscle [Binshtok, et al., 2007]. We hypothesize that by inserting 0.1 of 25 mMol of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipien the threshold will increase in the muscle.

Materials and Methods:
Obtain three (3) frog legs and prepare them by using forceps to remove the skin. Then separate the gastrocnemius muscle and free the sciatic nerve from the connective tissue. Lay silver thread across the sciatic nerve and make sure they are not touching, this will be used to measure the response to the stimulus. Measure the minimum threshold three times before injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.1 mL of 25 mMol lidocaine hold a few drops to sprinkle over the sciatic nerve. Find the minimum threshold after waiting eight (8) minutes for the chemical to take place. Repeat the process over again with the second and third frog legs. Use a paired two- tailed t-test to compare the frog legs response before and after they were injected with lidocaine.

Results:
When doing the experiment, the threshold was determined to be 0.075 V, 0.08 V, and 0.086 V for the respective 3 frog legs before lidocaine was injected into the muscle. After the injection of lidocaine and a waiting period of 8 minutes to five the chemical time to take effect the threshold was measured again and was 0.3 V, 0.3 V, and 0.152 V respectively. Figure 1 depicts the average of both the control and treatment groups with a standard deviation of +/- 0.08. Completing a paired t-test show the results to value 0.0824. The biggest trend in our results show that there was an increase of threshold once lidocaine was added.

Discussion:
Our results gave us paired t-test value of 0.0824 which makes our alternate hypothesis insignificant. One thing I think should be mentioned is if we were to run a one tailed paired t-test our alternate hypothesis which is that by inserting 0.1 of 25 mMol of lidocaine into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipien the threshold will increase in the muscle, becomes statistically significant. Our results support our alternate hypothesis as shown in Figure 1 since the threshold of the treatment group is much higher than that of the control group. The results our experiment also support the findings of other studies. When testing how sodium channel blockers effect inhibition of nociceptors (a sensory receptor for painful stimuli) a similar study was able to determine that by blocking sodium channels you also block the excitability or action potential of all neurons [Binshtok, et al., 2007]. As out results show that the threshold would increase after the sodium channel is blocked by the lidocaine our experiment agrees with the previous study mentioned.
