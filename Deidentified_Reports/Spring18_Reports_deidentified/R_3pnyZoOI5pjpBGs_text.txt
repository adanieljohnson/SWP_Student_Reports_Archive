Title: Photosynthetic Activity of DCPIP in Chard and Chickweed Leaves in Response to Diuron and Light Wavelength 

Abstract:
This study examines the effects different wavelengths of light, 640 nm and 470nm, and the herbicide Diuron have on the rate of photosynthetic activity in Chard and Chickweed leaves. The effects are measured using Hill Reactions to quantify changes in absorbance based on the reduction of electron acceptor DCPIP using a spectrometer. If Chard and Chickweed are exposed to lights with wavelengths of 640 or 470nm, then photosynthetic rates will be elevated, and samples exposed to normal light and Diuron will show decreased levels of photosynthetic activity. This experiment resulted in significent findings for Chickweed samples under 640nm lights after 30 minutes and Diuron after 10 minutes and 20 minutes, but insignificent findings for all other comparisons between wavelengths, leaves, and herbicides. Improvements include establishing a more efficient method for isolating chloroplasts and a greater intensity of light is necessary to affect the rate of photosynthesis. 


Introduction:
Plants obtain and produce the energy needed to sustain life through a process called photosynthesis. This process beings when plants capture energy from the sun in the form of photons, and this energy is then used to create chemical gradients across bilayers or stored within chemical bonds. Eventually, the plant uses the stored energy for glycolysis and respiration. The two parts of photosynthesis, light dependent and light independent, make use of different photosystems within the plant. In photosystem II, the energy from the photons is used to create a proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis, which causes electrons to leave the reaction center and be transferred to a high-energy electron carrier known as plastiquinone. The Hill Reaction proved that production of oxygen by chloroplasts is independent of carbon dioxide assimilation when the oxidized chlorophyll indirectly stimulates production of water from oxygen [Arnon: 1971]. Measurement of the Hill Reaction is provided by adding an electron acceptor to a sample of isolated chloroplasts, such as DCPIP, which accepts hydrogen near the primary photochemical center and is then reduced near to plastiquinone [West: 1967]. DCPIP in its oxidized form is an aromatic ring, appears blue, and optimally absorbs light at a wavelength of 600nm, but when reduced, DCPIP appears colorless due to conjugated bonds. Further, photosynthesis is affected by many different environmental conditions, such as availability of sunlight, the specific wavelength of light, presence of a herbicide, and individuality of different species of leaves. A common herbicide, Diuron, greatly decreased the rate of photosynthesis activity and weed populations when applied to Alfalfa fields [McClellan: 1999]. Previously, different wavelengths of light produced different levels of photosynthetic activity, and photosystem II operated best at a wavelength of less than 700 nm in green plants [Arnon: 1971].  Recent experiments have shown that light-emitting diode technologies present an opportunity for improving plant growth and sustainability of farming. Red LEDs match the maximum absorption peak for plants, which is around 650-665nm [Darko et al: 2014], while blue LEDs promote plant growth by maintaining the integrity of chloroplast proteins [Muneer et al: 2014].  This experiment utilizes the reduction of DCPIP through the Hill Reaction in order to quantify photosynthetic activity under various light wavelengths in Beta vulgarism (underlined)(chard) and Stellaria media (underlined)(chickweed).  Chard and Chickweed are good candidates for experimentation due to their lack of specificity for a cofactor [Avron: 1960], surplus of leaves, and availability of chloroplasts to be isolated. It is hypothesized that if samples of Chard and Chickweed are exposed to lights with wavelengths of 640 or 470 nanometers, photosynthetic rates will be elevated, and if samples are exposed to normal light with Diuron, there will be decreased levels of photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted at Wake Forest University within Winston Hall. Beginning with Chard and Chickweed leaves, chloroplasts were isolated by centrifuging twice (200xG for 3 minutes at 4*C, then 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4*C ) and treated using Hill reaction assay method. The three treatment conditions included 640nm light, 470nm light, and natural light. Additionally, the herbicide assay was performed using Diuron and placed only under natural light. See supplements for full reagent table. The absorbance of each assay was read from a spectrometer at time 0 and every 10 minutes up to 30 minutes total. The percent change in absorbance was calculated using the equation: absorbance at time 0 minus absorbance at time “n,” all divided by absorbance at time 0, and multiplied by 100. The tests were compared using a two-tailed t_test with alpha value of 0.05. Each treatment was compared to the sample under normal light and values recorded for 640nm and 470nm were compared to each other. 


Results:
Photosynthetic rates for both Chard and Chickweed increased the most in samples treated with 640nm light (red light), and photosynthetic rates were lowest when Diuron was present. In the Chickweed samples, displayed in Figure 2, the 640 nm lights significently increased the rate of photosynthesis after 30 minutes (t(4)=7.96, p&lt;0.05; p=0.001).The 470nm light treatment increased photosynthetic rates in comparison to the normal treatment, but was insignificent. Additionally, Diuron significently decreased the rate of photosynthesis at 10 minutes (t(4)=6.34, p&lt;0.05, p=0.003) and 20 minutes (t(4)=4.02, p&lt;0.05; p=0.015). 
In the Chard samples, displayed in figure 3, the 640 nm lights also increased photosynthetic rates, while the 470nm light had no effect on the rate. There was no significent difference between normal light and Chard at 470nm or 640 nm, while in contrast, normal light vs. 470nm was close to a critical p_value at 10 minutes (t(4)=2.33, p&gt;.05; p=0.08). Diuron showed no significent effects in reducing photosynthetic activity, keeping photosynthetic rates even with the sample containing no chloroplasts. 


Discussion:
The first null hypothesis was accepted, and photosynthetic rates did not significently change when Chard and Chickweed were exposed to lights with wavelengths of 640nm or 470nm. Having some significent results caused by differences in photosynthetic rates, chickweed had a p=value of 0.001 at 30 minutes under 640nm lights compared to normal light, but results were insignificent for chard. For the 470nm light samples, the chard sample came close to statistically significent with p=0.08 at 10 minutes compared to chickweed, which was much further from significent. This suggests chickweed has increased photosynthetic rates under 640nm lights and chard has increased activity under 470nm lights, but the overall lack of significance could be due to insufficient measures for isolating chloroplasts. The samples of Chard and Chickweed use for testing may have included inadequate numbers of chloroplasts to provide accurate measures during the experiment. Additionally, results could have been effected by a chard sample under the 470nm light, which had an abnormal response to treatment compared with the other replicates and may have affected the results.  If there were increased concentrations of chloroplasts in each treatment group, a significance in the difference between 640nm or 470nm light with normal light may have occurred even in the presence of unqualified samples. Other confounding factors include the lack of a sealed container for the 470nm and 640nm light treatment groups, allowing normal light to reach the samples.  Therefore, future experiments should check chloroplast density and place samples in sealed light conditions.

Secondly, the null hypothesis was accepted that there is no significent difference in photosynthetic activity between samples with Diuron and without herbicide. Diuron significently decreased photosynthetic activity in chickweed at both 10 minutes (p=0.003) and 20 minutes (p=0.015), but there was a lack of significent data for all other times and conditions with chard. This suggests the herbicide Diuron more efficiently reduces photosynthetic rates in chickweed populations, and a different herbicide should be used for chard.
The lack of significance in all samples is also possibly due to small concentrations of chloroplasts and a low concentration of herbicide. Further experimentation using the same treatments should include advanced measures for isolating chloroplasts, such as using sorbitol, EDTA and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone for the grinding buffer, and centrifuging at 1500 g for 10 minutes and then 8000g for 20 minutes [Fan: 2009]. A hemocytometer can be used to measure relative chloroplast density, and samples can include increased concentrations of Diuron. These measures will provide more precise results, and due to the possibility of increasing sustainability in farming populations, the ability to increase photosynthetic rates is beneficial to the population. Further studies should examine the potential for red LEDs around the wavelength of 640nm to optimize growth in plants and other effects of light intensity on plant species. Aside from chard and chickweed, maize leaves under increasing levels of light saturation showed increases in photosynthetic activity [Hesketh: 1963], and plants exposed to higher intensities of light develop means to reduce stress effects and promote longevity of the plant [Darko: 2014]. Exploration into the effects of LED lights and herbicides on plant populations within the bounds of the Hill Reaction provides opportunities to increase photosynthetic rates and sustainability of farming practices overall.
