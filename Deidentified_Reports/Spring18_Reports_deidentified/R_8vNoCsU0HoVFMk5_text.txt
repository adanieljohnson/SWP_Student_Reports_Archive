Title: Inhibiting ecdysterone hormones of Manduca sexta diet prevents its growth and molting

Abstract:
In this experiment, the Manduca sexta caterpillar was being studied to further our understanding about the ecdysterone hormone. The Manduca sexta caterpillar goes through 40-day life cycle. Juvenile hormones and ecdysterone play large roles in the Manduca sexta’s life cycle (particularly in relation to its molting and growth). Both juvenile hormones and ecdysterone are vital for insects to have in order to survive. An ecdysterone inhibitor in form of Azaguard food was introduced into four caterpillar’s meals and the other four caterpillars are fed normally. Both groups are placed into similar conditions (container and incubator). We hypothesized that the caterpillars that are fed normally will progress in growth and molting quicker than the other group since they are receiving proper amounts of ecdysterone. Once the lab was finished (at the end of 1 week), two controll group caterpillars molted before any experimental caterpillars did. There was a larger weight change in the controll group caterpillars than the experimental group. However, there was still not enough statistical evidence to support that inhibiting ecdysterone prevents or slows down growth of the Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
This experiment was designed to learn more about what the ecdysterone hormone does for the Tobacco Hornworm (Manduca sexta) in relation to its growth and molting. An insect in the Order Lepidoptera, The Manduca sexta is known to go through about a 40-day life cycle in which the egg becomes a larva, molts and becomes a Pupa, and finally becomes an adult moth after molting. It was useful to study this organism since it progresses through these phases so clearly. Juvenile hormones and ecdysterone are both necessary for insects to have in order to live. Juvenile hormones and ecdysterone function together to controll molting, growth, and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta. These hormones cause for chemicals called insect growth regulators to become used as insecticides, which in effect can affect the subject’s health. When either juvenile hormones or ecdysterone are inhibited it could cause for molting, growth, and metamorphosis all to be affected in the Manduca sexta. The ecdysterone hormone mainly regulates the timing of molting. A lack of ecdysterone will cause the caterpillar to mature at a slower rate, thus making this weigh less. In his experiment Masatoshi Kobayshi studied the effects that ecdysterone had on molting of insects. They studied to see what affects came from increasing ecdysterone levels in a housefly, Musca domestica. It was found that increased ecdysterone levels would speed up the process of molting [Kobayshi: 1967]. Different from his experiment, in our experiment we attempt to see how introducing an inhibitor of ecdysterone called Azaguard to the Manduca sexta affects the system. We hypothesize that if we inhibit ecdysterone levels in the Manduca sexta then it will prevent or slow down growth (in relation to weight) and molting of the caterpillar.

Materials and Method:
Attaining eight Manduca sexta caterpillars from our TA, we split up the caterpillars evenly into 2 groups (a controll and experimental group). Every caterpillar needs to be weighed initially so that we can compare its initial weight to its final weight. Then each caterpillar was placed in its own cubby (2 per each container). An index card and tape were used to divide the containers into two separate cubbies.  Throughout the week the controll and experimental groups would be fed their own diet. Daily, the controll group was fed 10g of food (with an additional 10 drops of di water), while the experimental was fed 10g of food (with an additional 10 drops of a reagent called Azaguard 1: 1250). When the caterpillars were not being fed, they were placed inside an incubator. The temperature inside the incubator was maintained at 23ºC. Each caterpillar was labeled on the index card so that it could be identified easily. And each jar was labeled with the groups names. Throughout the week caterpillars were weighed and observations were made. In the end, a two-sample t_test was used to compare the controll and experimental group’s initial and final weights.


Results:
In the experiment, we used a two-sample t_test and found our p_value to be 0.665, thus making our data not statistically significent. The average weight change for caterpillars in the controll group was 0.433 g and the average weight change of the caterpillars in the experimental group was -0.430 g. As seen in figure 1, the controll groups standard deviation for weight change was large at ±3.42 g. Also seen in figure 1, the experimental group’s standard deviation for weight change was smaller at ±1.65 g. We see in figure 2 that two caterpillars in the controll group gained weight (C1 and C2) and that two caterpillars lost weight (C3 and C4). The two caterpillars in which lost weight were the only ones that had successfully molted during this experiment. We see in figure 3 that three caterpillars from the experimental group lost weight (E1, E2, and E4) by the end of the experiment. In figure 2 we see that C2 in the controll group gained by far the most weight by gaining 4.02 g. While C3 in the controll group lost the most weight by losing 2.94 g. On day five of seven, E4 in the experimental group died. After day 4 all the experimental group caterpillars were observed to be moving rarely and slowly. Apart from the caterpillars that had molted, the controll group caterpillars were all observed to be alive, healthy, and moving.

Discussion:
Since the p_value was 0.665, which is greater than 0.05, there was not enough statistical evidence to support our hypothesis that inhibiting ecdysterone prevents growth and molting of the Manduca sexta. General trends, however, show that the Manduca sexta molts more often without ecdysterone. With a larger sample size of caterpillars, trends may have been made more prevalent and caused for the p_value to decrease. Another factor not accounted for in this experiment is that molting may cause for the Manduca sexta to lose weight. The molted caterpillars weighed much less than the other caterpillars in the controll group. An error that may have disrupted our data was that two caterpillars (C1/C2 and E1/E2) ate through the index card. This was a possible error since the caterpillars may have been switched, throwing off the data. H. Shigematsu had an experiment in which he completed a similar study on the growth and silk formation of silkworm’s larvae. In this experiment, he compared groups of silkworms ate 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg of ecdysterone every day. He discovered in this experiment that the weight of the silkworms that ate 5 μg of ecdysterone were noticeably lower than the weight of the silkworms that ate 10 μg and 20 μg [Shigematsu: 1972]. Several observations in our experiment concur with Shigematsu’s findings, such as the two controll group caterpillars that molted (compared to zero experimental caterpillars). Another observation that coincides with this experiment were the two controll group caterpillars that gained weight and the three experimental group caterpillars that lost weight. In future studies, it is important to compare the weight of the caterpillars before they molt and after (if they even end up molting). Another improvement that could be made is using a better material than index cards. Finally, we could use a large sample size of caterpillars.
