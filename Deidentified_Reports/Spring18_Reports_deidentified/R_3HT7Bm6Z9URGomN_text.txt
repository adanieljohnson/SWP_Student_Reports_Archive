Title: Effects of JH Concentration on Weight of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
ABSTRACT: Manduca sextas are a type of insect similar to caterpillars, butterflies, and moths. In order to reach their pupation stage, they need of the Juvenile Hormone in their lives. Methoprane has the same effects of JH, and is referred to as well as used in place of JH for this experiment. If a higher level of JH is given to a Maduca sexta, its weight should decrease because the levels of JH are proven to decrease right before the commitment pulse. This experiment focused on the weight of the Manduca sextas throughout a week of observing and feeding a controll group and an experimental group in which the experimental group received an extra 3 drops of methropane to their food. The separate subjects were observed and it was found that there was not a major difference between the controll and experimental group although it was shown that increasing the level of JH still increased the weight in a Manduca sexta. 


Introduction:
INTRO: Manduca sextas are a kind of insect that pertain to the Order Lepidoptera and have a life cycle beginning as a pest and eventually turn into a moth. The larvae stage is one of the most important parts of their life cycles as a certain hormones are needed in order to cause pupation. One specific hormone needed is called the Juvenile Hormone (JH) as it helps to regulate the type of molt during development in a Manduca sexta and is produced by the corpus allata. Molts, or the new epidermal layer of skin for the insect, separate the 5 larval stages in the insect’s life cycle. In most of these stages, the JH hormone stays continually high, however it is lowered right before the 5th larval stage. When the JH lowers during the 5th larval stage, another hormone, 20E rises. 20E is secreted by the prothoracic gland and helps with the timing of the insects’ molts as well as adult functions. Lastly, the hormone PTTH, produced by the corpus cardiacum, helps release the proper amount of 20E. (Johnson, 2018). Although the JH levels drops below it’s normal amount right before the commitment pulse, the level gets higher again right after the fifth larvae stage (Fain, 1971). Due to this lowering of JH right before the commitment pulse it is expressed that if the level of JH is raised with an additional 3 drops of methropane to the Manduca sextas’ food, their weight will decrease over the week of observation.


Materials and Method:
METHODS: The experiment began as we divided the eight Manduca sextas into two groups of four. For each group of four, we placed two insects into a plastic container with a barrier between them. Two of the containers included the controll group just as the other two containers were the experimental groups. The controll group was given a mixed substance containing 10g of food with 0.15Ml of distilled water. In addition, the experimental group was given 10mg of food and 0.15Ml of 4% methoprane. Finally, for a week, the insects’ weight was observed and recorded daily as they were kept in 25 degree Celsius incubators while alternating a 12 hour time span with light and 12 hour time span without light. A 2 sample T-test was used to find results because the overall significent difference between the controll and experimental groups was the objective. 


Results:
RESULTS:All of the insects, except one, weighed more on the last day than they did on Day 1. Control 3 Manduca sexta’s weight, however, started to decline after the first day as it lessened from 1.25g to 0.76g. Because the P-value was 0.512, the difference between the two groups tested was not significent. Overall, the controll group had an average of 1.29g with a standard deviation of 1.255 and the experimental group had an average of 1.765 with a standard deviation of 0.533. Figure 1 shows that there was not a major difference between the controll and experimental group’s weight. 



Discussion:
DISCUSSION: The hypothesis was rejected as the JH levels actually helped the Manduca sextas grow in weight rather than decrease. It was hypothesized that  a lower level of JH may lower the weight because the levels automatically lower before the commitment pulse anyways. However, this was not the case as the JH still is needed to help with the molting process. New molts are created in each larval stage, and is made possible due to the a carrier protein found in the JH that transports the hormone to the tissues targeted for the molting process (Kramer, 1976). Due to a higher level of JH, there must also be a higher amount of carrier proteins found that can therefore target a higher amount of tissues to create a larger molt. This explains why the hypothesis failed and the weight of Manduca sextas actually increased. In simpler terms, the Juvenile Hormone is used to regulate development, and this is exactly what was seen through this experiment. The experiment only lasted for a week, so the pupation process was not seen. In the future, it would be interesting to watch the insects actually follow through with their pupation to observe and see if possibly the effects would be different later on in their life cycle.

Four Manduca sextas were in the controll group and another four were in the experimental group which received an additional 0.15 Ml of methropene to their food. The insects were weighed daily as the last day to first day difference of each group's weight is shown.  The mean from the controll group is not significent from the experimental group: (d.f.=6, P=0.512317, T=0.696268).
