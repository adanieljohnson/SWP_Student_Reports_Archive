Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In this experiment we will be observing the effects of Juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which population can occur. In order to do this, we will have a controll and an experimental group. Each caterpillar in the experimental group will receive 10g of IGR treated food. On the other hand, the controll group will receive 10g of food with only DI water added to it. In order to analyze our data we will be conducting a two-sample t_test. We are testing to see if the Juvenile hormone alters the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. We will observe any increases in growth, as well as, any physiological changes of each caterpillar. 

Introduction:
The most important aspect of this lab and the respective growth of our model organisms is hormones. Hormones are responsible for puberty in humans, as well as, the development and life cycles of insects. For example, two hormones that directly affect insect development are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone work together to controll growth, molting and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta. With this said, these hormones are important because without one of them, the insects will most likely not fully develop, or could result in their death. 
Furthermore, in one case study focused on better controllling insect pest with the help of insect growth regulators (IGRs). The IGRs are used as a way to affect the insect’s growth and development. These regulators have an affect on certain physiological regulatory processes essential to insect development. A test was administered on cultures of linden bugs, which, in turn, resulted in low egg hatch rates, and later failed to mature into adults. With this said, insect growth regulators became a successful alternative to toxic insecticides (Johnson AD).
In addition to the linden bug, an experiment was conducted on the Manduca sexta caterpillars, our model organism for the lab. The Manduca sexta starts as an egg, then goes through the 5th larval instar, as a caterpillar, pupates and finally becomes an adult, in the form of a moth. In order to pass from one life stage to another the organism must molt and go through the process of metamorphosis. Our model organism’s growth and development is similarly affected by hormone-based and neuro-based signaling. Therefore, in addition to the linden bug, the Manduca sexta is also affected by Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone. 
In order to conduct this experiment, we will treat an experimental group with 5 drops of Juvenile hormone, allowing us to compare these results to the controll group, which will receive no added hormones to their food. Throughout the span of 7 days of daily feeding, we will track and record the growth and physiological changes of each caterpillar. 
We hypothesize that an increase of Juvenile hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which pupation can occur. 


Materials and Method:
Each caterpillar apart of the experimental group will receive 5 drops of 1: 1250 Dilution of IGR with DI water to their 10g of food every day. On the other hand, the controll group of caterpillars will only receive an addition of 5 water drops to their daily food. In order to carry out this experiment, we will dedicate four Manduca sexta caterpillars to the controll group, and four Manduca sexta caterpillars to the experimental group. Each caterpillar will be placed in its own section of a container. For seven days straight, we will feed each caterpillar 10g of their respective food, depending on if they are in the controll or experimental group. Each new day, we will dispose of their old food, and replace it with new food. For our data collection, we will measure the weight of each caterpillar, weight the leftover food and make direct observations on physiological changes and morphology. To analyze our date we will be conducting a two-sample t_test. Two-sample t_tests are used to compare the means from two groups of data; specifically, the mean of a controll group to the mean of an experimental group. Furthermore, we will either be rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis depending on our results. 

Results:
After conducting the experiment we noticed that by increasing the percent of JH in their food, it made the caterpillars have physiological changes, as well as an increase in weight. Through observation, we noticed that the experimental group went from a bright green/blue color to a pale green color. On top of this, after seven days, the experimental caterpillars became swollen and had white legs instead of their original black legs. The controll caterpillars maintained their bright green/blue coloration and still had black legs. Both groups of caterpillars gained weight, however, the experimental group had a larger increase in weight. 
P-value: 0.75 
T-value: 0.33
Degree of freedom: 8


Discussion:
For this experiment, our hypothesis was that an increase of Juvenile Hormone by 5% will inhibit the experimental caterpillars from muturing to a stage in which pupation can occur. After conducting our experiment, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there was no change, due to the fact that out p_value was 0.75. Our expectation was that an increase in JH would cause the caterpillars to have gone back to instar again. The caterpillars did obtain both weight gain and changes in coloration, however, there was not enough evidence to prove that the JH caused an alteration in their life cycle. The controll group was expected to turn a yellow-brown color, indicating that they were ready to pupate and turn into adults. With this said, the controll caterpillars did not experience this change. Overall, the JH must be at a low level at the commitment pulse in order for it to mature into an adult.
