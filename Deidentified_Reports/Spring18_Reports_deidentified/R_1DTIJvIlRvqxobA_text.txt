Title: The effects of Tetraethylammonium, a K+ channel-blocker, on the muscle contractions of a Rana Pipiens leg

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effects of a K+ Channel-blocker on the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg of the frog Rana pipiens. Tetraethylammonium (TEA), which is known to block K+ channels, was injected into the leg of frog. To cause muscle contractions, the sciatic nerve was stimulated with electrodes and the contractions of the leg were measured using a force transducer.  It was hypothesized that the relaxation period of a muscle contraction and the total twitch duration would be lengthened by injecting TEA into the leg. The results of the experiments were statistically significant and proved that TEA did have an effect of elongating twitch duration and relaxation period. The results indicate that TEA is a successful K+ channel-blocker. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab was to examine the muscle contractions of a frog’s leg when Potassium-ion (K+) channel blocker is administered to the muscle. The experiment will use several legs of the frogs Rana Pipiens, also known as the Northern Leopard Frog.
 Muscle contractions involve coordination between the nervous system and the muscular system. The inside of neurons have a difference in electrical voltage that is less negative compared to the outside of the neuron. The electrical membrane difference is created by having K+ inside the membrane and Sodium ion (Na+) outside the membrane which creates an electrical gradient. The electrical gradient is sustained by the Sodium-Potassium pump. This electrical gradient then maintains the Resting Membrane Potential by use of Potassium leak channels. For a muscle contraction to occur, first, the central nervous system sends an action potential down through axons, the primary transmitting portion of neurons.  To create an action potential, the gated sodium channels in the membrane open and sodium rushes in, depolarizing the membrane. The action potential travels down a motor neuron and then propagates along the sarcolemma and down the t-tubules until the sarcoplasmic reticulum is stimulated to release Ca2+. The Calcium ions affect Actin and myosin—the contractile fibers in a muscle. These Ca2+ ions expose binding sites on actin fibers to which myosin binds to in order to being a contraction. It takes several myosin and actin units working in cohesion to contract one muscle fiber to cause a twitch.  
Muscle twitches are divided into three separate phases: the latent period, the contraction period, and the relaxation period. The latent period is the time from when the stimulus is delivered to the first indications of contraction in the muscle. The contraction period, is the time it takes the muscle to reach its peak contraction after the latent period. The relaxation period is the time the muscle takes to return to resting tension after reaching its peak contraction[Silverthorn:2010]. 
In order to end a contraction, K+ must reenter the cell membrane. This will repolarize the neuron and muscle fiber and cause them to eventually return to their resting membrane potentials. For this lab, Tetraethylammonium (TEA) was applied to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog. TEA is known to block voltage-dependent K+ channels and also blocks Ca2+ - activated K+ channels[Armstrong:1971]. Blocking a K+ channel prevents repolarization of the neuron so the neuron will remain activated and will continue to fire action potentials, causing uncontrollable spasms[Lotshaw:1997]. We hypothesize that the times for both the relaxation period and the total twitch will increase because of the inability of the neuron to repolarize because of the K+ channel blocker

Materials and Methods:
We were provided 3 Rana pipiens frog legs that we degloved, skinned, and cut to expose the
sciatic nerve, which innervates the gastrocnemius muscle. The bottom of the Achilles tendon that connected to the gastrocnemius muscle was then cut and tied with string.  A loop was made and the leg was hung up on a force transduction machine. After this, the leg was pinned down to stabilize it before connecting the iWork machine with the two electrodes. The machine also connected to the computer and recorded the amplitudes of the contractions. The labscribe program that was used to control the iWork machine and what electrical signals are sent to the leg, was set with the settings at 0.8 V, 0.5 Hz, and 5 pulses. Control test were performed before injecting the potassium blocker, TEA, to measure the twitch duration
and relaxation period. After the control tests, 0.1 mL of TEA was injected into the
gastrocnemius, 0.05 at the base of the muscle and 0.05 at the top of the muscle. Once again, twitch duration and relaxation period were recorded. This process was performed the same for all 3 legs.  In order to compare results, the averages of the twitch duration and the relaxation periods were taken for the control experiments. Then the averages of the twitch durations and relaxation periods for the muscles injected were taken.  Standard deviation was calculated for each average.  Finally, a p-value and paired t-test will be used to examine the results and test their significances. 

Results:
Figure 1 illustrates that the mean relaxation periods of the legs after the addition of TEA were significantly greater than the mean before the addition of TEA (t-stat = 15.3, df = 8, P = 3.30E-7). Furthermore, Figure 2 demonstrates the mean twitch durations of the legs were significantly greater after the addition of TEA than the mean before the addition of TEA (t-stat = 16.3, df = 8, P = 2.01E-7).

Discussion:
Based on the results of the lab, the hypothesis was upheld, twitch duration and relaxation period are both lengthen by the presence of a K+ channel-blocker in the muscle. With the addition of TEA, the twitch durations mean at 1157.7  136.8 and relaxation periods mean at 1030.0  138.9 were both significantly larger than their respective control values. The results of this lab indicated proper blocking of the K+ channels. It was expected that because the neuron could not repolarize the membrane by allowing K+ to enter the membrane, action potentials would keep firing uncontrollably. This would cause the length of the twitch duration to increase greatly and also it would take the muscle much longer to reach and finish the relaxation period.
