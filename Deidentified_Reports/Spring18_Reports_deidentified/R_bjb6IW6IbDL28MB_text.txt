Title: Mandaca Caterpillar growth post introduction of Azagard 

Abstract:
Abstract;
My group tested the effects of the introduction of azagard into manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that if we introduced azagard into the Manduca caterpillar’s diet then it will be unable to molt resulting in more weight gain in these caterpillars due to them not being able to enter the next stage of their lifecycle. They would not be able to molt because azagard blocks ecdysone, the hormone that triggers molting. We studied this by feeding azagard laced food to one of two groups of caterpillars and studying the differences between the groups. We found that while the compound may prevent molting, the lack of molting does not increase weight gain. 


Introduction:
Introduction:
My lab group will attempt to alter the life cycle of the manduca sexta caterpillar through the introduction of azagard into the caterpillar’s diet. We use the Manduca sexta caterpillar as a model species for this experiment because it is lives well in a lab environment while also being easily introduced to and observably effected by easily obtainable chemicals. The manduca sexta begins life as eggs which hatch in 3-5 days. It will then move through 5 instar larval stages molting between each and these will last between 2-5 days depending on conditions with later stages lasting longer. Molting is where the caterpillar forms a new layer of skin, shedding its old skin. Molting is necessary for the caterpillar to move between stages in its lifecycle. At the end of the fifth larval stage the caterpillar will go through metamorphosis, transitioning into a Pupa [1]. Azagard blocks the hormone ecdysone, also known as 20-hydroxylecdysterone or 20E, which spikes to signal when to molt in manduca sexta caterpillars. ecdysone response in the caterpillar is triggered when the hormone reaches a threshold concentration for a certain period of time [2]. Completely blocking ecdysone would kill the caterpillar and so we will need to dose the caterpillar enough to keep it below the threshold but not kill it [3]. Ecdysone is a steroid produced by the prothoracic gland of the caterpillar that binds to the caterpillar’s DNA, altering gene expression which lead to the changes that arise in metamorphosis [4]. By preventing the process of molting, we believe the Caterpillar will be stuck in its current larval stage unable to undergo metamorphosis. Metamorphosis requires lots of energy and prevents the organism from eating, so we believe preventing this process will cause a weight change disparity. This weight disparity between azagard treated and untreated caterpillars will be the dependent variable. We are hypothesizing if we introduced azagard into the Manduca caterpillar’s diet then it will be unable to molt resulting in more weight gain in these caterpillars due to them not being able to enter the next stage of their lifecycle. The introduction or non-introduction of azagard is the independent variable, the controll being the untreated caterpillars. 


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method:
We will start by obtaining 4 rearing containers. Separate these containers into 2 sections with index card barriers down the middle. label each section of the containers controll 1, 2,3, 4 or experiment 1,2,3,4. Obtain 8 manduca sexta caterpillars of similar weights and place a single caterpillar into each of the sections. Weigh out four 10 gram balls of manduca caterpillar food, mix these well, hydrate each ball with 10 drops of distilled water from pipet and add each to a controll group section. Weigh out four more 10 gram balls of manduca food, well mixed again, hydrate each with 10 drops of 1: 1250 azagard from different pipet then add each ball to an experimental section. Place all containers into the same incubator set on 25 degrees Celsius and a 12-hour day/night cycle. Check on caterpillars every day for the next week taking observations, weighing the caterpillars, and replacing the food as needed. Calculate the average weight change from the final weighing of the caterpillars and use 2 sample t_test excel sheet to calculate P-value comparing the change in weights of the controll versus the experimental group. 


Results:
Results:
While the controll group on average gained weight, the experimental group lost weight on average. However, weight gain and loss were not evenly distributed between caterpillars in the least. Both the most weight was gained and lost by a controll caterpillar resulting in an average standard deviation around 3.42 for the controll. All this can be observed in table 1. The order the caterpillars molted correlates to them losing more weight with controll 3 molting day 6 and controll 4 molting day 7. Experimental group standard deviation was a little less at 1.65, but still very high for the data set. Figure 1 best illustrates how wildly the results varied. We observed molting in 2 of the 4 controll caterpillars and none of the experimental caterpillars and only one caterpillar died and it was in the experimental group as seen in table 1. The death occurred before day 5 in experimental caterpillar 4. We decided on using a 2 sample T-test to compare how close the mean values of 2 sets of data are. When we ran a 2 sample T-test, we obtained a p value of 0.665633. The P-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is truer than the chosen hypothesis, values over .05 signal that the data is not significent enough to prove the hypothesis. 


Discussion:
Discussion: 
Our P-value does not substantiate the hypothesis that introducing azagard would cause caterpillars to gain more weight. The caterpillars treated with azagard in fact had slightly less weight gain than their controll counterparts. While we know that after the first commitment pulse the caterpillar will stop feeding to find a pupation site, this might not be enough of an edge for the experimental group [5]. This seems to be due to our limited understanding of manduca Caterpillar behavior and anatomy. the inability to molt may have prevented the experimental caterpillars from growing, limiting weight gain. conduction this experiment with a different depended variable, like times molted, would be more effective due to being more directly affected by the independent variable. We did indeed seem to observe the azagard causing the caterpillars to not molt, however we would need to conduct another experiment with larger groups over a longer timeframe to be sure. The azagard could have also put the experimental caterpillars in much worse health than the controll, evidenced by higher concentrations often killing the caterpillar, possibly limiting weight gain [3]. Evidence of this was the death of a single experimental caterpillar and the survival of all controlls, of course, tests with much larger group sizes would be needed to prove this. Although the controll group gained more weight on average, the two caterpillars that did go through metamorphosis in the controll lost the most weight of any caterpillars as seen in table 1 with the order they went through metamorphosis correlating to their weight loss. We also had a large variation is the original sizes of the caterpillars which would cause larger variation is P-value and the large error bars on figure 1. While the original size of the caterpillar does not seem to be directly observably correlated with the amount of weight they gain or lose as seen in table 1, more tests would have to be done to confirm this. Around day five caterpillars in experiment one and controll one ate their ways into their neighbors’ enclosures as seen in figures 2 and 3. While I believe I separated them properly by moving the caterpillar back most closely to the original weight of the one in the enclosure, I cannot be sure. If this experiment could be repeated with larva in an earlier stage that wouldn’t go through metamorphosis, the results would be very interesting. By looking at the data in table 1, I can see that when the controll caterpillars did not go through metamorphosis they gained much more weight on average than the experimental caterpillars. this leads me to the assumption that the alternate hypothesis, azagard introduction slows weight gain, is more plausible if individuals in metamorphosis are excluded but more experiments would be needed to come to conclusions.
