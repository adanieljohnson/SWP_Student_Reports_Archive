Title: The Effect of  the Concentration of Juvenile Hormone on the Weight of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta experiences four distinct stages which are triggered by the insect molting. The molting process is a result of the release of ecdysone from the prothoracicotropic gland and it is through the concentration of juvenile hormone present in the insect that it can decide what to molt into. Through the manipulation of the concentration of juvenile hormone present in the insect through their consumption of Precor which would increase the juvenile hormone concentration; we predict that the insect would experience a lower weight as it transforms from a larva to a pupa. However, we were proven wrong in that although the Manduca sexta caterpillars which were treated with Precor had a lower weight our p_value determined that it was not significent.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta (M.sexta), also known as the tobacco hornworm, which belongs to the Order Lepidoptera, has an average holometabolous life cycle of 39 to 48 days. In a holometabolous life cycle the insect experiences four distinct stages in which it starts as an egg/embryo and through a process called molting, in which the M.sexta sheds its cuticle, the egg grows into a larva. The larval stage consists of five growth periods in between molts called instars. It is in the final instar in which the M.sexta prepares for metamorphosis into an adult moth. Molting is triggered through appropriate stimulation in which the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is diffused into a prothoracic gland which causes the gland to secrete ecdysone which then when it comes in contact with target tissues stimulates molting. The concentration of juvenile hormone, produced mainly by the corpus allatum, has effect on the decision on that the insect become whether what to be larva, pupa, or adult i.e the type of molt. We predict that with the manipulation of the juvenile hormone concentration by increasing it in the larva stage the insect will experience a lower weight as it develops into adults. 

Materials and Method:
Select eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in the larva stage who have not passed the commitment pulse, separate them into two groups (four in each group) one group being the treatment group and the other being the controll group. Grab four container and with a notecard divide the container in half. On each side of the notecard label which group they belong to as well as numbering them. Before placing each caterpillar in its corresponding container weight them and record their initial weight. Weigh 10 grams of the provided food for each of the caterpillars. For the controll group, with a pipet add 10 drops of distilled water into the food and mix. For the treatment group, with a pipet add 10 drops of Precor (which stimulates an increase in juvenile hormone) and mix. Place the caterpillars in their corresponding container and then place all of the containers in an incubator. For the next week, the food of the caterpillar has to be changed daily to allow the caterpillars to feed on it  and when changing the food record their weight of that day as well. Once the weight data has been collected for the week, do a two sample t_test to see the variance of the two means for which are able to make conclusions based on the difference obtained.


Results:
 Through the graph one is able to see that that treatment 3 responded alike those in the controll group. One can also see that treatment 2 also differed from the group in that there is an evident decrease in the caterpillar’s weight. On day 3, the weights of the caterpillars belonging to separate groups start differing.
T-statistic: 2.113482
Degree of freedom: 6
P-value: 0.078463


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was rejected; although the weights of the treatment group were to some degree lower than the controll group, with the exception of treatment 3, there was not a significent decrease between the two to support our hypothesis. Treatment 3 responded to its diet as if it was one in the controll group in that its final weigh was close to 12 grams. The increase in weight can be attested to the failure to properly mix the food given to the caterpillar in that if the caterpillar is does not ingest the Precor it will continue to molt. Treatment 2 weight drastically differs from the rest of the treatment weights, however, it is something that would have been expected with the increase of juvenile hormone in the caterpillar’s diet.
