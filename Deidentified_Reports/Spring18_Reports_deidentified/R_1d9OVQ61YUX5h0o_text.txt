Title: The Lack of Preference in Female Betta splendens for Size of Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
The purpose of this report is to determine if female Betta splendens show preference for the size of male Betta splendens. We hypothesized that the female Bettas would prefer larger males. We measured the preference of the female by the time spent engaged with the larger or smaller male, and the time spent unengaged in either male. Four trials were run with four different female Bettas and two different sets of males. The male Bettas served as our independent variables and the recorded times of engaged with the small or large male, or unengaged served as our dependent variable. Using a paired t test, we calculated a p-value of 0.792 for ratio of time engaged or unengaged, and a p-value of 0.642 for time engaged with the big male or the small male. These results show insignificance between the time the female showed preference or did not show preference and between time spent engaged with the large or small fish. The results did not support our hypothesis, and rather show that female Bettas show no preference for size of male Bettas. Our study and results are important for understanding female preference in male qualities for reproduction, and for better understanding the Betta species. 

Introduction:
The goal of this study is to observe the behavior of Betta splendens to determine if female Betta splendens show preference for larger male Betta fish. The Betta fish will be used because of their vibrant displays, specifically with members of their own species in which they exhibit intraspecific behavior. Betta fish are also capable of interspecific behavior (with members of other species). Overall, Betta fish have a range of behaviors that can be observed in lab. They are easily bred and readily available, making them a perfect model for our biological question [Braddock: 1955]. Studies have confirmed that males alter male-male interactions when either a male or female audience is present [Dzieweczynski: 2009]. Male Betta fish can even be conditioned to emit an operant response sequence reinforced by presentation of a model of another male Betta fish, in which the rate varied as a function of the color of the model with respect to the color of the subject [Thompson: 1965]. There are a variety of male Betta fish behaviors, using their fins, opercula, and branchiostegal membrane beneath the operculum [Johnson: 2018]. However, in our study, we ignored the behavior of the male Betta fish and only looked at the female preference for the male. We are hoping to answer whether female Betta show preference for larger or smaller male Betta fish. We chose males of similar color to avoid getting data for color preference instead of size preference. Females can behave aggressively, but typically do not with males [Elcoro: 2008]. Therefore, we looked at the amount of time the female Betta fish was engaged with the small or large male Betta, or unengaged completely with the males. In one study, it was observed that females showed no preference for display rates in males but did prefer larger male Bettas [Clotfelter: 2006]. Based on this information, we hypothesized that the female Betta fish will show preference for the larger male Betta fish by remaining engaged longer compared to with the smaller male Betta fish.

Materials and Methods:
Male and female Betta splendens were used in our study. We picked two males of similar color and of varying size (one small, one large), and placed them at the ends of our divided tank with three compartments. They acted as our independent variables. Then, we selected one female Betta fish and placed it in the middle compartment. We then removed the solid separator and kept the opaque separators in the tank to prevent the males from fighting each other or all three fish from fighting each other. We observed the female Betta fish for five minutes. This included recording time on each side of her compartment (close to the larger or smaller male) and the time the female was engaged or unengaged. These times were the dependent variables. Then, we switched female and repeated the experiment for five minutes. After this trial, we put all three fish back and picked two new males and one new female, then placed them in their respective compartments (female in the middle, males on the end). We recorded times again. Finally, we switched the female and kept the two males for our final and fourth trial. We then calculated the average time engaged with the small and big fish, and the average ratio of time engaged with either male fish and the ratio of time unengaged. These results can be seen in Figures 1 and 2. Once the graphs were made, we used a paired t test to calculate p-values and determine significance or insignificance of our results.

Results:
The average ratio of time the female was engaged at all was 0.444±0.193 and the average ratio of time the female was unengaged was 0.556±0.194. Using these results, we used a paired t test to calculate a p value of 0.792. The average time engaged with the big male was 55.6±43.4 seconds and the average time engaged with the small male was 59.4±29.7 seconds. Using a paired t test again, we calculated a p value of 0.642. Figure 1 shows the results of average ratio of time engaged or unengaged, and Figure 2 shows results of average time engaged with the small male or large male.

Discussion:
There was no significance in the time the female spent engaged or unengaged with the male, meaning the female showed insignificantly more or less amount of time engaged with the males or unengaged. There was also no significance in the time the female spent engaged with the big or small male, showing the female had no significant preference for the larger or small male. Overall, these results do not support our hypothesis that the female was prefer the larger male. The female Bettas instead showed no preference for male size. Our results also do not support the study referenced in the introduction, stating that females do prefer larger males [Clotfelter: 2006]. However, another study also found that females presented with two potential mates of different sizes did not prefer larger males [Jaroensutasinee: 2005]. Our study is important to add to other research on our topic, since the results differ and give different interpretations of whether females have preference for male size. It is also important to understand animal behavior in general. For example, if Betta fish populations shrink or become endangered in the future, knowing the female preference for males would be important for breeding. There are many other studies regarding Betta fish behavior. Aggressive behavior among females is interesting, and it was found that females do fight until there is a winner, but without significant differences between winners and losers found in frequencies of challenges or bites [Braddock: 1955]. Betta fish are great models for studying behavior, proven by the countless studies done on them. Our study’s results prove that females show no preference for size in male Bettas, which is important to add to the existing research on female preference in males for reproduction.
