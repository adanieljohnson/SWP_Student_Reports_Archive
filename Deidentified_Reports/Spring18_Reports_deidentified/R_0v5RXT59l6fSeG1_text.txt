Title: The Effect of Azamax on 20E Production in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a pest that pupates and becomes a moth when it matures. Both juvenile hormone and ecdysone are growth hormones in Manduca sexta and are necessary to the growth process. It was hypothesized that the blocking of ecdysone through the natural insecticide Azamax will inhibit the growth process and keep the caterpillars from maturing. Subsequently, caterpillars that are fed a diet treated with Azamax will weigh less and will have a smaller change in weight over 8 days than caterpillars that are fed a controll diet.  This hypothesis was proven to be true due to the fact that the four untreated caterpillars were much greater in weight than the four Azamax treated caterpillars. This proves that 20E is essential to the growth and development of caterpillars and that the inhibition of 20E results in abnormal development.

Introduction:
The Manduct sexta is a pest that turns into a moth after it pupates [Johnson: 2018]. Insects molt, or change state and mature, into adults by the release of hormones. Manduca sexta caterpillars molt as a result from the release of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20E), which regulates timing of molting and controlls additional functions in adult Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2018]. The necessity of ecdysone was found through experiments by Nijhout, who slowly defused ecdysone into Manduca sexta and observed that it elicited a physiological response of prodromal symptoms of pupation, even in the absence of juvenile hormone [Nijhout: 1976]. The experiment done by Nijhout demonstrates that the hormone 20E must be present in order to begin maturation of the caterpillars [Nijhout: 1976]. Blocking ecdysone would result in abnormal amounts of growth and development hormones in the Manduca sexta because ecdysone regulates timing of molting. Both JH and 20E are crucial to normal caterpillar development, so the absence of one hormone would result in abnormal development. The caterpillar would not be able grow and mature if 20E is inhibited, so it would be very small, and its starting weight would not be much lower than its final weight. This organism is good to use in this experiment because it is easily kept in a lab and can easily be weighed. A decrease in 20E levels would cause the caterpillars to be smaller in weight than if the hormones were not inhibited. The chemical azadirachtin that is found in Azamax blocks 20E in Manduca sexta. We hypothesize that if we treat Manduca sexta with Azamax, the treated caterpillars will be smaller in weight than the controll caterpillars that are fed a normal diet. We believe that the blocking of 20E will inhibit the caterpillars’ growth. 

Materials and Method:
In order to perform this experiment, we placed eight Manduca sexta into two groups of four. We used an index card and tape to section off four plastic bins in which we kept the caterpillars. We fed the controll group an untreated diet of ten grams of food with seven drops of distilled water with a concentration of 0.041 Ml per drop in every ten grams of food. We fed the treatment group ten grams of food with seven drops of Azamax with a concentration of 0.041 Ml per drop in every ten grams of food, making each caterpillars’ food 4.17% Azamax. Each caterpillar was weighed to obtain an initial weight and subsequently weighed every day for a week and documented. Throughout the week, the caterpillars were kept in an incubator in the lab. At the end of the week, the day eight weight of each caterpillar was obtained and the change in weight from day one to day eight of each caterpillar was calculated from a two sample t_test. 



Results:
The starting weight of the Manduca sexta before they were given either treated or controll food was between 1.00 and 1.28 grams. On the last day of weight measurements (day eight), the weight of the treated Manduca sexta was between 1.48 and 3.67 grams, while the weight of the untreated Manduca sexta was between 8.28 and 10.06 grams. The mean change in weight of the treated caterpillars was 1.155 +/- 0.9219 grams, while the mean change in weight of the untreated caterpillars was 8.33 +/- 0.7115 grams. The mean change in weight of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat: 12.32, d.f.= 6, p=.0000174). These values were obtained through a two sample t_test.

Discussion:
Based on our results, the hypothesis that the Azamax treated caterpillars would be smaller in weight than the controll caterpillars was supported. This means that the Azamax did indeed inhibit the growth hormone 20E and therefore inhibited the treated caterpillars’ growth. The inhibited caterpillars were not able to mature and therefore weighed less than the controll caterpillars. This difference was statistically significent (p= >0.01). This is consistent with our hypothesis and Nijhout’s study that explored the necessity of 20E to pupation because 20E was inhibited. The blocking of 20E by using Azamax subsequently made the treated caterpillars gain very little weight because they were not able to mature in the absence of 20E. The treated caterpillars only contained juvenile hormone but were not able to mature and pupate. This is consistent with the findings of Nijhout, who determined that both 20E and JH were necessary for caterpillar development; one could not be present in excess and make up for the lack of the other. The ability to inhibit maturation in Manduca sexta is important because they are pests. With the ability to controll caterpillar pupation, the effect pests have on crops can be reduced. Moving forward, studies could be performed that examine the effects of inhibiting JH to see if the absence of JH and normal amounts of 20E produce a different affect than inhibiting 20E does. Knowledge of how certain chemicals affect insect growth and development is important because it not only controlls pests, but it gives us a greater knowledge of how insect development and hormones work.

Azamax-treated group was fed a diet of 10 grams of food with 7 drops of Azamax in every 10 grams (0.041 Ml/drop). Four caterpillars were in each group and each caterpillar was weighed daily for 8 days.  Each bar is mean change of weight in each caterpillar group from day 1 to day 8; error bars are +/- 0.7114 grams.
