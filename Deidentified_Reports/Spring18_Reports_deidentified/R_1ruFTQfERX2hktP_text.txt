Title: Similar aggression shown in different sizes of Male Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Our initial goal in this experiment was to determine if there was a significant difference in aggression between small and large Betta Splendens. Considering that most bigger animals tend to be more aggressive, we hypothesized that the fish bigger in size would show more signs of aggressive behavior over the smaller Bettas. We set up an experiment using one small and one large fish for each treatment. We allowed both sizes of fish to visually interact with each other without physically touching. In the end, we found that our results did not support our hypothesis. Our treatments seemed to not have a direct effect on the frequency of tail-beating for both sizes of fish, but however, since I our p-value was less than 0.05 for the duration of time in which the Bettas displayed a “red-mane,” shows that in this case our treatment was a direct cause of this aggressive behavior and that it was not due to chance. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish are common fishes that originated in southeast Asia. They are a style of fish that show intraspecific behaviors in the presence of their own species. According to an article found in Behaviour, aggressive behaviors in Betta Splendens are more extreme in the presence of stimuli such as other males, rather that Betta seeing their own reflection in a mirror (Thompson, 1963).   For this lab we tested the different levels of aggression displayed among various sizes of Betta Splendens. We chose this experiment because, these behaviors affect a variety of factors, including the way in which Betta Splendens mate.   Bettas have been known for their aggressive tendencies, normally when they are faced with another male stimuli. In an article found in Psychon, a similar experiment was conducted to the different aggression levels of Bettas. After running multiple trials, they found that the Bettas spent more time showing aggressive displays with their own reflections than they did with other live male stimulus fish (Ronald Baenninger 1966).   In our experiment, we hypothesize that the bigger fish will show more extreme signs of aggression, both with and without live stimulus, than the fish smaller in size.

Materials and Methods:
We will first start by place three different sized Beta Splendens in a tank with three compartments. Only two fish will be able to see each other at a time. We will be using multiple treatments to test different situations when Bettas may show aggression. We will put one large male Betta in one compartment, and another smaller male in another, while being physically separated by a divider. To avoid any discrepancies with our results, we will use different color Bettas, as well as making sure we swap the fish with new fish after each treatment to avoid habituation. Our data will consist of two factors, time (in seconds) and frequency of aggressive traits. We will be collecting a mean, standard deviation, and p-value as normal for both factors. A bar graph will be used to visually interpret our results. In this study we will be using a two-sample one tailed t-test to compare our data. 

Results:
After collecting our tail beating frequencies in Figure 1, it was shown that big fish had a higher average of tail beatings than small fish, as well as a longer duration of time that their opercula opened and closed, displaying a “red mane (Figure 2).” Our independent variable was the size of the fish, and our dependent variables was the duration of their “red-mane,” along with the frequency of tail-beating. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was not a significant difference of aggression between the big and small sized Betta Splendens. Our results showed a p-value of 0.486241 for tail-beating, which is significantly higher than .05. This means that the data collected from both fish beating their tails were not caused by our treatments but was rather due to chance. Our p-value for displaying a “red-mane” was 0.010666, which is a value less than 0.05. This means that our treatment had a direct effect to how long both categories of fish opened and closed their operculum. The “red-mane” did not occur due to chance for both fishes. To compare our study to another, it was noted in Psychon that Betta Splendens tend to spend the most time in front of their mirrored image rather than another physical fish (Ronald Baenninger 1966). This trend was actually quite different during our treatments. Instead of the fish spending more time in front of their mirrored image, they were actually more aggressive when it came to the physical stimuli of other male fish. This was the case with both sizes of fish, and in reference to our results in Figures 1 and 2, size was not a deciding factor. Despite the larger fish having slightly higher activity than smaller Bettas, it was clear that both showed aggressive displays when they could visually see one another. This supports that size may not affect aggressive display at all, since both sized males showed about the same aggressive display.
