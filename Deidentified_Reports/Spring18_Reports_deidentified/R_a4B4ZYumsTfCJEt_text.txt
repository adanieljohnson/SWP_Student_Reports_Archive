Title: The Effect of Soil and Sand Environments on Resource Allocation in Raphanus raphanistrum L.

Abstract:
Plants allocate resources based on the environments they live in to get nutrients that is necessary for survival. In other words, plants can change the size of their roots and shoots (photosynthetic material) in order to get the most out of available resources. They are required to adapt to the environment based on resource availability and can change how they allocate resources. Root to shoot ratios demonstrate how the resources are being obtained and used in plants. We examined how Raphanus raphanistrum L. allocated resources in two controlled environments (sand and soil). After completing the experiment, we found that the plants in the soil medium had a larger mean root to shoot ratio for weight and a smaller root to shoot ratio for length. These results did not support our hypothesis that the sand environment would produce a larger root to shoot ratio in the plants. Overall, the results show that the radish plants allocate more if their resources to roots in soil environments than sand environments. 

Introduction:
Resources like H_2 O, CO_2, sunlight, and nutrients are required for plants to carry out photosynthesis and other processes that are necessary for survival.  Plants grow and use resources differently and tend to have differing patterns of phenotypic variation. Similarly, organisms have to interact and compete in their environments for these resources. They are required to interact and coexist with the abiotic and biotic factors that influence variation. Within the environment, there are limited resources, and organisms have to compete for survival. This resource limitation causes plants to change their resource allocation according to their environment. Normally, plants in nutrient and water rich soil allocate their resources so that the root to shoot is less than plants in nutrient or water poor soil. This experiment observes resource allocation in Raphanus raphanistrum L. (radish plants) by measuring root to shoot ratios from plants in different environments. One environment is fertilized soil and the other is fertilized sand.  The root to shoot ratio can be defined as the weight of dried root biomass divided by the weight of dried shoot biomass (Rogers, 1996). It shows the plants' use of resources in differing environments, and interactions with inorganic nutrients (Kachi, 1993). I predict that the radishes grown in the sand environment will have a higher root to shoot ratio than the radishes in the soil environment because the sand doesn't retain water or nutrients as effectively as soil. 

Materials and Methods:
A soil medium and a sand medium were prepared by adding enough water to soak the medium and adding 50 mL if 3.8g/L miracle grow to six trays. Then, radish seeds were planted and allowed to grow for two weeks (being watered daily). Five plants were carefully harvested from each medium and weighed, keeping the plants in groups according to their controlled environment. The plants were then cut at the root shoot junction. The longest pair of roots and shoots from each group was measured to the nearest centimeter, and the roots and shoots were massed individually in grams. The mean height and weight was calculated, along with the root to shoot ratio for weight and length of both groups. The data was recorded in the two table, one for the sand and the other for soil, and a two-sample t-test was completed with an alpha value of 0.05 for comparing the plant data. 

Results:
Radishes in the soil medium responded to the environment with a mean weight R:S=.331 and SD=.068, while the mean length R:S=1.14 and SD=.505. This was higher than the mean root to shoot mean length ratio, but lower than the mean weight ratio in the other radishes. The plants in the sand environment had a mean length R:S=.370 and SD=.032, and a mean weight R:S=1.33 and SD=.110. Based on the results from both groups together, there was a difference in the resource allocation of the plants. With both environments considered together, the difference is significant for the weight root to shoot ratio (t=.952, df=4, p&lt;.05), and the difference is not significant for the length root shoot ratio (t=.660, df=4, p&gt;.05). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the root to shoot ratio of plants in the sand environment having a larger root to shoot ratio than plants in the soil environment is not supported according the data (Fig 1).  The data shows that the mean root to shoot ratio for length and weight of radish plants in the sand environment are shorter than the mean root to shoot ratio for length and weight of plants in the soil environment. The patterns of plant resource allocation differed in the two environments but did not follow the predicted pattern. A few factors that could have contributed to the results could have been the way the seeds were planted in the environments before the lab, and the way the environments retained nutrients/water. Some of the plants in the sand were not planted properly as seeds, so the results could reflect this problem. More specifically, the seeds were not submerged in the sand, but instead, were resting on the surface. The germination of the seeds in the sand took much longer due to this faulty placement Additionally, the sand environment became much more compact when watered, which can make it harder for the roots to grow through the particles of sand. In a similar experiment, species of pleats on costal dunes move their resources, like biomass and nutrients, to above ground (Brown, 1997). In other words, the dune plants changed their resource allocation to maintain and increase their photosynthetic capacity. This is similar to our plants in the sand and seems to have helped with resource allocation by using more energy to grow the shoot, which carries out photosynthesis.  Another factor from our data that contributed to the results is that the variance in the sand data was much higher than the soil data (Fig. 1) which created a bigger error bar. This lab is one example of how plant resource allocation patterns change to adapt and succeed in different environments.
