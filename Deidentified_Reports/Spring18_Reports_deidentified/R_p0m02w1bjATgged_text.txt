Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contractions 

Abstract:
Calcium channel blockers can lead to paralysis, due to the blockage of calcium channels. The experimental goal was to test the effect to Lanthanum Chloride on a muscle contraction. To test this, three frogs legs were stimulated as the controll group. Then the frog legs were injected with lanthanum Chloride and stimulated. The hypothesis was that the voltage of the treatment group’s muscle contractions will be lower than the controll group’s voltage. Due to human error, the results collected were not significently different, and therefore the lab was inconclusive.  


Introduction:
The region that connects the nerve cells of our body to the muscle cells is called the neuromuscular junction (Engel 2008).  In order for a muscular contraction to occur an action potential needs to be generated within this region of the cell. For this action potential to occur the postsynaptic cell must be depolarized to threshold through AcH binding to their receptors and opening a ligand gated ion channel which causes sodium ions to rush into the postsynaptic cell and depolarize it. AcH can only be released from the cell if the presynaptic cell is partially depolarized. This release of AcH is caused by the influx of calcium into the cell through a calcium pump or Ca2+ATPase. A calcium channel blocker inhibits the use of the calcium pump and stops the the flow of calcium into the presynaptic cell nerve. (Washio 1983). The goal of this experiment is to test the effects of Lanthanum Chloride on the muscle tissue which will be stimulated.  
Biological Hypothesis:
If we inject the frog leg with a calcium channel blocker, the voltage recorded will be less than the controll group. 


Materials and Method:
Each lab group is given three frog legs in a dissecting pan. All frog legs should then be skinned, and the sciatic nerves should be exposed. Then each lab group cuts the achilles tendon of each frog leg to separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the tibia. The gastrocnemus muscle is then tied to the apparatus at a ninety degree angle. The electrodes are then placed into the gastrocnemus muscle under the sciatic nerve. The threshold is then found for each frog leg without using the treatment. Using the found threshold, the voltage is then found using the myogram. Each frog leg is then injected with the calcium channel blocker and then set aside for at least ten minutes. The treated frog legs are then set up as described above, and thresholds found are multiplied by 1.25. A t_test was conducted after gathering the data for each frog leg treated and untreated. `


Results:
The mean voltage of the controll group was 0.208 +/- 0.1312 volts. The mean voltage for the treatment group was 0.191 +/- 0.194 volts, which was not significently different than the controll (p=0.78, t=0.27). The error bars (see Figure 2) also signify that the voltages for the treatment and controll groups are not significently different due to their overlapping. Although the treatment group was one tenth lower than the treatment group, the p value shown (see figure 1) shows that the results are not significently different than one another. Throughout the experiment, the controll legs produced a greater amplitude than the treatment group. 


Discussion:
Based on the statistical analysis of the data collected, the null hypothesis was accepted due to the high p value of 0.78 with 24 degrees of freedom. Because the p_value was higher than 0.05, the results can be interpreted as the effect of the randomness of nature not the result of the calcium channel blocker. These skewed results are most likely the result of the frog legs sitting out for different amounts of time after the calcium channel blocker was injected. Although all of the frogs legs were left out for at least ten minutes, but some were left out for longer which might have caused the randomness of the results. There was also different amount of frog Ringer’s solution being used for each frog leg. In the instructions given for this lab did not indicate how much frog Ringer’s solution to use, so different amounts were used for different legs. Frog Ringer solution contains the necessary electrolytes for a muscle contraction to happen. [Ardrain 1956]. Without these flukes of human error and miscommunication in the lab instructions, these lab results could have ended in the inhibition of calcium channels and the lack of a muscle contraction[Snyderman 1976]. Although the aforementioned lab did not match with the results of previous studies, the effects of lanthanum chloride should still be studied due to its importance in the medical field.
