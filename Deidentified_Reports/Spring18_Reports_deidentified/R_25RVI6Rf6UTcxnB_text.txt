Title: Effects of Azamax on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a common pest that consumes tobacco plants in its larval stage. In this experiment we tested the effects of adding Azamax, a premade solution of organic insecticide, to the standard Manduca Sexta diet which inhibits ecdysone levels in the insect in order to observe if it stunted the growth and caused health to deteriorate in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar by using 8 caterpillars. The hormone ecdysone is secreted from the prothoracic gland and controls the time of the molt, meaning that if it was blocked the caterpillars should lose weight due to a decline in their health. Each caterpillar in the control group was fed 10 g of food mixed with 8 drops of distilled water while each caterpillar in the experimental group was fed 10g of food mixed with 8 drops of Azamax. Over a course of 8 days the caterpillars were fed the same amount and ratio of food and weighed. We then analyzed the difference in the weights of the two groups by performing a Two-sample t-test and found that there was a statistically significant difference between the control group and the experimental group.


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera that undergoes holometabolous development that undergoes holometabolous development. It is commonly known as the tobacco hornworm and is considered and feeds on tobacco plants during its larval stage. Due to the nature of the caterpillar’s eating habits, many agriculturists and gardeners desire to eliminate the populations that feed on their crop by using an insecticide.  The development of the Manduca Sexta is mainly controlled by three hormones: Prothoracicotropic Hormone, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. The Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone work together to control growth; ecdysterone regulates the time of the molt. It can also be noted that “the acquisition of steroidogenic competence by prothoracic glands of last instar Manduca sexta larvae is regulated by juvenile hormone (JH), meaning the time of molt [Watson & Bollenbacher : 1998]. If we were to observe the effects of the juvenile hormone we could use Precore which is a derivative of methoprene that is a “insect growth regulator” [Dhiadialla, 1985]. However, in this experiment, we will observe the effects of blocking the ecdysterone levels in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar by adding Azamax to the standard Manduca Sexta diet. Azamax is a natural insecticide that is extracted from neem seed kernels that works by blocking the necessary hormones for survival. Our hypothesis is that by incorporating Azamax into the Manduca Sext diet, the caterpillars will be stunted in growth and begin to deteriorate in health by losing weight. 



Materials and Methods:
Obtain 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars and divide them into two groups of four, assign each caterpillar a number and identify one group as the control group and the other as the experimental group. Weigh each caterpillar in order to obtain an initial weight. Next, measure approximately 10g of the standard Manduca Sexta food for each of the eight caterpillars. For the control group, add 8 drops of distilled water to each 10g of food using a disposable pipette and mix in a container. For the experimental group, add 8 drops of Azamax per 10g of food and mix. Then place two caterpillars from the same group into a container, using a secured index card to separate them. Place the designated food for each caterpillar in the container and place in the incubator. Feed and weigh the caterpillars by repeating the necessary steps above each day for 7 additional days and observe.
Materials needed include the following: 8 Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, a scale, Standard Manduca Sexta food, spoons, disposable pipettes, mixing containers, Azamax, distilled water, housing containers, index cards, and an incubator. 
Use a Two-Sample t-test to compare the mean of the control group to the mean of the experimental group.



Results:
We conducted a Two-sample t-test in order to compare the means of the control group and the experimental group. While the initial weights of the Manduca Sexta were relatively similar, however there was an apparent difference in the weight changes (Table 1). The mean weight gain of the treatment group was - 0.300 g while the control group was 5.425 g, which indicates that the caterpillars treated with Azamax lost a significant amount of weight over the course of the experiment (Figure 2). We calculated the p-value to be 0.00272 which indicates that there is statistically significant difference between the experimental and the control group, rejecting the null hypothesis. 


Discussion:
The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effectiveness of Azamax on Manduca Sexta caterpillar by comparing the weights of the treatment and control groups to analyze the overall growth and development. After we conducted a two sample t-test,  we determined that there was statistically significant evidence that supported our hypothesis. The experimental group had a lower mean weight than the control group after the 8 day period. The null hypothesis was rejected with a p-value of 0.00272. This conveys that the ecdysone blocking hormone had an effect on the Manduca Sexta caterpillars and gives insight to the importance of hormones in insects which have the ability to "delay[s] development by increasing the time to pupal commitment and wandering" [Watson & Bollenbacher: 1998]. This information is vital because even minimal changes have the ability to affect the development and life of Manduca Sexta caterpillars.
