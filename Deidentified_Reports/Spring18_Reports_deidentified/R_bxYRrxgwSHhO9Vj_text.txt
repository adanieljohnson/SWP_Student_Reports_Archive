Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The main objective of this study will be to determine if increases in Juvenile Hormone ( JH) in Manduca sexta will result in larger larva instead of full adulthood. JH Hormone is the hormone responsible for determining which molt a Manduca sexta molts into, and therefore, if manipulated it could trigger yet another molt stage of a larger larva. Before pupation Juvenile Hormone level in Manduca sexta heavily decrease, so could an excess amount of Juvenile Hormone keep Manduca sexta in a continual larval stage? By feeding Manduca sexta food with an increased level of Juvenile Hormone, and by tracking their growth, we determined that, in comparison to the Control Group, the Manduca sexta did not pupate or grow faster than that of their Control counterparts. On average the controll group gained 9.28 grams by the end of the week while the Precore group gained 5.6 grams. 


Introduction:
In this study, we will be examining the insect the Manduca sexta. It is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera; the same order that most moths, butterflies, and skippers belong too [Johnson, 2018] The Manduca sexta spends most of its life as a caterpillar in a larva like stage. After its fifth instar stage, the Manduca sexta enters what is known as the pupal stage, to which it matures into an adult [Nijhout,1974]. The life cycle of a Manduca sexta is regulated by hormones: Ecdysterone and Juvenile hormone. Ecdysterone is responsible for regulating the timing of when the Manduca sexta molts, while Juvenile Hormone (JH) is responsible for regulating which specific molt the Manduca sexta molts [Johnson, 2018]. Right before pupation, JH levels decrease heavily while Ecdysterone increases [Nijhout,1974] In this experiment, we will be examining two different groups of Manduca sexta larva and the effects an increase in Juvenile Hormone has on overall growth. Our dependent variable for the experiment will be the growth, or change in weight, of the Manduca sexta, while our independent variable will be the methoprene and Juvenile hormone found in Precore solution.  If Manduca sexta are continually exposed to high levels of Juvenille Hormones, which can be traced through the Juvenile hormone analogue methorprene found in regular Manduca sexta diet, they will continue to molt into different instar stages of Manduca sexta: meaning they will increase in weight and size, and never fully reach adulthood as moths, but instead larger larva. 


Materials and Method:
First, we selected 4, 11-12 day-old Manduca sexta caterpillars of all the same relative size. We picked smaller larva to begin the experiment since we hoped they would grow as time passed in the experiment. We then created 4 rearing containers with one divider down the middle. This left us with 8 separate halves in which our Manduca sexta lived. Proceeding with the experiment, we mixed and created 10 grams of food for each of the 8 Manduca sexta. We fed our controll group on Manduca sexta 10 grams of regular Floss Manduca sexta diet food mixed with .6 Ml of water. We then prepared our JH treatment Manduca sexta food with 10 grams of Manduca sexta diet food mixed with .6Ml drops of Precore methoprene and JH based solution. The Precore solution was 2 parts water Precore and 48 parts water giving it a concertation 4%. Placing all of the Manduca sexta caterpillars into their designated incubating containers, we then labeled each container either Control or Precore. Lastly, we Incubated all Manduca sexta at a consistent temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, in a 12 hour dark: 12 hour light cycle. Over the course of the following week, my group made sure to replace food once it began to dry and as necessary. Every day for the next week one of my partners then weighed and recorded each caterpillar. We then ran a two-sample t test to interpret our resulting and recorded weights of each caterpillar. 


Results:
The Control group grew on average and as a group grew more than that of the Precor JH treatment group: the controll group growing an average of 9.28 grams (sd +/-1.45), and the Precore JH treatment group growing an average of 5.6 grams (sd+/-  2.91). The Control group was much more active towards the beginning of the week. They seemed to move around more while in their rearing containers, and were much more responsive. They ate the most food and were extremely large by the last day. On day 6, this all changed. By the end of the week, the Control Group was characterized by little movement around their incubating tubes and little to no response when they were picked up and weighed. Although they were not dead, they clearly were not healthy. The Precore treatment group was characterized by decreased movement in the beginning of the week, with more movement than the Control group on day 7. We made sure both group’s food was replenished throughout the week. The mean weight of the group after examining both the controll and Precore JH treatment group was not significently greater than its mean before consuming the Precore methoprene JH analogue food (t_stat = 2.23172, d.f. = 6, P = 0.067107).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our experiment because, as outlined in the data, the controll group grew more than the Precore JH hormone group like we initially hypothesized. The experiment was not successful because none of the Manduca sexta reached another, larger larva instar stage. The results from a two-sample t_test revealed that there was not a significent difference in their change in weight: a difference of 9.28 grams for the Control and 5.6 grams for the Precore group.  However, we can detail that the controll group did grow faster and therefore would have reached pupation before that of the Precore JH treatment group. According to other studies, an influx of JH should not be responsible for excess growth [Browder, 2001] According to M.H Browder, a scientist studying the effects of JH on Manduca Sexta, in order for Manduca Sexta to enter their next instar stage, they must have decreased levels of JH. Without these decreased levels, there will be no significent growth. In his own experiment, he found little growth in Manduca Sexta as well [Browder, 2001] The purpose of this study was to see if increased levels in JH would correspond with faster and more rapid growth of Manduca Sexta to eventual pupation, however our results revealed we were incorrect in our hypothesis. In reality, the controll group grew on average faster and more than that of the JH Manduca Sexta we tested.  The next logical step in this experiment would be to redo it, but for a longer period of days, and maybe with a different Precore concentration to see if that resulted in an increase in growth to a eventual instar larva for the JH treatment Manduca Sexta.
