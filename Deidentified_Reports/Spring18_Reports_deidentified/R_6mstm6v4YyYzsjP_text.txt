Title: A Synthetic Juvenile Hormone, Precor, does not Have an Effect on The Prevention of Weight Increase in Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Animals use hormones for growth, regulation, and reproduction. The tobacco hornworm, formally called the Manduca sexta, utilizes two hormones to complete its life cycle through molting and metamorphosis: juvenile hormone and ecdysone. Juvenile Hormone (JH) functions to keep the insect from becoming bigger and morphing into an adult. When JH levels are close to zero, the insect begins a transition into the next stage of life. This experiment tested with an increase level of JH in the food of caterpillars to see if it would restrict their growth in regards to mass after seven days. The hypothesis predicted that the caterpillars given an increase in JH would have a smaller mass after seven days than a group that was not given an increase in JH. There were eight total caterpillars, four treated with JH induced food (treatment group) and four given standard dietary food (controll group). The results show that the hypothesis was rejected and that additional JH had no effect on the subject group due to inconsistent data.

Introduction:
All animals rely on hormones for growth and development regulation. Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone are two specific hormones inside a Manduca sexta, commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm.  The commitment pulse, which begins the wandering cycle for the insect, occurs when the level of juvenile hormone is near zero and there is a small amount of ecdysone in the bloodstream [Riddiford: 2003]. These two hormones work to controll the timing of molting and pupation in the life cycle of these caterpillars as well as in different stages of metamorphosis in insects.
	In this experiment, a synthetic of juvenile hormone, called precor (independent variable), was used to test how JH effects the mass (dependent variable) of M. sexta caterpillars over a period of seven days. A treatment group was fed with food that had been mixed with precor while the controll group was fed with a mixture of food and distilled water. The controll group was an important measure of standard caterpillar growth with normal levels of JH that could later be compared and analyzed with the treatment group (after the experiment had been completed). M. sexta are an agricultural pest, most significently of the tobacco plant, so it can be useful to experiment with ways to limit their damage to agriculture. Furthermore, they are a good species to experiment on because they absorb hormones fast and have short, easily distinguishable changes in their life cycle [Johnson: 2018]. Because we know that an increase in JH will restrict an insect from growth and larva metamorphosis, we can hypothesize that the caterpillars treated with precor will have a smaller mass after seven days than the caterpillars that were not treated with precor.


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, eight total caterpillars were tested. Four of them were used for a controll group (C1, C2, C3, C4), and four were used for a treatment group (T1, T2, T3, T4). The independent variable was the synthetic hormone that was given to the treatment group, which was 1:250 precor solution. The dependent variable was the mass of each caterpillar that changed throughout the experiment.
Eight caterpillars were selected, weighed with a scale, and divided into four plastic containers. There were two caterpillars in each container that were separated by an index card and labeled accordingly. It was important to make sure that each container had two of the same group, either treatment or controll. Once the caterpillars were divided, each of them were given an equal amount of dietary food. The four treatment group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of food that was mixed with 10 drops of precor, and the four controll group caterpillars were each given 10 grams of food that was mixed with 10 drops of distilled water. Once the food and the caterpillar were placed in each section of the containers, the lids were applied and the containers were placed in an incubator that was at 25*C. With the exception of the food they were given, all other variables were kept constant. Each day, the food for all eight caterpillars was cleared and replaced, and each caterpillar was re-weighed with the appropriate mass being noted in the lab notebook. Observations and notes regarding the caterpillarsâ€™ appearance was also noted. After the seven day experiment, a two-sample t_test was done to compare the controll and treatment groups in order to analyze if the data was statistically significent.


Results:
The four caterpillars in the controll group (C1, C2, C3, C4) showed very consistent growth throughout the seven day period. By the seventh day, all four of them were within 1.21 grams in weight (Fig 1- Weight Growth). The four treatment caterpillars (T1, T2, T3, T4) were far less consistent. T1 had a final weight was nearly half of the average of the four controll caterpillars (Fig 1- Weight Growth). T4 shows a similar trend of T1, with a steady growth and a relatively low final weight. T2 and T3 present data that are outliers when determining the effect of JH and the significance of the data. T2, which was noted to be a paler green color throughout the experiment, resulted in a loss of weight after seven days. T3 shows a steady increase that is similar to the controll caterpillars. The results show that the average daily increase in mass was consistently higher for the controll group than it was for the treatment group (Fig 2- Average Daily Difference). Day 3 of the experiment shows a distinct separation of the weights between the controll and treatment groups (Fig 2- Average Daily Difference). The two-sample t_test that was performed showed that the mean of the controll group was not statistically different than that of the treatment group (t_stat=2.316, d.f.=6, P= 0.073). 

Discussion:
Based on statistical analysis, our hypothesis was rejected due to the p_value of 0.073, which reflects a lack of consistent data with the treatment group. In an attempt to prolong the larva stage of life by keeping the mass low as described in the introduction, the JH did not have the predicted effect on the caterpillars. Synthetic juvenile hormone (precor) was applied to a group of Manduca sexta and it was hypothesized that this would restrict the caterpillar from having a mass that was as heavy as a group not given the synthetic JH. Juvenile hormone is usually present in a larva to allow growth and development until the insect is large enough for metamorphosis [Riddiford: 2003]. An experiment by Truman and Riddiford concluded that if juvenile hormone was applied before the wandering period (commitment pulse), the caterpillars would not grow or pupate. Once the caterpillar entered the wandering period, the insect would become unresponsive to the application of the hormone [Truman & Riddiford: 1974]. Our hypothesis was supported for two of the four treatment caterpillars, T1 and T4. Both were treated with precor and had noticeably smaller masses when compared to the controll caterpillars. This suggests that the synthetic JH provided a means of interference in the life cycle of the M. sexta, restricting the ability for the individuals to grow to their potential as was hypothesized. While T1 and T4 support the hypothesis, T2 and T3 provide evidence that the data was not statistically significent. T3, although treated with precor, showed no signs of a restriction in growth. It grew to match the weights of the controll group caterpillars, which significently rejects our hypothesis. Perhaps T3 had already experienced the wandering period described in the experiment by Truman and Riddiford, therefore the additional treatment of JH did not affect its growth or life cycle. T2 resulted in a loss of weight, providing evidence that it was sickly and was not able to mature at all. The data for the controll group shows that a standard diet without an alteration of JH results in a trend of healthy, steady growth of the insect. There is no clear and reliable trend in regards to the treatment group, so it cannot be said that this experiment supported our hypothesis. Perhaps with a larger population size, outliers such as T2 and T3 can be ignored if the general trend for the rest of the group shows statistical significance. In a future trial, it would be crucial to be sure that each of the eight caterpillars are equal in weight and stage of life so that timing is not a factor in their growth and maturation. An alternate approach to applying JH could be to apply the hormone directly to the skin of the caterpillar via a brush; by doing this, the results are not dependent on the amount of food consumed by each caterpillar.
