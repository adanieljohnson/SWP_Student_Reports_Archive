Title: Precor and its Impact on the Growth (weight) of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Abstract

The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of synthetic juvenile hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca sexta development.  The experiment tested whether Precor, which contains methoprene, impacted a difference in the weights of caterpillars.  This was done so by testing a controll group of Manduca sexta which ate a diet without Precor and comparing to a treatment group of Manduca sexta which ate a diet with Precor.  I hypothesized that if a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene, then JH levels won't drop, and therefore weight will be affected (will drop).  The results concluded that even though there were differences in average weights between the controll and treatment groups the difference was not statistically significent and therefore no conclusion of a difference can be made.


Introduction:
Introduction

Hormones are essential for how the regulate insect physiology.  One big family of insect hormones are the Juvenile hormones (JH) which are a long chain of organic molecules produced mainly by the corpus allata (a pair of glands located on either side of the foregut) [Johnson:2016].

This experiment tested the effects of synthetic juvenile hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca sexta development.  The Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers, and as the Manduca sexta goes from egg to adult in its holometabolous life cycle it is greatly affected by hormones [Johnson:2016], [Grunert:2015].  The Manduca sexta is a prime choice for this experiment because hormones (particularly JH) strongly influence the Manduca sexta which has a development process that depends so much on hormones.

During development, the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt [Johnson:2016].  Also pupae and adult insects don't grow, so body size as an adult depends by the size at which larva starts the metamorphic molt to the pupa which depends on hormones [Grunert:2015]. The experiment was a small feeding experiment in which the Manduca sexta caterpillars were examined.

The experiment looks at how consuming a chemical called Precor, the independent variable which is mixed with food, impacts growth and behavior by looking at eight Manduca sexta caterpillars.  Precor contains methoprene, an IGR which mimics JH functions [Johnson:2016].  Studying the impact of Precor on the caterpillars' differences in weights (dependent variable) can lead to a better understanding of hormone on Manduca sexta caterpillars as a whole.  I hypothesize that if a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene, then JH levels won't drop, and therefore weight will be affected (will drop) and the caterpillar won't be able to reach the commitment pulse to mature into an adult.

Materials and Method

First 8, 11-12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars, tobacco worms found in the surrounding area, weighing 0.9 to 1.5 grams were divided into two groups and each group of caterpillars were given 1 of 2 diets.  The controll group was given the Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) recommended diet with 10 drops of water added, and the other (treatment) group was given the same recommended diet with 10 drops of the Precor (methoprene) chemical (concentration of 2 parts of chemical per 48 parts of water) added [Johnson:2016].  Each caterpillar is given 10g of the recommended diet.  All caterpillars are then kept in the same incubators under the same condition and the weights are recorded every day for 7 days.  The differences in weights between the treatment and controll groups were examined to test the hypothesis.  A two-sample t_test was then used to compare the two groups and test for statistical significance.


Results:
General trends are seen in Figure 1 that the average weights of the controll group Manduca sexta caterpillars are higher than the average weights of the treatment group Manduca sexta caterpillars. The average weight of the treatment group was 1.79g compared to the controll group average weight of 2.04g.  Despite this difference, however, the two groups are not statistically different from one another as the two-sample t_test had a p_value of 0.289.

Discussion

My hypothesis seemed to be supported by my results at first glance with the average weight of the treatment group at 1.79g compared to the controll group average weight of 2.04g,  however my hypothesis was not statistically supported as the two-sample t_test came out with a p_value of 0.289 which is nowhere near the significance level of 0.05.  Therefore a statistical difference in the populations between caterpillars effected by Precur vs caterpillars not effected cannot be proven in this study.  Though not statistically supported the differences in weight shows that when a Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to methoprene weight and development are affected possibly creating difficulty (JH levels not dropping) in reaching the commitment pulse and in development.

Another study showed that when increasing the hormone levels in food the average weights of the hormone altered groups were significently lower than the non-altered groups [Grunert:2015].  

A possible error could have occurred in the experiment in how they were only fed the original amount of food (10g) over the 7 days and were not given any more when the food ran out.  If the experiment was run again I would choose to add food every day when weighing the caterpillars to test if that change would produce an even further disparity in weight which would be statistically significent.  Then if that produced results the next logical step would be to repeat the experiment to increase the number of replicates with the existing method.

Overall, the experiment provides an excellent way into how the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt and affects development in insects [Johnson:2016].  The experiment allows a way to look into an emerging approach to insect pest controll which uses substances that affect insect growth and development [Tunaz:2004].  The IGRs "insect growth regulators", which were created based on an understanding of biochemistry and physiology of development in insects, impair insect survival and are being used in many ways [Tunaz:2004].  The experiment allows a simple way to look into the effects of IGRs on development and insect development as a whole.

Figure 1: Effect of the treatment (Precur vs controll) on the average weight of Manduca sexta caterpillars.  The controll group (blue bar) is the group of caterpillars eating the GLM recommended diet with just water added.  The treatment group (orange bar) is the group of caterpillars eating the GLM recommended diet with Precur chemical added.  4 caterpillars were put in each group and studied (weights recorded) for 7 days and the average weights of each one over time was recorded.  Each bar is the mean of the average lengths from either the treatment or controll groups; error bars are  0.657 for the controll bar and  0.550 for the treatment bar.
