Title: Effects of AZA Max, an ecdysterone blocker, on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Forgot to include abstract.

Introduction:
All animals and plants secrete hormones for a multitude of reasons. Oftentimes these reasons correlate to the organismâ€™s growth and development. Through this experiment, we took a look at the important developmental hormone in Manduca sexta, ecdysterone.
	The Manduca sexta is in the order Lepidoptera which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers [6]. They all go through some type of dramatic change; metamorphosis. From egg to adulthood (which includes the metamorphosis stage) the caterpillar fluctuates greatly with two hormones, ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). 20E regulates the timing of molting, along with other functions [11]. More specifically, when injected with endysterone, it stimulated molting [1]. Therefore, if injected with ecdysterone bloackers, it should do the opposite and inhibit or postpone molting. This concept intrigued the lab group in what would happen if caterpillars were given different doses of 20E.
	We want to dissect the outcomes of greater amounts of 20E in the caterpillars than the natural amounts presented by the control group. Could this decrease in hormone dosage, in fact, be beneficial for the species? We believe not, as the timing of the molt is likely to be affected. Our hypothesis states: the decrease amount of 20E will cause the caterpillars to not mature at a fast-enough rate and will struggle to survive. The null hypothesis is that 20E will have no affect on the caterpillar development.


Materials and Methods:
To begin, we selected eight caterpillars that had around the same mass, in our case around 1.2 g. We then randomly split them into two groups of four, one control and the other experimental. We then took plastic see-through containers and split them into two halves with an index card, making sure the li can be secured on. This lid must have holes in which the caterpillars can breathe.
	In order to distribute correct amounts of hormone to the caterpillars, the 20E is mixed with the caterpillar food. No matter whether control or experimental, each caterpillar received 10g of food. For the control, we mixed 7 drops of water per 20g of food measured out. For the experimental, we mixed 7 drops of AZA Max, which is an ecdysterone inhibiter, into every 20g of caterpillar food. 
	Every day we took the mass of the caterpillars and changed their food. We cleaned the containers of waste and extra food. We repeated this for a week and recorded the masses each day.


Results:
Our results support our hypothesis that the caterpillars would not develop quick-enough. The average difference in growth for the control is 8.0675g over the week, and the experimental difference was merely 3.4925g. The control group grew on average over twice the amount. It is also important to note that the control group had the largest growth difference with 11.19g. The data is statistically significant, with a p-value of .002. Our standard deviations were 1.512 for the control and .460 for the experimental.

Discussion:
First, it is important to point out that the data is, in fact, statistically significant. Because of this, we have more confidence that the data has correlation. The data implies that a sufficient amount of 20E is necessary for proper growth and development. The data supported our alternative hypothesis because the experimental caterpillars did not grow as large as the control. This leads us to wonder how what amount of 20E is optimal for Manduca sexta growth. From this experiment, we can simply conclude that a deficiency in 20E is detrimental to the species. An area of potential error could be the person, him or herself, doing the experimentation. This was not constant throughout the week, as we had different people from the lab group feed and mass the caterpillars. In theory it should all conclude the same, however each person could have different methods of doing this which could cause inaccuracies.
