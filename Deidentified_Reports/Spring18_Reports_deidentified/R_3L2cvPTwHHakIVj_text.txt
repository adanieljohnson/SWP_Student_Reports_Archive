Title: A comparison of the photosynthetic activity in spinach (sun-favoring) and fern (shade-favoring) leaves

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a necessary process for plant survival and involves the capture of sunlight in order to use energy. The chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of leaves absorb light to make O2 which is released and glucose that is used or stored for energy. Photosynthesis begins with light dependent reactions in PSII, therefore photons of light must be present. The absorption of light then causes the excitation and transfer of electrons with the electron transport chain, creating a proton gradient, and then ATP synthesis. In this experiment, spinach and fern leaves were compared using Hill reaction assays during which the amount of photosynthetic activity was determined. DCPIP was used to examine the percent change in light absorption and measure rate of photosynthesis. The results showed that the spinach had a higher percent change in light absorption and thus more photosynthetic activity. The experiment proved to have significent results that supported the hypothesis, because plants that prefer to grow in light are more efficient in absorbing light in PSII and have higher photosynthetic potentials. The experiment proves that light is a key factor that affects photosynthesis, especially the activity of PSII, & that the internal structure of leaves also affects photosynthetic activity

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to compare photosynthetic activity of spinach and fern leaves, and to determine if the rates of photosynthesis are decreased in plants that prefer the shade rather than sunlight. The spinach plant thrives in abundant sunlight, while the fern can prosper in shaded areas. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture and use energy from sunlight, using CO2 and H2O to produce glucose, H2O and O2.  Energy obtained during photosynthesis is then released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration in mitochondria for important metabolic processes. In both photosynthesis and respiration, there are redox reactions in which electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain to other complexes. The complexes pump protons across the bilayer to create a gradient with the energy from the electron transfer, and the gradient causes the synthesis of ATP. Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis because they absorb solar radiation in their chlorophyll molecules to begin the process. Light dependent reactions start in Photosystem II, and occur when light photons are present, and they generate most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. DCPIP is an important reagent during the assays because it acts as an electron acceptor and changes color in order to show if the conditions affect reduction reactions in photosynthesis, going from blue to colorless if it is reduced to display photosynthetic activity (Johnson: 2016). The organisms used in the experiment are spinach, because it has a high yield of chloroplast in general and because its photosynthetic activity prospers in ample sunlight, and fern leaves, as its photosynthetic activity thrives in shade in contrast. Thus, we hypothesized that the spinach leaves that grow well in the sunlight will have a higher photosynthetic rate than the fern leaves that grow well in the shade. We expected this to be the case because even though the shade favoring plant prospers in the shade, the light favorable plant would acquire more energy and be able to begin photosynthesis with PSII more easily. The fern leaves would be better at absorbing light at lower levels, however they predicted the spinach would have more energy in general from the absorption of strong light and would have a high rate of photosynthesis (Spilatro: 1998).  Further research on the topic of comparing sun plants and shade plants determined that an increased internal leaf area in sun plants causes a generally higher photosynthetic rate, because it lowers their liquid phase resistance to CO2 diffusion, and they tend to have smaller, thicker leaves that have more developed mesophyll regions (Novel: 1976). 


Materials and Method:
The two organisms used in this experiment were spinach, Spinacia oleracea and a species of fern, a member of the monilophytes group. The spinach was provided by the laboratory and the fern plant was obtained by extracting five branches of leaves from a shaded fern plant. We first packed a mortar and pestle, beaker (150-250Ml size) and 3 50Ml centrifuge tube in ice to cool. Once cooled, the central veins were removed from four of the spinach leaves and the leaves were grinded into a paste with the mortar and pestle, with the addition of a total of 20Ml cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The leaf slurry was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. During this time, the fern leaves were also cut into smaller fragments and then grinded with a total of 20Ml cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) with another mortar and pestle, and the leaf slurry was strained though three layers of cheesecloth into an additional chilled beaker. Once these steps were completed for each, 200 μl of the filtered liquid of spinach and fern leaves were transferred into separate microtubules (Sample A’s) and chilled in the ice bath. The remainder of both liquids were then separately placed in centrifuge tubes labeled “A” and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4oC. Then both of the supernatants of the Sample A centrifuged liquid were transferred into separate “Sample B” chilled centrifuge tubes and centrifuged again at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was then removed from each Sample B and the pellet was suspended by adding 20Ml of grinding buffer solution and mixed. 200 μl of the resuspended pellet for both the spinach and fern samples were transferred to microtubes and stored on ice. Next, each sample of B-pellet were examined for chloroplast density on hemocytometer under a microscope in order to compare the differing amounts of chloroplasts. Since the B-pellet sample of the fern sample was found to be much more dilute in comparison to that of the spinach, the spinach sample was diluted by adding 100 μl spinach sample and diluted with 700 μl of water during the assay. In contrast, 800 μl of the fern sample was added during the assay, without dilution. In order to complete the assay Hill reaction next, 13 test tubes were labeled and filled with reaction mixtures. The reaction mixtures consisted of one blank tube with 8Ml water and 2Ml reaction buffer, three tubes without chloroplasts with 6Ml water, 2Ml 130 mM DCPIP, and 2 Ml of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), three tubes with spinach chloroplasts (diluted) and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer, and then three tubes with fern chloroplasts and the same amounts of DCPIP and reaction buffer. The tubes were mixed after the addition of chloroplasts and then transferred into 10 different spectrophotometer cuvettes that were then measured for absorbance at 600nm. The samples were then placed under light for 10 minutes and measured for absorbance again, and this step was repeated 3 times for a total of 30 minutes sitting under light. A statistical two sample t_test was then used in order to examine the results.


Results:
The trend displayed by the data shows that the percent changes in absorbance between 0 and 30 minutes of time had passed were highest with the spinach leaf samples, at an average of 57.1%, followed by the fern leaves at an average of 11.6%, and then the samples with no chloroplasts had an average of 0.298%, as they were expected to have little to no change at all (% change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%). The spinach leaves also had the highest standard deviation value, at about 12.5, while the standard deviation for the fern leaves was much lower at 1.35. The two-sample t_test determined that the degrees of freedom were 4, the t-value was 6.234155 and the p_value was 0.003373.


Discussion:
The results displayed by this experiment support the hypothesis that the spinach, the sun-favoring organism, would display a higher rate of photosynthesis than the fern, which favors shade. This was found to be the case because the data, as displayed in Figure 1, shows an impressive percent change for the spinach, at 57% compared to the 12.5% change for the fern over 30 minutes. The statistical two sample t_test also proved that the data was in fact significent because the p_value was 0.003373 which is less than 0.05. In a similar study that compared the photosynthetic rates of sun versus shade leaves of Hyptis emoryi, the results showed that shade leaves are able to absorb light like sun plants because their leaves generally have larger surface area which helps to intercept photons of light and capture the light energy even when light isn’t especially abundant. However, the results also showed that sun plants have generally thicker leaves with smaller surface area, but a thicker mesophyll region that lowers the liquid phase resistance of CO2 when there is abundant sun, and thus leads to higher photosynthetic rates, which supports our data as well (Novel: 1976). Other research on leaf form and photosynthesis also supports the data found in our experiment that the sun-favoring plant would have a higher rate of photosynthesis, as their data showed that leaves that have the most photosynthetic potential are those in abundant light situations, like spinach, that have the features of light-favoring leaves including horizontal, thick leaves and more equal number of stomata. In comparison, leaves that prefer less light, like the fern, that have thin leaves, no palisade cells and stomata only on one side have lower potentials for photosynthesis (Smith: 1997). This is in line with our data as the fern leaves had much lower amounts of photosynthetic activity during the 30 minutes, even though we took measures to make the chloroplast amounts even, likely because the fern has a lower potential for photosynthesis in light. The experiment ultimately was successful, however some sources of error that might have affected the experiment could have been the differing amounts of chloroplasts the two organisms had to begin with. Though we diluted the spinach sample in order to even out the number of chloroplasts, the ratio was likely still imperfect as the spinach plant had around 10x more chloroplasts than the fern plant originally. The age of the plants and chloroplasts could also have affected the experiment in a negative fashion, as well as human errors, like causing an accidental, incorrect amount of reagent during the assay. A future experiment that could compliment this one would be to examine the differing amounts of chloroplasts in different types of plants and the reasoning behind it. I would want to know if most shade-favoring plants have significently less chloroplast than those of sun-favoring plants. Another question we would want to further research is if the specific type of white light used in this experiment may not have excited the fern as much as the spinach, and if there may be another type of light that would have an opposite effect on both of the organisms. This experiment was successful as a whole and supported many other sources of data that have proven that sun-favoring plants display a higher photosynthetic rate than shade-favoring plants.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The graph displays the average percent change for the fern, spinach and “no chloroplast” samples, measured at 30 minutes of time from the start. The change in absorbance during the 30 minutes was obviously most significent with the spinach, with about a 57% mean change, compared to about 12% mean change in the fern leaves. The standard deviation bars show the biggest variation for the spinach as well. The two plant samples are also compared to the samples with no chloroplast, which expectedly had an extremely minimal change. The two-sample t_test provided a p_value of 0.003373.
