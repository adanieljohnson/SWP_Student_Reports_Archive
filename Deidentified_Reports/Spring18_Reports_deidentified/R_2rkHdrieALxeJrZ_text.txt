Title:       Alteration of Acetylcholine Reception in Rania pipiens Frog Legs

Abstract:
The role of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is vital in the contraction of muscles in that its binding to the receptors of muscle fibers creates an end-plate potential which triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum directly causing the muscle to contract. In the presence of the acetylcholine receptor blocker tubocurarine, less acetylcholine should be able to bind to the muscle fiber reflecting in a measured muscle contraction of a lower amplitude than that in a muscle without tubocurarine. In two separated Rania pipiens frog legs of different individuals, threshold is found and the leg is then electrically stimulated (at threshold + 25%) five times in series and the average amplitude for each leg is recorded. A paired t_test is then performed to compare the corresponding means between the two samples which indicates that the results were statistically significent for both frog legs and therefore the average contraction amplitude in legs treated with tubocurarine were significently smaller than the controll response. Further investigation into the effects of tubocurarine could indicate how it, or a similar acetylcholine receptor blocker, could affect other organisms (such as humans) and lead to an understanding of how such antagnostic drugs could be

Introduction:
        	Rania pipiens are a species of amphibious frogs native to the Northern United States that, like other frogs, are characterized by their strong gastrocnemus muscles in their legs which facilitate their powerful jumps. The contraction of this muscle is caused by the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine from a motor neuron into the neuromuscular junction where it binds to acetylcholine receptors on the muscle fiber, triggering the release of Ca2+ ions which then bind to the thin myofilament of the sarcomeres, exposing the binding site for the thick myofilament to bind and slide—causing the muscle to contract. In order to test the behavior of the gastrocnemus muscle in the presence of less acetylcholine, the acetylcholine blocker Tubocurarine will be injected into the muscle and the resulting amplitude of the contraction of the muscle will be compared to that of the normal muscle, “In frog, tubocurarine caused an increase in apparent facilitation of end‐plate current amplitudes during the first few impulses of repetitive stimulation; this increase was followed by a more rapid rundown of end‐plate current amplitude” [Magleby: 1981]. In the presence of tubocurarine, each muscle should demonstrate a smaller amplitude muscle contraction than before it was injected when the receptor blocker when stimulated with the same voltage.


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method:
        	After being given two separated frog legs from individual Rania pipiens, the skin was pulled off and the tissue above the knee joint was separated to expose the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle and Achilles tendon were severed from the bone and hung from the measuring device by a string while pins were placed around the bone for stability. Silver wire connected to the stimulating electrodes were then placed over the exposed sciatic nerve and it was stimulated repeatedly at increasing voltages starting at 0.1V until threshold of the muscle was found. Once this measure was determined, the muscle was stimulated five times in series at 125% of threshold and the contraction amplitude was measured by the computer. 0.2 Ml of the tubocurarine was then injected into the top of the gastrocnemus muscle and left for five minutes to spread the muscle. The same threshold-measuring and voltage stimulating and measurement process was then repeated. The entire process above was then repeated for the second frog leg. The frog legs were then disconnected and discarded and a paired t_test was performed on the two mean amplitudes for the controll groups and the treatment groups.


Results:
Results:
        	While being stimulated, the contraction in the controll legs was visibly strong and increased with increased voltage. Although the contraction in each leg after being injected with tubocurarine was visibly weaker, it could still be seen. The average contraction amplitude for the first frog leg controll group (before being treated with tubocurarine) was 0.26 V (standard deviation = 0.0138) while the average contraction after being injected was 0.0846 V (standard deviation = 0.01166) In the second frog leg, the average controll contraction was 0.9648 V (standard deviation = 0.0346) and the treatment was 0.7756 V (standard deviation = 0.0331). A paired t_test performed on these data yielded a one tail p_value of 0.00184 with an α-value of 0.05, indicating that there was a statistically significent difference between the average controll and treatment contraction amplitudes.


Discussion:
Discussion:
        	As indicated by the results, the presence of the acetylcholine receptor blocker, tubocurarine, in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens frog leg corresponded with a smaller average muscle contraction amplitude when stimulated with the same voltage. The mean of the two controll groups were statistically different than that of the treatment groups (d.f. = 1, one tail p_value = 0.00184). Because the tubocurarine was blocking the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle fibers, there were not as many end-plate potentials propagating through the post-synaptic nerve leading to less release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore sarcomere contractions as measured by a weaker overall muscle contraction amplitude. Due to the fact that the legs most likely came from two separate individuals, the contractions of the second leg tested (both the controll and treated) were greater than those of the first leg. These data reflected previously studies which concluded that the smaller muscle contraction in muscles injected with acetylcholine was likely due to a rapid rundown of end-plate current amplitude [Magleby: 1981]. Continued research on the effects of antagnostic chemicals such as tubocurarine could lead to an improved understanding of the role of acetylcholine in the muscle contractions of not only frogs, but other organisms as well—including humans. An advanced understanding in this field may facilitate the development or successful application of existing drugs in managing or curing neuromuscular diseases.

The average amplitude for the controll contraction in frog one was 0.276 V while that for the treatment contraction was 0.9648 V. In frog two, the average contraction amplitude for the controll was 0.9648 V and the average treatment amplitude was 0.7756 V.
