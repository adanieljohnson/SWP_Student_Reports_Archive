Title: The Growth and Metaphorical Effects AzaMax, a Ecdysterone Inhibiting Compound, Has on Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effect that the insect growth regulator, AzaMax, has on a Manduca sexta’s metamorphical growth and development. AzaMax is a compound that inhibits ecdysterone, which is a growth hormone that is essential for molting phase occurrences. Since many biological processes rely on a specific chemical ratio, we predicted that by adding AzaMax to the natural food instead of water, these treated caterpillars would grow slower and possibly not endure another molting phase, therefore, inhibiting them from completing their growth cycle. By separating eight Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups, a control group and a AzaMax treated group, we were able to examine their different eating behaviors, lengths, and weights. By the end of the week, our results confirmed our hypothesis, therefore, stating that adding AzaMax to the Manduca sexta diet completely offset the ratio between the two growth hormones, therefore, inhibiting the insect from its normal growth tendencies. 

Introduction:
Metamorphosis is a process that is largely dependent on the levels and emission of two growth hormones, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. In Manduca sexta, “an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers” (Johnson: 2018), the collaborative effects of these two hormones triggers molting phases to occur. “Molting allows for the insect to change in size and/or morphology. A molt separates each of the larval instars and the pupal and adult stages.” (Johnson: 2018). Although the collaboration of these two hormones is incredibly important in the overall progression of metamorphosis, the two hormones play different roles in the molting process. Juvenile hormone levels are what determine the type of molting that is occuring, whereas, ecdysterone determines the timing of the molting. Therefore, the ratio between these two hormones is incredibly sensitive and important in the Manduca sexta’s morphological progress. 
	“This cycle can be longer or shorter under different conditions, depending on the quality of the diet and the average daily temperature” (Johnson: 2018). In our lab, we hypothesize that if we mix the biologically normal Manduca sexta diet, Great Lakes Manduca (GLM), with AzaMax, an ecdysterone inhibiting compound, it will prevent the insect from molting, therefore, completing the insects completion of metamorphosis. We predict this because the ratios between ecdysterone and juvenile hormone are incredibly specific, meaning that if less ecdysterone is injected in their diet, it will inhibit the insect from achieving that specific molting phase. This lab’s results will display the importance of chemical and hormonal ratios and test if AzaMax is an effective pesticide. 


Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we obtained eight Manduca sexta caterpillars and split them into two groups: a controlled group and a AzaMax treated group. We used four small, round, plastic containers to inhabit the eight caterpillars. We used an index card to divide the container into two artificially constructed ecosystems, allowing for two caterpillars to inhabit each container, but on different sides of the divider. All of the caterpillars were incubated in a refrigerator at 23 degrees Celsius and were exposed to 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. 
 In the control group, we fed the 4 control group caterpillars 10 mL of Great Lakes Manduca food mixed with 7 drops of water each day. In the treatment group, we fed each of the four treatment caterpillars 10 mL of Great Lakes Manduca food mixed with 7 droplets of AzaMax. For all eight days, we made sure to clean the containers of any excretion or extra food, and record their weight, length, and note any alarming changes in their diet, color, or behavior. To test the precision and accuracy of our results we will average the control and treatment group data for each day and implicate standard deviation and a Two Sample T-test. 


Results:
	The data shows that even though both the control group and the treatment group grew, the control group grew exponentially, while the treatment group grew slowly. According to both Figure 1 and Figure 2, the control group showed continual increase in growth throughout the week, while the group treated with AzaMax showed inconsistent influxes of growth in length, like portrayed in Figure 1, and a weight curve that seemed to flatline around day 6, as portrayed in Figure 2. 
	Table 1 further supports the phenomenon of an increased control group growth and minimal growth in the AzaMaz treated group. Both the P Value for weight and length are below 0.5, which means that they have a confidence interval above 95%, making them significant. The Manduca sexta caterpillars treated with AzaMax weight value, 2.1, and length value, 5.1, on the final day of the experiment, were less than the control group weight value, 9.6, and length value, 7.7. In addition, the standard deviation for the treatment group, 1.1, was much larger than that of the control group, 0.6 for weight and 0.4 for length. 


Discussion:
The exponential growth increase in the controlled group of Manduca sexta and the minimal growth of the treatment group supported our hypothesis. Adding the AzaMax to the GLM diet did not speed up the morphological process in the Manduca sexta, but instead slowed it down drastically. The AzaMax insect growth regulator (IGR) effects on the Manduca sexta supports the fact that “an IGR does not have to be toxic to its target, but leads instead to various abnormalities that impair insect survival” (Johnson: 18). In this case, the abnormality that the AzaMax triggered was a devastating altercation in the ratio between the juvenile hormone and the ecdysterone. The standard deviation values in Table 1 further support this scenario. Both the standard deviation for the weight and length on day eight for the caterpillars treated with AzaMax were much higher than those values of the control group caterpillars. This shows that there was less uniform in the growth patterns for the caterpillars, which show inconsistent growth patterns. On the other hand, the smaller standard deviation values, 0.4 for length and 0.6 for weight, show more consistent and uniform growth patterns, which indicate the continual increasing trend in growth, as seen in both Figure 1 and Figure 2. 
To test the accuracy of our results we conducted a Two Sample T-test, which supplied us with standard deviation, a confidence interval, and a P value. We rendered our results as significant if they were 0.05 or less, therefore, setting a 95% confidence interval. For our weight, we calculated a .049 interval, which is slightly less than 0.05, meaning that it was statistically significant data. Our weight on the other hand fell down to about 90%, which usually would mean that it would not be classified as significantly relevant data. However, due to the minimal deviation from the 95% interval, we still believed this data to be significant. 
Since this experiment was relatively straightforward, there was little room for error. However, since there were four people per group, this could have resulted in different measuring techniques, which may have resulted in slight deviations from the true measurement values. In addition, when we measured the caterpillars lengths each day, we sometimes struggled to get the caterpillar to fully extend, which could have resulted in some of the length fluctuations seen in Figure 1. Because of this, we decided that weight was a more accurate measurement of growth as each and everyday the scale measured the weight, leaving less room for error. Figure 2, shows a much more consistent growth trend, making it a more reliable growth indicator. 
Decreased levels of ecdysterone, and therefore, the disruption in this growth hormone ratio, impeded the Manduca sexta from being able to molt, and therefore, inhibited the Manduca sexta from growing to their full potential. The insects’ fatigue and browning exterior showed that by inhibiting ecdysterone, the insect was driven further away from achieving that biochemical sweet spot between ecdysterone and juvenile hormones. The results that we collected and assessed can be used to further investigate the usage of AzaMax as a pesticide and could be used to further study the relationship between growth and development hormones. This experiment has demonstrated how precise and specific these chemical ratios are and how altercations of any kind can have grave and possibly lethal effects on the organism.
