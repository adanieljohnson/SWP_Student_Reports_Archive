Title: Caterpillar Mass

Abstract:
The objective of this lab was to see the effect of growth hormones in Manduca Sexta. We predicted that using the Azguard solution, there would be a significent difference in weight over 7 days. We thought this would happen because the moth commitment pulse is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018]. We fed the M. Sexta caterpillars, measured the weight and length and observed their color and if they pupated for a week. For one group, we dropped water on the caterpillar food and in the other group, we dropped the Azguard solution to test its effect on the M. Sexta. In our results, most of the specimens decreased in mass.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, also known as tobacco the hornworm is a worm that grows into a tobacco hawk moth in its adult stage that solely thrives in the Americas. This organism is helpful in this experiment because the Manduca Sexta has a short life cycle. In labs, they rely on an artificial diet, a diet we used for this experiment. For the experiment, we fed the M. Sexta caterpillars, measured the weight and length and observed their color and if they pupated for a week. For one group, we dropped water on the caterpillar food and in the other group, we dropped the Azguard solution to test its effect on the M. Sexta. Because the moth commitment pulse is produced when the signals reaching the indicate that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients to pupate and form a normal size moth [Johnson: 2018], we predicted that using the Azguard solution, there would be a significent difference in weight over 7 days.

Materials and Method:
Our materials in this experiment included 4 round, plastic containers, 4 lids with breathing holes for those containers, caterpillar food, a spoon, a balance, another container to mix the food, transfer pipets, the reagent (in this case, Azguard) index cards and tape. We separated the 8 caterpillars into two groups, the controll group and the treatment group. Each group had 4 containers and 2 caterpillars were placed in each container. We placed the caterpillar food in container and weighed 80 pounds on the balance with zeroing it out first and we stirred the food using the spoon. We weighed 10 grams of food for each caterpillar for both controll and experimental group. For the controll group, we dropped 10 drops of water for the caterpillars in the controll group, using a pipet. For the treatment group, we dropped 10 drops of the Azguard reagent for the caterpillars in the treatment group, using another pipet. We labelled the index cards with the caterpillar number, lab section, group name, and whether it was treatment or controll on both sides and taped them inside each container. We would visit the caterpillars for a week and we would feed them the same amount of food and we would measure their weight, length, color and if they pupated. We would record the data in our notebooks and we would take turns visiting the caterpillar.

Results:
Figure 1 shows the mass of Manduca Sexta for 7 days.  From we can tell from the graph in Figure 1 that specimen 1 had the largest mass with a t_statistic of 0.545 and a p_value of 4.08. Many of the specimens had decreased in mass as shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.

Discussion:
The changes in mass with these Manduca Sextca specimens lead to believe our hypothesis failed because the caterpillars were decreasing in mass. We have failed to the null hypothesis.
