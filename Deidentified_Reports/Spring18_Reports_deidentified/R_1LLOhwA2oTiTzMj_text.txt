Title: The negative effect of EDTA/SrCl channel blockers on Physarum polycephalum growth on water agar plates

Abstract:
Cellular motility is important in many organisms on the planet, especially in plasmoid organisms that act as a single-cell mass. By utilizing actin filaments, the organism can perform move towards nutrients and away from threatening chemicals or organisms, following activation of a signal transduction pathway. These pathways rely on the binding of a ligand to the plasma membrane, and then commonly a secondary messenger will initiate a response from the cells of the organism. However, what if these pathways are inhibited? By attempting to grow Physarum polycephalum on water agar plates coated with an EDTA/SrCl solution, we targeted the signal transduction pathways that bind Ca²⁺ ions for inhibition. After recording growth at 15 and 24 hours, the overall effectiveness of the inhibitor was deduced. We hypothesized that by adding the EDTA/SrCl inhibitor, the growth of P. polycephalum would be inhibited because EDTA chelates metal ions such as Ca²⁺. The experiment yielded results that were insignificent after 15 hours, but were overall significent after the full 24 hour growth period, meaning that our EDTA proved to significently inhibit the growth of our P. polycephalum.

Introduction:
The ability of an organism to move is one of the most important factors in allowing it to survive in various conditions. Movement can allow an organism to move towards a food source, move away from a harmful chemical agent (negative chemotaxis) and towards a non-harmful chemical agent (positive chemotaxis), as well as moving away from a light source, an action called phototaxis (Unit 3: Cell Signalling). Movement is heavily dependent on actin and the cytoskeleton within the cells of the organism,with repeated steps of attachment to the external environment, detachment, and pulling of the rear of the cell towards the direction of movement (Ananthakrishnan, et al.: 2007). These responses are directly related to signal transduction pathways within the organism. Without the ability of the organism to receive information about the external environment and translocate that information throughout its body, the organism would be lost in the world and likely die. Humans use signal transduction pathways within the nervous system to help relay information about the internal and external environments to the brain to make decisions about how to respond from stimuli.
P. polycephalum is a plasmodium that has many similar signal transduction pathways to human cells (Unit 3: Cell Signalling). The mass utilizes actin filaments to move it along the leading edge towards nutrients and away from harmful stimuli, and uses a phenomenon called cytoplasmic streaming to transfer nutrients and waste to and from the cells within (Unit 3: Cell Signalling). The mass grows thin strands towards nutrients and away from harmful stimuli instead of moving its main body completely. P. polycephalum use a few different types of G-protein coupled receptor pathways (GPCRs) for signal transduction, but also a type of ion-channel coupled pathway with Ca²⁺ ions. In this pathway, Ca²⁺ channels located on the plasma membrane will allow Ca²⁺ ions to diffuse into the cell, where they bind to specialized calcium receptors like ryanodine. From here, calcium can be pumped out of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and used for whatever is needed (Unit 3: Cell Signalling). In multiple studies, it has been found that Ca²⁺ is important in the movement of P. polycephalum (Ridgeway, Durham: 1976) (Yoshiyama, et al.: 2013), allowing the plasmodium to have repeated contraction and relaxation leading to movement in conjunction with the actin filaments. However, the Ca²⁺ ions can be chelated by agents such as EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) (Chelates and Chelating Agents). Chelation is where a chelating agent binds several times to a single metal ion. In P. polycephalum, this would lead to the inability of Ca²⁺ to bind to their receptors on the plasma membrane, and thus preventing Ca²⁺ release from the SER, which would prevent movement if Ca²⁺ ions are important in the movement of P. polycephalum. This has been witnessed in a study with P. polycephalum (von Olenhusen: 1979) and as well with the amoebozoa Entamoeba histolytica (Makioka, et al.: 2001).
In this experiment, we will be testing how the Ca²⁺ chelator EDTA effects the ability to bind to Ca²⁺ receptors on the membrane of P. polycephalum cells, and therefore the movement and growth of the plasmoid mass. We hypothesize that if a water agar plate is soaked with and EDTA/SrCl solution, then the P. polycephalum mass growth will be inhibited because the Ca²⁺ has been blocked from binding to its receptors and cannot initiate the release of Ca²⁺ ions from the SER to assist in moving the mass.
P. polycephalum is a good organism to use for this study, since it behaves as a giant single-cell mass, allowing us to witness several cellular processes without the aid of a microscope. Also, as mentioned before, P. polycephalum utilizes several signal transduction pathways that humans do, so much of  the research that is done on P. polycephalum translates directly to human cells. 


Materials and Method:
The P. polycephalum used was cultured on non-water agar plates and held in an incubator at 37℃ prior to use in the experiment.
Nine 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water were procured and labelled the plates on the back for which treatment the agar plates had, as well as being marked with 3, 1 x 1 cm squares where the agar was cut and replaced with the P. polycephalum block or the treatment blocks.Three plates each were labelled for the controll group, Ca²⁺ treated group, and EDTA/SrCl treated group. Create a 1 mM sample of EDTA/SrCl solution, a 1 mM Ca²⁺ solution, and a 25 mM glucose solution. Enough Ca²⁺ solution was poured over the agar plate as to cover the the entirety of the plates for Ca²⁺ treatment.The plates then soaked in the solution for 10 minutes. This was repeated for the EDTA/SrCl solution and its agar plates, as well as for an agar plate covered in glucose solution. The spatula and forceps were sterilized by letting them sit in 95% ethanol for 10 seconds, then hovering over a flame as to burn off any contamination. After cooling, 3, 1 x 1 cm squares were cut into the agar in each of the water agar plates.The left and middle blocks from the plates were removed, but the right block remained cut, but not removed to act as a blank. It is important to make sure the spatula and forceps are resterilized any time they need to touch a new surface. We then cut and removed 9, 1 x 1 cm square slabs from the agar plate containing the grown P. polycephalum. One square was placed into each of the middle holes in the water agar plates. A block of agar soaked in glucose solution was placed in the remaining holes on the left of the agar plates, and an oat was added on top of the glucose block to act as a food source for the P. polycephalum.
	Each of the lids of the plates were taped down on two sides to keep the lid in place, and then each of the plates were wrapped in tin foil so that no light could permeate. The plates were then placed in an incubator (INSERT TEMPS). 15 hours later the plates were removed from the incubator and scored for the distance that P. polycephalum travelled along the plate, measured in millimeters. The plates were then wrapped in foil and placed back into the incubator. After 24 hours from the start of the experiment, the plates were scored again. A two-sample t_test was used to determine statistical difference between the growth of the plates, with respect to a critical value of p=0.05.


Results:
The average growth of P. polycephalum after 15 hours for the Ca²⁺ treated group was the largest with 12.0 mm±17.4, for the controll group 1.67mm±1.16, and for the EDTA/SrCl group 0.0 mm±0.0. The Ca²⁺ treated group represents a positive controll. A two-sample t_test was run and found that for the EDTA/SrCl treated agar plates (t(3)=(1.94, p=0.15). However, after 24 hours, the largest average growth was seen in the controll group with 38.0 mm±7.94, with 14.3 mm±15.5 of growth in the Ca²⁺ group, and still 0.0 mm±0.0 of growth. A two-sample t_test was run and found that for the EDTA/SrCl treated agar plates (t(3)=(6.42, p=0.008).


Discussion:
Overall, the data from the experiment was found to be insignificent after the 15 hour incubation, but after the 24 hour period, the data was significent as seen in the results of the t_tests. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis that EDTA does not inhibit growth of the P. polycephalum, and our alternate hypothesis of EDTA inhibiting P. polycephalum growth was supported. At 24 hours, the results from the t_test showed statistical significance in the fact that EDTA did inhibit the growth of the P. polycephalum mass. The reason that the EDTA seemed to have not inhibited growth over the 15 hour period was because the controll group itself hardly grew, with only an average of 1.67 mm±1.16 more than the EDTA/SrCl treated agar plate. But, when more time had passed, it is clear to see that the controll plates had much more growth with an average of 38.0 mm±7.94 more growth than the EDTA inhibited plates. It is important to note, however, that one of the data points from the EDTA/SrCl treated agar plates was removed because it was an outlier. Whereas two of the plates did not show any growth at all, one of the plates showed extensive growth over both the 15 hour and 24 hour incubation periods, totalling 62 mm of growth. Therefore, it was an outlier, and was omitted from the averages for the EDTA/SrCl group because there was likely error in the experimental set up. This may be from contamination and improper sterilization of the instruments used to remove and place the agar blocks into their plates, or possibly that the EDTA/SrCl solution did not fully absorb into the water agar plate over the 10 minute period that we let them sit prior to cutting and adding the P. polycephalum and glucose blocks to the plates.
	Ultimately, the EDTA did inhibit the growth of the P. polycephalum, as we had suspected from the previous literature (von Olenhusen: 1979), (Makioka, et al.: 2001). One thing that is confusing, though, is the fact that the Ca²⁺ treated plates did not have the highest overall growth after the 24 hour period. After the 15 hour period, they had grown to an average of 12.0 mm±17.4, but after the full extent of the experiment they only grew on average 2 mm more, ending with an average of 14.3 mm±15.5. This suggests that the signal transduction pathways that allow for Ca²⁺ release from the SER may have a threshold for the amount of Ca²⁺ that is beneficial for the movement of the P. polycephalum mass, and the presence of too much Ca²⁺ may actually stunt the growth of P. polycephalum. This is similar to the effects seen in muscle contraction, where an influx of Ca²⁺ ions is needed for contraction to occur, and will relax when the Ca²⁺ ions are reuptaken by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In our experiment, the constant exposure to the 
Further experimentation can be done to further investigate this idea. A possible investigation would be to manipulate varied concentrations of Ca²⁺ solutions and see how they affect the growth of P. polycephalum in comparison to a controll water agar plate. Another interesting experiment would be to soak an agar plate after allowing P. polycephalum to grow for 24 hours on a controllled water agar plate, then to introduce an agent like EDTA after P. polycephalum has had time to grow, and see if it will induce any sort of chemotaxis, or simply just inhibit the growth altogether at the point that it had reached prior to EDTA introduction. Furthermore, using other agents that block Ca²⁺ binding would be a useful further experiment to see which provides the strongest inhibition of growth. It would also be interesting to look at how inhibition by EDTA affects the cytoplasmic streaming within the strands of P. polycephalum, if there is any impact at all. 
As far as this experiment, there needs to be further experimentation with a larger sample size, and perhaps more segmented time intervals to gather more data and investigate the rates of growth with the presence of excess Ca²⁺ ions compared to the controll group. Since P. polycephalum utilizes many of the same signalling pathways that human cells do, further experimentation may lead us to find out new concepts that we had not previously known about in the movement and growth of cells, which potentially would allow us to better the life of human cells and in turn humans as a whole.
