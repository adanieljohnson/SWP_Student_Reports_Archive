Title: Effects of Caffeine in the Somatic Neuromuscular System of a Rana pipien

Abstract:
In this experiment, the sciatic nerve of a Rana pipien will be stimulated by 3 volts to determine the twitch amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle. However, for both of the 2 legs, the second portion of the calculations will receive 5 mL of caffeine. The means for both legs will be calculated for the pre-injection vs. the post-injection. It is hypothesized that if the Rana pipien’s sciatic nerve is injected with the CNS stimulant caffeine, then the twitch amplitude will increase to an extreme amount.  This was not the case though as the twitch amplitude actually decreased with the caffeine. This was due to chemically induced tetany which essentially explains why the twitch amplitude decreases since the muscle is already contracted at the max.


Introduction:
Nerves, or bundles of axons in the peripheral nervous system used to carry out information, allow muscles to receive this information and act upon what was received. These nerves and muscles show their connection to each other in the species of Rana pipiens, They are Northern Leopard Frogs that contain a gastrocnemius muscle and a sciatic nerve in each leg. The amount of nerve and muscle activity that each goes through depends on the somatic neuromuscular system. This consists of skeletal muscle which is made up of myofibers, or cylindrical, multi- nuclear, fused aggregates of cells that are kept together by connective tissues. Skeletal muscle is also made up of motor neurons originating in the spinal cord. The motor neurons contain axons that extend into a muscle and branch into the myofibers. This creates a neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the site at which acetylcholine releases after a nerve impulse from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Finally, these action potentials release calcium resulting in a muscle contraction. In addition, these muscle contractions can be stimulated by excitation-contraction coupling due to either electricity, the stretching/shortening of a muscle, etc. This process can be monitored by a force transducer with a myogram to show each phase: contraction (the shortening of a muscle), relaxation (when the muscle lengthens again), latent, and tetany (the stage at which there is maximum contraction)  [Johnson: 2018]. Also, muscles and nerves can be stimulated directly to have certain effects. For example, caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that is obvious in its effects on humans that drink it daily just to stay awake and reach the energy levels that they need because of it. It can potentially have an effect of making people’s muscles feel seemingly extra stimulated. Why does it have this effect? Caffeine increases the calcium released from the endoplasmic reticulum with help from the ryanodine receptor creating a muscle contraction. Therefore, with more contractions, a muscle will be more stimulated. An extreme amount of contraction may lead to tetany, which is the maximum level of contraction.  A second effect that caffeine has been shown to do is decrease the rate of relaxation in a muscle while tetany tends to increase due to caffeine [Kalmer: 2001].  If a human that drinks coffee in the mornings feels more energetic, then a Rana pipien’s leg should have a similar effect of the same twitching result. Therefore this leads to the hypothesis that if the Rana pipien’s gastrocnemius muscle is injected with the CNS stimulant caffeine, then the twitch amplitude will increase to an extreme amount versus no injection of caffeine.


Materials and Methods:
 To begin the experiment, the skin of the Rana pipien’s leg needs to be gently pulled off with forceps. After,  squirt the leg with frog ringers so that it does not dry out and remember to do so throughout the rest of the experiment. Next, gently separate the inner thigh muscle with a probe and separate the nerve from the gastrocnemius muscle with a needle and forceps. Then attach the silver conductive thread so that it is touching the nerve. After doing so, apply the stimulus parameter from a laptop to find the maximum and minimum amplitudes for both the control and experimental groups to help determine the threshold. Once that is found, at 3 voltages, shock the control group and find 3 separate twitch amplitudes. Finally do the same thing with the experimental leg, but inject it with 5 mL of caffeine first. Unlike other chemicals used, no time needs to be spent waiting for the caffeine to kick in as it is almost instantly recognized. Once results are gathered, a paired t-test will be done.  


Results:
The main physical difference between the post-injection groups and the pre-injection groups was how contracted the post-injection group became. The gastrocnemius muscle instantly hardened and was stiff to touch. However, the p-value of 0.402782 states that the difference between the two groups is not significant. In addition, the mean of the twitch amplitude of the pre-injection for leg 1 was 1.788 while the post-injection mean was 0.547 plus or minus 1.06915 (V). Meanwhile, leg 2 pre-injection mean was 0.276 and the post-injection mean was 0.085 plus or minus 0.326683 (V).  See figure 1 for the graphed results. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis was not proven correct as the twitch amplitude did not increase, as the statistics show.  Why is it that caffeine causes contractions, yet they were not shown as expected on the myograms? The caffeine caused the gastrocnemius muscle to contract so much that the muscle reached complete tetany as it hardened and was stiff too when touched. The hypothesis suggested that the amplitudes of the experimental groups would be much higher, but this chemically induced tetany is why it failed. All of the amplitude was lost in the tetany so when it came time to shock the muscle (at 3 volts), it was not able to contract at high amplitudes because the muscle was already contracting at the fullest amount. The myogram did an excellent job at showing this because there was a gap before the three amplitudes were visually seen. As said earlier, caffeine increases the calcium released with help from the ryanodine receptor creating a muscle contraction as this receptor is a channel way for the calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (Kalmar:2001). This expresses that when calcium is released, a muscle contracts. Therefore, if there is more calcium released due to the caffeine, then the muscle will contract even more. The caffeine causes so much calcium to release that the contraction turns into the chemically induced tetany. In conclusion, it was the tetany triggered by the caffeine that maximized the contractions, but took away the increase in amplitudes.
