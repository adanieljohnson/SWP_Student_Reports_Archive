Title: Precor effect on the growth and development of (Manduca sexta) 

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effects of Precor on (Manduca sexta) were tested. Precor is an IGR that is made of methoprene.  It mimics the function of JH hormone in the caterpillars.  JH effects the ability for the caterpillars to molt. These caterpillars have seven stages of development.  In the 5 instar (larval) stages the (Manduca sexta) are considered pests. The experiment was performed over a 7-day period and 8 caterpillars were used.  4 were part of the controll group and the other 4 were part of the experimental group. The mass of each caterpillar was measured every day, in order to determine if the experimental group would have a greater mass than the controll group.  A statistical test was conducted, which showed that the data was random and not statistically significent. Therefore, our results did not show a correlation between JH and weight in the (Manduca sexta).


Introduction:
	(Manduca Sexta) are caterpillars that live predominantly in the southeastern United States. They are commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms and Goliath Worms when in their larvae stage. In their adult stage, they are moths that are commonly known as Carolina Sphinx moths and Tobacco Hawk moths. The (Manduca sexta) has 7 stages of development.  The first 5 stages of growth are called instar.  These instar stages are when the larvae begin to grow extensively.  During the first 4 instar stages, the larvae typically have high levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH).  In the 5th stage, JH levels begin to decrease, and remain very low throughout the pupa and adult stage.  The 6th and 7th stages are pupa and adult.  The (Manduca sexta) lifespan is typically 30 to 50 days.  They usually grow to approximately 10 g during the larvae stages (Reineke 1980).  During development, JH determines the type of molt.  JH comes from the corpus allata, which are glands that the caterpillars have (Rowland 2017).  The IGR’s mimic the functions of JH or 20E. This allows researchers to manipulate the hormone levels in the (Manduca sexta). The IGR we used in our experiment was Precor.  Precor is methoprene based, and is made up of 1.2% of the active ingredient (Rowland 2017). The initial question that we asked in our experiment was, what effect does JH have on the (Manduca sexta) during the larvae stage?  This question is important, because (Manduca sexta) are considered pests in the larvae stage. They are a large problem in the southeastern United States (Mechaber 2000).  They feed on tomatoes and tobacco, which are two cash crops prevalent in the Southeast (Mechaber 2000). We are studying the hormone regulation, because it could lead to some insights on how to limit the amount of these pests.  From this question, we formed our hypothesis: If the (Manduca sexta) consumes food containing Precor, then it will weigh more than the controll group.  If our data did not pass the t_test, then we would use our null hypothesis: If the (Manduca sexta) consumes food containing Precor, then it will weigh the same as the controll group.
	


Materials and Method:
8 (Manduca sexta) in their larvae stage were randoMly selected and divided into two groups.  Each caterpillar was placed in its own living space.  The controll group was given 10 g of food with 3 drops of water. The treatment group was given 10 g of food with 3 drops of Precor (an IGR).  Our independent variable was the drops of Precor or Water in the food.  For 7 days, the caterpillars were fed the same amount and lived in the same environment. They were maintained at a consistent temperature in an incubator. Each day they were weighed, in order to test our hypothesis.  At the end of the experiment, we compared the weights of the controll group with the weights of the treatment groups for every day.  We used a two-sample T-test to determine whether the alternate or the null hypothesis should be used.  

Results:
Table 1. outlines the differences in mass per each caterpillar from day 1 to day 7 and also shows the average of these differences in the controll and treatment groups. Looking at Figure 1, it can be determined that the mean difference in mass of the controll groups was 2.215+/-2.42 g. It was also determined that the mean difference in mass of the groups treated with Precor was 3.288+/-2.96 g, which was not significently different from the controll (p=0.595, t=0.56).  A two-tailed t_test was used in order to get these values. The error bars in the graph represent the standard deviation of the data. 


Discussion:
Because of the results, the Alternate hypothesis was rejected and Null was accepted.  This statistical test indicated that the p_value was over 0.05.  This made the results not statistically significent, and indicated that the results were due to random chance rather than the presence of Precor in the food.  Moreover, these results may be because of several experimental errors. First, the (Manduca sexta), were not fed 10 g of food every day.  Two of the caterpillars (controll 2 and treatment 4) lost weight, because they were starved.  This inconsistency with feeding, led to inaccuracies in the weights of the (Manduca sexta). Previous research indicated that (Manduca sexta) in the larvae stage typically weigh 10 g (Reineke 1980), which was not the case in this experiment. Another experimental error that occurred, was the escaping of two of the caterpillars to the wrong side of the paper note card divider.  These caterpillars (controll 1 and 4) both moved to the treatment side for no more than 24 hours. They were separated again based on the weights previously measured. This contributed to the randomness of the results, because the treatment and controll groups were not completely isolated from each other.  Some caterpillars consumed both foods, which indicated why the results were inaccurate.  JH should have affected molting in the (Manduca sexta), but the results did not indicate a correlation between the two.  Therefore, the results from the experiment do not show any data relating to the regulation of the (Manduca sexta), as a pest in the southeastern United States.  Other research indicated that JH had an effect on the caterpillars near the 5th instar phase, and that the more IGR added, the more molting was inhibited (Beckage 2003).
