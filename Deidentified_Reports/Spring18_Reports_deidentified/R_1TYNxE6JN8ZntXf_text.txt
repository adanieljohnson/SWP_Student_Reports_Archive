Title: Insect Growth Regulators Effect on (Manduca Sexta) Caterpillars

Abstract:
The (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar, like most insects, relay on hormones to make developmental changes. However, these hormones can be synthetically reproduced in the form of Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs). The purpose of this experiment was to determine if IGRs have an adverse effect on the development and life cycle of the (Manduca Sexta). It was hypothesized a small dose of Azamax in their food would be harmful to the caterpillar’s life cycle- stunting their growth and transformation into a pupa. This hypothesis was supported because there is a significent difference between the weight gain between controll groups and the experimental groups. This lack of weight gain in the experimental group caterpillars can be correlated to their ingestion of Azamax, leading to the conclusion that Azamax, and perhaps other IGRs, negatively affect the growth of (Manduca Sexta) caterpillars. 


Introduction:
(Manduca Sexta) are a type of tobacco hornworm in the order Lepidoptera, along with other butterflies and moths. The life cycle of a (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar is approximately 35 days, spending 2-5 days in each instar and around 20 days as a pupa (Johnson, 2018). Like all animals, these caterpillars use hormone and neuron signaling to controll physiological processing, such as growth. Because insect hormones play a significent (and visual) role in their development, insects like the Manduca caterpillar are good model organisms to use in hormonal research. 
	There are three main hormones related to growth, molting, and development in insects, such as the Manduca caterpillar: Prothoracicotrophic hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH and 20E work together to affect the Manduca’s metamorphosis rate and type. However, not all developmental factors are controllled naturally by hormones. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are synthetic growth hormones that can alter the physiology and life cycle of insects. IGRs are not toxic to the targeted pest, but rather, alter the physiology of the pest to affect its life cycle (Tunaz, 2004). Tunaz further states that there are currently two types of IGRs: chitin synthesis inhibitors and ones that over-stimulate or interfere with hormonal processes. Azamax, the IGR used in this experiment, is an insecticide that interferes with developmental processes. The active ingredient in Azamax is the insecticide azadirchtin, which is a mimic of JH in insects (Hollis, 2011).
In this experiment, we will be determining if IGRs affect the Manduca’s growth over a period of seven days. We hypothesize that, since the IGRs are a JH mimic, it will be harmful to the caterpillars’ development, stopping the rapid growth and preventing the caterpillar to change into a pupa.  


Materials and Method:
•	Four round containers and lids
•	Index cards
•	Tape 
•	Caterpillar food
•	Spoons
•	Plastic containers 
•	Pipettes 
•	Balance
•	Reagent (Azamax IGR)

Method

Containers were divided in half with index cards and tape and then labeled.  One caterpillar was placed in each side of the containers. 80 grams of food was weighed, then 10 grams of that food was weighed and placed in a plastic container. In containers, 10 grams of food was mixed with 10 drops of water for the controll groups and 10 grams of food was mixed with 5 drops of Azamax IGR and 5 drops of water. The food (10 grams per side) was placed in the containers containing the caterpillars. The weights of each caterpillar were recorded daily for 7 days. Fresh food should have been provided to each caterpillar daily, however, in this experiment the same food was left in the container until none remained. 
Once data is collected, make a bar graph that shows the average change in weights of the controll group versus the treatment group caterpillars. Include error bars in the graph. Furthermore, perform a two sample T-test and record the p_value. If the p_value is less than 0.05, then the alternative hypothesis is accepted and the null hypothesis is rejected. 


Results:
The results of this experiment show a significent difference in the average weights of the (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar over the course of seven days. The controll group caterpillars were fed a regular diet, and showed much more weight gain than the treatment group caterpillars (Fig. 1). This increase in weight gain over a week is healthy for the (Manduca Sexta) and corresponds to developmental growth. In the treatment group, however, there was much less weight gain. Because azadirachtin is an effective growth regulator, the lack of weight gain can be attributed to the consumption of this IGR, which stunted their growth and development (Sharma, 2006).


Discussion:
In this experiment, the goal was to determine how an IGR (Azamax) affects the (Manduca Sexta) caterpillar’s development. We hypothesized that the administration of the IGR would be harmful to the caterpillars’ growth. The p_value for this experiment is 0.0001. Because this p_value is under 0.05, the alternative hypothesis that IGR are harmful to the caterpillars is accepted. This means that the null hypothesis is rejected; it is concluded that the IGR negatively affects the development of (Manduca Sexta). 
Overall, the controll caterpillars gained more weight than the experimental caterpillars. This pattern is most likely attributed to the experimental group receiving Azamax, an IGR that is expected to reduce development and weight gain (Tunaz et al., 2004). These results support previous research by Sharma et al. (2006) and Almeida (2010). Sharma and others state that treatments of azadirachtin caused growth inhibition, as well as death in (Helicoverpa armigera), a type of caterpillar similar to the (Manduca sexta). Furthermore, the results support data found by Almeida et al. (2010) because they state that azadirachtin adversely affects adult (Anticarsia gemmatalis) as well as its larvae. 
	On the contrary, these results, that attribute the lack of development of (Manduca sexta) with the effect of azadirachtin, somewhat refutes the previous research by Kraiss and Cullen (2008). They state that azadirachtin did not negatively affect the growth of (Harmonia axyridis), a type of ladybug, but, rather, proved to be beneficial for the insect. They concluded that this IGR increased adult developmental time, suggesting that IGRs increase the rate of development. It is possible that our results differ from those of the study by Kraiss and Cullen due to the fact that the organisms tested are different. Perhaps azadirachtin affects different species in different ways.
