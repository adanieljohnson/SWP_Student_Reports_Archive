Title: Male Betta Splendens of Smaller Size Display Quicker Signs of Aggressive Behavior Towards Male Betta Splendens of Larger Size

Abstract:
Dominating territories, winning out over competitors, and attracting mates are only some of the reasons betta fish exhibit aggressive behavioral displays. Male betta fish express high levels of aggression when in the presence of other betta fish to assert dominance. We measured the amount of time it took for male betta fish to exhibit aggressive behavior when in the presence of another male betta of a different size to see if size influenced the aggression of betta fish. We predicted that medium-sized fish will display aggression faster toward a large fish rather than a small fish. In our experiment, we measured the amount of time it took for two different medium-sized betta fish to react to both a small betta fish and a big betta fish. Our results show that the medium-sized betta fish reacted much quicker toward the big betta fish rather than the small betta fish. 


Introduction:
Animal behaviors are an important aspect in evolutionary biology. Scientists investigate to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. In this lab, we will be looking at betta fish behavior because of their colorful displays in the presence of their own species, which are known as intraspecific behaviors. Betta fish come in various shapes, sizes, and colors and in this experiment we will be focusing on the role that size plays in correlation to betta fishes aggressive behaviors. Size has been known to affect the mating preference of females to males, as females prefer to mate with larger males (Clotfelter, Curren, and Murphy, 2006). If size affects mating preference, there is a large possibility that it also affects intraspecific behaviors of aggression between two males that are in the presence of one another, especially because betta fish are territorial animals, which defend their claimed area against others of the same species (Doutrelant, McGregor, and Oliveira, 2001). Therefore, in our experiment, we will be looking at how size affects betta fish’s behavioral displays of aggression. We will be looking at the amount of time it takes for male betta fish to start showing signs of aggression when introduced to another male betta fish of a different size. We will be looking for any type of broadside movements or facing movements at any level of aggression betta fish display when they are in the presence of another betta fish that is either bigger or smaller. We hypothesize that size influences aggressive behavior and that the medium fish will display more aggression at a faster pace toward the large fish rather than the small.

Materials and Methods:
We obtained a small betta fish, two medium betta fishes, and a large betta fish. Number 1 medium betta fish was used for Trial 1 and the number 2 medium betta fish was used for Trial 2. Next, we removed the opaque barrier between the small betta fish and #1 medium betta fish and observed their behavior for 5 minutes, timing how quickly the medium fish displayed aggressive behavior. We put back the opaque barrier and provided 5 minutes for the betta fish to rest. Next, we removed the opaque barrier between the large betta fish and #1 medium betta fish and observed their behavior for 5 minutes, timing how quickly the medium fish displayed aggressive behavior. We put back the opaque barrier and provided 5 minutes for the betta fish to rest. Again, we put back the opaque barrier and provided 5 minutes for the betta fish to rest. We then replaced #1 medium betta fish with #2 medium betta fish and repeated the exact same steps with the #2 medium betta fish with both the small and large betta fish as we did with the #1 betta fish. We then took the times of how long it took for both the medium fish to react to the small fish and averaged them. Next, we took the times of how long it took for both the medium fish to react to the big fish and averaged them. We then used a one-sample paired t-test to determine if the reaction times were significantly different. 


Results:
The medium betta fishes reacted more quickly with aggressive behavior toward the large betta fish than the small betta fish shown in Figure 1. We conducted a one-sample paired t-test that found that p value was 0.015. This value is less than .05, therefore, there was a significant difference in that the medium betta fish displayed aggression faster toward the bigger betta fish than the smaller betta fish. 


Discussion:
In both trials, the medium betta fish started showing aggressive behavior much faster toward the bigger betta fish than the smaller betta fish. This is most likely because the medium betta were the smaller fish in this situation. Betta fish are territorial animals because their ability to compete for territory is critical to the reproductive success of male betta fish and, therefore, utilize their aggressive behavior to exemplify dominance over the area (Mullica and Krisanadej Jaroensutasinee, 2003). When the medium betta encountered the large betta, they most likely flared their operculum, exposed their mane, and erect their pectoral fins to appear larger in size and assert their dominance over the area. I also observed from the trials that the smaller fish of the two in each of the trials swam away from the barrier, whether it was the small betta fish or the medium betta fish. The larger fish of the two fish consistently patrolled the barrier. This is most likely because the fish that was bigger has the right over the territory the fish are competing for. These trials proved our hypothesis to be correct. We would have to run this test again to obtain more concrete data, since at the beginning of the trial we had to switch the fish out four times due to the fact that they were not reacting at all and seemed to be habituated to the experiment.
