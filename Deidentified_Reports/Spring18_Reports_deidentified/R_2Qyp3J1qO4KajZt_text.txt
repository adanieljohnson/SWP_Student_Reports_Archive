Title: The Effect of Salinity on Avena sativa Root to Shoot Weight and Length Ratios

Abstract:
Plants utilize the allocation of resources in order to survive in their environments. The purpose of this lab was to determine how plants allocate resources in high nutrient concentrated environments. In lab, the ability of Avena sativa to allocate resources in a high salt ion concentration was tested by comparing the root to shoot weight ratios in four experimental replicates, given 1.3g/l NaCl solution, and four controll replicates, given water for fourteen days. It was hypothesized that there would be a significent difference in the root to shoot weight and length ratios between the controll and experimental group. The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.696, d.f.=8, P=0.505). The root to shoot length ratio was not statistically significent (t_stat=2.015, d.f.=8, P=0.079). This could be due to a high photosynthetic activity by the Avena sativa.

Introduction:
Plants vary in location and therefore their environment determines how they allocate energy and metabolic resources. Plants must adapt to their surroundings in order to survive. They survive by utilizing resource allocation, the distribution of limited resources, but there are tradeoffs as well. Organisms cannot evolve to survive every possible condition; plants allocate resources above ground through the use of stem and leaf growth, as well as root growth underground. In lab the ability of Avena sativa, plants commonly known as Oats, ability to adapt through the allocation of resources in a salt water environment was tested. Avena sativa was tested because the organism is able to grow within a short period of time. Plants select ions to either use or exclude by controllling the root uptake through the xylem and transport of ions in leaves. High concentrations of salt lead to stalling root growth [Parida & Das: 2005]. In addition, the controll of ions in order to relieve salt stress results in increased water retention to balance the concentration with plant cells [Parida & Das: 2005]. It was then hypothesized that there would be a significent difference in the root to shoot weigh and length ratios between the controll and experimental group of Avena sativa. 

Materials and Method:
Method:
First, the Avena sativa seeds were potted with 50Ml of Miracle Grow. Then, every day for two weeks 100Ml of 1.3g/l NaCl solution was poured into two pots of Avena sativa, the experimental group, and 100Ml of water was poured into two pots of Avena sativa, the controll group. After two weeks, each whole Avena sativa replicate weight and length was measured in grams. The roots and shoots of each of the four controll and four experimental replicates were separated. Their weights were measured in grams and their lengths were measured in centimeters. The root to shoot weight and length ratios were determined for each replicate. The average value of the root to shoot weight and length ratios were determined for the experimental and controll replicates. Two-sample t_test was used to analyze the statistical difference between the experimental group of four replicates and controll group of four replicates.

Results:
The mean root to shoot weight ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=0.696, d.f.=8, P=0.505). The controll group had a greater root to shoot weight ratio compared to the experimental group, as seen in Figure 1. The controll group had an average root to shoot weight ratio of 0.4340.093. Whereas, the experimental group had a root to shoot weight ratio of 0.3840.130. The experimental group has more standard deviation compared to the controll group meaning there was more variation among replicates in the experimental group compared to the controll group, as seen in Figure 1. The mean root to shoot length ratio of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat=2.015, d.f.=8, P=0.079). The controll group had a greater root to shoot length ratio compared to the experimental group, as seen in Figure 2. The controll group had an average root to shoot length ratio of 1.0980.237. Whereas, the experimental group had a root to shoot length ratio of 0.8560.134. The experimental group has less standard deviation compared to the controll group meaning there was less variation among replicates in the experimental group compared to the controll group, as seen in Figure 2.

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported because the p_value was greater than 0.05 in the statistical analysis comparing the controll and experimental groups root to shoot weigh and length ratios. Therefore, there is no significent difference between the root to shoot weight ratio of the controll and experimental groups. In addition, there is no significent difference between the root to shoot weight ratio of the controll and experimental groups. This conclusion can be supported by the finding in another study where the ineffectiveness of salinity on physiological characteristics in the plant Alhagi pseufoalhagi was determined. There was no effect of the physiological characteristics due to high salinity concentrations because there was increase carbon dioxide activity and stomatal conductance which resulted in photosynthetic activity [Kurban, et al: 2012]. There was no difference in the root to shoot weight and length ratio [Kurban, et al: 2012]. The experiment explained that salinity had promoted the root uptake of potassium and salt ions, not affected calcium and magnesium ions, and created a deficiency of calcium in the Alhagi pseufoalhagi. This means that salinity affects the root uptake of some nutrients, but not all. The allocation of these ions in reaction to a salty environment resulted in growth of the plant weight, instead of inhibiting plant growth. Limitations of the experiment using Alhagi pseufoalhagi are that the experiment looked at growth over a period of thirty days compared to our experiment which only looked at the growth after fourteen days. Therefore, it would be more effective for future experiments to last longer than fourteen days. Recognizing how plants react to high nutrient concentrations can help determine where salt tolerant plants can be planted and vice versa. The effect of salinity on plant resource allocation is important in improving crop productivity in the coastal plains, near the ocean, which has high salt concentration.
