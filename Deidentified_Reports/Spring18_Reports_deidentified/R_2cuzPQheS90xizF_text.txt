Title: The Effects of A23187 Activator on the Intracellular Calcium Channels of Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested the effects of A23187 on intracellular calcium channels in Physarum polycephalum. Using three petri plates containing water agar as our controll group, and three petri plates with 5Ml of a 20Ml diluted solution containing A23187 as our test group, we had the ability to calculate the time of cytoplasmic streaming and the distance and direction that the P. polycephalum traveled from the Physarum stock. We hypothesized that the A23187 activator would cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and cause the P. polycephalum to move towards the food. Our results showed that A23187 did cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease when compared to our controll group, and the P. polycephalum did move towards the food. The A23187 caused the amount of calcium in the P. polycephalum to increase which resulted in increased contraction and movement 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we tested the effects of A23187 on intracellular calcium channels in P. polycephalum. By measuring the cytoplasmic streaming and distance travelled by the P. polychephalum, we can determine the effects of A23187 on calcium channels. Since P. polycephalum have transduction pathways like humans, they are great organisms to study. The movement of P. polycephalum is due to cytoplasmic streaming. During this process, the interaction between the actin and myosin located within the walls of the plasmodial tubes causes the rear edge of the cell to release from its surface. Thus, the organism continues its movement forward [Terry: 2009]. Calcium plays a huge role in the motility of P. polychephalum. When removing calcium from P. polychephalum, the organism ceased to show contractile movements. This indicated that calcium has an enhancing effect on the movement and growth of an organism [Terry: 2009]. Thus, we hypothesize that the A23187 will cause the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and cause the P. polycephlaum to move towards the food. Since A23187 is an activator, it will speed up the time it takes a P. polycephalum to complete a full cycle of streaming. 


Materials and Method:
We started our experiment by making a dilution solution containing 1Ml of 1x of our test compound(A23187) and 19Ml of dH2O to make a 20Ml of 20x test solution. We collected 6 petri plates containing 2% water-agar and prepared our plates as seen in figure 5. Then we added 5Ml of our 20Ml of 20x test solution to three of the petri plates to act as our test group, waited 10 minutes and then drained the excess liquid. We then cut twos squares from each of the six plates, making sure to sterilize our spatula every time.  We then cut out six squares of Physarum stock and place it in the initial square we had cut out, and took oats (physarum food) and placed it in the second cut out 1cm x 1cm square of each of the 6 petri plates. After, we took each petri plate, wrapped it in aluminum foil, and placed it in the incubator for at least 18 hours. After the 18 hours passed, we recorded the cytoplasmic streaming of the 3-controll petri plate and the 3 test petri plates, and recorded the distance, direction the physarum traveled in each plate, and conducted a two-sample t_test.


Results:
Our results show that A23187 activator caused the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease and caused the P. polycephalum to move towards the food source. When comparing the cytoplasmic streaming of both groups as seen in figure 3, test group 1 had an average of 32.67seconds, test group 2 had an average of 33.67 seconds, test group 3 had an average of 29.00 seconds, and the controll group had an average of 41.8 seconds. When looking at figure 4, one can see that the average distance traveled by the controll group was 3.5cm and the average distance traveled by the test group was 3.9cm, which is 0.4cm greater than the controll group. After analyzing the direction that the physarum traveled one can see that the controll group had no growth and the test group tended to move towards the source of food. After completing a two-sample t_test comparing the cytoplasmic streaming of the controll group and the test group, our results had a t_stat = 4.1724, d.f.=9, and p_value=0.0008.


Discussion:
After completing our experiment, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported. The A23187 activator did cause the cytoplasmic streaming time of the P. polycephalum to decrease from an average of 41.8 seconds to an average of 32.67 seconds, 33.67 seconds, and 29.00 seconds. The P. polycephalum that received the diluted solution with the A23187 traveled an average distance of 3.9cm which is greater than the 3.5cm that the controll group traveled. The A23187 activator caused the cytoplasmic streaming time to decrease because it has a direct effect on the calcium channels of the organism. Organisms need calcium to contract their muscles and move forward. The increase in calcium causes the actin-myosin interaction so that the muscle contracts when calcium returns to submicromolar levels, the interaction is abolished and the muscle relaxes [Kawamichi and Nakamura:2000]. For this reason, our controll group had no growth since the calcium channels were not activated. Thus, the activator caused the amount of calcium in the P. polycephalum to increase which caused the P. polycephalum to contract its muscles and move at a faster pace[Terry:2009]. When analyzing the results of our two-sample t_test, our p_value= 0.0008 which is less than 5%. This shows that our results are statistically significent and there was a significent difference between the results of out of controll group and the results of our test group. When analyzing our controll groups, we saw that controll group 1 showed growth. This could be due to human error, specifically the placement of the food which could have moved since none of the other controll groups showed any growth. If i were t repeat this experiment I would alter the concentration of A23187 and complete more trials to see who this would alter cytoplasmic streaming and to receive more accurate results.
