Title: Calcium blocker doesn’t affect the twitch threshold in the Rana Pipiens by inhibiting the reuptake of calcium

Abstract:
A muscle contraction works when a nervous system signal reaches a neuromuscular junction, a chemical is released by a motor neuron. Acetylcholine is then released and binds to receptors which then opens of sodium channels that gradually allow an action potential to be formed. The action potential spreads throughout the whole muscle fiber and goes into the T-Tubule which release calcium. Calcium plays a significant role in muscle contraction, as they bind to troponin then causing tropomyosin to go from the actin filament to the myosin heads and allows it to bind therefore producing a contraction. This being said, I decided to observe the Rana Pipiens species due to the fact it has a simplistic muscular structure that allows one to examine the functioning of a muscle contraction . An experiment was established in order to test the hypothesis that a calcium blocker (lanthanum chloride) would increase the twitch threshold in the gastrocnemius muscle of a leg in the Rana Pipiens. Four legs were given pulses through stimuli and then injected with lanthanum chloride.  After the results and measurements were collected in the same day, my group noticed there was no difficulty of achieving threshold with calcium blockers being injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. This being said my p-va

Introduction:
The Rana Pipiens, commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog, are a type of amphibian which has a muscular system much similar to that of the human body. The Rana Pipien, a type of frog, is an amphibian that can be found in parts of Canada and the United States.  The skeletal muscle found in these vertebrae contain thousands of myofibers, which are cylindrical fused aggregates of cells [Johnson: 2018]. Each myofiber is bound by connective tissue in order to form functional group, which are the skeletal muscles proper [Johnson:2018]. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose cell bodies are located in the spinal cord [Johnson: 2018]. The axons of the motor neurons then go into the muscle then spread out to innervate other individual myofibers, or neuromuscular junctions.  Action potentials arrive at the neuromuscular junction triggering the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal. The acetylcholine then binds to an acetylcholine receptor on the membrane of a muscle fiber, which then opens sodium Na+ channels that produce an action potential. The action potential spreads throughout the whole fiber, goes into the T Tubule which triggers the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Released calcium diffuses in sarcoplasm, and activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. A study performed by J A Sanchez and E Stefani included a similar experiment that will be performed with the frog legs. They blocked potassium currents with tetraethylammonium and replaced chloride ions with sulphate. A slow inward current was detected, these slow inward currents were mainly carried by calcium therefore yielding a possibility of calcium participating in contraction during a twitch during long depolarizations [ Sanchez & Stefani: 1978]. With the previously stated information, my hypothesis is that by using the calcium blocker [ 1mM lanthanum chloride], the twitch threshold of the frog leg will increase.


Materials and Methods:
My group received four frog legs from the Rana Pipiens. First, we removed and disposed of the skin from the leg. Next, we pulled and exposed the sciatic nerve, then pulled the Sartorius and gastrocnemius muscle from the frog leg and attached it with string to tie onto a contraption at a 90-degree level. After the muscle has been tied, we then attached the sciatic nerve to a stimulator which was connected to the Iworx electrophysiological record, look at Figures 1 and 2 in order to get a better visual representation on how the experiment was set up.  Each frog leg was then shocked at different amplitudes in order to find the threshold for muscle contraction. After threshold was reached, we then injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 1mM lanthanum chloride and waited approximately 10 minutes before stimulating the sciatic nerve with pulses again. Afterwards I collected the data and placed it into charts.  I used a paired t-test in order to compare and observe the results of the different twitch thresholds.


Results:
The results of the various twitch thresholds reached from the legs of the Rana Pipiens before and after injection can be located in Figure 3. The average for the control group of frog legs was .19V with the average of the treatment being .14V.  The average difference between the control and experimental group is -0.05V with N=4 with the degrees of freedom being 3. The t-value is at .827606 with the p-value being at .468582. This is not statistically significant due to the fact the p value is greater than .05.


Discussion:
The following results do not support my hypothesis regarding that calcium channel blockers will decrease the twitch threshold of the frog leg. The p-value is at .868556, which means I fail to reject my null hypothesis and I cannot accept my alternative hypothesis.  The explanation for such a high p value can be due to the fact when stimulating   any muscle repeatedly for a long duration of time can cause fatigue which then can also make the twitch threshold of the frog much lower, especially if we inject with a calcium blocker such as lanthanum chloride. A study performed by C.P. Bianchi reaffirms the effect calcium has on the contraction of the muscle with his experiment of the effect of caffeine on radiocalcium movement in frog Sartorius [ Bianchi: 1961]. Caffeine works as a calcium blocker which then makes the skeletal muscle of the frog leg constantly contract which therefore proves my hypothesis to be false [ Weiss: 1970]. I believe the next logical step for my study on the effects of calcium on the muscle on even bigger organisms, since it would give researches a better idea, or model of how the muscles are utilized within the human body. It also helps to repeat this experiment more times with different blockers besides calcium to get a better understanding on how muscle contraction is effected by different chemicals. I think it would be very interesting to do a similar experiment on a large to medium animal such as a chimpanzee since they are known to have such a similarity in DNA as well as other characteristics (utilization of various muscles to perform tasks such as smiling).

Figure Legends: 
Figure Legends: Figure 1 shows the set-up of frog leg Figure 2 shows the contraption Figure 3 represent the different twitch thresholds reached from four different frog legs before and after being injected with lanthanum chloride. The error bars shown above represent the variability of data and are used on these graphs to indicate the uncertainty in this report measurement. They give a general idea of how precise my measurements were. The trend of the graph shows that the control group (frog legs not injected with lanthanum chloride) had a greater twitch threshold compared to the treatment group of frog legs (legs injected with the lanthanum chloride). The statistical results for the represented data show an average for the control group of frog legs was .19V with the average of the treatment being .14V. The average difference between the two groups are -0.05V, with degrees of freedom being at 3, a t-value of 8.27606, and a P-value at .468582 so there is no statistical difference.
