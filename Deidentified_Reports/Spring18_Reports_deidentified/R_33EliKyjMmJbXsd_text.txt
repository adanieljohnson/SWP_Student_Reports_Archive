Title: How Lidocaine Affects the Threshold of Contraction in a Frog Leg 

Abstract:
This study’s main objective was to determine if lidocaine affects the threshold of contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg. As a sodium channel blocker, lidocaine delays the depolarization of the postsynaptic cell, which therefore delays the contraction of the muscle. The alternate hypothesis is that if the Lidocaine is injected into the frog leg, then the threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle will increase. After two frog legs’ thresholds were measured as the control, 0.1 L of 25 M lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. After five minutes passed, the threshold was measured on both legs. The experiment was then replicated six more times. The two-sample t-test was applied to the average of the eight experiments of the control and the treatment thresholds. There was a statistical difference between the average control threshold and the average treatment threshold, so the alternate hypothesis was accepted. Therefore, it was found that lidocaine increases the threshold because a greater stimulation is needed to overcome the delay in contraction. 

Introduction:
Muscle contraction is stimulated by excitation-contraction coupling (Ebashi, 1968). An action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction and releases acetylcholine (Ach) from the presynaptic nerve terminal (Ebashi, 1968). Ach binds with its receptors on the muscle and opens sodium channels that create an action potential (Ebashi, 1968). The sarcoplasmic reticulum then releases calcium that causes the muscle to contract (Ebashi, 1968). When the sarcoplasmic reticulum re-uptakes the calcium, the muscle relaxes (Ebashi, 1968). A muscle’s threshold is the lowest level of stimulation that is required to make the muscle contract (Ebashi, 1968). Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker that is used as an anesthetic. By blocking the sodium channels, the action potential in the postsynaptic cell does not occur, which delays contraction of the muscle (Kai, 1993). The objective of this lab is to discover if the injection of lidocaine will affect the threshold. Will the injected lidocaine affect the threshold of contraction? The independent variable is the amount of lidocaine and the dependent variable is the threshold. The Biological Null hypothesis is if the lidocaine is injected in the leg, then the threshold of contraction will not be affected. The Biological Alternate hypothesis is if the lidocaine is injected into the frog leg, then the threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle will increase. 

Materials and Methods:
First, two separate frog legs were prepared for contraction analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle. This was measured by using a specialized displacement transducer and a high voltage stimulus insulator which stimulated the muscle using the sciatic nerve. The threshold of contraction of the first control leg was measured using the Iworx software three times. Then, the leg was injected with 0.1 L of 25 M lidocaine using a syringe. Five minutes passed before measuring the contraction again to allow the lidocaine to work in the muscle. Then, the threshold was measured three times. This whole process was repeated for the second frog leg. The experiment was then replicated six more times. The two-sample t-test was applied to the average of the eight replications of the control threshold and the average of the eight replications of the treatment thresholds. 

Results:
As observed in Figure 1, the frog legs injected with lidocaine had a higher average threshold than the frog legs without lidocaine. The mean of the control group was statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.818, df = 14, P = 0.0137). The two-sample t-test was applied to the average of the eight replications of the control threshold and the average of the right replications of the treatment thresholds. The standard error bars did not overlap, which is evidence to there being a statistical significance. Because there was a statistical significance, the null hypothesis was rejected while the alternate hypothesis was accepted. 

Discussion:
In an experiment done about Lidocaine as a sodium channel block as an antiarrhythmic mechanism, the lidocaine was used to treat ventricular premature depolarizations which were caused by cardiac disease (Bean, 1983). This showed that lidocaine had the strength to delay the contraction of a heart as a powerful sodium blocker. Therefore, in the frog leg experiment, lidocaine delayed the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle, which in turn affected the amount of voltage needed to stimulate contraction. As seen in Figure 1 and in the results, the frog leg injected with lidocaine had a higher average threshold of contraction as the alternate hypothesis predicted. Because the lidocaine blocks the sodium channels, which in turn delays the depolarization of the post synaptic cell and therefore delays the contraction itself, a higher voltage of stimulation was needed to overcome the delay of depolarization (Hong, 1994). This minimum amount of voltage needed to cause contraction despite lidocaine sends the action potential necessary to cause the sodium gates to open, depolarize the post synaptic cell, and release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to cause the muscle to contract. It can be inferred that lidocaine is then an affective anesthetic in relaxing and halting the contraction of muscles because a higher threshold is needed to cause contractions. If other researchers were to conduct a similar experiment, an improved version of this experiment would include the need to conduct more in-depth research of the time needed for lidocaine to work in the muscle after injection, so the most accurate threshold of the muscle possible is measured in each experiment.
