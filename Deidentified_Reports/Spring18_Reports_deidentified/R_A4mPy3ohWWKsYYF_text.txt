Title: Effects of A23187 and sodium butyrate on cytoplasmic streaming on the Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
The Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium and is most commonly used to study cell-level processes without the use of a microscope. This lab focuses on cytoplasmic streaming that Physarum polycephalum exhibits and the role that Ca2+ plays in the signaling pathways associated with it. A23187, a Ca2+ activator, and sodium butyrate, a Ca2+ inhibitor, will be used to study the role Ca2+ plays in the signaling pathways. It is hypothesized that in the presence of A23187 cytoplasmic streaming will increase and in the presence of sodium butyrate cytoplasmic streaming will decrease. Using water agar plates that have been treated with A23187 and sodium butyrate, the Physarum polycephalum was allowed to grow in each treatment agar plate as well as a control plate. It was found that only the treatment group of A23187 yielded significant results while the sodium butyrate treatment group did not. The data collected did not support the original hypothesis. The data collected from this experiment suggests that Ca2+ does not play an important role in cytoplasmic streaming. This may be due to a procedural error in which the Physarum polycephalum was not completely exposed to sodium butyrate. Future experiments may benefit from using different mediums to grow the Physarum polycephalum.

Introduction:
The Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium which means it is a mass that contains multiple nuclei that is contained in a single plasma membrane [Johnson AD 2016]. What Physarum polycephalum is most commonly used for is studying cell-level processes without the use of a microscope [Johnson AD 2016]. 

	Physarum polycephalum is a multicellular plasmodium so long as it remains in the dark with high humidity [Johnson AD 2016]. It spends most of its time looking for food but, if there is no food or if there is light then it starts its reproductive cycle [Takamatsu A et. al. 2009]. However, a plasmodium Physarum polycephalum exhibits complex behavior such as cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis, chemotaxis and structural reorganization [Takamatsu A et. al. 2009]. This lab will focus on cytoplasmic streaming that the Physarum polycephalum exhibits. Cytoplasmic streaming is the cytoplasm inside the thin strands flowing bidirectionally [Johnson AD]. The direction changes frequently, which suggests there is a signaling mechanism that controls flow reversal [Kamiya N. 1981]. Since the Physarum polycephalum organism is such a good model for studying cell-level processes without the use a microscope and it exhibits cytoplasmic streaming as a plasmodium it will be the perfect organism to study cytoplasmic streaming and its signaling pathways.

In a recent study, it was found that Ca2+ propagates in a wave like form during cytoplasmic streaming [Yoshiyama S et. al.]. This means that Ca2+ plays a role in the signaling process during cytoplasmic streaming most likely as a second messenger since it usually is a second messenger in most cells [Johnson AD 2016]. However, how important is Ca2+ in the signaling pathways of cytoplasmic streaming and can cytoplasmic streaming occur when Ca2+ levels are decreased or increased?
	
	To clearly see the role Ca2+ plays in cytoplasmic streaming in the Physarum polycephalum an activator and an inhibitor of Ca2+ will be exposed to the Physarum polycephalum to study how cytoplasmic streaming will be effected with a decrease or increase of Ca2+. A recent study suggests that the chemical A23187 increased tension strength generation in the permealized plasmodial strand of physarum [Yoshimoto Y et. al. 1981] which means that it can act as an activator of Ca2+. Another study suggests that sodium butyrate can act as an inhibitor of Ca2+ in the Pysarum polycephalum because of the effects that it has on mitosis and growth [Jalouzot R, Toublan B.1981]. For these reason A23187 and sodium butyrate will both be used to activate and inhibit Ca2+ respectively in the Physarum polycephalum model organism. It is hypothesized that in the presence of A23187 cytoplasmic streaming will increase and in the presence of sodium butyrate cytoplasmic streaming will decrease. 


Materials and Methods:
This experiment requires nine water agar plates three of which will be treated with A23187, another three with sodium butyrate and the last three will act as a control and nothing will be added to the plates.

	The solutions of A23817 and sodium butyrate were prepared using 1-mL of the corresponding concentrated solution that was then diluted with 19-mL of distilled water. 5-mL of the resulting diluted solution was used to treat each of the treatment plates. 

	Once the water agar plates had been treated with the corresponding solutions and dried for ten minutes, a 1x1-cm cube was cut out of each plate using sterilized spatulas and forceps. Once cubes had been extracted from all nine plates, a stock plate containing the Physarum polycephalum was then cut into 1x1-cm cubes using sterilized spatulas. Once enough 1x1-cm cubes of the stock Physarum polycephalum had been cut, one cube was transferred to each of the nine water agar plates using sterilized forceps. Oatmeal flakes was then placed on the parameter of each plate to ensure movement of the Physarum polycephalum.
	
	Each plate was then wrapped in aluminum foil to ensure complete darkness, labeled and placed in an incubator for eighteen hours. After eighteen hours had passed, each plate was taken and observed under an inverted phase microscope. For each plate, three strands were observed and measured for the time in seconds it took for the cytoplasm to change direction and then back to its original direction. Three time trials were taken for each strand.

Both treatment groups were analyzed and compared to the data collected from the control group and a two-sample t-test was used to determine if there was a significant change in cytoplasmic streaming. 

Results:
The A23187 treatment group yielded a significant increase in cytoplasmic streaming when compared to the control group (t-value = 2.1, p-value = 0.03, df = 52). 

	The sodium butyrate treatment group however did not yield any significant results when compared to the control group.

Figure 1 presents the data collected from this experiment.


Discussion:
The null hypothesis that in the presence of A23187 or sodium butyrate will have no effect on cytoplasmic streaming in the Physarum polycephalum cannot be rejected.

	The A23187 treatment group was the only treatment group in the experiment to yield significant results. This alone however is not enough to support the original hypothesis. The purpose of this experiment was to find the importance that Ca2+ plays in the signaling pathways of cytoplasmic streaming. To support our original hypothesis, that is find that Ca2+ does indeed play a big role in the signaling pathways, both treatments would have to yield significant data. However, only A23187, the Ca2+ activator, yielded significant results while the inhibitor, sodium butyrate did not. This data only suggests that with higher levels of Ca2+ does in fact increase cytoplasmic streaming but the conclusion that Ca2+ does play an important role in the signaling pathways cannot not be made without significant data for the inhibitor, sodium butyrate. Therefore, the alternative hypothesis that in the presence of A23187 cytoplasmic streaming will increase and in the presence of sodium butyrate cytoplasmic streaming will decrease has to be rejected.
	
	Sodium butyrate did not yield significant results and this may be due to Ca2+ not playing such an important role in the cytoplasmic streaming. However, other studies have shown that Ca2+ is released during cytoplasmic suggesting that it does indeed play a role in the signaling pathways [Yoshiyama S et. al]. Perhaps there was a procedural error in which the sodium butyrate was not completely exposed to the Physarum polycephalum due to the water agar plates used. If this experiment was to be done again, it may benefit from using a different medium that ensures each chemical is properly exposed to the Physarum polycephalum.

	It is important that further research is done with the Physarum polycephalum because it such a good model to study cell-level processes. Further studies can be done using different mediums to grow the Physarum polycephalum. This experiment utilized water agar plates but other mediums can be used to grow the organism. One experiment used vivo and in vitro mediums when growing Phyarsum polycephalum to study microtubules growth [Quinan RA et. al. 1981]. Perhaps this experiment might benefit from a different procedure that utilizes a different medium that would ensure that the Physarum polycephalum is properly expose to each treatment chemical.
