Title: Effect of Salt on the Root to Shoot Weight and Length Ratio of Oat Plants 

Abstract:
Plants can change the way they allocate resources internally based on different environmental factors that they come across.  I hypothesize that plants subjected to salt will have a smaller to shoot weight and length ratio than our controll plants not exposed to salt.  For this experiment, we selected oat plants in order to determine the effect of salt water on the oat plants. Our one-tailed t_test for the root to shoot ratio showed that there was a significent difference between the groups for the root to shoot length ratio (t_stat = 2.01, d.f. = 8, p = 0.039).  The one-tailed t_test for the root to shoot weight ratio showed no significent difference between the two groups.  My hypothesis was that that plants subjected to salt will have a smaller to shoot weight and length ratio than our controll plants not exposed to salt.  Part of my hypothesis was correct but part of my hypothesis was incorrect.  There was in fact a significent smaller difference between the experimental and controll root to shoot length ratio which means that this part of my hypothesis was correct.  However, I also believed that there would be a significent smaller ratio of root to shoot weights but this was not true according to the t_test that was carried out.
	


Introduction:
Plants can change the way they allocate resources internally based on different environmental factors that they come across.  Salinity is a major environmental factor that can limit plant growth and productivity (Allakhverdiev et all: 2000).  Biochemical pathways leading to products and process that improve salt tolerance most likely act additively and synergistically (Iyengar and Reddy: 1996).  There are five different biochemical strategies that plants employ in order to tolerate salt.  The first is the selective accumulation or expulsion of salt ions (Parida and Das: 2005).  The second is the controll of ion uptake by the roots and transport into the leaves of the plant.  (Parida and Das: 2005).  The third is the compartmentalization of ions at the cellular level or whole plant level (Parida and Das: 2005).   The fourth is the synthesis of compatible solutes and the final is the changes in photosynthetic pathways (Parida and Das: 2005).    
I hypothesize that plants subjected to salt will have a smaller to shoot weight and length ratio than our controll plants not exposed to salt.  This experiment is relevant because it can play a major role in areas near the ocean in which salt is present in the soil and in the environment.  In addition, the experiment is also relevant in cold areas where it snows due to the salting of the roads to prevent the accumulation of ice.  

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we selected oat plants in order to determine the effect of salt water on the oat plants.  We began the experiment by placing oat seeds into four different pots with soil in them.  We added 50 milliliters of Miracle Gro into each of the four pots to help the plants grow.  We then placed labelled which of the two plants would be watered with salt water and the two that would be watered with normal water.  The plants were then placed in the greenhouse of Winston Hall.  Daily, the plants labelled salt water were watered with 1.3g/L salt water.  The plants labelled normal water were watered with regular tap water.  The watering of the plants was repeated for fourteen days in order for the oat seeds to grow.  After the two weeks were complete and growth occurred, we pulled five replicates from the salt water group and five replicates from the normal water group.  We weighted each individual strand and recorded the data.  We then separated the root from the shoot at the seed and weighted each section individually.  We then measured the length of the two different parts.  The root to shoot weight and length ratios were then calculated using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the averages were calculated for the root to shoot weight and root to shoot length ratios.  Statistical tests used for interpreting the data included a one-tailed, two sample t_test in addition to the mean and standard deviation.


Results:
The mean and standard deviation for the experimental root to shoot weight ratio was 0.38  0.13.  The mean and standard deviation for the experimental root to shoot length ratio was 0.86  0.13.  The mean and standard deviation for the controll root to shoot weight ratio was 0.43  0.09.  The mean and standard deviation for the controll root to shoot length ratio was 1.10  0.24.  The controll group had a greater average root to shoot length and weight ratios than that of the experimental group.  Figures 1 and 2 show the average ratios and standard deviations with figure 1 showing the weight ratio and figure 2 showing the length ratio.  Our one-tailed t_test for the root to shoot ratio showed that there was a significent difference between the groups for the root to shoot length ratio (t_stat = 2.01, d.f. = 8, p = 0.039).  The one-tailed t_test for the root to shoot weight ratio showed no significent difference between the two groups.  


Discussion:
As seen through the results presented in the results section, the t_test showed a significent difference between root to shoot length ratio but the results were not significent for root to shoot weight ratios.  My hypothesis was that that plants subjected to salt will have a smaller to shoot weight and length ratio than our controll plants not exposed to salt.  Part of my hypothesis was correct but part of my hypothesis was incorrect.  There was in fact a significent smaller difference between the experimental and controll root to shoot length ratio which means that this part of my hypothesis was correct.  However, I also believed that there would be a significent smaller ratio of root to shoot weights but this was not true according to the t_test that was carried out.  Biologically, these results can be explained by the second way that plants deal with salt in the environment in that the plants were able to controll of ion uptake by the roots and transport into the leaves of the plant  (Parida and Das: 2005).  This could cause the smaller ratios that were seen in both the root to shoot weight and length ratios.  The salt was able to retard and have an impact on the growth of the plants as Parida and Das laid out in their experiment.  The ability of plants to tolerate salt in the environment can be determined by multiple biochemical pathways that facilitate allow for the uptake of water, protect chloroplasts, and maintain ion homeostasis (Parida and Das: 2005).  There were no particular errors that occurred in this experiment however one error that could have occurred was not watering the plants enough through the two weeks which would lead to the plants not being able to grow enough in order to gather data.  As far as the bigger picture and future implications for this experiment, one item of note shows that plants are not able to grow as well as seen through the average ratios when salt is present in the environment which would impact plants near the beach or on the side of roads where it snows.
