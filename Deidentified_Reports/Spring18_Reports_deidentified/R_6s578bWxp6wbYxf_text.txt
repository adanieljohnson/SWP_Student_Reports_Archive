Title: The Effects of Martin’s IGR on Manduca Sexta Experiment

Abstract:
The main objective of this study is to view the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. The experiment will be performed by separating eight caterpillars into two groups of four, with one receiving a basic diet while the other is being fed that same diet except with six drops of Martin’s IGR. It was expected that the Martin’s IGR would make the caterpillars grow more in a shorter amount of time compared to the controll group due to the Juvenile Hormone deficiency.

Introduction:
The purpose of the lab was to observe the effects of Martin’s IGR on the growth of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. Martin’s IGR is an insect growth regulator that functions by blocking the production of Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the caterpillar(Nottingham 1985). It is a hormone essential for the growth and pupation of caterpillars. The life cycle of caterpillars depends on the different ratios of JH and Ecdysterone (20E), which is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting. A caterpillar must go through the commitment pulse before it can pupate and turn into an adult, which is signaled by a large drop in JH and an increase in Ecdysterone (20E). By blocking the production of JH in the caterpillars, Martin’s IGR causes the caterpillars to enter the commitment pulse earlier, which, in turn, makes the process of becoming adults faster. We believe that the caterpillars with the Martin’s IGR drops in their food will grow more in length and in weight than the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
We were provided eight larval stage Manduca Sexta caterpillar for the lab. We also separated the caterpillars into two groups of four and were provided 10 g of a pre-made solution to feed them every day for a week. We gathered the caterpillars and placed them into plastic tupperwares, two per tupperware, and divided them with a flashcard. The four caterpillars of the controll group were fed a basic diet, while the experimental group of four were given the same food except with six drops of Martin’s IGR added to it. The food was prepared by weighing the 10 g of food per caterpillar and then adding the treatment to the food. Each caterpillar was weighed in grams and measured in centimeters at the start and every single day throughout the week to track their growth until the final day. We also took pictures of the caterpillars at the beginning of the experiment, as well as the end of the experiment to compared size and color. 

Results:
Some observations we made include the controll group caterpillars, as the week went on, turned a bright green with a red tail. This differs compared to the experimental group who, as the week went on, became a lighter teal color and their tail faded slightly to a pinkish color. There were also days where the caterpillars displayed much more movement and energy. For example, the second day of the experiment the caterpillars displayed minimal movement and even lost weight, but towards the middle of the week when their growth increased substantially they were much more active. The table above represents the average difference in the mass of the caterpillars in both the controll and the experimental group. The average value we obtained for the controll group caterpillars was 8.4675 g and the experimental group weighed 8.26 g. We also received a standard deviation of 0.262345192 for the controll group, along with a value of 0.609644705 standard deviation for the experimental group. The p_value we obtained for these averages was 0.592543, which means that these results are not statistically significent. This value also means that it is about 59% possible these results could be obtained by chance. The table above represents the average difference in the length of the caterpillars in both the controll and the experimental group. The average value we obtained for the controll group caterpillars was 3.3 cm and the experimental group measured at about 3.845. We also received a standard deviation of 0.21602469 for the controll group, along with a value of 0.267145404 standard deviation for the experimental group. The p_value we obtained for these averages was 0.019254, which means the results are statistically significent meaning that only 1% of the time you would obtain these values by chance.

Discussion:
According to our results, the average length difference between both groups is statistically significent, while the average mass difference is not. According to our averages, the controll group grew more in the mass category than did the experimental group, but the experimental group was longer than the controll group. Possible errors made during the lab include one day accidentally measuring the caterpillars in inches instead of centimeters which could throw off the accuracy of our data by a few decimal places. If I were to repeat this procedure, I would definitely modify it by making it span over two weeks to obtain more data point, as well as make more observations. I would also attempt to obtain more caterpillars to study along with increasing the variety of diets amongst multiple groups.
