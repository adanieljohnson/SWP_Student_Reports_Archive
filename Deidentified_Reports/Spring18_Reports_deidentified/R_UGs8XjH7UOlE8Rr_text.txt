Title: Resource allocation in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum)

Abstract:
In this study we are studying radishes, Raphanus raphanistrum, and the effect that different colored light has on their root: shoot length. We predict that for the plants exposed to the green light the root: shoot length will be smaller than that of the plants grown under natural light. To do this we covered the treatment group with a green plastic and the controll with a clear plastic covering. We watered them every day and then at the end of the two weeks we measured the root: shoot length. We found that our hypothesis was in fact supported due to the fact that the treatment group truly did have a smaller root: shoot length than their controll counterparts. This means that the treatment group allocated more resources to growing the shoot than the roots in comparison to the controll group.

Introduction:
In this experiment we will be using radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum). Radishes are a good organism to use because their seedlings germinate and grow relatively quickly allowing for us to get reasonable measurements. [Smith: 2008] Furthermore, they are big enough to the point that they are convenient to study and we only need to measure a few plants as oppose to many small plants to compensate for the slower development and size limitations of other potential organisms we could have used. [Smith: 2008] In this study we will be researching how the color of light affects the root: shoot ratio and resource allocation of the radish in order to simulate how living in the rainforest canopy as oppose to the understory of the rainforest. Plants do not absorb green light but rather absorb mainly red and blue light but not the green part of the color spectrum leading to chlorophyll reflecting green. [Smith: 2008] This gives plant leaves the color green. [Smith:2008] The plants will then use the light to help power the light dependent aspect of photosynthesis and eventually lead to vital glucose synthesis. [Smith: 2008] To simulate the plants growing in the canopy we will be using a clear plastic to cover the plants and for the plants in the under story we will be using a green plastic to cover the radishes. We predict that for the plants in the under story exposed to green light the root: shoot ratio will be smaller than the root: shoot ratio of the plants in the canopy exposed to normal light.

Materials and Method:
Firstly, attain six pots of radish seedlings. Use vermiculite as soil and 50 Ml. of miracle grow as fertilizer for the pots. For three of these pots put a clear plastic over them, this will be the controll group, and then for the other three put a green plastic over them. Then move both of these trays into a green house and every day for two weeks water them. At the end of two weeks measure the shoot length, root length, shoot weight, and root weight of nine plants per group. Using this calculate the root: shoot ratio and determine the resource allocation of each plant. Use a 2-sample t_test to compare the results and test for significance.

Results:
In the three trials, which were represented by the three pots for each group, the treatment group had a lower root: shoot length every time. When looking at the average overall of each group, the root: shoot length was once again higher in the controll and the root: shoot weight was also higher in the controll group in comparison with the treatment group. For our 2-sample t_test we had a t-value of 3.75 and a p_value of 0.019952 at four degrees of freedom which means the means of our controll group were significently different from the mean of the experimental group since the p_value was below 0.05.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported as the controll group, which was the plants exposed to normal light with the clear plastic on to simulate the canopy, had a higher root: shoot length than the treatment group, which was the plants exposed to green light with the green plastic on to simulate the understory. This is shown through graph 1 in which because the treatment group had a lower root: shoot length than the controll group it means that the treatment is allocating more resources to the shoot than to the root. This is because that plants in the understory had a much more difficult time getting the resource of light, which is the responsibility of the stem, because being in the understory the plant is covered by many trees in the upper levels of the rainforest so it is very difficult for it to get light. [Bennet: 2012] [Offord: 2014] To compensate for this the plants in the understory must allocate more resources to their stem to grow them longer so they have a better chance of getting sunlight for photosynthesis and therefore survival. [Bennet: 2012] They do not have to allocate as much to roots because they are the closest to the soil and do not have as much competition for nutrients from there relative to the competition for sunlight. [Offord: 2014] This is the opposite for plants in the controll group which were simulated to be in the canopy. In the canopy plants do not have as much competition to get sunlight and therefore do not have to allocate a lot of resources to grow the shoot since they can get sunlight so readily. [Offord: 2014] Therefore, they grow their roots longer and use their resources to do that leading to a longer root: shoot ratio. [Bennet: 2012] Some potential sources of error in our experiment is that we might have not completely covered the treatment group with the green plastic or it may have fallen of a little bit exposing it slightly to natural light altering the ratio slightly. Furthermore, we could have put more water in one of the groups than the other because we simply watered them until it dripped from the bottom leading to slightly skewed measurements. Some other studies that we can conduct in the future regarding this study is we could test how different colors, other than the ones we tested, alter the root: shoot ratio or we could test how altering moisture, since it is much more moist in the understory than in the canopy, effects the resource allocation in radishes.

Table 1: This data table reports the average root: shoot length, the average root: shoot weight and the standard deviations for both of these. The controll was greater in terms of the average root: shoot weight and length. 
Graph 1: This graph is representative of the averages of the controll group and the treatment group. Control represents the plant pots which were covered in clear plastic while the experimental represents the treatment plants which were covered in green plastic. The controll was greater in terms of the root: shoot length than its treatment counterpart. The controll group`s average ratio was about 1.3 and the treatment was about 1.1. The standard deviation between the two groups was +/- 0.127.
