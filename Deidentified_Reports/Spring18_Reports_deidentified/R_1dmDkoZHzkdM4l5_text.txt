Title: The effect of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin on PKA activity in Physarum 

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin on protein kinase A activity in Physarum through chemotaxis. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity affects the behavior of Physarum to the initial stimulus. If Physarum is exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP, an activator of PKA, it will cause an increase in positive chemotaxis while Physarum exposed to curcumin will result in an increase in negative chemotaxis. This was measured by placing Physarum in three different agar plates (no chemical, saturated with dibutyryl-cAMP, or curcumin) with oat flakes next to the organism. All of the plates with dibutyryl-cAMP showed positive chemotaxis while all of the plates exposed to curcumin showed negative chemotaxis. The hypothesis is partially supported as the dibutyryl-cAMP significantly increased PKA activity while the curcumin did not, which is supported by a two-sample t-test. A possible explanation of the statistically insignificant results of the curcumin is the size and structure of the molecule. To expand upon this lab, different dilutions of each chemical could be tested to see how the specific concentration affects chemotaxis in Physarum.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium that undergoes mass mitosis. Physarum use many of the same signal transduction pathways as human cells, but it easier to grow, handle, and observe physarum. Physarum allows the observation of several cell-level processes, like chemotaxis, without the use of a microscope. Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to a chemical stimulus. Physarum undergo two types of chemotaxis, positive and negative. Positive chemotaxis would cause the organism to respond to the chemical stimulus by crawling toward the source while the opposite would occur for negative chemotaxis (Johnson, 2018). In order to sense and respond to its environment, Physarum relies on signal transduction pathways. One of the major transduction pathways it uses is the cAMP mediated pathway. This is a G-protein coupled pathway relies on the activation of the second messenger cAMP through the activation of a G-protein. cAMP then activates an enzyme called protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates several different enzymes, which can lead to varying inhibition or activation depending on the specific enzyme. PKA and the other proteins it activates is what determines the behavior of the organism to the initial external or internal stimulus (Johnson, 2018). There are many chemicals that can alter various key factors in this pathway. For this experiment, the effect of dibutyrl-cAMP and curcumin on PKA was tested. Dibutyryl-cAMP is a chemical that activates PKA while curcumin inhibits PKA. In a study conducted by Derlacz and colleagues, the effect of protein kinase ck2 on plasmodia of Physarum was tested (Derlacz et al., 1998). They found that dibutyryl-cAMP elevated the activity of PKA by 4-5 units compared to the control after four hours. In a different study the effects of the effects of curcumin on cell cycle inhibition in Physarum was observed (Rajan et al., 2013). It was found that the curcumin extract inhibited cell cycle and cell motility the most out of the other chemicals: soxhletted chloroform, acetone and aqueous extracts (Rajan et al., 2013). From the information about the cAMP pathway and the experimental results, we hypothesized that exposure of the physarum to the activator, dibutyryl-cAMP, will increase the PKA activity causing the sample to grow towards the food source, while exposure to the inhibitor, curcumin, will inhibit PKA activity causing the sample to grow away from the food.

Materials and Methods:
Physarum was prepared at growth medium prior to the start of this experiment (refer to as stock). A total of three petri dishes were used for control and six for treatment (3 for dibutyryl-cAMP and 3 for curcumin). The control and treatment groups were prepared following the guideline of Figure 1. Once the blocks for food and stock were added each plate was taped, covered with aluminum foil and placed in an incubator for a period of 24 hours. The amount/direction of growth (mm) and was recorded and tested using a two-sample t-test with a critical value of p = 0.05 to determine significance. 

Results:
After running a two-sample t-test, the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP showed a statistically significant increase in growth toward food (t-stat =4.8346, df = 4, p = 0.0084). However, in the plates exposed to curcumin, there was not a statistically significant decrease in growth away food (t-stat = 0.9064, df= 4, p = 0.1293). In all of the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP the physarum showed positive chemotaxis, while all of the plates exposed to curcumin the Physarum showed negative chemotaxis. A difference between the two treatments is the standard deviations. In the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP there was a low standard deviation of 2.52 while in the plates exposed to curcumin there was a standard deviation of 10.69 (see Figure 1). The lower standard deviation indicates that there was less variability in the amount of growth between each of the dibutyryl-cAMP plates compared to the curcumin plates. 

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that Physarum exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP would cause an increase in positive chemotaxis will the Physarum exposed to curcumin would cause an increase in negative chemotaxis. This hypothesis is partially supported, as there was found to be a statistically significant increase in growth toward the food in the plates exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP. The latter part of the hypothesis was not supported as there was not a statistically significant decrease in growth. A possible explanation of the statistically insignificant results of the curcumin is the size and structure. In a previous study by Reddy and Aggarwal, the effect of curcumin was tested on six different protein kinases in tumor cells (Reddy and Aggarwal, 1994). It was found that after being exposed to 0.01 mM curcumin, phosphorylase kinase (PHk )was the only protein kinase that was completely inhibited while other kinases like PKA, which was inhibited by 10%, were only partially inhibited. It was concluded that PHK possibly had the greatest inhibition due to its large size and multiple regulatory units, which could also explain why curcumin did not have a statistically significant decrease on PKA activity in the Physarum (Reddy and Aggarwal, 1994). However, it is important to note that two of the control plates did not show any growth. Not only did two of the control plates not grow, but the one that did exhibit growth grew away from the food source. However, the Physarum could have grown toward food, but since the plates were checked towards the end of time it is difficult to make an accurate conclusion as the previous tracks would have needed to be checked by holding the plates up to the light. It is possible that this issue with the control resulted from improper sterilization of those two plates. To expand upon this lab, different dilutions of each chemical could be tested to see how the specific concentration affects chemotaxis in Physarum. The Physarum could also be grown in different types of mediums, and then compared to the agar medium in this experiment. The Physarum could be grown from different stocks and see how this affects chemotaxis.
