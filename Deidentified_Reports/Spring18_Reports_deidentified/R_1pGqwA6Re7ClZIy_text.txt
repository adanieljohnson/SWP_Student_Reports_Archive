Title: Effects of Tubocurarine on gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs

Abstract:
Muscles contract through conduction of action potentials. For contraction to happen, acetylcholine(ACh) is released and binds to ACh receptors. The binding of ACh causes to depolarization that causes release of calcium ions, which lead to muscle contraction. Our experiment is proposed to test the effects of a typical ACh blocker, Tubocurarine on gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs. We used two frog legs and compared amplitudes of contraction on each leg’s gastrocnemus muscle before and after injection of Tubocurarine. Paired two sample t_test is used to analyze data. The result leads to conclusion that Tubocurarine is effective in reducing amplitude of muscle contractions of frog legs, through blocking ACh receptors. 


Introduction:
Muscle contraction in vertebrates is activated through conduction of action potentials, which are nerve impulses or change in electrical potential on cell membrane. Skeletal muscles of vertebrates and invertebrates are built up by myofibers bound by connective tissues. The skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, which are located in the grey matters of the spinal cord. Action potentials originated in the motor neurons are conducted to the myofibers through axons. An action potential or nerve impulse arrives at the neuromuscular junctions, connecting points of axons and individual myofibers, and triggers release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes influx of sodium ions that generates an action potential. The action potential spreads and causes release calcium ions. The release of calcium ions stimulates contractions of muscle fibers and the muscle shortens. Researchers studied the effects of chemicals that either block or amplify muscle contraction through changing the activities of acetylcholine receptors. D-Tubocurarine paralyzes neuromuscular conduction by making the end-plate less sensitive to the depolarizing action of acetylcholine and thus reduce the muscle’s ability to shorten. In contract, acetylcholine mimic, Decamethonium effectively depolarizes the end plate region and initiates propagated muscle contraction or leads to a neuromuscular block (Paton and  Zaimis 1949).  Our experiment is proposed to test the effect of tubocurarine, a type of acetylcholine blocker, on gastrocnemus muscle of frog leg. We used two frog legs and conducted same experimental steps. We measured the threshold of one frog leg and found its amplitudes under stimulation. Then we injected 0.2 Ml, 1mM tubocurarine into its gastrocnemus muscle and found its amplitudes under same stimulation. We repeated the steps on the other frog leg and gathered data to run a paired t_test to test our hypothesis. Our hypothesis is stated that there will be statistically significent difference between the controll and treatment groups in amplitudes of muscle contraction before and after injection of Tubocurarine.

Materials and Method:
We prepared two frog legs by peeling off the skin and exposing the nerves. After preparation, we suspended one frog leg by its gastrocnemus muscle and connected its nerve with two electrodes. We directly stimulated the nerve and determined its threshold, which equals 0.3V. Then we stimulated the nerve 5 times with voltage of  0.375V, 25% more than the threshold. The purpose was to ensure the muscle is above threshold. We determined and averaged the amplitudes as data of our controll group of leg 1.  We injected 0.2 Ml, 1mM tubocurarine into the gastrocnemus muscle and then waited ten minutes for its effects to happen. We then stimulated the muscle 5 times under the same voltage and recorded and averaged the amplitudes as data of our treatment group of leg 1. We repeated the above steps on the other frog leg and collected a set of data as controll and treatment groups of leg 2. The threshold of leg 2 was 0.25V, and we stimulated the muscle by 0.3125 V. We ran paired two sample t_test to compare difference in amplitudes of muscle contraction before and after injection of Tubocurarine.


Results:
We observed less contraction on gastrocnemus muscle in treatment groups than in controll groups. According to figure 1, amplitude of muscle contraction decreases in both legs after application of  Tubocurarine. According to figure 2, on both frog legs, the values of difference between amplitudes in controll and treatment groups vary within small range. We ran paired two sample t_test on the amplitudes in controll and treatment groups of both frog legs. Our test results in d.f.= 1, t=173. One tail p_value = 0.00184 (p&lt;&lt;0.05) and two tail  p_value= 0.00368(p&lt;&lt;0.05). 


Discussion:
The paired t_test result supports our hypothesis that there is statistically significent difference between amplitudes of muscle contraction before and after injection of Tubocurarine. In other terms, after injection of acetylcholine blocker, Tubocurarine, the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs was less likely to contract. According to previous study,  application of D-Tubocurarine on soleus muscles of cat depresses the cat’s muscle contraction. D-tubocurarine reduces skeletal muscle contraction or increases skeletal muscle relaxation by blocking acetylcholine receptors and preventing conduction of action potentials (Paton and  Zaimis 1949). Muscle contraction is activated through transfer of action potentials, which signify and arouse responses of neurons and muscle cells or myofibers. An action potential arrives at the neuromuscular junctions and triggers release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binds to its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes depolarization. Another action potential is generated and it causes release of calcium ions. The release of calcium ions stimulates contractions of muscle fibers and the muscle contracts. Each step is important in signifying muscles to contract by the brain. When we interrupted action potentials by blocking acetylcholine receptors, impulses stopped and calcium ions were not sufficiently released. Lacking calcium ions made the muscle fail to contract or contract by a less than normal magnitude. In conclusion, our hypothesis is supported that there is significent difference between amplitudes of muscle contraction before and after injection of acetylcholine blocker, Tubocurarine.

Figure 1: Effects of Tubocurarine on gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs. Two frog legs were used to measure their muscle contractions before and after injection of Tubocurarine. The graph shows controll average and treatment average in amplitude of each frog leg. Each bar is presented with standard deviation. Standard deviations of controll group equal +0.014 V(leg 1), +0.0066 V (leg 2). Standard deviations of treatment group equal +0.035 V (leg 1), +0.033 V(leg 2).
