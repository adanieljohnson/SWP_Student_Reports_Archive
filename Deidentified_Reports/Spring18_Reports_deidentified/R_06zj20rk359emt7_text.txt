Title: Effect of AZA Max on Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
This study focuses on the Manduca sexta and hormone level. In decreasing ecdysterone, a hormone affecting the timing of molting in caterpillars, the objective is to determine the effect it has on growth of the caterpillars over the course of a week. By creating two groups, one experimental, on controll, it is easy to compare the two through a two-sample t_test. From the experiment, the data is statistically significent and demonstrates that a lack of 20E is detrimental to the species, and results less growth over a weak span, which concludes that in the early stages of development (as larvae), 20E is necessary and crucial in growth throughout this stage, and furthermore, negatively effects other stages, like the pupal and adult stages. 

Introduction:
	The Manduca sexta have many common names including sphinx moth, hawk moth, tobacco hornworm, and the Carolina sphinx. It is in the order Lepidoptera which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers [Johnson: 2018]. All these species share a similar lifecycle: eggs, larva, pupa, adult [Reinecke: 1980]. The Manduca sexta has these four major life stages and undergoes holometabolous development. The larvae do not look like the adult, as there is major body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis. An advantage of the dramatic change is that larvae and adults do not compete for the same resources. During the pupal stage there is reduced movement as the organism is protected by a cocoon. Adult Manduca sexta develop wings, functional reproductive organs, and sense organs such as compound eyes. The complete life cycle is approximately 37-44 days in a controllled environment. These are under controllled conditions and can fluctuate greater in outdoor conditions. Quality of diet and average daily temperature are two primary factors in the growth of the caterpillar [Johnson: 2018]. Hormones are secreted in plants and animals mainly for growth and development of the organism. Throughout the Manduca sexta life, three hormones influence the development of the caterpillar: prothoracicotropic (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormone (JH). Juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allata and primarily regulates the type of molt. PTTH is produced by the corpus cardiacum. Its main function is to regulate the release of ecdysterone. 20E regulates the timing of molting, secreted by the prothoracic gland. JH and 20E work together in the larvae stage of development in Manduca sexta caterpillars [Johnson: 2018]. These hormonal levels and the weight of the caterpillar determine when the caterpillar will molt into its next larvae stage, according to The Journal of Experimental Biology [Nijhout: 1974]. Therefore, the concentration ratio is crucial during its lifespan. Whilst working together, the hormones controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis. The levels of each hormone must be specific and accurate for each stage in larvae development to occur. Rises and falls in each hormone communicate to the organism when transformations in its life cycle must occur. The most important time in the larvae life is just before pupal formation when there is a small rise in 20E which triggers the commitment pulse. This commitment pulse readies the caterpillar’s body by beginning a series of sequential changes including behavioral, genetic, morphological, and physiological [Rimmer: 1989]. Ultimately, these changes transform the pupa into an adult. In relation to 20E, when injected with 20E, it stimulated molting in the organism because the commitment pulse came earlier in the lifecycle than optimally desired. [Judy: 1970]. Therefore, if injected with ecdysterone blockers, it should do the opposite and inhibit or postpone molting.
	Ultimately, injecting the caterpillar with the hormone and stimulating ecdysterone was detrimental to the organism, as experimented by Judy. However, because inhibition of the hormone contrasts the physical aspect of stimulation regarding when the molting occurs, do the two contrast in optimization? In other words, if a caterpillar is inhibited of ecdysterone, will it be more beneficial to the species as opposed to detrimental? If an aspect of a species is not optimized, it is not being maximally efficient, and therefore has the potential to evolve further and be better fit to survive. Or, if it is not the most efficient method of growth and development, there must be reasons as to why this is the case, which would open the door for further investigation. This question can be asked due to the first case study viewed in lab. From the results, it showed an increase in mass in caterpillars who received a slight increase in juvenile hormone, meaning the natural level of juvenile hormone was not quite optimal [Case Study 2: 2018].
	In correlation with results from previous experiments, it is understood that the increase in ecdysterone causes molting to occur too early in the lifestyle and is detrimental to the growth of Manduca sexta because they become pupa too quickly. To further research if the current hormonal level of ecdysterone in natural Mancuca sexta is optimal, the opposite must be experimented (when referring to the levels of hormone in the controll caterpillars within the lab, the word ‘natural’ will be used as they are not ‘wild’ caterpillars). The lab group tested an inhibition of ecdysterone in Manduca sexta larvae using AZA Max, an inhibitory chemical of ecdysterone. AZA Max is considered an insecticide as it considered a growth disrupter [Veitch: 2007]. It is hypothesized that molting will be inhibited or slowed, and the caterpillars will not be able to grow and develop fully. It is believed that the current output of ecdysterone (controll) is optimal for growth and development.


Materials and Method:
We selected eight caterpillars that had around the same mass, in our case around 1.2 g. We then randoMly split them into two groups of four, one controll the other experimental. We took plastic, see-through containers and split them into two halves with an index card, making sure the lid can be properly secured. This lid must have holes in which the caterpillars can breathe.
	The chemical, AZA Max, which inhibits the ecdysterone hormone, was mixed into the caterpillars’ food. No matter whether controll or experimental, each caterpillar received 10g of food. For the controll, we mixed 7 drops of water per 20g of food measured out. For the experimental, we mixed 7 drops of AZA Max into every 20g of caterpillar food. 
	Every day we took the mass of the caterpillars and changed their food, repeating the mixing of water or AZA Max as depicted above. We cleaned the containers of waste and extra food each day. We repeated this for a week and recorded the masses each day. We used a two-sample t_test to evaluate our results, examining the controll and experimental groups.


Results:
As demonstrated in Figure 1, the average difference in growth for the controll is 8.0675g over the week, and the experimental difference was merely 3.4925g. There is quite a dramatic discrepancy in the average difference in caterpillar mass. The controll group grew on average over twice the amount of the experimental. The exact difference is 4.575g. It is also important to note that the controll group had the largest growth difference in an individual with 11.19g. The data is statistically significent, with a p_value of .002. 

Discussion:
First, it is important to point out that the data is, in fact, statistically significent. Because of this, we have more confidence that the data has correlation. The data implies that a deficiency in ecdysterone is detrimental to growth and development and that a sufficient amount of 20E is necessary for growth and development because ecdysterone regulates mRNA during the larvae instars and furthermore into the development of adults [Riddiford: 2003]. The data supported our hypothesis because the experimental caterpillars did not grow nearly as large as the controll; the controll caterpillars were twice as big. This is useful information whilst determining the optimal ecdysterone level in Manduca sexta because it suggests that a lower level of this hormone is not optimal for survival rates of the caterpillar. Greater levels of ecdysterone compared to natural levels is not desired, as described in Judy’s research. During the larvae stage (specifically the fourth), ecdysterone is levels experience a large increase in the caterpillar, so naturally, a blocker will have great effect on its development, as well [Bollenbacher: 2004]. Because the results from this experiment express a lower level of ecdysterone is not optimal, then the optimal amount is a value in between that of this experiment and Judy’s experiment. There is still a possibility for natural Manduca sexta caterpillars to be at an optimal level with ecdysterone, however this does not necessarily have to be the case, as was shown with juvenile hormone in the case study [Case Study 2: 2018]. An area of potential concern could be the person, him or herself, doing the experimentation. This was not constant throughout the week, as we had different people from the lab group feed and mass the caterpillars. In theory it should all conclude the same, however each person could have different method of doing this which could cause inaccuracies. The experiment should also be repeated multiple times with greater numbers of caterpillars to strengthen results due to the law of large numbers. For future experiments, it would be beneficial to test different volumes of the AZA Max, to determine the levels of ecdysterone in the caterpillars. This would allow for more precise measurements and more accurate discussions whilst concluding the optimal level of ecdysterone for Manduca sexta; whether it is the current natural level or not. Yet, this experiment has led to great strides in this determination. From previous research, it was concluded that more ecdysterone was not optimal, however now it can be suggested that a lower level is not either. As opposed to there being an infinite number of values that the optimal level can be, it is now between two discrete values. The next step is to determine what concentration value is optimal for maximum growth and development in Manduca sexta.
