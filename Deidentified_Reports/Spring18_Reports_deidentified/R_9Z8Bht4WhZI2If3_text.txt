Title: Influence of AzaGuard on Manduca Sexta 4th Instar Larvae Growth and Body Weight Abstract: 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effect of an ecdysterone blocker (AzaGuard) on the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Ecdysterone is an important hormone that triggers molting from larva into pupa. AzaGuard works by lowering the ecdysterone levels in the insect to prevent it from molting. The hypothesis we used was that if the caterpillars ate food treated with AzaGuard, their ecdysterone would be inhibited, they would fail to molt, and would eventually die. We divided the caterpillars into 2 groups: controll and experimental, which had AzaGuard incorporate dinto their diet. They were kept for 7 days and were weighed and measured every day, and then compared them at the end of the 7 days. Once the results were compared, it can be seen that AzaGuard did inhibit their growth because the experimental group barely grew at all while the controll group nearly quadrupled in size. The hypothesis was not completely correct because none of the animals died at the end of the experiment. If the experiment were to be carried out over a longer period of time, the hypothesis may have been proven true. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a pest to farmers in its larval stages as it feeds on the tobacco plants themselves. Manduca sexta has a 39-48 day life cycle divided into four parts: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The hormones controllling the larval stages of the caterpillars are juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone. Prior to the fifth instar, the caterpillars undergo what is known as a commitment pulse, which triggers a drop in the JH levels of the caterpillar and signals to the larva that it is ready to molt and enter the pupal stages of its life. This experiment will work to inhibit ecdysterone. Ecdysterone is a chemical hormone involved with molting, and due to its responsibility in the molting process, it is essential for insect growth. The prothoracic gland, located near the brain of the insect, releases ecdysterone. When a larva has grown and stored enough energy to molt, the prothoracic gland releases high levels of ecdysterone. The commitment pulse mentioned above occurs when the ecdysterone is released and this tells the larva not to molt into another larval instar, but rather to molt into a pupa. Due to Manduca being a pest, farmers often treat their crops with insect growth regulators (IGRs) to inhibit their growth and controll the insect population.(Johnson: 2018) The IGR used in this experiment was AzaGuard, which disrupts the lifecycle of Manduca between its larval and pupal stages by impeding the metabolism of ecdysterone. As mentioned above, ecdysterone is necessary for molting, without which the insect cannot mature into its next growth stage and die. After the consumption of food treated with AzaGuard, the Manduca sexta caterpillars' ecdysterone will be inhibited, they will fail to molt, and they will die.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca caterpillars in the fourth instar were collected and used for this experiment. They were divided into 2 groups: a controll group fed on an AzaGuard free diet, and an experimental group that had AzaGuard supplemented into their diet. The insects were kept in 4 contained with a divider in the middle so as to isolate them from each other. The first two containers housed caterpillars from the controll group, and the other two containers housed caterpillars from the experimental group. Each caterpillar was provided with 10 grams of food, regardless of group. Caterpillars in the controll group each had 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water mixed in so as to hold the food together. Caterpillars in the experimental group each had 10 grams of food with seven drops of AzaGuard mixed into their food. The caterpillars were all stored in an incubator for one week with 12-hour light and dark cycles. They were weighed and measured once a day over the course of the week long period. At the end of the experiment, the caterpillars were taken out of their containers and placed in a bag to be frozen and disposed of. 

Results:
According to the data collected, the average weight and length of the caterpillars in the controll group increased up until day 5, when they ran out of food. The weight and length of the controll group increase at a greatly decreased rate until the fourth day when they began to increase. The controll group ate the food provided to them much faster than the experimental group and the no animals in the experimental group finished their food. Using a 2-tailed T-test for the weight, the average P-value came out to be 0.012. The two-tailed T-test for the length of the caterpillars led to an average P-value of 0.035.

Discussion:
When the caterpillars were exposed to AzaGuard, their life and molting cycles were inhibited, although they did not die as hypothesized. This can be attributed to the possibility that the caterpillars had already experienced their commitment pulse by the time our group selected them. That being said, the insects treated with AzaGuard experienced a greatly diminished rate of growth compared to the controll group. On the 5th day of the experiment, the controll group was almost triple the size of the experimental group. The experimental group was minute in comparison to the controll because of the AzaGuard which prevented the proper release of ecdysterone from the prothoracic gland, which in turn signals to the insect that the time has come to consume large amounts of food to prepare for pupation. The controll group had no AzaGuard, so their ecdysterone was at normal levels, and they continued to grow in both weight and length, strengthening the hypothesis. They grew until day 5, when they ran out of food. This is still significent because the insects in the experimental group still had ample amounts of food left at the conclusion of the experiment. While the section of the hypothesis regarding the diminished weight and molting was true, the section about the death of the insects was not. This could be because the experiment was not run for enough time for the caterpillars to completely react to AzaGuard. Had the experiment been run for another 7 day period, the insects may have died as a result of their exposure, thus proving the hypothesis. In conclusion, it can be seen that the IGR AzaGuard inhibits the growth of larval Manduca sexta by blocking the release of ecdysterone and prohibiting the animals from undergoing their commitment pulse.
