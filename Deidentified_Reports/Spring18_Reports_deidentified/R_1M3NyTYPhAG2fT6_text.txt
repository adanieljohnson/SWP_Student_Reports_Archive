Title: The Effects of Tubocurarine on the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Frog Legs

Abstract:
	Smooth muscle contractions are classified by three different phases: latent, contraction, and relaxation. Muscle contractions are started with neurotransmitters, and use calcium ions to contract. Using acetylcholine or calcium blockers causes the amplitude of the muscle contraction to be less. We used two frog legs, testing the each leg separately, to observe the effect of tubocurarine on the muscle contraction of the frog muscle. We hypothesized that the muscle treated with the tubocurarine will have a lesser magnitude of muscle contraction in the frog leg than the muscle that is not treated. After being injected with the tubocurarine, the frog muscle did not contract as much; the magnitude of the contraction being statistically significently less than the magnitude before the addition of tubocurarine. We calculated a p_value of 6.95E-6 for frog leg 1, and a p_value of 1.48E-5 for frog leg 2, meaning our data was statistically significent, and that our null hypothesis can be rejected.


Introduction:
	Forty percent of the total body mass of a human body is skeletal muscle. These muscles go through three phases during their contraction period: the latency period, contraction period, and relaxation period. By using a myogram, the amplitude of the muscle contraction can be recorded, as well as the length of each of the three phases. Muscle contraction is activated by neurotransmitters. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that is released by the neuron that signals to muscles to contract. After being released, the acetylcholine binds to ligand gated receptors on the membrane of the muscle cell, triggering an action potential in the muscle cell. The action potential travels down the membrane of muscle until it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The action potential then triggers the release of Ca2+ into the muscle cell. The calcium ions then bind to troponin, which in turn, allows myosin fibers to the bind to the actin filaments and create a contraction. Certain chemicals, such as acetylcholine blockers or calcium blockers can affect the movement of a muscle. In a reaction run by Betty Twarog, Acetylcholine characteristically depolarizes and causes the contraction of the muscle when applied to the muscles. This means that if an acetylcholine blocker is used, the muscle contraction will be less (Twarog 1954). We will be adding tubocurarine, an acetylcholine blocker, to the frog leg, the gastrocnemus muscle, and recording the results. We hypothesize that the muscle treated with the tubocurarine will have a lesser magnitude of muscle contraction in the frog leg than the muscle that is not treated.


Materials and Method:
	The first step is to deglove the frog leg, which means removing the skin of the frog leg. Using our hands, we grabbed the skin and peeled the skin off the leg. We then exposed the sciatic nerve by pulling apart the muscle to expose the nerve. Next, we detached the gastrocnemus muscle from the back of the frog leg. Using scissors, we cut the muscle near the achilles tendon, then suspended the muscle from a string at a 90 degree angle. This prepared our frog leg for the experiment. For the actual experiment, we first found the threshold of the first frog leg. Then we took 25% of the threshold to run the experiment, ensuring that the experiment was run at above threshold. We then stimulated the nerve 5 times and found the amplitudes of each contraction. Then, using the same leg, injected .2 Ml of tubocurarine into the muscle and waited 10 minutes for it to spread throughout the frog muscle. We then stimulated the treated muscle at the same voltage (25% of the threshold) and recorded the amplitudes. We then repeated the same experiment on the other frog leg, finding the threshold again. We then ran a paired t_test for each leg to analyze the data. 


Results:
The data within the paired t_test for frog leg 1 found that the mean amplitude of the contraction of the muscle after the treatment of tubocurarine was significently less than the mean contraction of the muscle before the treatment of tubocurarine (t_stat = 30.42, d.f. = 4, P = 6.95E-6). The data within the paired t_test for frog leg 2 found that the mean amplitude of the contraction of the muscle after the treatment of tubocurarine was significently less than the mean contraction of the muscle before the treatment of tubocurarine (t_stat = 25.16, d.f. = 4, P = 1.48E-5). The standard deviation of Frog 1 controll = ± 0.0138. The standard deviation of Frog 1 treatment = ± 0.0116. The standard deviation of Frog 2 controll = ± 0.0346. The standard deviation of Frog 1 treatment = ± 0.0331.


Discussion:
From the data, we could see that the average amplitude of the contraction in each leg after being treated with tubocurarine was less than that of before being treated, as seen in figure 2. In an experiment in 1950, Paton found that tubocurarine paralyses the muscle by blocking the depolarizing action of acetylcholine in the muscle cells. This in turn causes the muscle to contract with a lesser amplitude, as the acetylcholine can not fully depolarize the muscle cell (Paton 1950). Since we were applying tubocurarine to the muscle, the muscle did not contract as much as compared to before as seen in figure 1. The tubocurarine was blocking the acetylcholine receptors by binding to the receptors themselves, preventing acetylcholine itself from binding to the receptors. This causes less of an action potential in the muscle of the frog leg, so when the action potential reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it did not have as strong of an signal to release calcium ions. As a result, the magnitude of the muscle contraction was less after the injection of tubocurarine than before the treatment as seen in figure 2. We calculated a p_value of 6.95E-6 for frog leg 1, which means our data was significent; the mean amplitude of the contraction before the treatment of tubocurarine was significently bigger than the mean amplitude of the muscle contraction after the addition of tubocurarine. We calculated a p_value of 1.48E-5 for frog leg 2, which means our data was significent for leg 2 as well; the mean amplitude of the contraction before the treatment of tubocurarine was significently bigger than the mean amplitude of the muscle contraction after the addition of tubocurarine. Because of these results, our null hypothesis could be rejected.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The amplitude of the contraction in each frog leg before and after treatment of tubocurarine over 5 stimulations. Each leg was stimulated at 25% of its threshold, and stimulated 5 times at the same voltage. Each leg has two trials, a before treatment and after treatment trial. 
The blue lines are the trials from Frog 1, where the lighter blue is after the leg had been treated with tubocurarine. The red lines are the trials of Frog 2, where the pink is after the leg has been treated with tubocurarine.
