Title: A Study of Insect Growth Hormones: How the Manduca sexta caterpillar was negatively affected in terms of physical growth and development by the addition of a Juvenile Hormone mimic, Precor, to their Great Lakes Manduca (GML) diets.

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta a type of caterpillar subjected to influences by hormonal changes, which can be affected by the types of diets they have or any variations of the food they consume. In this lab, we decided to test this experiment by manipulating the diets of half of the 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars obtained with a growth hormone - Juvenile Hormone mimic called Precor - in order to see if changing hormone levels in their consumed food would affect their physical well being. We hypothesized that 5 drops of the Juvenile Hormone mimic Precor into the diets of half of our Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in a large growth by mass with the most healthy overall appearance as opposed to the other half of the caterpillars which were not subjected to the JH mimic. In conclusion, our hypothesis was accurate and it depicted a final higher average value by mass of the caterpillars who were subjected to the JH mimic hormone as opposed to those caterpillars which were not. This reinforced our hypothesis and also reinforced the idea that hormones do, in fact, contribute and directly affect physical development and growth in organisms.


Introduction:
Biological and physical development of organisms from a young state is vital to how they will grow into mature organisms and be able to survive in their environments. The ability for organisms to develop and grow healthily is often the result of endocrine controll [Grunert: 2015]. Endocrine can be defined as “relating to or denoting glands that secrete hormones or other products directly into the blood,” which tells us that hormones are influential in development [Oxford Dictionary: 2018]. In turn, hormonal effects directly correlate with the life cycles of organisms. Furthermore, the hormonal effects in certain types of food consumed can also demonstrate these effects on the physical development of organisms. In order to properly test this theory in the most effective manner, we took a simple organism with various steps in its life cycle and manipulated the type of food it was given, which resulted in notable physical differences. 
 
The Manduca sexta caterpillar was beneficial to use in an experiment testing hormonal effects on growth cycles because this caterpillar has a multi-stage life cycle, which included instar larva before maturing into a pupa and then into a moth [Johnson: 2018]. The entire life cycle can take approximately 19-23 days; however, within just a week, we were able to easily see physical development and color changes just in the pupa stage which only took 7 days [Johnson 2018]. Because this time frame was so quick, the Manduca sexta caterpillar proved beneficial to use in this experiment because the observations did not require much time in order to be concluded, and because it had various phases in its life cycle which provided in more accurate results when testing the hormonal effects on stage development.
 
The diet of the Manduca sexta caterpillars consisted of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) which provided these caterpillars with hydration and nutrients proving vital for their development and vital to this experiment [Johnson: 2018]. We were able to alter this diet by adding 5 drops of a growth hormone - a Juvenile Hormone mimic called “Precor”- to 4 of the 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars tested to see any physical change in the caterpillars’ outer appearance since Juvenile Hormone does, in fact, regulate the type of molt larvae produce [Johnson 2018]. Thus, we hypothesized that 5 drops of the Juvenile Hormone mimic Precor into the diets of half of our Manduca sexta caterpillars would result in a large growth by mass with the most healthy overall appearance as opposed to the other half of the caterpillars which were not subjected to the JH mimic.
 


Materials and Method:
The hypothesis was tested by taking a total of 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and dividing them up into groups of 4, giving us two groups of controll caterpillars who would be fed a normal diet containing 100 g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) and two other groups which would be consuming 5 drops of precor in their GML diet. These 2 groups were then divided up again into groups “1A, 1B, 2A, 2B,” and so forth. This allowed us to gain accurate measurements because the caterpillars were being divided up into smaller groups which made it easier to focus on their specific weights and physical properties. The caterpillars weighed between 1.5-2.0g before the experiment began. The caterpillars were consecutively fed approximately 10g of food every day for 7 days straight, both for the caterpillars eating the 5 drops of Precor mixed with GLM and for the controll caterpillars eating the GLM with 5 drops of water. When the caterpillars were not being fed or their measurements were not being taken, they spent their time in an incubator which maintained a temperature of 25 degrees and experienced a 12 hr dark and 12 hr light cycle everyday. After the 7 days, the final weights and physical descriptions of the caterpillars were concluded.




Results:
Table 1 above demonstrates the major data involved with this lab. It shows the masses collected daily of the Manduca sexta caterpillars when they were eating GML with 5 drops of Precor added to their food, as well as the masses of the controll group even though they were not subjected to Precor levels.

Figure 1 is a good visual representation of what is truly happening to the caterpillars during this lab. This line graph clearly exhibits the relationship between the controll group and the independent variable, Precor. It depicts the average masses collected, which allows us to see how overall the caterpillars which consumed Precor did, in fact, grow larger than those who strictly ate the GLM diet.

Table 2 demonstrates the average controll mass changes and the average JH mimic changes as well as the standard deviations and P-value needed for this lab.


Discussion:
In conclusion, the experiment produced expected results that aligned with our hypothesis. Our hypothesis deemed accurate and resulted in observations which were easily calculated and proved correct. In figure 1, it is clear to see that there seemed to be a source of error in the 2A value of the JH mimic average mass. This could have resulted from the caterpillar’s original weight being too small before the lab was conducted, or the caterpillar simply did not eat enough food for the Precor to be effective. Table 1 demonstrated the collected numerical masses of the caterpillars, which was vital for observing the trends in the data between the JH mimic and the controll group on the GLM diet. Furthermore, our hypothesis proved correct because the 2B caterpillar, as well as the other caterpillars being subjected to the Precor diet, weighed more in mass as opposed to the caterpillars which were only subjected to the GLM diet, even though it is fair to say that all caterpillars increased in size over the span of 7 days.
 
This lab proved that there is a direct correlation to growth hormone in food sources and the physical development and well-being of the Manduca sexta caterpillars [Grunert, Laura: 2015].
