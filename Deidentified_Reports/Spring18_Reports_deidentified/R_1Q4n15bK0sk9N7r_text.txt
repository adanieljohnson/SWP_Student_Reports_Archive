Title: The effect of lanthanum chloride on the muscle contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle in a rana pipien

Abstract:
This experiment isolated the gastrocnemius muscle in a rana pipien in order to record the threshold of muscle contraction before and after lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker, was injected into the muscle. It was hypothesized that if lanthanum chloride was injected into the muscle the muscle contraction threshold would increase due to the fact that calcium is required for muscle contraction. All legs were stimulated with a force transducer and the threshold was calculated before the muscles were injected. Then the threshold was calculated for those same muscles which then contained the calcium blocker. The hypothesis was rejected by the data collected and the results were not statistically significant (t-stat= 0.05, df=18, P=0.961). In the future, more legs could be tested and a different calcium blocker could be used. 


Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of lanthanum chloride, a calcium blocker, on the muscle contraction threshold of the gastrocnemius muscle in a rana pipien. Skeletal muscle consists of myofibers bound together by connective tissue which serve as the skeletal muscles proper. These muscles are innervated by motor neurons which are located in the central nervous system, or spinal cord. Axons of these neurons innervate the myofibers at a location known as the neuromuscular junctions (AD Johnson, 2018). A muscle contraction happens when an action potential arrives at the presynaptic side of the neuron. Calcium and sodium voltage sensitive gates open. The ions rush in and calcium binds to the presynaptic vesicles and dumps the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which depolarizes the cell. This creates an action potential which dives into the t-tubules and activates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium binds to the myofilaments of the muscle which allows for muscle contraction (Sadava et al). If lanthanum chloride, a calcium blocker, is inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle it will significantly increase the threshold of muscle contraction. The dependent variable is the threshold and the independent variable is the lanthanum chloride. 


Materials and Methods:
Obtained two frog legs, one right leg and one left leg. Skinned both legs using forceps. Cut gastrocnemius muscle away from leg so that it could be attached to the force transducer (Ft-302). Tied the right gastrocnemius muscle to the force transducer with cotton string. Pinned the muscle to the board so that it stayed in place. Tied silver string to force transducer and muscle in two places, near the top of the muscle and closer to the bottom, so that the muscle was perpendicular to the board. Determined the threshold amplitude (in volts) of the muscle using a myogram. Injected 0.1mL of 1mM lanthanum chloride into the muscle with a syringe. Injected half towards the top of the muscle and the other half towards the bottom of the muscle. Ten minutes later the threshold was found again three times. Calculated the average and standard deviation for both the control and treated leg data. Ran a two sample t-test at alpha level of 0.05 and confidence interval of 95% to determine the significance of the statistics. 


Results:
Figure one shows the average of the threshold of muscle contraction of the ten legs used in the experiment. The average for the control group was 0.2314 volts and the average for the treatment group was 0.22752 volts. The bar graph also shows the standard deviation which was 0.002743574. The change in threshold from the control group to the treatment group was not statistically significant (t-stat= 0.05, df=18, P=0.961). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that injecting lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle of the rana pipien would increase the threshold of muscle contraction was rejected. An increase in threshold was expected due to the fact that calcium is a significant contributor to muscle contraction. The release of calcium is what causes the muscle to contract. Therefore, if the calcium was blocked it was predicted that the muscle would take longer to contract, increasing threshold. An experiment done by C. Devlin used the calcium blocker verapamil to see the effects on the sarcolemma in smooth muscle. He and other researchers found that muscle contraction was slowed due to the calcium blocker (Devlin et al, 1996). In another experiment done by researchers, they found that the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum increases heart rate (Yang et al, 2018). So if calcium is blocked it is predicted that muscle contraction would slow.  In the future more frog legs could be tested and a different calcium blocker could be used.
