Title: The effects of temperature and 1mM lanthanum (III) chloride on photosynthetic rates in Brassica oleracea leaves.

Abstract:
This experiment explored the effects of varying temperatures and the pollutant Lanthanum (III) Chloride (LaCl3) on the photosynthetic rate in Brassica oleracea, as known as kale.  In order to measure the photosynthetic rates in B. oleracea we first isolated chloroplast from kale using a centrifuge technique and then performed an assay where we tested temperatures at 4˚C, 20˚C, and 40˚C along with chloroplast interacting with LaCl3 and the controll with no chloroplast.  The hypothesis was that photosynthetic rates would be optimum at 20˚C and that LaCl3 would decrease the photosynthetic rate of the chloroplast.  Once all the data was collected a 2-sampled t_test was performed to compare the treatments to the controll and it was found that the only treatments that were statistically significent were 20˚C and LaCl3 (p_values &lt; 0.05).  Therefore, it was only determined that 20˚C and LaCl3 presence has a differing rate than no chloroplast.

Introduction:
Plants have the ability to capture and store energy from the sun through a process called photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis is the process a plant cell undergoes to make glucose, a sugar, used in cellular respiration.  It can be broken down into two different stages: the light dependent reactions and the light independent reaction.  The light dependent reactions consist of photosystem II and photosystem I which will work together to use the absorbed photons from the sun, or any light source, to generate NADPH and create a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis.  The ATP and NADPH created in the light dependent reactions are then used in the light independent reaction, or the Calvin cycle.  An enzyme RuBisCo uses these two molecules to make glucose from CO2 and ribulose phosphate.  This process can be extremely hard to measure since it is happening at such a small level.  However, with the help of the Hill reaction we can measure electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts [Johnson:2018].  This experiment will determine the effects of the pollutant Lanthanum (III) Chloride (LaCl3) and varying temperatures on the photosynthetic rates of Brassica oleracea.  LaCl3 is an inorganic molecule that inhibits cation channels in cells.  Cation channels are used in photosynthesis to maintain the proton gradient in order to make ATP in the light dependent reactions [Homcal:2015].  A specific example could be the evidence of calcium channels functioning in photosystem II [Becker: 1984].  The other independent variable temperature also could have an effect on photosynthesis in chloroplast.  In order to speed up these reactions found in both stages of photosynthesis enzymes act as catalyst.  In varying temperatures, the efficiency of enzymes varies as well.  Previous experiments show that enzymes perform the best in temperatures around 20˚C rather than around 0˚ or 40˚C [Markings:2018].  We hypothesize that photosynthetic rates will be optimum at 20˚C and that LaCl3 would decrease the photosynthetic rate of the chloroplast for these reasons.

Materials and Method:
Four kale leaves with their veins removed were rinsed and dried then grounded up with a chilled mortar and pestle in 10Ml of grinding buffer.  Once the mixture started to resemble a paste another 10Ml of grinding buffer was added and the solution was strained with a cheesecloth.  The strained solution was placed into a centrifuge tube and spun at 200xG for 3 minutes at 0˚C.  Then the supernatant was poured into a second centrifuge tube leaving the debris behind in the first tube.  This centrifuge tube was then spun at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4˚C.  The supernatant of this solution was poured out as well, leaving the pellet in the tube as best as possible and then 20Ml of grinding buffer was added back into the centrifuge tube with the pellet.  A stir rod was used to mix up the pellet and the buffer to make the solution of the chloroplast used in this assay.  Then 19 large test tubes were gathered and labeled blank and 1-18.  The test tubes were then filled according to the reagent table (Table 1).  To start the assay, 100µL of the chloroplast made before was added to test tubes 4-18 and mixed together.  The mixtures were then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes and the initial absorbance were read for each trial at 600nm after setting the blank.  The cuvettes were then placed in their respective places (also according to Table 1) and their absorbance were measured 3 more times at 10-minute intervals (making sure to reset the blank each time).  The data was recorded and then a 2-sampled t_test was performed to determine significance of each treatment compared to the controll (test tubes 1-3).

Results:
Figure 1 shows the trends found in the treatments and controlls of this experiment.  There seems to be an upward trend of photosynthetic rate for all treatments and the controll was the only downward trend.  The LaCl3 pollutant has a slightly upward trend that looks to be similar to the sample of chloroplast at 20˚C.  The chloroplast at both 4˚C and 40˚C had a greater percent change increase than the chloroplast at 20˚C.  The 2-sample t_test (Table 2) show that the only significent treatments were the 20˚C and LaCl3 pollutants at 95% confidence, p_values of 0.047216 and 0.008936 respectively.  The treatments of 4˚C and 40˚C were not significent compared to the controll at 95% confidence (p_values of 0.757887 and 0.152019 respectively).

Discussion:
While the looking at the percent changes alone for the temperature treatments it would seem that the 20˚C treatment was the least effective at increasing the photosynthetic rates of chloroplast than 4 and 40˚C treatments.  However, the 2-sample t_test shows that the only significent treatment was the 20˚C treatment.  Plus, since it had an upward trend for its percent change as well, it goes on to support our hypothesis that photosynthetic rates are optimum at temperatures around 20˚C.  The LaCl3 treatment was also significent compared to the controll which tells us there is a difference in photosynthetic rates, however, the upward trend was not expected for the percent change for this pollutant.  It is possible that the reason for why the LaCl3 treatment had an upward trend instead of the downward trend like hypothesized is that there was not enough concentration of the pollutant to affect the cation channels.  There was an experiment done testing the inhibition of TRP3 channels via Lanthanides and it was found that lower concentrations tend to not inhibit channels as well [Halaszovich, Zitt, Jüngling, Lückhoff:2000]. This can lead to further testing to find at which concentration does LaCl3 need to be to effectively inhibit cation channels and decrease the rate of photosynthesis.
