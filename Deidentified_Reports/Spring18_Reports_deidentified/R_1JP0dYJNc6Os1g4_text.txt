Title: Lidocaine as a Muscle Contraction Inhibitor in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
This experiment analyzed the success of lidocaine as a muscle contraction inhibitor in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. Muscle contraction is achieved through interaction between the skeletal and nervous systems and generation of an action potential. An action potential is only produced if a specific threshold is reached, thus muscle contraction relies on threshold being achieved. Lidocaine is a compound proven to function as a sodium channel blocker, thus inhibiting action potential and in turn muscle contraction. This study tests the biological question if lidocaine successfully inhibits muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of R.pipiens. Based on the knowledge of lidocaine as a sodium channel blocker and prior research, it was hypothesized that lidocaine would increase contraction threshold when injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of R.pipiens. The experiment consisted of measurement of the contraction threshold after being stimulated using a high displacement transducer. This threshold was compared in the gastrocnemus muscle of R.pipiens before and after injection of lidocaine. The results showed that there was a statistical significent difference between the mean threshold of controll and treatment groups, therefore the hypothesis was accepted.

Introduction:
The skeletal and nervous systems work in conjunction to respond to environmental stimuli. Skeletal muscle consists of myofibers bound together by connective tissue and innervated by neurons. Motor neurons work to respond to stimuli within milliseconds by causing release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which activates the opening of sodium channels to generate an action potential. This action potential amplifies its response to further release sodium and therefore initiates the activation of the contraction of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. This action potential is only generated if a specific voltage threshold is reached. This specific threshold needed varies between animals and within specific muscle types. Physical stimuli can additionally affect this threshold. Myograms are graphs that display the phases of muscle contraction, and they are recorded by attaching a muscle to a force transducer. Threshold can be determined from analyzing these myograms [Johnson: 2018].
Lidocaine is a compound that has been proven to function as a sodium channel blocker when injected into an organism [Cummins: 2007]. Specifically, one study showed that lidocaine injection inhibited contraction of rats’ tracheal smooth muscle [Kao, Chu, & Wang: 2010]. Lidocaine works to increase threshold, inhibiting action potentials and therefore muscle contractions from occurring. 
This study seeks to test the biological question if lidocaine proves successful as an inhibitor for muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens.  Rania pipiens was an ideal model organism selected due to the ease of isolating the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve. The independent variable for this experiment is the injection or absence of lidocaine into the gastrocnemus muscle, and the dependent variable is the threshold measured as a result. Based on the knowledge of lidocaine as a sodium channel blocker and prior research [Cummins: 2007], it was hypothesized that lidocaine would increase contraction threshold when injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. 


Materials and Method:
In this experiment, two separate legs of Rania pipiens were prepared for analysis of contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle. Specifically, each leg was skinned using forceps and then moistened with frog Ringer’s solution. A dissecting probe was then used to separate the inner thigh muscles to isolate the sciatic nerve attached to the gastrocnemus muscle, and sleeve and pin electrodes were carefully inserted in the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus muscle for direct stimulation of the muscle. A specialized displacement transducer and a high voltage stimulus isolator were used to create and measure the stimulus and response from the sciatic nerve to the muscle. Increasing pulse amplitude was applied and the threshold of contraction of the first leg was determined using the LabScribe software previously installed on the computer. This threshold was measured three times using the autoscale button on this software to determine the lowest stimulus voltage at which the muscle contraction is above zero (where there is a peak present on the graph), and these three measures were averaged. The leg was then injected with 25 Ml of lidocaine solution using a syringe. After one minute, the threshold was measured three times and averaged again using the procedure previously described. This entire procedure (with both no treatment and lidocaine) was then repeated for the second leg. Data was gathered from three other groups to obtain a total of 8 data sets for thresholds of the gastrocnemus muscle. These 8 sets were averaged for the controll and treatment groups to obtain two values. For statistical analysis, a two-tailed t_test was applied to these averages to compare the controll thresholds and the average treatment thresholds and determine if there was a statistical significance. 


Results:
Table 1 displays the average threshold of muscle contraction for the controll and lidocaine treatment groups. This summarized data was determined from averaging the eight data sets of muscle contractions for both controll and treatment groups. As is shown in table 1, the controll leg’s muscle contraction threshold was 0.168 Volts, while the leg treated with lidocaine had a muscle contraction threshold of 0.406 Volts. 

Figure 1 compares the average threshold of muscle contractions for controll groups and treatment groups (those that received lidocaine injections). As is visible in figure 1, the legs treated with lidocaine appeared to have a much higher muscle contraction threshold than those in the controll group. 

The results of the two-sample t_test for data analysis were as follows: t_stat=-2.818, d.f.=14, P=0.014. Because the P value is less than 0.05, and therefore this data can be considered statistically significent. Therefore the data shows that the mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. The standard error bars on the graph additionally do not overlap, which supports this conclusion (figure 1).


Discussion:
As reported in results, the P value was less than 0.05, and therefore it was concluded that the results were statistically significent. This indicates that the hypothesis, that lidocaine would increase muscle contraction threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle when injected into Rania pipiens, can be accepted. This is likely a result of lidocaine functioning as a sodium channel blocker as discovered in prior research [Kao, Chu, & Wang: 2010], and this leads to the conclusion that lidocaine functions successfully as a as a muscle contraction inhibitor by increasing the threshold for contraction. 
	This study holds important implications for the scientific community as well as the general population. Lidocaine has been in use as an anesthetic agent for numbing purposes [Davis, Oakley, & Smith: 1984] but recent findings proving its effectiveness in various muscles in multiple organisms have found new potential uses. Specifically, a recent study has found the potential for lidocaine as a treatment for asthma [Abuan, Yeager, & Montgomery: 2010]. This study shows that lidocaine is a good muscle contraction inhibitor in gastrocnemus muscles and leads to the potential for even further uses of lidocaine in medical contexts.
