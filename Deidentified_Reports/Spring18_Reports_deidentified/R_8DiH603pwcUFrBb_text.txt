Title: The Effects of Feeding Precor to Manduca Sexta Caterpillars on Inhibiting Growth and Development in Their Molting Cycle

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta caterpillar, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is a large green caterpillar that is found in the United States and is commonly used in laboratory experiments. In this experiment, we aimed to observe the growth and developmental effects of adding Precor, a synthetic supplement of Juvenile Hormone, into a 4th instar stage caterpillar’s daily food. We introduced Precor into the experimental group’s daily food for one week and recorded visual observations, weight, and percentage of the food eaten. We hypothesized that the caterpillars given Precor would experience stunted growth and development in their molting cycle and would not progress normally from their current 4th instar stage to the 5th instar stage. Though our daily observations seemed to support our hypothesis through the lack of development of black and red coloration on the caterpillars’ backs and decreased weight gain in the experimental group, the mean difference in daily weight between the control and experimental groups was not statistically significantly different so our hypothesis could not be supported and null hypothesis could not be rejected. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta caterpillars, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is a large, green caterpillar commonly found in the United States. It is widely used for laboratory experiments due to its large size, short life cycle, and easy rearing conditions (Villaneuva: 1998). We are particularly interested in its molting cycle and molting hormone, Juvenile Hormone, which is a hormone produces by the Corpus Allata that determines what the insect will molt into (Johnson: 2018). In this experiment, we are wanting to discover how feeding the caterpillars a synthetic Juvenile Hormone, Precor, will affect their growth and development within their molting cycle. We received the caterpillars in their 4th instar stage, so the Juvenile Hormone supplement should alter their development into their 5th instar form. By feeding the caterpillars synthetic Juvenile Hormone, we will be keeping Juvenile Hormone levels higher than normal and we hypothesize this will stunt the caterpillars’ growth and physical development as it develops toward its 5th instar stage. The independent variable in this experiment is the presence of Precor in the caterpillar’s daily diet, and the dependent variable is observable changes in development and weighable changes in weight. The transition between 4th and 5th instar takes 4 days (Johnson: 2018) and we will be observing the caterpillars for one week, so the inhibitory effect of supplemented Juvenile Hormone should be observable.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we observed 6 Manduca Sexta caterpillars which we split into two groups of three caterpillars each, a control group and an experimental group. Each caterpillar was given its own compartment within a container and all were kept in the same controlled environment within a temperature controlled unit. Daily, for one week, we fed each caterpillar one of two diets: control group was given 10g normal dietary food from Great Lakes Manduca plus 5 drops of water and the experimental group was given the 10g regular diet plus 5 drops dilute Precor (4mL Precor: 100mL water) mixed into the regular diet food. Our independent variable was whether or not the caterpillars received Precor in their diet and the dependent variable was observable changes in development and weight. Each day we measured the weight of the caterpillar, the percentage of the food each caterpillar ate, and recorded visual observations. For statistical inference, to compare average daily weight of the caterpillars, we used a two sample T-test. 

Results:
Through daily observations, we observed that the control caterpillars over the week grew larger in size and weight as well as developed predominant black stripes down their backs along with red/brown dots. The experimental caterpillars fell behind in daily average weight (see Figure 1) and did not develop black or red markings down their backs as the control caterpillars did. As seen in Figure 1, the control caterpillars, on average, had a greater increase in weight gain when weighed daily in comparison to the experimental caterpillars. However, the control group’s daily weight mean was not statistically significantly different than the mean daily weight in the experimental group (t-stat= 0.438, df= 12, P= 0.669).

Discussion:
In the experiment, the hypothesis seemed supported through daily observations of the development of coloration and growth in the control group, such as the development of black and white lines down the control caterpillars’ back. It was also supported through the increase in average weight of the control group, which was greater than that of the average daily weight of the experimental group (see Figure 1). We believed these indicators are signs that, in the control group, the 4th instar larvae were developing normally into 5th instar larvae and the experimental group was not. However, the resulting data was not supportive enough to be statistically significantly different so our hypothesis cannot be supported and null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Juvenile hormone analogues mimic naturally occurring Juvenile Hormone and prevent metamorphosis from the 4th to 5th instar. During the days of instar transition, Juvenile Hormone levels slope into a decline which allows for transitional development (Johnson, 2018). We believed that keeping Juvenile Hormone levels high through the caterpillar’s ingestion of Precor would inhibit the caterpillars from the normal transitional development from 4th instar to 5th instar. Supplementing the experimental group with Juvenile Hormone in the early 4th instar phase should eventually result in the continuation of a larvae stage and even the development of supernumerary instars (Khater, 2012). Though Precor has been previously found to inhibit caterpillar development and growth due to its role as a synthetic Juvenile Hormone (Khater, 2012), our experiment statistically supported the null hypothesis that there was so significant difference between the control and experimental caterpillar’s development. To improve the study, the caterpillars could be observed longer in the hopes that the control group would pupate and the experimental group would maintain in the instar phase due to high levels of Juvenile Hormone. The caterpillars could also be observed in greater numbers in hope to compile statistics that prove to be statistically significantly different.
