Title: The Effects of Increased Juvenile Hormone Concentration on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test the effects of synthetic Juvenille Hormone activators and inhibitors on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars development. We tested two different groups using the synthetic chemical Martin’s IGR on the treatment group and distilled water with the food for the controll group to see how the development of the caterpillar would vary. 


Introduction:
A typical life-cycle of a Manduca Caterpillar is 39-48 days long. During this period, they will develop and molt to eventually become moths. Before pupating, they will undergo usually 5 developmental stages, or instars. The two hormones involved in this transition are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysome (E-20). In our lab specifically, we are going to only focus on JH, as it controlls the type of molt the caterpillar undergoes. According to “The Comparative Physiology Lab Manual,” for a caterpillar to undergo a commitment pulse (the period before they pupate and after the 5th instar period) the JH hormone must remain at a low, constant concentration with a spike in E-20 concentration. Systematically increasing the treatment groups concentration of JH by feeding them high doses of it in their food is how we measured the effects of it on these caterpillars. If there is no constant reduction of JH, then the caterpillars will never pupate into moths because the JH concentration will be too high: they will continue to molt into 6th and 7th instar caterpillars. 


Materials and Method:
Split up 8 Manduca Caterpillars into 4 groups of 2. There will be 4 caterpillars that will be designated the controll group and 4 caterpillars that will be designated treatment group. Each caterpillar will be fed everyday 10 grams of caterpillar food (80 grams of food total). The controll group will have their food mixed with 40 droplets of distilled water and the treatment group will have their food mixed with 40 droplets of Martin’s IGR chemical (similar to the effects of JH). Every day, these caterpillars must be fed with the same amount and same food solutions. Afterwards, weigh each caterpillar and record weight into data table. 


Results:
The results of our experiment were unexpected. Starting this process my group and I predicted that the treatment group with the increased concentration would have the larger weight as they would continue to molt into further instar developmental stages. However, this did not appear to be the case (see graph below for further information). After discussion and further thought, we realized that this could be because of the mimicking chemical involved, Martin’s IGR. This chemical causes an inhibitory response on development rather than an excitatory response, which explains why the caterpillars in the treatment group were underdeveloped and weighed less than those in the controll group. We think that rather than increasing the Juvenile Hormone concentration, to get the caterpillars in the treatment group to continue to develop into further instar stages, we should have increased the dosage of Martin’s IGR at a lower dosage. This would prevent them from being underdeveloped but still continue to transform into further instars without ever pupating. As far as the statistical significance went for this lab, we calculated a two-tailed p_value of 0.0247. Our t-value was 2.9775. Both indicating statistical significance for our experiment. 


Discussion:
The first observation that was seen was the reduced growth in the caterpillars in the treatment groups. According to “The Comparative Physiology Lab Manual,” this appears to be due to the inhibitor of JH which was fed to the treatment groups. Rather than molting into the 6th and 7th instars like we hypothesized, the caterpillars in the treatment group looked malnourished and weighed less than the controll group. Even though the caterpillars were fed the exact same amount of food each day, the treatment group grew much larger and were much more developed. When comparing our lab design to others outside of the class, it can be seen that there were similarities in results with ours in other’s labs regarding JH in Manduca Caterpillars. One thing that was noticed was that the color in the treatment groups was a lighter pigment of green and they were paler. This could be due to the Martin IGR chemical used which is a chemical in many common pesticides. By feeding them this highly concentrated dosage, it can be seen that the JH hormone not only affects the growth and development, but also the color pigmentation of the caterpillars. This was further proven as I was looking into other evidence to support this claim. In the article, “Hormonal Control of Cuticle Coloration in the tobacco Hornworm, Manduca Sexta: Basis of an Ultrasensitive Bioassay for Juvenile Hormone,” it describes the similar effects that we observed in our lab. In the article, it talks about how the color change in caterpillars is largely due to endocrine responses that are inhibited by chemicals (such as Martin’s IGR). These responses are producing an insufficient amount of melanin, a hormone which controlls skin pigment in animals. This is yet another subtle observation that can be seen when the concentration of Juvenile Hormone was increased. Knowing how this chemical works on animals considered “pests”, like Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, we can further examine ways to either get rid of them, or keep them in a stage where they are no longer considered a problem.
