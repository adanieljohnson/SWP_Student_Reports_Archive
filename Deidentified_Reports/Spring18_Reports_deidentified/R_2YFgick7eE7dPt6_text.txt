Title: The Effects of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Blocker on Skeletal Muscle in Rania Pipens

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to test the effects of a nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist on the stimulation of a frog's gastrocnemus muscle. Blocking the ACh receptors would hinder an action potential from being generated. A more powerful stimulation is required in order for the treated muscle to contract. 2 Ml (1mm) of the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist was injected using a needle into the gastrocnemus muscle of two frogs. The tests showed that the outcomes of the controll and variable are statistically significent. The results sustained the original hypothesis, the minimum amplitude stimulation is increased when a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist is applied. This study suggests that the function of ACh receptor is needed to open the sodium channels to create an action potential.


Introduction:
The objective of this study is to find if there is a significent difference in the threshold amplitude required to cause a contraction between the controll and treatment study groups. This experiment demonstrates the intricate processes of neuromuscular controll within a subset of muscle and nerve tissue derived from the northern leopard frog (scientifically known as Rania pipens). Dating back prior to the 1950s, the neuromuscular system of the Rania pipens is commonly used as a test species due to its similarity to mammals and other vertebrates, straightforward maintenance, and its practical size. uses a frog leg nerve and muscle preparation to demonstrate the intricate process of neuromuscular controll. [Burggren, 2007] The organization of the human somatic neuromuscular system can be compared with the findings of the Rania pipens.
Skeletal muscle makes up about 40% of an average human's body mass.  "Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of calcium ions from internal storage sites (the sarcoplasmic reticulum). The release of calcium ions activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten." (¬¬_________, 2018)
If a nicotinic Ach receptor antagonist is injected into the frog's gastrocnemus, then the baseline threshold is increased.
 


Materials and Method:
The standard protocol was followed for the preparation of the isolation of the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of the frog leg. It is extremely important to not let the specimen dry out. In order to keep the tissues moist, we periodically applied frog Ringer's solution. Keeping the tissues moist with the isotonic solution allows for easier transport of ions. After deskinning the frog leg, we moistened it with frog Ringer's solution. Using a dissecting probe, we separated the inner thigh muscle and the sciatic nerve from its connective tissue. Next, we detached the separated tendon and muscle by cutting the tissue below the Achilles tendon. To secure the leg in preparation for the electrical stimulation, we pinned the femoral muscles to the lab pan. Then, we used polyester string to suspend the Achilles tendon to the force transducer. Next, we attached the probes and calibrated the LabScribe software.
Starting at 0.1 volts and increasing the amplitude at a rate 0.01, we stimulated the frog leg until a baseline of muscle contraction was found. We measured a total of 5 myograms for each frog leg. Next, we injected the frog leg with 2 Ml (1 mili-mol) of a nicotinic ACh receptor blocker. (We waited 10 minutes after applying the blocker to allow it to set.) Then we repeated the process of finding the threshold baseline of muscle contraction.
To analyze the data, we calculated the mean of the controll and treatment trials' amplitude, used a two-sample t_test, and took the standard deviation. (Confidence level= 0.95; alpha=0.05)
 


Results:
The average threshold amplitude required to stimulate a contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle was much lower in the controll group than the required amplitude by the group treated with a nicotinic ACh receptor inhibitor. The mean threshold of the controll (0.169 +/- 3E-05) was significently lower different than the treatment (0.244 +/- 3E-05). Figure 1 displays a significent increase in threshold amplitude required for a muscle contraction.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis is supported, as represented in both frog legs, the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist-treated muscles required a higher amplitude to produce a measurable contraction, as represented in the myogram. In order for the muscle to contract under normal circumstances, an action potential is required. ACh is needed to bind to its receptor, which opens the sodium channels that generate an action potential. However, in the presence of a channel blocker, the ACh is unable to bind with its receptor, so an action potential is not generated. This experiment showed that the inhibitor blocks several, but not all of the ACh receptors, which explains why the threshold is higher in the treated group. 
This study brings a deeper understanding of the components in the generation of an action potential, specifically the neurotransmitter ACh. 
In our treatment group, we injected a synthetic depolarizing neuromuscular agent into the gastrocnemus muscle of two frog legs. The function of the neuromuscular agent, or the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist is to induce the depolarization across the membrane by mimicking the mechanism of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh). The neurotransmitter is received by the neuronal nicotinic receptors, opening the membrane's ligand-gated channels, causing an extended depolarization. Due to this extended period, a neuromuscular blocker is initiated, followed by a burst of fasciculation, causing muscular paralysis. The depolarization can be observed in the delay muscle contraction.
A similar study published in 1988 evaluated the mimicking effects of ACh antagonists. It was found that ACh receptor blocker antagonized the suppressive actions of the ACh, which prolonged the cascade of events required to produce an action potential [Norris, 1988].
	The results of this study assist us in developing a deeper understanding of the processes involved in delivering a neuromuscular action potential. Further studies could potentially test the variations in results between muscarinic and cholinergic receptors.
