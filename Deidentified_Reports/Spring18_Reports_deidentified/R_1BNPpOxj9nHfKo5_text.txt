Title: Relationship Between the Increase of Juvenile Hormone and Body Weight Changes of Tobacco hornworms

Abstract:
JH hormone plays an important role in all insects, and Manduca sexta caterpillars are used to study its influence on the insect maturation process. We hypothesize that an increase of JH causes an increase of weight in the caterpillars. Treatment groups are given Precor in their food, as control group received normal food. Both groups are monitored, weighed daily and kept in a stable incubator. Results show that caterpillars in both groups have gained weight, and the statistical test indicates that the weight difference between control and treatment groups is not statistically significant enough to support our hypothesis. However, through research, we found out that JH is not the only factor that alters weight change in the process of maturation in tobacco hornworms. JH delay the timing of metamorphosis in general. Further experiments should include JH in different concentrations and more treatment groups to explore the hormonal influence on weight change of tobacco hornworms.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta caterpillars, otherwise known as tobacco hornworms, are good subjects for the study of the physical influence juvenile hormone (JH) has on insects’ development and maturation process, because they are well studied, and relatively easy to measure. JH is secreted through the corpora allata of all insects, and have a universal impact on the overall control of the development of insects’ reproductive systems [Garriga: 2011]. Levels of JH fluctuates as the caterpillar goes through its five larval instar stages. JH inhibits the secretion of the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which is critical to the release of ecdysteroid (biosynthesis influenced by TOR signaling) that trigger the complete metamorphosis process [Hatem: 2015]. Theoretically, JH level dramatically decreases once the caterpillar reaches its critical weight, and PTTH subsequently signals the fifth and final instar stage, which eventually leads to the initiation of molting and reaching full maturation.  In this study, we used immature caterpillars. We attempt to see how the increase of JH in the caterpillars’ diet influence their weight and appearance. We mixed Precor, which mimics JH, into the food of subjects that have not experienced the commitment pulse and monitored their weight changes. We hypothesize that when tobacco hornworms receive more JH in their system, they will weigh more than usual, and will not go through commitment pulse.

Materials and Methods:
We separated the 8 caterpillars into two groups and place them into a total of 4 plastic containers. Two caterpillars share a plastic container with an index card in between, and each gets individual food. We put 10 drops of Precor 1:1250 into every 10 grams of regular caterpillar food for treatment group caterpillars. To mimic the texture of the treatment groups’ diet, we put ten drops of distilled water into every 10 grams of food of the control group caterpillars. Control and treatment groups are put in the same incubator, which maintains a steady 23 Celsius degrees, humidity, and lighting. All caterpillars are weighed every day at approximately the same time over a span of seven days, and the weights are recorded accordingly. They receive new food every day after being weighed. We used two-sample T-test to define the statistical significance of our study (it is statistically significant if the p-value is less than 0.05).

Results:
The initial weights of the subjects are similar. The data shows that after seven days, seven out of eight caterpillars have gained weight. Out of those seven caterpillars, control 2, treatment 1 and treatment 3 ended up being the heaviest (over 10 grams), while control 1 has lost 0.38 grams of weight and influenced the control group’s average. The trend of control group and treatment groups average weight change by days is shown in Figure 1 (see Appendices). The weight difference of each caterpillar from initial measurement to final measurement is available in Figure 2. Treatment 1 has gained 10.15 grams of weight, which is the most among all other caterpillars. We excluded control 1 from the statistical test, because we suspect a pre-experiment natal defect may play a role in its abnormal behavior and development. The two sample T-test we performed shows a p-value of 0.93, t-value of 0.97, and the degree of freedom is 5 (Graphic report with error bars shown in Figure 3). Apart from the obvious weight gain, we noticed the color difference between control and treatment groups: control group caterpillars have generally darker skin (see Figure 4 and Figure 5).

Discussion:
Having a p-value greater than 0.05, our statistical test shows that the difference of average weight between treatment group and control group is not statistically significant, which means that our study has failed to show that an increase of JH has any influence on tobacco hornworms’ body weight. As the result rejects our hypothesis, we conclude that an increase of JH in tobacco hornworms’ systems do not cause significant weight change. Surprisingly, our result coincides with a published study, which shows that JH only dramatically increases mutant larvae’s peak body size, and have no alteration in wild-type larvae [Hatem: 2015]. In wild-type tobacco hornworms, JH only determines the caterpillars' weight by influencing nutrient-sensitive pathways. When the amount of JH increases in the caterpillars’ systems, their developmental delay takes over the effect TOR signaling pathway, and the final size and weight of the tobacco hornworms are not influenced by the nutrient-sensitive pathway; therefore, the body size and weight of the caterpillars do not alter significantly when given more JH. Considering we did use wild-type Manduca caterpillars, the result we got is what it should be. Furthermore, the JH titers amount in caterpillars also plays an important role in the weight changes of Manduca caterpillars [Johnson: 2018], and we did not test the amount of JH titers in all subjects beforehand, so we don’t know if some of the subjects were born with a susceptibility to weight change under the influence of JH.   The difference in coloration of our control group and treatment group shows that an increase of JH causes a delay of maturation since treatment 2, 3 and 4 have never been through the commitment pulse as the experiment ended (the light coloration) [Jonson: 2018]. This observation also coincides with published studies. An increase of JH pushes back the timing of metamorphosis in both wild-type and mutant Manduca sexta larvae [Hatem: 2015].  Control 1 in our experiment is an outlier, as it has lost weight over time. It was excluded from the final statistical test because it might influence the general trend of our study significantly. We do not know exactly the reason why it has lost weight, but we suspect that it has a birth defect that causes it to be unable to survive and molt into an adult even in the wild. Another drawback of our study is that we did not record the weight of our subjects on the first day of the study. This is a human error and should be avoided in further experiments. However, the missing of a day’s data should not impact the overall result, because we mostly focus on the general trend of weight changes and the final weight, which we did measure and record.  For further improvement of the study of how JH impact the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, we could use several different concentrations of JH, chemicals that suppress JH release, have more treatment groups, and possibly include mutant larvae in our experiment to study what other hormones and pathways influence the weight and size change.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Trend of weight changes of the average of control group and treatment group subjects is shown in the graph. Except for control 1 caterpillar, all have increased their body weight dramatically, especially during the days in the middle. The growing trend slows down in the last day before the last measurement. 
Figure 2: Statistical differences between initial measurement and final measurement of every subject shows that over the span of seven days, treatment 1 have gained most weight, control 1 have lost weight, and treatment 2 have gained lease weight.  
Figure 3: Statistical test results shows an insignificant difference between the average weights of both groups, with treatment group slightly lighter than control group. All weights are measured in grams, control 1’s data is eliminated. 
Figure 4: Treatment group caterpillars at last measurement have light body color, and only treatment 1 have gone through commitment pulse (black line on its back). 
Figure 5: Control group caterpillars at last measurement have dark body color, all have gone through commitment pulse, and C1 has reached its lowest weight throughout the seven days of the experiment.
