Title: Observing the Effect of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor on Frog Leg Muscle Contractions 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to observe the effect acetylcholinesterase inhibitor has on muscle contractions.  Specifically, the amplitude of the muscle contractions will increase while the threshold value for muscle contractions will decrease. To test this, 6 frog leg muscle contractions were measured before and after the inhibitor was introduced to observe the effect on the amplitude of the contractions.  In addition, 3 frog legs were measured both before and after the inhibitor was introduced with the purpose of finding the threshold value.  After comparing all the results taken before the inhibitor was used with the results found after the inhibitor was used, the data did not in fact support the hypothesis.  This is because the overall amplitude of muscle contractions decreased and the resulting threshold values actually increased in value. 


Introduction:
Muscle contraction has a multitude of steps to it.  One of these steps occurs at the neuromuscular junction within an organism’s body.  The first part to the neuromuscular junction phase of muscle contraction is the arrival of an action potential.  It arrives at the presynaptic element of the neuron, stimulating the calcium channels to open and consequently flood the synapse with calcium.  Also at the presynaptic element, acetylcholine (or ACH) is stored within specific vesicles.  These vesicles are triggered to release the ACH that they store by the process of exocytosis.  As the ACH is released into the synapse, it will bind to ACH receptors located on the post-synaptic element.  These receptors also act as channels for sodium and potassium flow.  When the ACH binds it opens these channels allowing sodium to rush through and depolarize the sarcomere.  The depolarization will lead to the muscle fibers shortening and subsequently contracting the muscle.  After muscle contraction, ACH is released from the ACH receptor into the synapse to be recycled by acetylcholinesterase and eventually to be used as new ACH in the next muscle contraction.  In this experiment, an ACHesterase inhibitor will be used to stop the recycling of ACH.  As a result, the ACH will remain in the synapse causing a higher amplitude of contraction and a decreased threshold value. 


Materials and Methods:
To start the experiment each group was given three frog legs that served as both the control group and the experimental group.  The skin on each leg was removed as to reveal the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle.  From here, a string was then used to hang the leg from a transducer which was responsible for measuring the actual muscle contraction.  Two electrodes were then placed along the sciatic nerve for direct stimulation.  With all this properly set up, a set of electrical stimulations with ranging amplitudes from 0.02 to 0.5 amps were then induced for each of the three frog legs.  Measurements were then taken of the amplitude of contraction along with the threshold value of muscle contraction.  For the experimental group, the same procedure was performed but prior to stimulation, 0.1mL of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor was injected into the muscle.  3 minutes of waiting after injection was necessary to make sure the inhibitor took effect.  After this waiting period, stimulations with amplitudes up to 0.5 were sent at the muscle.  Measurements of the amplitude of muscle contraction were once again taken along with the observance of the threshold value. 


Results:
The results of this experiment showed that the mean amplitude of the threshold was lower when the legs were used as the experimental group than when the legs were used as the control group.  In addition, the mean stimulation needed to find the threshold was higher for the experimental group than it was in the control group. 

Discussion:
The experiment yielded a wide range of data that contradicted the hypothesis to some degree. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor led to a decreased amplitude for muscle contraction in the first two legs while the third leg showed an increase in amplitude.  These data points in our graph show that there was no clear trend for amplitude of muscle contraction and therefore cannot support the hypothesis that the amplitude would clearly increase.  In addition, the threshold value for muscle contraction was higher than the control group threshold value for the first two legs.  However, the third leg contradicted the data from the first two legs and showed a lower threshold value than when it was used as a control leg.  As a result, the threshold values fail to show a clear trend and do not support the hypothesis.
