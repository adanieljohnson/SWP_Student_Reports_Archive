Title: The Comparison of Weight of Manduca sexta After Increased Juvenile Hormone Consumption 

Abstract:
	The Manduca sexta is a species of moth that undergoes a holometabolous life cycle. This life cycle is regulated by two hormones: Ecdysterone, regulating the timing of the molting process and Juvenile Hormone, regulating the type of molting that takes place. The objective of the experiment was to observe the weight of M. sexta over a period of seven days. In turn, forming a hypothesis that suggests an increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will cause the M. sexta to gain a significant amount of weight over time. In this experiment, Juvenile Hormone was manipulated to stimulate an abnormal increase of the hormone by incorporating 10 drops Precor (Methoprene) at 1:1250 concentration into the 10g diet of the treatment group and only 10 drops of water into the 10g diet of the control group. The caterpillars were weighed and fed 10g of food every day for seven days. A two-sample t-test displayed that the results were statistically insignificant (t-stat=0.316, df=6, P=0.763). This information determines that there is an unlikely probability that the observed value, weight, is a significant effect of increased juvenile hormone. 

Introduction:
Hormonal function is essential to the process of homeostasis and the maintenance of life cycles within an organism. The Manduca sexta, also referred to as the Tobacco Hornworm, is an example of an insect that uses hormones to develop into an adult. As seen in other insects, the M. sexta develops through a holometabolous life cycle consisting of four major life stages: the embryonic stage, the larval stage, the pupal stage and adulthood [Sanes: 1976]. These four stages are regulated by Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH), the three main hormones found in insects [Johnson: 2018]. However, Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone are the dominate hormones used in the progression of the “five larval instars, separated by molts” that determine the timing of the molt and the type of molt that occurs [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile Hormone significantly reduces production after the fourth larval instar, indicating to the insect that the next instar will entail development into adulthood. 

Juvenile Hormone can be manipulated to stimulate or inhibit abnormal amounts of production after the fourth instar to regulate the insect’s development based on natural environmental conditions, like temperature [Wyatt: 1996]. However, Juvenile Hormone can be artificially produced for experimentation to study the effects of the hormone on the life cycle of an M. sexta. Therefore, raising the research question “Does the overproduction of Juvenile Hormone during the life cycle create significant weight gain of the insect that ingests it?” The M. sexta is a common insect of study because it naturally develops through a holometabolous life cycle while producing juvenile hormone. An independent variable of the amount of juvenile hormone placed in the insect’s food can be studied for its effects on the dependent variable, the weight gain of the M. sexta. In turn, reasoning that the increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will cause the weight of the M. sexta to increase as the hypothesis of the experiment.


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted by using eight M. sexta caterpillars chosen before the Commitment Pulse was passed through, each weighing between .95g and 1.60g. The M. sexta were then divided into four groups of two. Each group of two M. sexta were placed into a transparent feeding container, separated by a barrier to ensure food was not shared amongst the insects. A perforated lid was secured on the container to enclose the insects. Each group received one of two diets, the control diet (consumed by four caterpillars) or the treatment diet (consumed by four caterpillars). Those in the control diet received 10g of M. sexta food made as directed by the manufacturer with 10 drops of water. Those in the treatment group received 10g of M. sexta food with 10 drops of Precor (Methoprene) at 1:1250 concentration to stimulate the behavior of Juvenile Hormone. The M. sexta were kept in the same incubator of 23⁰C. 

The M. sexta were weighed each day for seven days and the measurement was recorded. Everyday, 10 grams of food, according to their assigned diet, was added to the food left from the previous day. On the seventh day, the final weight measurement was recorded. A two-tailed t-test was performed on the data to test significance between the control group, that consumed normal food, and the treatment group, that consumed food with Juvenile Hormone mixed in. 


Results:
The M. sexta caterpillars shared similar values in the total growth from the initial values to the final values of weight observed (Fig. 1). However, numerical data suggests that the control group found higher amounts of growth, despite an outlier in the treatment group. The treatment group appeared lighter in color on the seventh day of observation and data collection. They appeared to have a layer of skin covering them while the control groups had more vibrancy in color (Fig. 2). A two-sample t-test was conducted to compare the control group to the treatment group. The results were statically insignificant in this experiment (t-stat=0.316, df=6, P=0.763). Meaning that the probability of weight being a significant factor in the difference between the control group and the treatment group is low. 	

Discussion:
The two-tailed t-test performed on the data suggests that the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different from the treatment group (t-stat=0.316, df=6, P=0.763). This indicates that the experiment’s hypothesis was not supported. The data collected of the initial weight of the M. sexta to the final weight collected on the seventh day depicts growth that is limited in variety (Fig. 1). However, the statistical null hypothesis of the experiment was supported: the increased amount of exposure to Juvenile Hormone will not cause the weight of the M. sexta to increase. Juvenile Hormone is necessary for the life cycle process to occur in insects. Because Juvenile Hormone is responsible for the type of molt that the M. sexta is signaled to have, it was hypothesized in this experiment that the M. sexta would gain weight because its molt would continue to create a larger body, trying to transition to the next stage, however failing due to the hormone imbalance [Johnson: 2018]. The findings that weight is not significantly affected by the overproduction of Juvenile Hormone during metamorphosis is supported by recent and ongoing research about the effects of Juvenile Hormone on the life cycle process of insects.
	A study on Juvenile Hormone was conducted by Riddiford in 2010 on Drosophila melanogaster, also referred to as the fruit fly [Nijhout: 1974]. Because M. sexta and D. melanogaster have similar holometabolous life cycle, the results can be relayed to understand that processes that take place within the insects. The study found that those lacking Juvenile Hormone at a younger stage have abnormally small puparia [Nijhout: 1974]. However, when the D. melanogaster were introduced to Juvenile Hormone in their final instar, the attained normal weight [Nijhout: 1974]. This study found that Juvenile Hormone does not focus on the weight of the insect to continue the molts. Rather, it is critical for establishing growth rate to ensure that the insect remains proportional with working body parts to prevent malnutrition until the hormones have received information from a stimulus that it is possible to enter the 5th instar towards adulthood. In another study conducted by Cymborowski in 1982 once more suggests that weight gain is not a significant factor in the production of Juvenile Hormone for the life cycles of insects. In this study, the M. sexta in the experiment were starved for a total of five days beginning “…after ecdysis to the 5th instar” [Cymborowski: 1982]. Beginning on the fourth day, there was an increase in the amount of Juvenile Hormone present in the life cycle. In turn, causing a reduced and slowed growth process of the M. sexta [Cymborowski: 1982]. The increased amount of Juvenile Hormone on the fifth day, in which metamorphosis takes place, was prevented because it inhibited the ability of PTTH and ecdysterone to flourish in the system. Once more suggesting that Juvenile Hormone is critical to the regulation of proportionate growth rather than the regulation of the overall size of the insect, for example, weight. 
	Error was present in the experiment based on construction of the feeding containers. There were several instances in which one M. sexta had breeched the barrier and entered the side of the other in that container. This behavior was demonstrated in treatment number 3 crawling into the cage of treatment number 4, control number one entering the side of control number 2, and control number 3 entering the side of number four twice. Each time this occurrence was noticed, minor structural repairs were performed. In this situation, the control group and the experiment group were not compromised because they were eating the same type of food. However, it is uncertain if one caterpillar received more food that the other by actively feeding on the wrong side. Though only placed together for a short time, this finding could have caused the M. sexta to gain weight evenly and had a slight skew on the results. For this reason, it would be appropriate to maintain another sample of M. sexta to have a basis to compare. 
	In summation, the holometabolous life cycle demonstrated in the M. sexta caterpillar is an important process that provides information on the effects of hormones in controlling bodily processes and development. Though the hypothesis of the experiment was disproved by the two-sample t-test, it suggests that the Juvenile Hormone has many significant effects on the insect including the type of molt it undergoes, the size of the insect when it molt and regulates steady growth throughout the process. With an increasing global population size, mass farming is a necessity to provide goods to the public. However, pesticides that allow larger crop yields could cause significant damage to the surrounding ecosystems. Therefore, the study of the hormones within insects and how they are affected by environmental stimuli is important to learn to produce products that are both safe for the environment and provide significant agricultural benefits.
