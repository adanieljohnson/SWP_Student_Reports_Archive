Title: Aggressive behavior in male Betta splendins does not correlate with scale color

Abstract:
Understanding animal behaviors can provide valuable insight into the behavioral factors that shaped species evolution. Behaviors influencing reproductive choices and success are especially important to consider when evaluating the influence of behaviors on selection and fluctuating allele frequencies in a population. Males of the model species Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish) display varying levels of aggressive behaviors and eventually fight each other when they come into contact. Wild male betta fish display brightly colored scales when fighting with each other, and here we test whether one scale color is associated with increased display of aggressive behaviors. Red and blue male beta fish were presented with another male of the same color through a glass barrier and the amount of aggressive behaviors in five minutes were counted, as well as the amount of time before first aggressive behavior display. The results show that there is no difference between number of aggressive behaviors or time to first aggressive behavior in male betta fish of different colors. More work investigating the link between color and aggressive behavior is critical to understand the mechanisms permitting the persistence of differently colored betta fish in wild populations.

Introduction:
Populations adapt when allele frequencies change in response to selective pressures. The behavior of organisms within the population—especially behaviors relating to mate choices that influence reproductive success—can strongly influence long-term adaptations in a population. Understanding how particular reproductive behaviors function in a population can thus provide valuable insight into how behavioral factors shaped species evolution.
One model for understanding how reproductive behavior influenced species evolution is the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins). To best position themselves to find a mate and to protect already fertilized eggs deposited in nests, male betta fish will fight with each other after displaying aggressive behaviors in increasing intensity. After seeing another male, a wild betta fish’s scales will change to bright colors and the fish will begin displaying aggressive facing and broadside behaviors. The facing behaviors, in increasing intensity, include displaying an erect pectoral fin, spreading gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes under the gill covers. The broadside behaviors, in increasing intensity, include pelvic fin flickering, sudden tail movements (tail beating), and closing and opening the caudal fin (tail flashing). When fighting, the males will lock jaws and spin vertically, causing significent harm to each other. This aggressive behavior allows the males to compete with each other for mates [Johnson: 2018].
Male betta fish have many possible aggression-induced scale colors which can be described as either a blue or red morph [Clotfelter et al: 2007]. If color and increased aggressive behaviors are linked, this could suggest that scale color linked to aggression provides some reproductive advantage that could have influenced the adaptation of the species as a whole. Here, we test whether differently colored fish also display differing levels of aggression. 


Materials and Method:
Aggressive behavior display assays were adapted from [Johnson: 2018]. Male fish (Betta splendins) were placed in a tank with opaque and glass barriers separating them. Both fish in each experiment were the same color; there were four replicates with red fish and four with blue fish. After being allowed to rest for two to three minutes, the opaque barrier was removed so the two fish could see each other. Their behavior was observed for five minutes. The number of times broadside (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) and facing (erect pectoral fins, spreading of gill covers, and protrusion of branchiostegal membranes) aggressive movements occurred was recorded, as well as the amount of time it took for the fish to display that behavior for the first time. 
Fish that only displayed one type of behavior one time or did not exhibit any aggressive behaviors were excluded from analysis. The average number of facing movements and broadside movements for red and blue fish, as well as the average time for the first facing or broadside movement to occur were calculated. A two-sample two-tailed t test was used to compare the average number of facing or broadside movements or the average time to first broadside or facing aggressive movement between red and blue fish.


Results:
Fish scale color does not affect number of facing and broadside movements
The number of times red and blue fish displayed facing and broadside movements when exposed to each other through a glass barrier were counted for five minutes. The average number of facing movements displayed by red fish was 8 ± 8.37 and by blue fish was 12.33 ± 10.78. A two-sample two-tailed t test comparing the average number of facing movements between red and blue fish yielded a p value of 0.52. The average number of facing movements displayed by red fish was 5.75 ± 5.5 and by blue fish was 10 ± 10.58.  A two-sample two-tailed t test comparing the average number of broadside movements between red and blue fish yielded a p value of 0.49 (Figure 1).
Fish scale color does not affect time to display aggressive movements
The number of times red and blue fish displayed facing and broadside movements when exposed to each other through a glass barrier were counted for five minutes. The average time to first display of facing movements by red fish was 50 ± 47.6 seconds and by blue fish was 35.83 ± 41.76 seconds. A two-sample two-tailed t test comparing the average time to display first facing movements between red and blue fish yielded a p value of 0.63. The average time to first display of facing movements by red fish was 100.5 ± 120.56 seconds and by blue fish was 30.5 ± 9.99 seconds.  A two-sample two-tailed t test comparing the average time to display first facing movements between red and blue fish yielded a p value of 0.18 (Figure 2).


Discussion:
These results suggest that scale color is nor correlated with the amount of aggressive behavior displayed by male betta fish. The number of aggressive behaviors displayed, as well as the time to first aggressive behavior displayed, varied widely among fish of each color. This is likely due both to natural variation in willingness to display aggressive behaviors when presented with another male and a result of habituation of the fish used in the experiment. When presented frequently with other males, male betta fish respond with fewer aggressive behaviors than if they had not seen a male betta fish for a long time [Figler: 1972]. Because the betta fish used in these experiments had been repeatedly exposed to other males in the days preceding the experiments, habituation likely contributed to the large variation in aggressive behaviors displayed.
Any wild natural variation in aggressive behaviors, as well as the lack of difference in aggressive behavior displays between fish of different color morphs, could have several evolutionary explanations. Color influences both biochemical and behavior phenotypes, and differences in other phenotypes linked to color could explain why both color morphs have persisted in the betta populations. First, female betta fish have been shown to prefer association with other fish that are similarly colored to them [Blakeslee et al: 2007]. In addition, compounds contributing to scale color called carotenoids also contribute to immune response. One study found that blue bettas have fewer carotenoids and divert those available to immune responses instead of scale color. However, this same study also found that females prefer to associate with more red bettas [Clotfelter et al: 2007]. From these data, there is no indication that blue betta fish have a selective advantage that has allowed their alleles to persist in the population. Therefore, it is critical to obtain more information about the aggressive behaviors of differently colored betta morphs to understand the evolutionary and genetic relationships between immune response, scale color, aggressive behaviors, and mating choice that could explain how blue bettas have persisted in the population.
