Title: The Effects of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Blocker on Skeletal Muscle

Abstract:
This experiment was designed to test the effects of Gallamine Triethiodide, a nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, on the stimulation of a frog's gastrocnemius muscle. Blocking the ACh receptors would hinder an action potential from being generated. If a nicotinic ACh receptor blocker is used to treat the specimen, a more powerful stimulation for the muscle to contract is required. 2 mL (1mm) of Gallamine Triethiodide was injected using a needle into the gastrocnemius muscle of two frogs. The tests showed that the outcomes of the control and variable are statistically significant. The results found that the original hypothesis is correct, and that the function of ACh receptor is needed to open the sodium channels to create an action potential.

Introduction:
 "Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of calcium ions from internal storage sites (the sarcoplasmic reticulum). The release of calcium ions activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten." (BIO 114 Lab Manual, 17)
If a nicotinic Ach receptor antagonist is injected into the frog's gastrocnemius, then the baseline threshold is increased.


Materials and Methods:
After putting on gloves, we gently removed the skin from the frog leg. Then, using the surgical scissors, we detached the gastrocnemius muscle by severing the tissue just below the Achilles tendon. To secure the leg, we pinned the femoral muscles (avoiding nerves), then using string, we suspended the Achilles tendon to the force transducer. Next, we attached the probes. 
In order to keep the tissues moist, we periodically applied frog Ringer's solution. Keeping the tissues moist with the isotonic solution allows for easier transport of ions. 
Starting at 0.1 volts and increasing the amplitude at a rate 0.01, we stimulated the frog leg until a baseline of muscle contraction was found. We measured a total of 5 myograms for each frog leg. Next, we injected the frog leg with 2 mL (1 mili-mol) of a nicotinic ACh receptor blocker. (We waited 10 minutes after applying the blocker to allow it to set.) Then we repeated the process of finding the threshold baseline of muscle contraction.
To analyze the data, we calculated the mean from each frog's control and treatment trial amplitude, used a two-sample t-test, and took the standard deviation.


Results:
The mean threshold of the control (0.144 +/- 3E-05) of the first frog leg was significantly lower different than and in the treatment (0.236 +/- 3E-05). Similarly, the mean of the control in the second frog leg (0.194 +/- 3E-05) was significantly lower from the treatment (0.252 +/- 2E-05). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis is supported, as represented in both frog legs, the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist-treated muscles required a higher amplitude to produce a measurable contraction, as represented in the myogram. In order for the muscle to contract, an action potential is required. ACh is needed to bind to its receptor, which opens the sodium channels that generate an action potential. However, in the presence of a channel blocker, the ACh is unable to bind with its receptor, so an action potential is not generated. This experiment showed that the inhibitor blocks several, but not all of the ACh receptors, which explains why the threshold is higher in the treated group. 
This study brings a deeper understanding of the components in the generation of an action potential, specifically the neurotransmitter ACh.
