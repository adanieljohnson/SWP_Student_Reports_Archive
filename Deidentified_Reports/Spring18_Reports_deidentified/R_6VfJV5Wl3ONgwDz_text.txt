Title: How does JH affect growth in Manduca Sexta caterpillars?

Abstract:
This experiment was performed in order to find out the effects of JH (Precor) on insect development. Four out of eight of a group of Manduca Sexta caterpillars were given a diet of food treated with Precor at the concentration of 1.1250 for a week while the other four caterpillars were on a diet treated with diH20. The Precor decreased the weight and growth of the caterpillar, while the controll group only got larger. The JH or Precor inhibits the growth of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar.


Introduction:
Ecdysterone, or 20E (20-hydroxyecdysone), is a hormone secreted by the Prothoracic Gland is a regulator for the timing of the molting within an insect [Johnson 2018]. JH or Juvenile Hormone is secreted from the corpus allata, JH “regulates the type of molt” [Johnson 2018]. Both JH and Ecdysterone work together for the development of an insect, if the concentrations are altered, it will determine the developmental stage of the insect [Johnson 2018].
	Precor is classified as an insect growth regulator (IGR) and JH, it prevents the maturation of an insect.
	In the study Effects of the Synthetic Insect Growth Regulators Methoprene and Hydroprene on Survival, Development or Reproduction of Six Species of Stored-products Insects [Loschiavo 1976], it showed that “Methoprene (another name for Juvenile Hormone) at one ppm or higher prevented emergence of adults of Oryzaephilus mercator (Fauvel), and O. surinamensis (L.) in treated rolled oats or cornmeal.” [Loschiavo 1976]. This study therefore shows that Precor (another type of JH) prevents the growth of insects.
	In this experiment, I will be using the Manduca Sexta, also known as the “tobacco hornworm” to replicate a similar experiment. I will be recording the weight of 8 caterpillars as well as observing them. Four caterpillars will be given normal food and four caterpillars will be in the experimental group with food treated with a concentration of Precor (1.1250). The independent variable for the experiment is the food while the dependent variable is the caterpillar growth. The null hypothesis is by giving the caterpillar JH hormone, caterpillar growth will show no change, while the alternative hypothesis is that the caterpillar growth will change/ be affected. My hypothesis is if the Manduca sexta consumes JH the growth will change.


Materials and Method:
There will be 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars. Select 4 of the caterpillars in the group will be the in the controll group. Each of the caterpillars in the controll group will have 10 grams of food treated with 10 drops of diH20. 2 caterpillars each of the controll group will be in a container separated by index card.
	The other four caterpillars will be in the experimental group. Each of the caterpillars in the experimental group will also receive 10 grams of food each but instead the food is treated with ten drops of Precor (concentration 1: 1250). There will be 2 of the experimental group each in a container separated by an index card.
	Do initial weights of each caterpillar before placing in containers, and then put the caterpillars in fridge and come back to for the next seven days to get the weights of the caterpillar.
	Each day put ten drops of diH20 in the controll’s group food and 10 drops of Precor in the experimental group’s food each day. Replace food if necessary.


Results:
The results of the growth rate between the controll group and experimental group is displayed in the line as graph as well. The average for the controll group is 4.6675 grams with N =8 with a standard deviation of 4.11.
	The average for the experimental group is 2.04 grams, N=8, with a standard deviation of 1.23. Finally, in conclusion, the d.f. (degrees of freedom) is 14, the t-value is at 1.73, and the P-value is .104784.


Discussion:
With the average for the controll group being 4.6675 grams being larger than the average for the controll group (2.04 grams), it is proven that JH does affect the growth rate of the Manduca Sexta. The p_value is .104784 thereby showing that the information is not statistically significent. This means the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted. However, since this is a smaller sample size N=8 it might be harder to prove the null hypothesis.
	The explanation for why the controll group is bigger than the experiment is due to the fact it was not given Precor, so maturation was not inhibited. The experimental is so small due to the chemical ratio imbalance of the JH (precor) and ecdysterone. 
	Another reason that they are smaller is due to the critical period/ switch hypothesis, which states depending when an insect receives JH it will become another form of itself (Larva final-1 -> Larva final).
	Another study conducted that is analogous to my study is by S.R. Loschiavo testing the effects of synthetic IGR methoprene and hydroprene for survival [ Loschiavo 1976]. JH or methoprene and hydroprene were used in the diet of the six species of stored product insects ( 1, 5, 10, 20 ppm). At 20 ppm, there was a prevention of emergence of pupae [Loschiavo 1976].
	Methoprene at 1ppm prevented the emergence of adults which is similar to my study as the JH affected caterpillar did not pupate or fully grow into an adult.
	Overall the hypothesis stands true if the Manduca sexta is given Precor it will remain in the same stage and will have no growth. This all relates back to JH that regulates the type of molt and determines what the Manduca Sexta will become [Johnson 2018].
