Title: The Effect of a Change in Water Color on the Agonistic Behavior of Two Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Agonistic behavior in animals is a broad term that refers to any social behavior related to aggression, fighting, and threats. Agonistic behavior does not require contact between two animals, as territorial displays and threats fall under the umbrella term. Our experiment was designed to observe the agnostic displays of male Betta splenden fish, with a specific focus on how a change in water color effects intraspecific threat behavior. To quantify this behavior, we assigned aggression scores to common agnostic displays such as tail beating, Red Mane flashing, and pelvic fin flicking, and then observed how many times each behavior occurred in clear and blue water over a five-minute period. We did not find a significent difference in their behavior between the clear and blue water, but their behavior was clearly altered by the color change. The change in their behavior can be attributed to their poor eyesight, as their lack of proper depth perception made them more prone to actual combat, instead of display behaviors, in the blue water. Our experiment highlights the necessity of agnostic displays, as their inability to perceive the potential threat of the other male increased the chances of them engaging in combat and risking injury as well as depletion of their energy stores.  

Introduction:
Agonistic behaviors are necessary because limited resources, mates, and shelter are a constant threat to the survival of an individual animal. Male Betta splenden’s have been especially prone to agnostic behaviors since they were first discovered, and these behaviors have been exacerbated through centuries of breeding aimed at increasing the inherent aggression of male Bettas (Mise, 1910). The aim of our experiment was to investigate the benefits of threat behaviors. Betta splenden’s have monocular vision, meaning they can see in two different directions, but their depth perception is quite poor. Changes in brightness severely inhibits the Betta’s ability to see because their irises adjust very slowly (Baenninger, 2008). Therefore, we assumed that changing the water color in their tank would significently impair a male’s ability to see and perceive the threat behaviors of another male. We predicted that this impairment would make the fish more docile and placid. We hypothesized that they would exhibit significently less agnostic threat behaviors due to this impairment of their perception. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment requires four male Betta fish and two freshwater tanks with at least three compartments that can be separated by an opaque screen.  One of the compartments is to be filled with blue water, and all other five compartments are to be filled with clear water. The four main agnostic behaviors displayed by male Betta fish are pelvic fin flicking, protrusion of their Red Mane, tail beating, and tail flashing. To create a system that would allow us to quantify the aggressive behaviors of the Betta fish, we assigned progressive scores to each behavior. The resource guide informed us that Betta’s will display different behaviors depending on the level of aggression they feel. Pelvic fin flicking was assigned a score of 1, tail beating a score of 2, and Red Mane protrusion and tail flashing a score of 3. We first placed two males in the same clear water compartment for one five-minute round and recorded the quantity of each agnostic behavior. These males were then returned to their individual clear water compartments to rest. While the first pair was resting, we placed the other pair of fish in the same clear water compartment. After a five-minute round, they were returned to their individual clear water compartments. Next, we placed the original pair of fish in blue water for five minutes, and then placed the other pair in blue water for five minutes. Once we measured the frequency of each behavior in the two types of water, we multiplied the frequency of a specific behavior by it’s aggression score. We then ran a paired T-test (P=.162, T=1.849, d.f.=3) comparing each individual fish’s total aggression score in blue water versus clear water.  

Results:
With P=.162, T=1.849, and d.f.=3, the results of our statistical analyses indicate that there was not a significent difference in the agnostic behaviors of male Betta splenden’s when interacting in clear water versus blue water. However, the fish tended to interact differently in the two types of water, with the average aggression score of the four fish varying by five (Figure 1). In blue water, they were less prone to engaging in agnostic threat behaviors. However, they were more likely to engage in actual combat. 

Discussion:
While the variance in their behavior was not significent enough to support our hypothesis, their behavior clearly was affected by the color change. Our experiment and accuracy of our results was limited by our small sample size. Animal behavior is not a constant, perfectly replicable experimental subject, and numerous interactions must be observed to garner accurate data. Still, however, our results indicate a trend. In the clear water, one of the males would succumb to the threats of the other male’s behaviors before they actively engaged in combat. The smaller, or less threatening male would back down and retreat to their space within the compartment. The dark blue color of the variable water diminished the refraction of light through the material. The Betta’s lack of depth perception, combined with their slowly adjusting irises, severely inhibited their ability to perceive each other in the blue water (Elwood, 1983). They did not exhibit the territorial behaviors until they were within striking distance of one another as they could not see the other male until close enough to attack. Hindering their perception made them more prone to actively engaging in combat. Because they could not see each other until they were within striking distance, they had no time to ward each other off. Their immediate reaction was to begin biting each other and they subsequently had to be separated. Our original assumption was that the hindrance of their perception would make the fish more docile and placid, as the Betta is a calm species when not in the presence of another male. However, when tested, the color change had the opposite effect. Our results convey the necessity of perception and warning signals in the Betta social community. The intricate threat signals that occur between two males in close proximity allow them to gauge, interpret, and react to the perceived size and strength of another male. When their perception is hindered, this complex social interaction breaks down and the fish are forced to resort to actual violence. The results of our experiment have far reaching implications about the nature of agnostic social interaction in the animal community. It shows that threat behavior and warning signals are essential to the conservation of energy and the avoidance of actual violence between two members of the same species.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: This graph shows the mean aggression score of two male Betta splendins interacting in clear water versus interacting in blue water. The average score for those interacting in clear water was 12.938 and the average score for those in blue water was 8. Standard deviation was 6.25. P=.162, T=1.849, and Df=3, indicating that the difference in their scores was not significent.
