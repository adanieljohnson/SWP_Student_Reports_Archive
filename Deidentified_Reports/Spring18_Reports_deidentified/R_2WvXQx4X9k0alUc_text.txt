Title: The Effect of Positive and Negative Charges on Physarum polycephalum Movement

Abstract:
Organisms usually communicate through cell signaling. In this experiment, we observed how a certain factor caused Physarum to respond through cell signaling pathways. The hypothesis of the experiment is, if the Physarum polycephalum are put in a well of the agarose gel in the gel electrophoresis tank, then it will be repelled by the negative charge and respond by moving towards the positive end. The method for determining the response to the electrical stimulation is by measuring the directionality and distance the Physarum travel in the agarose gel at 23 volts. The data collected from the experiment is compared to the data of the phototactic controll. The phototactic controll is data taken from a previous experiment. Physarum was in a well of a Petri dish kept in a dark cabinet which allowed natural growth towards a food source without any interference from an outside factor impacting movement. After the conclusion of the experiment, it appeared that the Physarum traveled towards the negative end of the agarose gel which was contrary to what was predicted. Though there was a consistent growth trend towards the negative charge, the results of the experiment suggest that there is no significent movement towards the positive or negative charges with respect to Physarum mobility.

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to both their internal environment and the external environment. The model organism for this experiment is the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The reason that this is our model organism is because we can view and discover a multitude of cellular level processes without the use of a microscope. Signal transduction mechanisms in Physarum are similar to human and other eukaryotic cells as well. Physarum is different from other unicellular organisms as it does not use a nervous system or hormones to detect and react to the environment. Each response is directed by an intracellular signal transduction pathway. This intracellular signal transduction pathway generally goes through three steps. The first step being that an external or internal stimulus activates a protein. The next step is that the activated molecule causes either the formation or the release of a second messenger. The final step is that the second messenger binds with an effector for the purpose of creating a change in behavior, or in our case, a response [Johnson: 2018]. We are measuring the distance and directionality that the slime molds undergo. For this experiment, gel electrophoresis is used. Gel electrophoresis is usually used for the purposes of separating mixtures of DNA, RNA, or proteins based on their molecular sizes. They are pushed through the small pores of the agarose gel by the electrical field generated from the positive and negative ends [Cleveland: 1976]. In gel electrophoresis tanks, there is a positive charge. This positive stimulation acts like an attractant causing the Physarum to move towards it. On the other hand, the negative charge actually inhibits movement in the organism [Whiting: 2014]. The hypothesis of the experiment is, if the Physarum polycephalum are put in a well of the agarose gel in the gel electrophoresis tank, then it will be repelled by the negative charge and respond by moving towards the positive end. The independent variables of this study are the positive charge and the negative charge. The dependent variables of the study are the direction and the distance that the Physarum grow.

Materials and Method:
The first step in the procedure is growing a healthy Physarum culture. Next, set up a gel electrophoresis tank [Smithies: 1959]. Dip a spatula into ethanol and then light the end of it with an open flame. Following this step, make sure the spatula is cool enough to cut 3 1 x 1 cm2 equidistant squares straight down the middle in the agarose gel. Remove these blocks with flame sterilized forceps and dispose of them in a proper waste container. Return both the spatula and forceps to the ethanol. After a Physarum culture has been grown, there should be 3 1 x 1 cm2 equidistant squares cut from this culture plate. These squares should be cut with a spatula that has been dipped in ethanol and then lit with an open flame. Once the spatula cools off, then the blocks can be cut [Johnson: 2018]. Forceps are to be flame sterilized as well in order to remove the Physarum squares from the culture. Place these Physarum blocks in the wells created of the agarose gel. Evenly distribute oatmeal flakes on the agarose gel. Make sure to have six flakes for each Physarum block. Three should be going in the direction of the positive charge, and the other three should be going in the direction of the negative charge. The oatmeal flakes should be equidistant from each other, between 2-3 cm apart. The flakes of oatmeal also account for the confounding variable of the Physarum moving towards a food source. Fill each side well of the gel electrophoresis setup with 1x SB buffer. Keep in mind that the buffer should not be overlaying the agarose gel because this may affect the Physarum activity with respect to it moving towards a positive or negative charge. Set the apparatus to a voltage of 23 V. This is the lowest possible voltage setting so that the Physarum is not overwhelmed with the charge. Let the Physarum sit in the gel electrophoresis tank for 24 hours. Once the experiment comes to completion, the distances and the directionality of the Physarum are recorded. From these values, an average is calculated in order to analyze and use it for the results. The values calculated from the experiment are compared to the values of a phototactic controll. The phototactic controll data was from a previous experiment performed in which the Physarum was in a well of a Petri dish that was kept in a dark cabinet. This allowed the Physarum to grow naturally towards a food source without an outside factor having an effect on the movement. In a neutral environment Physarum use cytoplasmic streaming to move in a general direction. Cytoplasmic streaming is sending cytoplasm in a direction in order to move the organism. For example, if there is sunlight present, the cytoplasm will recognize that a negative stimulus is present and move away from it. Also, if there is a food source present, the cytoplasm will recognize that there is a positive stimulus present and move towards it. The statistical tests used are a one-tailed t_test and a chi-squared test. 

Results:
The overall trend of movement was towards the negative charge in the gel electrophoresis tank. The distances of the Physarum movement were measured and the average distance traveled was calculated. The results of the experiment are displayed in Figure 2. The growth of the gel electrophoresis trials (12.3 ± 9.61) was less than the growth of the phototactic controll trials (15.7 ± 4.04). In Figure 2, the error bars overlap meaning that the data is not significent. The values of the raw data were taken and used in a one-tailed t_test. The result from the one-tailed t_test gave a p_value of 0.609 which tells us that the data is not significent because the p_value is greater than 0.05. Our chi-squared test gave us a p_value of 0.042 which tells us that the data is significently not what we expected as a chi-squared test tests a neutral outcome against the actual outcome of the results. 

Discussion:
To conclude, the hypothesis for the experiment was not supported, but the null hypothesis was supported by the data collected. A one tailed t_test was conducted and the p_value was 0.609. With the p_value showing insignificance, this suggests that there was no significent movement towards the positive or negative ends of the gel electrophoresis tank when comparing the electrophoresed growth to the phototactic controll growth. With regard to this, there was a consistent growth trend towards the negative charge, inversely, there was no movement towards the positive charge. An overlap in error bars also shows that the data was not significent. A chi-squared test was carried out. In this test, it is expected that if charge has no effect on movement, then there would be movement in equal directions. This data was taken and tested against what our data showed which was three movements towards the negative end and no movement towards the positive end. The p_value from the chi-squared test is 0.042 which is significent since it is greater than 0.05. What exactly is significent is that what we had hypothesized did not occur and the significance lies in what we did not expect. Another way to state this was that the movement in equal directions, which was not hypothesized, is what is significent and not the growth in the negative direction. The results showed that there was movement towards the negative charge rather than the positive charge. The reason for this may be that the Physarum contains a positively charged portion to it [McMaster: 1977]. This would make sense as it moves towards the negative charge. This is due to the attraction between opposing forces. A source of error in the experiment was that there was an outlier in the gel electrophoresis data. This value was very low and had an impact on the average distance that the Physarum grew. If the outlier was dismissed from the data, the p_value would increase meaning that there would be more insignificance amongst all of the data points. This insignificance shows even more of a consistent growth towards the negative charge. We determined that this value is an outlier because it is outside of three standard deviations. The reason that it was kept in our data analysis is because with such a low number of replicates, removing one data point out of a set of three would make the results less reliable due to an even less number of replicates. An improvement to this study would be to increase the amount of time that the gel electrophoresis was left at a low voltage. The purpose for this would be to see if there is an increase in the movement of Physarum with the possibility of eliminating outliers by giving them more of a chance to grow. The reason that this experiment is important is because it delves into signal transduction pathways. The reason that these are important is because once a signal is received in a cell from an external source, it needs to be effectively transmitted in order to have an appropriate response in the cell. It was an important experiment especially because we came up with this interesting way to further interrogate this one mechanism and see how something as out-of-the-box as charge could affect the movement of Physarum. For further testing, it would be interesting to look at the relationship between increasing voltage and the speed of the Physarum movement.
