Title: Manduca Sexta Molting in Response to Ecdysone-Blocking Hormone

Abstract:
The juvenile hormone and ecdysone hormone are vital to the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. This experiment involves the Manduca Sexta caterpillars and how they will be effected by an ecdysone-blocking hormone in their diet. The hypothesis is that the addition of the Ecdysone-blocking hormone, AZAMAX, will successfully prevent the Manduca Sexta from progressing through the stages of molting, and in addition, will not grow as well as the controll group. They will be monitored over the course of seven days and their daily weights will be recorded. A statistical test was used to analyze the data and found that there was statistically significent evidence that our hypothesis is supported by our data. In conclusion, these results show some correlation to other studies and they indicate the significance of this hormone to the insect’s life. 


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is an insect that grows and develops through a four-stage life cycle. These phases are known as: Egg/Embryo, Larvae, Pupa, and Adult [Johnson: 2018]. In order to progress through these stages, the insect experiences natural occurrences of the Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysone. The Juvenile Hormone acts in order to controll the type of molt while it is in its developmental stages [“Insect Hormones”: 2016]. In addition to the Juvenile Hormone, the Ecdysone hormone helps to determine the timing of the insect’s molting. Furthermore, it is altogether imperative for ecdysone to be present in order to stimulate normal tissue growth; however, if there are high concentrations of ecdysone it could hinder the growth of these tissues [Grunet, Clarke, Ahuja, Eswaran, Nijhout: 2015]. The insect will not be able to develop, molt, form a pupa, or emerge as an adult without the existence of these two hormones working together [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment will use an Ecdysone-blocking hormone, called AZAMAX, in the daily diets of the Manduca Sexta in order to see if the overall development and molting of the insects is affected. The hypothesis is that the addition of the Ecdysone-blocking hormone will successfully prevent the Manduca Sexta from progressing through the stages of molting, and in addition, it will not grow as well as the controll group. 


Materials and Method:
The insects will be split into two groups of four; one being the controll group and one being the treatment group. The caterpillars will be kept in containers with two per container and will be separated with a note card. Additionally, they will all be kept in an incubator to ensure they endure the same living conditions with twelve-hour light and dark cycles. Each day every caterpillar will be given ten grams of food. The controll group will get ten grams of food plus eight drops of water while the treatment group will get ten grams of food and eight drops of AZAMAX. Their weight will be measured daily and any changes in overall appearance will be noted. In order to check the effectiveness of the Ecdysone-blocking hormone, a one tailed t test will be used to check for statistical significance between the mean weight gains of the controll and treatment groups.


Results:
The initial weights of the Manduca Sexta were all relatively similar; however, by the end of the experiment it was clear that there was a significent difference in the overall weight gains between the controll and treatment groups (Refer to Figure 1 and 2). This is evident upon comparison of the mean weight gains for the two groups. The mean weight gain of the controll group was 5.425 grams while the mean weight gain of the treatment group was -0.300 grams indicating that the caterpillars lost weight (Refer to Figure 1). In addition, we found our p_value to be 0.00272; this indicates that there is statistically significent evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The Manduca Sexta caterpillars that were fed the Ecdysone-blocking hormone did not look as healthy as the caterpillars that ate the Manduca Great Lakes diet, and they did not grow as much. 


Discussion:
The goal of the experiment is to be able to determine how much of an effect the Ecdysone-blocking hormone has on the overall growth and development of a Manduca Sexta caterpillar by comparing the mean weight gains of the treatment and controll groups. After performing a one tailed t_test, there is statistically significent evidence that proves that the mean weight gain of the Manduca Sexta group that was fed the Ecdysone-blocking hormone is less than the mean weight gain of the Manduca Sexta in the group with a normal diet. This means that the null hypothesis can be rejected (p = 0.00272). It can be inferenced that the ecdysone-blocking hormone did have an effect on the growth and development of the treatment group caterpillars and interfered with their continuation with the molting stages. A study by Judith H. Willis showed that ecdysone has actually been found to hinder the sexual maturation in adult females. In addition, the same study found that there are very few activities that the Juvenile hormone is able to accomplish without the presence of Ecdysone; this suggest the importance of the role that Ecdysone has in an insect’s life [Willis: 1974]. In a broader spectrum, this matters due to the fact that even slight disruptions in these insects lifestyle can drastically effect the quality of life of these caterpillars.
