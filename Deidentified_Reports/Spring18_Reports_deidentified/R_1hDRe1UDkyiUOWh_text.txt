Title: Muscle Contraction under the effects of Calcium Channel Activator

Abstract:
The Rania pipiens, the northern leopard frog, has legs that are function similarly to that of muscles found humans in the regard that they are controllled by levels of calcium. In the presence of higher levels of calcium, it is known that this stimulates muscle contraction by reacting with regulatory proteins (troponin) which stimulate actin and myosin filaments in muscle to contract and relax accordingly. In this experiment, a calcium channel activator A23187 was injected into 3 Rania pipien legs and the contraction period was determined. It was concluded that A23187 did have an effect on the frog legs through the found p_value of 0.013. However, it was found that A23187 shortened the overall period of contraction in the experimental group as opposed to prolonging contraction as expected. This may have occurred because the influx of calcium channel activator acted upon the sarcoplasmic reticulum releasing too much calcium causing fatigue or desensitization in the frog leg. 



Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow for an organism to interact and respond to the environment and other external stimuli in a very quick manner. Different from hormone systems, the neuromuscular system is composed of myofibrils which allows for communication amongst muscle cells. Furthermore, the axons of motor neurons are myelinated with Schwann cells which allows for quick propagation of an action potential. This process of quick propagation leads to quick muscle response and therefore can be broken down into 4 different sections: Stimulus, Response, Work, Summation, and Tetanus. Also, it is known that nerve impulses in the form of action potentials cause the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic terminal which can then stimulate the opening of Calcium ion channels from the sarcoplasmic reticulum allowing for muscle contractions. In an experiment done by Masayoshi Uehata et al., a pyridine derivative was used to selectively inhibit smooth muscle contraction by inhibiting calcium ion sensitization in an organism. [Masayoshi Uehata, 1997]. We hypothesize that by injecting 100 millimolar of A23187, a calcium activator, into Rania pipiens, then we will see prolonged muscle contraction due to a greater influx of Calcium ions into the muscle cells. 


Materials and Method:
First, 3 Rania Pipien frog legs were obtained and prepared for stimulation by the transducer. In each frog leg threshold and contraction length period for each contraction was recorded. After, each frog leg was injected with 1 Ml of 100 millimolar A23187, a calcium channel activator, and was allowed to sit for 1 minute before redetermining threshold and entire contraction length in each leg. The data was recorded and analyzed with the use of a paired t_test in order to determine the effects of calcium channel activator on Rania pipiens. 


Results:
When performing the paired t_test, it is found that the degrees of freedom were 2 while the t-value  is a value of 8.68 giving an overall p_value of 0.013. It was also observed that muscle contraction length appeared to decrease through repetitive firing of the stimulus. Muscle contractions also appeared to be less violent after the injection of 100 millimolar of A23187.


Discussion:
In this experiment, it is hypothesized that by adding 100 millimolar of A23187 to the treatment group would prolong overall muscle contraction in the frog legs of Rania pipiens. The hypothesis was not supported because it was noted that the overall length of contraction in the controll group was much longer. While the experimental group showed a lower overall average length of muscle contraction. In the controll group, the average muscle contraction length was 355.66±35.44 milliseconds in the controll group and 291.66±23.09 milliseconds in the experimental group. The hypothesis was further unsupported because it was noted that the experimental group, after injection, exhibited less vigorous contractions. Furthermore, these results are shown from the results of the paired t_test as the p_value was found to be less than 0.05 with a value of 0.013 which indicates that the added calcium ion channel activator had some effect on the contraction of the muscles of the Rania pipiens. In this case however, it was seen that the channel activator made the muscle contraction shorter. In an experiment done by Szent-Györgyi, it was determined that calcium triggers contraction by reaction with regulatory proteins that in the absence of calcium prevent interaction of actin and myosin (Szent-Györgyi, 1975). This is an indicator that our experiment possibly had sources of error which could come from not injecting enough calcium channel activator into the experimental group. Furthermore, a technical error could have occurred in the transducer which could have caused the reading of inaccurate values. Also, the experimental group was performed on the same legs after the controll testing was done which could have cause fatigue in the legs. Therefore, through this particular performed experimental trial, it cannot be concluded that the injection of calcium channel activator will prolong the length of muscle contraction in Rania Pipiens as the data in this experiment concludes that calcium channel activator shortens the contraction period in the Rania Pipiens species.

The Control group (blue bars) show the three frog legs which were not injected with calcium channel activator. The experiment group (orange bars) are the three frog legs of which were injected with 100 millimolar A23187 calcium channel activator. The contraction length was measured with the use of the transducer. Each bar shows the actual contraction length found for each leg. Averages were not taken of contraction length. The Degrees of freedom were 2 while the t-value was found to be a value of 8.68 giving an overall p_value of 0.013.
