Title: Effects of Sevin (Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor) on the Minimum Threshold and Muscle Contraction Voltage in Rania pipiens' Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
There are many factors in the neuromuscular system that determine whether an action potential can be passed down the system and what the result of these signals will be. This experiment aims to investigate the effects of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (Sevin™) on the minimum threshold and muscle contraction voltage in Rania pipiens' (Northern leopard frog) gastrocnemus muscle. Sevin™ is an insecticide that contains carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), which can make acetylcholinesterase dysfunctional. Sevin™ was injected into the Rania pipiens' legs; the threshold and contraction voltages were then measured to compare with the voltages before injecting Sevin™. The biochemical effects of carbaryl on motor neurons and synapses are discussed. The hypothesis of this experiment -- that the threshold voltage will not be affected much; the muscle contraction voltage will decrease -- is supported by both the statistical test (paired t_test) and the experimental data. 

Introduction:
Another system that vertebrate and invertebrates use to respond to external and internal stimuli is the neuromuscular system. This experiment primarily focuses on skeletal muscles, which consist of hundreds to thousands of myofibers. These individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups. 
The contraction and relaxation of a single myofiber occur at the molecular and cellular level, thus making these activities hard to record. In this experiment, a myogram is used to record the different stages within a single muscle twitch by connecting a muscle to a force transducer which records the amount of force generated over a given time (Johnson: 2016).
One factor that affect the muscle contraction is the neurotransmitters. This experiment focuses on acetylcholine (Ach), which is one of the chemicals in the motor neurons that activates muscle contractions. When action potential reaches the end of the neuron, the vesicles that contain acetylcholine molecules merge to the presynaptic membrane and release the acetylcholine to the synapse. Acetylcholine molecules then bond to post-synaptic receptors; the action potential passes on and, eventually, causes muscle contraction (Jarrett, 1956, pp.243 - 254). During this process, an enzyme that breaks acetylcholine into acetate and choline - acetylcholinesterase - plays an important role. The primary role of acetylcholinesterase is to terminate the muscle contraction. Without acetylcholinesterase, acetylcholine will remain the in the synaptic cleft and overstimulate the receptors, which may cause to muscle to fatigue. The fatigue can be detected by the decrease in the muscle contraction voltage.
In this experiment, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Ache 2% Sevin™, is injected into Rania pipiens' (Northern leopard frog) legs, specifically to the gastrocnemus. The active ingredient in Sevin™is carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), a chemical that can prevent the acetylcholinesterase from breaking acetylcholine into acetate and choline. Under normal condition, the acetylcholine will be released when action potentials are generated and be taken back to pre-synaptic cell after being broken down by acetylcholinesterase. However, since the function of acetylcholinesterase is interrupted by Sevin™ (Winteringham and Fowler, 1966), the used acetylcholine cannot be taken back normally. Thus, the hypothesis of this experiment is that the threshold voltage will not be affected much (since the threshold voltage happens in the pre-synaptic cells while Sevin™is effective in the synaptic cleft and its later process); the muscle contraction voltage will decrease (since the muscle becomes fatigue due to the overstimulation). 


Materials and Method:
Dissecting the Gastrocnemius Muscle and Sciatic Nerve
	Three frog legs were obtained. The skin of the frog legs was pulled down with a pair of forceps grasp and hands (with gloves). After the skin was peeled, some Ringer's solution was used to moisten the leg. Gently separated the inner thigh muscle by using a dissecting probe and freed the white sciatic nerve from its connective tissue. 

Control Condition: Stimulate the Sciatic Nerve without AchE 2% Sevin™
	Open the stimulator controll panel by clicking Stimulator Preferences. Adjust the values for stimulus parameters, set Pulse amplitude (Amp) to 0.000V, Number of Pulses (#pulses) to 1, Frequency (F(Hz)) to 1, Pulse width (W) to 5ms. Then, click "Apply" to finalize the changes. Connect the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes to the BNC-banana adapter on the stimulator output and leave the sleeve electrodes on the nerve. Notice that the sleeve electrodes should not touch each other. Start the threshold voltage with 0.000V and increase the voltage in 0.1V increments; stop recording when a visible muscle twitch is seen. After the threshold voltage is found, stimulate the nerve three times to obtain three contraction voltage data. Drag the two lines in the voltage result graph to calculate the contraction voltage. Record all data in notebook.

Treatment Condition: Stimulate the Sciatic Nerve with AchE 2% Sevin™
	After a leg had gone through the Control Condition, it entered the Treatment Condition immediately. Inject 0.1Ml of AchE 2% Sevin™to the top and bottom part of the gastrocnemus muscle. Follow the previous section, "Stimulate the Sciatic Nerve without AchE 2% Sevin™," for the same stimulus parameters and procedures to send signals to the sciatic nerve. Record both minimum threshold voltage and contraction voltage data.

Disposal
	Clean all used equipment, such as the tray, the tweezer, and the probe, with soap and dry with paper towels. Dispose any materials that had contacted with the frog legs (including the frog legs themselves) into bio-disposal containers. Injection needle was discarded into its specific used needle box.   

Statistical Test
	The average of the minimum threshold (V) and contraction voltage (V) in both Control and Treatment are calculated. Two paired t_tests were done for: (1) minimum threshold voltage of controll versus treatment and (2) contraction voltage of controll versus treatment.


Results:
In the minimum threshold data, only Leg #2 showed an increase (increased from 0.0375V to 0.042V), the minimum threshold voltage for Leg #1 and #3 remained the same after injecting AchE inhibitor. In the contraction voltage data, all nine data from the three legs displayed a decrease after AchE inhibitor was injected. 



Discussion:
As shown in Figure 1., the mean minimum threshold voltage of the controll group was not statistically significently different from the mean of the treatment group (t_stat = 1.00, d.f. = 2, P = 0.42265). However, the mean contraction voltage of the controll group was statistically significently smaller than the mean of the treatment group (t_stat = 3.02, d.f. = 2, P = 0.02346). 
	The decrease of the contraction voltage can be explained by the effects of Sevin™. The active ingredient in Sevin™is carbaryl (1-napthyl-N-methylcarbamate) which is an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor that prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine to acetate and choline at the synapse, thus indirectly prevents the reuptake of acetylcholine (Schock, 2012). Acetylcholinesterase is responsible for breaking down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft so the contraction signal can be terminated. The biochemical mechanism of how carbaryl disrupts the nervous system is that it adds a carbamoyl moiety to the active site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, which prevents it from interacting with acetylcholine (Casarett and Doull's Toxicology, 1986, pp. 659 - 663). When the enzyme is inhibited, surplus acetylcholine builds up in the synapse, therefore the surplus acetylcholine overstimulates the post-synaptic neuron and causes fatigue. The fatigue of the neuromuscular system then causes a decrease in the muscle contraction voltage. With that being said, carbaryl only has an impact on acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and the interaction occurs in the synaptic cleft and affects the post-synaptic voltage, thus, in theory, the pre-synaptic threshold voltage should not be affected. The experimental data in Table 1 are coherent with the biochemical mechanism of carbaryl. Thus, the hypothesis of this experiment (threshold voltage may only experience small impact while the muscle contraction voltage may decrease) is supported by the results of this experiment.

Figure 1. Minimum threshold and mean contraction voltage of all three Rania pipiens leg samples. Since minimum threshold was measured once, an error bar is not shown. Also, contraction voltage for Rania pipiens Leg #1 was measured once, thus having an error bar of zero. Contraction voltages for Rania pipiens leg #2 and #3 were measured thrice and the means are presented in the graph.
