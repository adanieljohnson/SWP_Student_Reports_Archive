Title: Effect of Calcium Blocker (Lanthanum Chloride) on Muscle Contraction in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Calcium plays a key role in the contraction of muscles. The release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulation will trigger a shortening of the muscle fiber, causing a contraction.  In this experiment, we tested the effect of a calcium channel blocker on a species from the order of anura. By blocking the calcium channel, the hypothesis is that the leg will have a reduction in the muscle contraction and voltage because there are less action potentials being fired to stimulate the contraction of the muscle fiber. The experiment was repeated with three frog legs and trend was consistent. Through the experiment, it was observed that all control groups were higher in voltage when compared to their treatment parallels proving that lanthanum chloride did have a significant effect on the contraction of the muscle.  With this data and evidence that calcium blockers can help reduce muscle contractions, this concept, when applied to real life, could aid in the reduction of seizures and other involuntary muscle movements. (Meyer 2)

Introduction:
In both vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscle consists of cylindrical and multi-nuclear cells called myofibers. These myofibers are bound together through connective tissues to form groups that control skeletal muscles.  At points called  neuromuscular junctions, axons of motor neurons stimulate individual myofibers. The release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic terminal binds with a receptor of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that, in turn, generate action potentials in the muscle fiber. This action potential spreads through the fiber, triggering the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, then activating the contraction of the muscle fiber. (Johnson 18) To test the  neuromuscular junction connection with calcium, Lanthanum Chloride, a calcium blocker, was injected into a dissected frog leg. The hypothesis would be that Lanthanum Chloride will inhibit calcium in the neruomusuclar junction, reducing contractions and a decreased voltage in electrical signals sent through the frog leg. 

Materials and Methods:
With a total of three frog legs, each is tested at the lowest amplitude that would stimulate a response from the muscle. This is referred to as threshold. The threshold was multiplied by 1.25 for all three trials, with the first being the control, a regular frog leg, and the next sets being the treatment frogs, each injected with the calcium blocker. For each frog leg, the skin is removed and pulled off to reveal the muscle underneath. The frog legs had their inner thigh muscles separated to expose the sciatic nerve. Electrodes were placed in the gastroenteritis of the thigh and attached to the main apparatus. The contractions of the control and treatment groups were measured using a myogram to visualize the differences. This experiment was repeated three times. 

Results:
The trend depicted by Figure 1 shows that the control group has a much higher voltage charge than the treatment group, with an average difference of 0.07 volts. For each of the frog legs, the trend is consistent in the control being higher than the group treated with lanthanum chloride. According to Figure 2, the validity is ensured through the use of a T-test. 

Discussion:
In conclusion, the hypothesis was proven correct because the control group produced a greater contraction when compared with the treatment group. This concludes that lanthanum chloride caused a minimal contraction due to the blocking of calcium channels. According to Figure 1, the average voltage for the control was 0.137 volts while the treatment group was only 0.083 volts. Since this was consistent with all three groups, it proves that calcium plays a major role in muscle contraction. It also proves that calcium channel blockers are effective and can reduce muscle contractions. When applied to the real world, this calcium blocker experiment could aid in the research of the reduction of seizures on epileptic patients. If the calcium is inhibited in their muscles, it could result in a dramatic reduction of seizures.
