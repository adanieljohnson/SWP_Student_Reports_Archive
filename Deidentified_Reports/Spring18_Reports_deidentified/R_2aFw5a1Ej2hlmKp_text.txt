Title: Intraspecific Agonistic Behavior in Betta Fish Increases When Placed Back in Original Environment

Abstract:
Betta splendes are common aquarium fish that portray intraspecific behaviors. These fish were domesticated because of the love for the “fighting colors” they exhibit when they are displaying aggressive behaviors. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that two domesticated male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior towards each other when in clear water than in turbid water. This hypothesis was proven by the results of this experiment. In the turbid water the mean of the broadside movements was 24.67±2.082 while in the clear water it was 38.33±10.504. The mean for the facing movements in the turbid water was 20.33±13.50 while in the clear water it was 55±13.077. Both the broadside and facing movements were higher in the clear water than in the turbid water. The results of the paired t_test showed: t_stat=2.054792, d.f.=3, P=0.132155. The domestication of this fish has caused an increase in the aggressive behaviors of the betta fish. 

Introduction:
Intraspecific behavior in betta fish is when they display their vivid colors in the presence of other member of their own species. In this experiment the intraspecific behavior in these fish was studied to determine how domestication has change how often these fish display aggressive behaviors. Betta fish were originally found in Southeast Asia in sluggish or muddy waters. They were domesticated and now as a common household pet, they live in clear freshwater. It was hypothesized that two domesticated male betta fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior towards each other when in clear water than in turbid water. This was hypothesized because of the lack of oxygen in the turbid water. Although betta fish can live in turbid water due to their labyrinth organ, aggressive behavior requires a lot of oxygen. It is important for Betta fish to display aggression because in the animal kingdom, aggressive behavior plays a significent role in the fitness of animals [Nasim:2017]. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, the aggressive behaviors the betta fish displayed were being counted on a point system based on the behavior they exhibited. The fish can exhibit both broadside and facing movements of aggression. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing, while facing movements include, facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading its opercula, and then protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. The lowest sign of aggression in both movements got assigned 1 point, the next most aggressive; 2 points, and the most aggressive; 3 points. In this experiment, there were two male betta fish that were separated by a glass wall. They were at first in clear water and the colored separator was removed so they could see each other. The amount of times both fish exhibited each behavior was recorded for a total of 5 minutes. The color separator was then replaced so the fish could rest. The observation of the fish in the clear water happened a total of 3 times, each with 5 minutes on and 5 minutes rest. After the clear water was observed, dirt was put in both sides of the tank and mixed to make the water turbid. The fish were then observed again for 5 minutes as they exhibited their aggressive behaviors. This was observed 3 times as well, for 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off. The amount of points each fish got for each round was calculated and a paired t_test was used to determine the statistical significance of the experiment. 

Results:
The mean for the score of broadside movements for both fish in the clear water through the entire experiment was 38.33±10.504 (Figure 1). The mean for the facing movements for fish 1 and fish 2 in the clear water was 55±13.077 (Figure 1). In the turbid water, the mean for the broadside movements was 24.67±2.082 for both fish (Figure 2). The mean for the facing movements for the fish in the turbid water was 20.33±13.50 (Figure 2). There was no significent difference (t=2.054792, d.f.=3, P=0.132155).

Discussion:
The results prove the hypothesis of this experiment was supported. The amount of aggressive behavior in the fish that were in the turbid water was significently lower than the fish that were in the clear water. These fish do have the labyrinth organ which allows them to breathe better in turbid water, but these fish were domesticated since they were born, which means they are not used to having to rely on this organ. In a similar study, betta fish were placed in water that was wastewater and placed in a tank full of betta fish [Ferburg:2003]. In this study, it was concluded the betta fish had no correlation between the water and behavior, but some of the fish did in fact display more air gulp and escape in the different water [Ferburg:2003]. The fish in this experiment had a similar reaction to the turbid water, as they were air gulping more during the experiment and they ignored more aggressive behaviors from the other fish more often. A domesticated betta fish does not really need to worry about oxygen as much, which allows them to allocate more of their energy to their aggressive behaviors.
