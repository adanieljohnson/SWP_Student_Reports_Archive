Title: Juvenile Hormone in Caterpillars Study

Abstract:
In this lab, we tested whether the increase of Juvenile Hormone in a caterpillar’s diet increased the weight of that caterpillar.  In our experimental group, we fed four different caterpillars food mixed with .41 mL of 4.1% precor, a chemical that elicits the same response as JH.  In our control group, we fed four different caterpillars the same food without any precor.  We came in every day for 7 days to record the caterpillar’s weights.  We found that the increase of JH in a caterpillar’s diet does increase the weight of the caterpillar. This is relevant because JH determines the timing of growth and molt in caterpillars that determine their life span. 

Introduction:
Hormones directly control insect development and growth.  One specific hormone, Juvenile hormone, or JH, regulates the type of molt of an insect, determining whether or not the insect will reach adulthood.  It is classified as a non-toxic insect growth regulator that leads to abnormalities, which impair insect survival.  Juvenile Hormone plays a major role in the processes of metamorphosis and reproduction in all forms of insects, but particularly in the manducta sexta insect species.  This species is known for its bright green appearance and horn-like structure on the posterior segment of their bodies.  They can grow about 80 mm.  This species undergoes a cycle of larval molting and metamorphosis that is regulated by the JH hormone.  The formation of the mold is dependent on the levels of JH.  In addition to this, JH also regulates color morphs and casted differentiation.  We are testing whether or not the JH analog will increase the caterpillar’s weight.  We hypothesize that the increase of JH in the caterpillar’s diet will increase the weight of the caterpillar. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we divided the caterpillars into the control and experimental groups.  Our control group was the caterpillars that did not have JH added to their diet.  The experimental group was the caterpillars with .41 mL of 4.1 precor into their diets.  We weighed the caterpillars before feeding them and then came into the lab each day to weigh the caterpillars for seven days.  Our dependent variable was the weight of the caterpillar.  The independent variable was whether we fed the caterpillar precor or not.

The caterpillars in the experimental group became more swollen and bigger in size.  Overall, the experimental group gained weight quicker than the control group.  The average weight gain in the control group was 2.31, and the average weight gain in the experimental group was 2.75.  


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported because the experimental group had a greater gain in weight than the control group.  The caterpillars in the experimental group were also a lot puffier than the caterpillars in the control group.  Therefore, we can conclude that the increase of JH in a caterpillars diet will result in a quicker and great increase of weight.  This is relevant today because this demonstrates how much hormones can later one’s growth.
