Title: Effect of Acetylcholine Solution on Rana pipiens Skeletal Muscle Contraction Threshold and Force

Abstract:
The Rana pipiens frog provides a great way to study basic muscle contraction in invertebrates. Here we study how the gastrocnemius muscle contracts by looking at the threshold for contraction, as well as force of contraction. We will be studying the effects of added acetylcholine on the twitch threshold and force of contraction, hypothesizing that the acetylcholine will reduce threshold and increase force. To do this we will find these values for two untreated frog legs and then treat each leg with acetylcholine and then again find these values. From this experiment we find that the addition acetylcholine provides no constant trend between the two legs, thus providing no significant data to support the hypothesis.

Introduction:
We are studying the contraction of skeletal muscles, specifically the gastrocnemius muscle, in the Northern Leopard Frog, scientifically known as Rana pipiens. This specimen is an ideal study specimen as we can easily isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and easily stimulate the nerve by isolating the white sciatic nerve [Johnson:2018]. In our experiment we will be adding the acetylcholine to the muscle and testing its effect on the contraction threshold and contraction force of the muscle. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that works by binding to receptors on the muscle surface, causing gated ion channels to open, depolarizing the cell and creating an action potential [Kuo and Ehrlich: 2015]. From this information, we can hypothesize that the addition of acetylcholine will lower the energy threshold to start a contraction as well as increase the overall force of the contraction at different voltage inputs. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform this lab we will obtain two legs from a single Rana pipiens frog and a force transducer. We will then prepare the leg by removing the skin, isolating the sciatic nerve, cutting free the distal end of the gastrocnemius muscle and connecting the the muscle to the force transducer. During this preparation and throughout the experiment the muscle will be kept wet with Ringerâ€™s solution. We will then place electrodes in contact with the sciatic nerve. We will then preform control testing for each leg by first sending signals at .1V and increasing in .1V intervals (all over variables constant) until a contraction is found. We will then find a contraction force control by sending signals into the muscle at 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 5V. The force of contraction will be recorded at each value, as well as for the threshold values. Each muscle will then be treated with .1mL of 10mg/mL solution of acetylcholine. The muscle will then sit for 5 minutes to allow the solution to spread. After this five-minute period, both threshold and force tests will then be repeated in each leg for the treatment aspect of our experiment. 

Results:
We can look at our data to see that that there is little trend that runs between the two legs between the control and treatment groups. For the contraction threshold we see that in leg 1 the threshold required is .35 for the treatment group as compared to .17 in the control, in leg 2 the threshold is .2 for the treatment group and .8 in the control (Figure 1). When a paired t-test is performed for the threshold values we get 1 degree of freedom, a t-value of .538462, and a p value of .685547. When looking at the average force of maximal twitch we see that for leg 1 the force of contraction in treatment group was  .2462V and that of the control was .229V, in leg 2 we saw that the force of contraction was .177 in the treatment group and .7904 in the control (Figure 2). For the paired t-test between these average values we found 1 degree of freedom, a t-value of .945449, and a p value of .517846. 

Discussion:
Our data from this experiment provides little significant data as we see a p-value of .685547 for the threshold results and a p-value of .517846. These values are both well above .05 meaning that our results were insignificant. This also means that our data does not support our hypothesis that the acetylcholine will reduce threshold and increase contraction force. Our results show an increase in threshold for the treatment group in leg 1, but a decrease in threshold in the treatment group for leg 2 (Figure 1). We can see that these trends are opposing to each other and do not show any significant information. The increased threshold for the treatment test of leg 1 could likely be due to muscle fatigue, coupled with the acetylcholine not yet bonding with the muscle to assist in sending the signal. The decrease in threshold in leg 2 could be attributed to the acetylcholine effectively bonding to the muscle, thus assisting the action potential in firing. For the overall force of the contraction the results show a slight increase in force of contraction in the treatment group when compared to the control for leg 1 and a significant decrease in contraction force for the treatment when compared to the control in leg 2 (Figure 2). The increase in contraction force for leg 1 can be explained by the idea that the acetylcholine eventually binded to the muscle surface, helping to send the action potentials and thus creating a stronger contraction. The large decrease from muscle 2 could be attributed to the fact that the acetylcholine did not bind onto the muscle and thus the added weight from the water, coupled with the lack of help from acetylcholine led to the overall force being suppressed.  While we can individually provide possible reasons for our results, the trends seen between twitch threshold and the force of each twitch contradict each other in what they mean overall for the muscles in each leg, the trends are fully scattered and are likely due to some error made when injecting the acetylcholine, such as injecting in different ways of in too small of a quantity into each leg.  Another explanation could be that acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter released by the nerve onto the muscle and simply binds to the muscle resulting in channels opening, creating the excitation part of an action potential [Kuo and Ehrlich 2015]. This could mean that adding acetylcholine would simply cause a small contraction upon being added and will give no impact on how the muscle contracts when we add our own stimulus. The changes we see in our data could be due to other factors such as error, added weight to the muscle, and fatigue.
