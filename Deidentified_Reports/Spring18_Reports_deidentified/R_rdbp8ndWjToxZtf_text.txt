Title: The Effect of Size on Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta splendens 

Abstract:
	In this study, six individual Betta splendens were observed to find a correlation between size and aggression. The experiment was modeled to focus on three behaviors: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and gill spreading. The frequency of each behavior was counted during a five minute encounter with an opponent fish and recorded. It was hypothesized that larger betta fish would display more aggressive behaviors than the smaller betta fish which would affect overall population demographics and perhaps relate to the fecundity of the fish as it does in other aquarium fish. After each five minute encounter the betta fish were weighed and replaced with a new fish to interact with the opponent. A line regression was created for each behavior and data showed little to no statistical significance between the behaviors and the weight of the fish with RÂ² values of 0.092, 0.004, 0.581. 


Introduction:
Betta splendens, or Siamese fighting fish, change in color and aggression when in the presence of other fish. These displays are called agonistic behaviors, and are composed of two different types of movements: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are when the side of the fish is facing the opponent and includes pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing. Facing movements are when a fish is facing its opponent head on and includes erect pectoral fins, gill spreading, and a red mane. By observing these behaviors, we can understand the patterns of visual communication and draw connections between other characteristics of betta fish and aggression [Johnson 2018]. 
This experiment was designed to analyze the correlation between size and aggression of Betta splendens. Cichlid fish, Astronotus ocellatus, that are better at fighting, more fecund, and better defend their are on average larger than fish that are less strong in these areas. In intraspecific competition, these fish are able to estimate the size of their opponent and therefore their fighting ability [Beeching: 1992]. Cichlid fish and betta fish are both common aquarium fishes and display intraspecific aggression. This experiment could not only estimate betta fish aggression, but also find a correlation in size to fecundity and nest defense like in the cichlid fish. 
To look at the effect of size on aggression, we focused on the behaviors of tail beating, pelvic fin flickering, and gill flaring. Pelvic fin flickering is a less aggressive broadside movement where the fish moves its pelvic fin, located under the fish, vertically opposite of the opponent. Tail beating is a more aggressive broadside movement and very pronounced. This is when the fish makes sudden movements with its back or caudal fin. Gill flaring is a facing movement that is also pronounced, displaying aggression. The fish will spread the skin located over its gills called the operculum creating a circular shape around its face to appear more threatening [Johnson 2018]. It was hypothesized that larger male betta fish would display more of these  agonistic behaviors than smaller male betta fish.  


Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment, a tank was divided into two sections using a clear and opaque barrier. An opponent betta fish was kept constant through the experiment on one side of the tank. An additional betta fish was placed on the other side of the divider. After five minutes with the opaque barrier between the fish to allow them to become acclimated to their environment and rest, the barrier was removed. A timer was started for five minutes and the number of tail beatings, pelvic fin flickers, and gill flares were noted in the non-opponent fish. After the five minutes, the fish was taken out of the tank and weighed. This method was repeated with six different fish varying in size. With this data, linear regressions were conducted for each behavior to test if our findings were statistically significant. 

Results:
Looking at Figure 1 and 2, the R2 values for the behaviors of pelvic fin flickering and tail beating versus weight were relatively low at 0.092 and 0.004 respectively. The R2 value for gill flaring versus weight was higher at 0.581 (Figure 3). The data points appear scattered rather than closely following the regression line for each behavior. 

Discussion:
Our results were not statistically significant and do not support our alternative hypothesis. We hypothesized that larger fish would show more aggressive behaviors, but the R2 values for each behavior were rather weak. The values of 0.092 and 0.004 are very close to 0, suggesting very little to no correlation between size and pelvic fin flickering or tail beating. The R2 value for gill flaring versus weight is substantially higher at .581. It is closer to 1, but not by very much suggesting a stronger correlation than the other two behaviors, but still weak. The regression line graphs show scattered data points that are very far from the line of best fit. 
These results could have been the result of experimenter error when counting the frequency of the behaviors. It is difficult to differentiate when the betta fish is swimming versus actually beating its tail or if the water is causing the pelvic fin to move versus the behavior of pelvic fin flickering. The gill flaring behavior is much easier to observe and count as it is rather obvious when performed. Another reason why there was little to no correlation between these behaviors and the weight of the fish could be because of exhaustion. The betta fish were allowed five minutes in between being moved to the tank and facing the opponent fish to become acclimated to their new surroundings. Perhaps the fish needed to rest for longer than five minutes to fully be able to perform these behaviors.
To improve upon this experiment, we could have run more than six trials creating a larger weight spectrum of fish and more data points to input into our line regressions. Controlling for environmental factors such as temperature and nutrition was well done, but since we were limited in resources we were unable to control for the color of fish. A study conducted on Betta splendens showed a correlation between aggressive behavior and brightly colored fish, especially those with red coloring [Thompson: 1965]. Our non-opponent fish ranged in color from blue to purple to red and this factor could have skewed our data as size could have been negligible compared to the aggression due to color. 
Improving upon this experiment could result in statistically significant data and could not only prove that aggression and size are correlated in betta fish, but also a correlation in fecundity and nest defense. Studying these agonistic behaviors and visual communications could reveal information on hierarchies and discrete social groups in Betta splendens. In coral reef fish, specifically the fairy basslet or Gramma loreto, size determines what place a fish has in the overall hierarchy of the group. Larger fish are in prime feeding positions over smaller fish affecting the overall demographic rates and population regulation of this type of fish [Webster: 2000]. This experiment could be expanded to not only the correlation between size and aggression, but also the correlation between size and status.
