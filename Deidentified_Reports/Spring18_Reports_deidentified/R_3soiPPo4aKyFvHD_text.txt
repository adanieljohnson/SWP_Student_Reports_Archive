Title: Effects of Artificial Juvenile Hormone on the Development of Manducta Sexta

Abstract:
This experiment concentrates on the growth of caterpillars, specifically the effect of JH on larval molting. The goal of this experiment was to study the effects on artificial Juvenile Hormone on the development of Manducta sexta in their forth instar measured by their weight. Both the Juvenile Hormone and ecdysone influence the pupation and development of the caterpillars. The experimental group was given a concentrated amount of the Juvenile Hormone in a form of Precor known as Methoprene. Both groups had an increase in weight but the results were not significent. We concluded that the Precor had no major effect on the growth development of the Manducta sexta. We found that the Manduca sexta treated with the Precor chemical had an average change in weight of 2.75 g and the average change in weight of the controll caterpillars is 2.31 g. The controll group had a standard deviation of 0.72 and the experimental group, treated with Precor, had a standard deviation of 0.31. We performed a t test and found a p value of 0.31 significance and t value of 1.09. 

Introduction:
JH plays a major role in the processes of metamorphosis and reproduction and is especially evident in the Manduca secxta due to their specific molting patterns. Manducta sexta have a relatively short life cycle and they are relatively large so easy to physically observe. In the course of this experiment we will be mixing the concentrated JH into the caterpillar’s food to observe whether or not the JH analog will increase the caterpillars weight. According to the 2018 BIO 114 Wake Forest University Lab manual, Juvenile, or JH, regulates the type of molt of an insect, determining whether or not the insect will reach adulthood. The Manducta Sexta is classified as a non-toxic insect growth regulator that leads to abnormalities which impair insect survival. This species is known for its bright green appearance with a horn-like structure on the posterior segment of their bodies. They are tobacco pests that grow into moths when they fully mature.  A study which looked into the effects of JH was conducted by Karl Treiblmayr et al. on female nymphs and adult German cockroaches. The purpose of the experiment being conducted is to test whether an increase in concentration of the JH hormone will cause the caterpillars to gain weight.  Treiblmayr’s experiment also studies the effect of JH hormone on metamorphosis development and can give insight into the overall effect of this hormone. This experiment focused on four different physiological situations related to reproduction and metamorphosis including: penultimate and last instar nymphs, adults during the first vitellogenic cycle, and adults transporting the oothecal. This study found that there was a positive correlation between JH synthesis and JH titer in females.  The most important stages in the reproductive cycle are the penultimate day (day 6) when an increase in synthesis leads to a decrease of concentration in the JH hormone, and on the 16th day, the penultimate day, where a high titer leads to lower rates of synthesis. Keeping this in mind, the administration of JH hormone in this experiment will cause there to be an increase of weight in the caterpillars (Jindra, 2003). The methoprene chemical being used inhibits the production of juvenile hormone. Based on previous studies we expect that the increase of JH in the caterpillar’s diet will increase the weight of the caterpillar.

Materials and Method:
The caterpillars used for this experiment, Manduca sexta, were farmed and bought by Wake Forest University’s Biology department. For this experiment 6 caterpillars were obtained, weighed, and placed into a container with 10 mg food. This experiment will be conducted using two different groups. The first group will receive the concentrated JH mixed in their food while the second group will receive water mixed in with their food. For the 3 experimental caterpillars, we mixed 4.1% concentration of .41Ml of Precor chemical. During the course of the experiment, we went into the classroom to get daily measurements on their weight and take observations on how they were developing. After collecting all of the amplitudes, we ran a paired t_test to find a t statistic and p_value.

Results:
Manduca sexta treated with the Precor chemical had an average change in weight of 2.75 g while the average change in weight of the controll caterpillars is 2.31 g. The standard deviation of the controll group was 0.72 and the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.31.We performed a t test and found a p value of 0.31 significance and t value of 1.09. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported by our findings as our p value was 0.31 and we failed to reject the null. By the end of the experiment we were able to observe quantifiable results of how the Precor chemical blocker impacts larva growth. When there is an absence of JH it allows for the release of prothoracioctropic hormone (PTTH) which allows for metamorphosis to begin (Hayakawa, 1995). In a study published in 1995 by Yoichi Hayakawa, caterpillars were injected with a solution that decreased the rate of JH degradation and pupation was delayed. Therefore a solution such as methoprene causes an earlier onset of pupation. Despite these findings, we did not have substantial evidence that the Precor had a major impact on the development of the caterpillars because our p value was very high. We did have limitations that could have effected the results of our experiment. We had a relatively small sample size and could have had some human error. To yield more accurate results it would be important to have a larger sample size with more trials. Although our results showed that Precor does in fact increase the rate of JH degradation, the results were not significent enough to support our hypothesis.  There is the potential for a variety of different experiments involving the caterpillar’s pupation. This experiment could be conducted with different species of caterpillar could be tested to see if their pupation cycle is similar to that of a Manduca secxta. It would also be interesting how hormones that regulate the human’s development cycle, such as estrogen and testosterone, would affect the caterpillars growth and development through stages of pupation.

Figure #1. Effect of Precor on weight of caterpillars. Control caterpillars (blue bars) not treated with Precor have a lower average weight. The experimental caterpillars (the red bar) have a higher average weight. 3 Manducta Sexta caterpillars were placed in each group, and the experimental caterpillars were exposed for 7 days to the methoprene chemical mixed into their food. Weights were measured daily and the SD bars are displayed above.
