Title: Applying Azamax in the food of Manduca Sexta slowing down the rate of growth

Abstract:
Hormones are involved in the life cycle of holometabolous insects. Ecdysone regulates the timing of molting specifically. The inhibitor of ecdysone is used as insect growth regulators in insecticides. The objective of this study is to discover the effect of ecdysone inhibitor on insects. Manduca Sexta is used as the model organism while Azamax is used as the source of ecdysone inhibitor. The hypothesis was that the Manduca Sextas that had been treated with Azamax would grow slower than those had not. Azamax was added to the food of Manduca Sextas to perform its effect. The result showed that the experimental groups gained less weight than the control groups. The experimental groups also ate less than the control groups. The result proved the hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Holometabolous insect undergoes life cycle from egg, 5 stages of instar, pupa to adult moth. Hormones are used to control its growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes [1]. As a result, we can use substances like hormones that adversely affect insect growth and development to control insect pest [2]. These “insect growth regulators” (IGRs) are less harmful to other life form than traditional insecticides by leading to the death of insects without being directly toxic. Ecdysone, refer to as 20E in this report, is a hormone that holometabolous insect produce to regulate timing of molting. The insect is likely to molt when the concentration of 20E is high. In the study, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting 20E to Holometabolous insect. To achieve our goal, we chose insecticide Azamax, which was a 20E inhibitor, as the treatment to the food. The model organism Manduca Sexta was chosen because it was a typical pest and not physically harmful. Since inhibit 20E would postpone the time of molting, our hypothesis was that the insects that had been treated with Azamax would grow slower than the control groups of insects in a same period of time. In this case the addition of Azamax would be the independent variable while the change of weight of Manduca Sexta being dependent variable. 

Materials and Methods:
For the setup of our study, we picked six Manduca Sextas at fifth instar stage. We measured their initial weight and separated them to control group and experimental group, three worms for each. We put a control worm and an experimental worm in a round container that was divided to two parts by index card. We then measured 10g of food for each worm. Four drops of reagent (Azamax) were added to each portion of food for experimental group. In contrast, four drops of water were added to each portion of food for control group. The concentration of Azamax was 1:1250. We kept each portion of food as a big clump to not let it dry out. The last step was to give worms corresponding food and close the perforated lids. 

All the containers containing Manduca Sextas were kept inside an incubator. We replaced their food every time according to the procedure of treating food described above. Then we measured the weight of each Manduca Sexta and the weight of food eaten every day at around 16:00. All the data and observations were kept in a google document. By comparing the change of weight of control group and experimental group, we could test if our hypothesis was correct or not. 

We used two-sample t-test as statistical test to see if our results were significant different from each other.

Results:
The mean of the change of weight of control group was barely statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 2.99, df = 4, P = 0.040).

According to our observation, the worms in experimental appeared darker in color. The feces of experimental group were dark grown and dry while those of control group were light yellow and moist. There were also less feces in the experimental group. 

Figure 1 shows that experimental groups showed fast growth in weight in the beginning. Control groups started to grow faster at the forth day and remained the fast speed of growth to the end of the study. Figure 2 indicates that the mean change of weight of experiment group was smaller than that of experimental group. Figure 3 expresses that experiment group ate less food than control group did. 

Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis that the Manduca Sextas that had been treated with Azamax would grow slower than those had not been treated. We thought the result was generated because the inhibition of 20E made the insects think they didn’t need to prepare for molt yet. Thus, the insects didn’t eat much and grew less. As a result, the effect of Azamax would be keeping the worm in the life form of larva. The pest insect can’t proceed to adult form and reproduce. Therefore, the number of the pest insect would drop. 

Mistake might generate in the collection of the data of day 4. It was collected much later than 16:00 and probably leaded to the big jump in the weight of the worms in day 4. However, the change of weight in total was not influenced by this mistake. 

The next step of this study would be to prolong the time the insets are treated and to increase the number of model organisms. If we could observe the difference in time when they start to molt, our outcome would be more convincing.
