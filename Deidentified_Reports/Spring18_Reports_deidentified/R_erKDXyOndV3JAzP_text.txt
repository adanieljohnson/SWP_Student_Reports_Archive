Title: Mung Beans (Vigna radiata) Growth Allocation in the Presence of Hydrogen Peroxide 

Abstract:
Root-to-shoot ratios are a way to measure allocation, the biomass of the root is divided by the biomass of the shoot. Root- to- shoot ratios change based on limiting resources and environmental conditions that effect plant behavior based on nutrient availability. It essentially helps to assess the overall health of a plant. We examined the effects of Hydrogen Peroxide (H202) in an environment on Vigna radiata (mung beans) versus environments without H202 and only water (H20). We did this by separating six pots into two treatment groups, three pots that received H202 and three that only received H20. The first week both treatment groups only received H20 to ensure germination, the second week only one treatment group received H202. Our results show, statistically, that H202 has an effect on root-to-shoot length ratios but not root-to-shoot weight ratios. The plants in H202 environments were able to successfully allocate to their new surrounding conditions during week two of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Hydrogen Peroxide's (H202) behavior for many physiological process in plants has been recorded as being a promotor during root growth and formation in hypocotyl cuttings; roots and shoots (Li, 2017). Plants act different based on their environment. When limited resources arise, such as water, plants will respond by allocating to their new environment. Biomass allocation can be calculated using root- to- shoot ratios. Generally, root-to- shoot ratios increase when there is a nutrient deficiency and moistures stress conditions. Limited resources to below-ground environments usually lead to a higher root-to-shoot ratio. It is to be expected that the root-to-shoot ratio for plants living in environments induced with H202 will have a higher ratio for both weight and length than plants living in an environment without H202 present.  In this experiment Vigna radiata were used to test the difference in root-to shoot ratios of length and weight of plants that grew in the presence of and not in the presence of H202. Our hypothesis is that the presence of hydrogen peroxide will increase the root-to-shoot ratio of plants grown in the stressful environment of H202 due to damage in roots. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment was conducted over a two-week period. During week one all six pots, both of the two treatment groups, only received water (H20) every day to ensure successful germination. After week one, treatment group two, three pots of plants, received 10 (mm) H202 every other day instead of H20 for a week. The other treatment group, the remaining 3 pots, received 50 (mm) of H20 every day. Both treatment groups were kept inside a greenhouse.  First, mung bean seeds were planted. A solution of 10 (mm) of H202 and water was created and stored in the Greenhouse to be used throughout week two of the experiment. After Mung bean seeds were planted both treatment groups, all six pots, were placed into the greenhouse. After two weeks, the pots were removed from the greenhouse and the following data, average of three plants per pot, was recorded for each of the six pots: weight of plant (g), weight of roots (g), weight of shoots (g), weight root-to-shoot ratio (g), root length of plant (mm), shoot length of plant (mm), length root-to-shoot ratio of plant (mm). 

Results:
The H202 treatment group showed higher root-to-shoot ratios than the H20 treatment group. The average weight root-to-shoot ratio of H20 is 0.39 and that of H202 is 0.41. The average length root-to-shoot ratio of H20 is 0.57 and that of H202 is 0.65.  Based on error bars and the standard deviation results, however, the Root-to-Shoot ratios show inconclusive data. The standard deviation of weight root-to-shoot ratio of H20 and H202 is 0.08 and 0.03 respectively. The standard deviation of length root-to-shoot ratio of H20 and H202 is 0.01 and 0.05 respectively.  It is clear that H202 had an effect on the length root-to shoot ratio but there is statistical uncertainty of weight root-to-shoot ratio due to excessive scarcity in the data. The standard deviation is statically uncertain. The excessive scarcity in the three-pot average, to make the average of the root-to-shoot ratio, may be reason for this result. Even though the average is 3.9 the range is wide.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment supported my hypothesis of root-to-shoot ratios increasing in both weight and length of mung bean plant growth. Mung beans show a response to increased growth and weight when in the presence of H202. The presence of H202 influenced the plants to grow more in length and weight because the plants were trying to find resources in a low nutrient environment. While the graphs show this information, the effect of H202 on the weight root-to-shoot ratio of plants is not statistically proven. Using H202 has a clear effect on length ratio and is inconclusive if it has an effect on the weight ratio based on the data we took. However, it can be assumed that although my data is statistically uncertain, in another experiment it has been proven the H202 mostly likely would have affected the weight and growth of mung beans. 
In an experiment conducted on mung beans, acid seaweed liquid extracts at a low concentration of 0.2% there was an increase in mung bean seed germination rates. Root-to-shoot length and weight ratios showed an increase when in the presence of acid extract (Castellanos-Barriga, 2017). Just as H202 acid seaweed liquid acted as a stressful environmental factor. Mung beans in this experiment also had to allocate their resources. Thus, it can be assumed that mung beans in environments of H202 should have both increased length and weight root-to-shoot ratios even though our data does not statistically prove this for weight root-to-shoot ratios.
