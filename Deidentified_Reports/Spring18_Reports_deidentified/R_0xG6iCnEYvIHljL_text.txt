Title: The Effects of Growth Hormone on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars: How the Juvenile Hormone Mimic Precor produced a negative effect on weight and overall health of experimental caterpillars

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta’s growth and development is aided by Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. We were interested in how giving the hormone JH after the fifth instar would affect its growth and also how their weight would affect development. We hypothesized that an increase in weight gain would have positive influences on weight gain and overall health of the caterpillars. We tested 2 groups of Manduca Sexta caterpillars, one receiving only di water, and one receiving a JH mimic, precor in addition to their food. We found that overall the control group was more consistent in their growth, as well as many of them seemed healthier and less pale at the end of the week. Our results exhibited the control group was more consistent in weight gain; however, the average weights of both groups were pretty similar. After running a two sample T-test, we determined there was no statistical significance at any alpha level. We believe that the control caterpillars outperformed the Precor caterpillars because after the 5th instar JH does not play as much of a role in the development of the caterpillar and therefore when we gave the Precor caterpillars more JH, it affected them more negatively than we hypothesized. 


Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect that is commonly known as a Tobacco Hornworm while still in the caterpillar stage of its lifecycle and is known as a Carolina Sphinx moth during its adult phase. In this report will focus on the caterpillar stage, during which it is considered a pest. Manduca Sexta growth and development from a larva into an adult moth is aided by the effects of a variety of growth hormones; specifically, Juvenile Hormone(JH) and Ecdysterone (E20) [Bio 114 Lab Manual, 2018.] Juvenile Hormone regulates development and maturation into an adult moth [Noriega, 2014.] During their lifecycle they go through different instars until they reach the commitment pulse and pupate, all aided by JH and E20 [ Bio 114 Lab Manual, 2018.]  During the last larval instar, the caterpillar experiences only E20 without JH, which is believed to send the caterpillar into the pupal state [Ismail, 2000.] What will happen if after the fifth instar, the caterpillar keeps receiving JH? In normal Manduca Sexta development, the caterpillar is around 1 gram right before the onset fifth instar and after 4-5 days of continuous feeding they reach 8-10 grams [Nijhout, 1974.] If this is the normal development of a Manduca Sexta caterpillar, then how would an increase in JH effect these weight gains and development? In many cases it has been found that mimics of these hormones can act as insecticides [Tarlochan, 1998], which could be a useful way for agriculture to control and eliminate the problems caused by these pests. We hypothesize than an increase of Precor in the diet will promote an increase in weight of each caterpillar, as well as benefit their overall appearances when compared with the control group. 


Materials and Methods:
We began our experiment by labeling each container with our group names, our section, our lab time, our TA name, and which caterpillar it would be containing. We folded and taped the ends of an index card in order to create two sides to each container. We selected 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars, provided by the Wake Forest University Biology Department, making sure that they were similar in size to begin with. Then we divided them into two groups of four each. We used a clean spoon to weigh out 80 grams of food and put it into the square container, we made sure to zero the scale. We made sure to stir the food. For the control caterpillars we weighed out 10 grams of food per caterpillar and then we placed it in a new container. Then we used a transfer pipet to add 5 drops of di water/ 10 grams of food for each control caterpillar container. We made sure to keep the clumps of food as large as possible to prevent it from drying out. Then after we had mixed each solution, we placed each 10-gram glob of food plus di water into the correct, labeled caterpillar home. For the treatment caterpillars, we weighed out 10 grams of food for each treatment caterpillar and placed the food in a new, separate container. After the caterpillars had been separated, we used a NEW pipet to add 5 drops of Precor, the Juvenile Hormone mimic, per 10 grams of food. We made sure to stir the mixture well. As we did for the control group, we made sure to keep the food in a large clump to prevent it from drying out. Then we added the correct caterpillars to the correct compartment of each container. After the caterpillars had been fed and correctly placed, we placed them in an incubator. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows the overall mass change throughout the week of observation in each of the control and Precor caterpillars. Overall the control caterpillars grew more consistently than those who received supplements of Precor. Most of the caterpillars followed the same general pattern of an increase in weight each week, with the exception of Precor 2A, which actually lost weight.
During the experiment, we observed that many of the control caterpillars, specifically 1A and 1B, were very lethargic throughout the week. We noticed that Precor 2B was active almost the whole time.  At the conclusion of the week, we noticed that the control caterpillars displayed brighter green colors, while the Precor caterpillars were extremely pale (specifically Precor 1A and 1B.)
 




Discussion:
We hypothesized that an increase in Precor in the Manduca Sexta food would generate a positive increase in weight and overall health appearance in the caterpillars. Our results did not support this hypothesis. Many of our control caterpillars weighed just as much as the Precor caterpillars, and many of them also looked more green and overall healthier than the Precor caterpillars. However, despite the general results, 2 of our Precor caterpillars behaved slightly differently—one, Precor 2A, actually lost weight and was the smallest out of all caterpillars. On the other end of the spectrum, 2B was the largest caterpillar and actually displayed the results that we expected to see from each Precor caterpillar. These cases, especially 2A, skewed the results. It is possible that these outliers had other confounding variable that effected their growth and performance.  

If we were to re-conduct this experiment, we could decrease the number of drops of Precor per 10 grams of food, and then it would be possible to receive more uniform results that would more closely reflect our hypothesis. We could also repeat the same experiment with more caterpillars per group in order to reduce the amount that one caterpillar could skew the results and see a more overall trend in the data. 

In a study conducted by Joel G Kingsolver, he considered caterpillars grown in the lab and others in the field and also measured the temperature they were kept at, and diet. Many of their caterpillars had average weights of about 7.9 [Kingsolver, 2007.] While these weights are slightly smaller than the ones produced in our experiment, they are comparable and show that there was no drastic difference in the results of our experiment. 

We can conclude that while there was a difference in mass between control and Precor caterpillars, it was not statistically significant. In an alternative experiment we could account for these results and add other measurements, such as temperature, to gain a more wholesome understanding of Manduca Sexta growth and development.
