Title: The impact of understory light on the growth of the roots and shoots of the plant Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
The root vegetable Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus was studied under the imposed conditions of green cellophane wrap around the plant compared to clear cellophane wrap. It was hypothesized that the experimental group would allocate more resources to the shoots of the plant instead of the root, in order to compensate for the different color of light being absorbed by growing larger shoots to receive more light. The results showed that the green light caused the experimental group to grow larger than the controll group. Six pots were used in this experiment and five individual plants from each plot were measured for weight and for length. The idea that the green light encourages allocating resources to the shoot may influence growers who wish for larger stems and do not care for the roots to grow or vice versa.

Introduction:
The organism R. raphanistrum ssp. sativus is a plant native to Europe. It is a root vegetable that is known for its vast root systems and is often used as a cover crop in agriculture [Warwick SI and Francis A: 2004]. The experiment that was conducted compared the root and shoot growth of R. raphanistrum ssp. sativus in green tinted light and in unfiltered light. The green tinted light was chosen in order to emulate the light filtered through an understory of a rainforest. A high intensity of green light generally promotes plant growth, but in the understory there is no way to ensure a high intensity of green light [Johkan M, Shoji K, Goto F, Hahida S, Yoshihara T: 2012]. The R. raphanistrum ssp. sativus does grow best under high intensity light and prefers acidic soil [Warwick SI and Francis A: 2004]. This specific organism was chosen in this experiment model because of its ability to grow in many climate conditions and its hardiness as a plant [Warwick SI and Francis A: 2004]. Plants allocate resources differently based on the type of resources they receive the most of in their habitat; if a plant receives less water, then resources will be allocated more towards the growth of root systems in order to capture enough water to sustain the plant [Johkan M, Shoji K, Goto F, Hahida S, Yoshihara T: 2012]. As expected, the same distribution of resources is seen in the relation between the plant and the amount of receivable sunlight [Johnson AD: 2018]. I hypothesized that the R. raphanistrum ssp. sativus under the green filtered light, the independent variable, will allocate more resources to the shoot growth, the dependent variable, than its counterpart in the unfiltered light because of the need to compensate for the lack of the full range of light. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted in a greenhouse under controllled conditions. Six small plots of the plant were planted, three for the controll and three to be tested under the implemented independent variable. Seeds were liberally scattered across the plots of soil. To emulate the understory of a rainforest, a supporting structure that enveloped the entire six plants was constructed and green cellophane wrap was wrapped around it. The plants were then watered once a day for two weeks. After the two weeks, one plot from each group of three was extracted and water was used to diffuse the soilâ€™s grip on the roots. Five individual plants were retrieved from each plot and those plants were cleaned of the soil. They then were weighed as a full plant and that was recorded. The plants were then cut at the meeting point of the shoot and the roots, indicated by a color change on the plant. The shoot was measured in length and in weight as was the root. The root to shoot ratio (RS ratio) was recorded for the length and for the weight. A two tailed t_test was used in order to obtain significent statistical data for the experiment.

Results:
To accurately assess the hypothesis, the averages of the three groups of the controll and the three groups of the experimental group were compiled and a two tailed t_test between the means was run on the data. The same test was run with the same groups, but this time testing the length of the shoots. Using a base p_value of .05, the data of the shoot weight was statistically significent with the p_value of 0.04647. The data of the shoot length was not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.058247.


Discussion:
The results supported our hypothesis; the shoots on the plants that underwent the experimental treatment had more overall growth than the shoots on the controll plants. However, the statistical significance of our graphs did vary. The intended data of study, shoot length, showed that a higher intensity of green light did indeed help the shoot grow larger. However, the higher intensity of green light did not reduce the growth of the roots, meaning the roots of the controll and the experimental group both grew equally. This could possibly be because the plant of choice, R. raphanistrum ssp. sativus, grows larger in general in higher intensity green light [Johkan M, Shoji K, Goto F, Hahida S, Yoshihara T: 2012]. Future directions for this study would be to expand on the size of the experiment to get a larger sample size. A larger sample size would allow a narrowing of the standard deviation and a more precise outcome. Experimenting on another species of plant is also a viable direction to go towards in order to see if the higher intensity of green light has the same effect to other species [Johkan M, Shoji K, Goto F, Hahida S, Yoshihara T: 2012].
