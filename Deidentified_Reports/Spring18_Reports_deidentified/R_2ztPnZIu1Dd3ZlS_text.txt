Title: An examination of the effect of caffeine and IBMX on phototaxis of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Phototaxis describes the process by which the organism Physarum polycephalum migrates towards or away from a source of light, & is one of the cellular functions the organism conducts through the use of signaling pathways. The cAMP-mediated pathway is important to phototaxis because the presence of cAMP is known to cause movement in the cell. The process involves adenylyl cyclase being activated, & converting ATP to cAMP, which then activates PKA & phosphorylates enzymes. The signaling path is stopped by the presence of phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cAMP. In this experiment, a phototaxis assay was conducted with P. polycephalum in PDA plates to determine the effect caffeine & IBMX would have on the phototaxis of the organism. It was expected that the presence of these inhibitors for the treatment group would cause positive phototaxis because they would inhibit phosphodiesterase, which breaks down cAMP, & the increase of cAMP would increase movement of the cell. However, the results did not support the hypothesis or prior research, as only one control plate & zero treatment plates had any movement. This was likely due to contamination of the PDA plates, & without the presence of the overpowering bacteria in the PDA, the data likely would have shown positive phototaxis.

Introduction:
The organism Physarum polycephalum exhibits cellular behaviors and movement based on its environment, which are controlled by signal transduction pathways. P. polycephalum acts like one giant cell, despite being a multinucleate syncytium, containing multiple nuclei within one plasma membrane. It uses similar signal transduction pathways as human cells but is much easier to study cell-level processes without needing a microscope, as it exhibits intelligent behavior despite lacking a nervous system (Johnson: 2016). P. polycephalum is mostly found in its plasmodium stage of life, during which it moves by using actin microfilaments. As it remains in darkness, it will continue searching for food and moving around. P. polycephalum functions and conducts behaviors by using signaling pathways including G-protein coupled receptors, with the cAMP-mediated path (Johnson: 2016). Because the P. polycephalum does not have a nervous system, its responses to the environment are all controlled by these signal transduction pathways. They involve the process of a stimulus activating a receptor that acts as a sensor, the receptor causing the forming or release of a second messenger which triggers the response pathways, and then the second messenger binding to an effector to trigger the cell to respond to the stimulus. The pathway focused on during this experiment is the cAMP-mediated pathway, which involves adenylate cyclase being activated by the G-protein and which converts ATP to cAMP. Then, the cAMP binds to substrates in the cell, and protein kinase A is activated by the cAMP, which then phosphorylates other enzymes. Finally, the pathways stop when the cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase. Phototaxis describes the process during which masses of plasmodium of the P. polycephalum migrate away, with negative phototaxis, or towards light, with positive phototaxis. The purpose of this experiment is to examine the effect that the inhibitors caffeine and IBMX have on the phototaxis of the P. polycephalum (Johnson: 2016). 
	During this experiment, we conducted a phototaxis assay with P. polycephalum in PDA plates to compare the effects of using caffeine and IBMX for the treatment group versus the control group without the inhibitors. Caffeine is an inhibitor that is known to inhibit cyclic phosphodiesterase specifically, which leads to an increase in cAMP. Furthermore, IBMX mimics these effects of caffeine and causes an accumulation of cAMP and enhanced PKA activity (Dixon: 2011). Prior research on this topic of the effect of light on cAMP signaling in a different type of slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, shows that the secretion of cAMP caused by a light source caused a decrease in the length of optical density waves and increased cell movement. The researchers believed that the increase of cAMP release could control the phototactic movement and direction toward the light source (Miura: 2000). Another study examined the role of cAMP on phototaxis in a very similar study to ours, and their results supported our expectations. Their data showed that higher levels of cAMP caused the cells to migrate towards the light source, and the addition of IBMX caused an increase in cAMP in the strain (Boonyareth: 2009). This research and information led us to hypothesize that the use of the inhibitors would cause positive phototaxis for the P. polycephalum during our experiment. We expected that the use of these two inhibitors on the treatment group would cause the P. polycephalum to exhibit positive phototaxis because they would cause an increase in cAMP release. This in turn is important because cell movement in the organism is organized and coordinated by the cAMP waves, and thus it causes increase of distance of movement (Miura: 1997). We predicted that the caffeine and IBMX would inhibit the cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is the enzyme that breaks down cAMP, thus preventing the inactivation of the second messengers of the pathway, cAMP. 


Materials and Methods:
          In this experiment, caffeine and IBMX were used on six PDA plates to measure the Phototaxis of Physarum polycephalum, a species of slime mold. The P. polycephalum samples were cultured on water agar plates in 37-degree temperature in an incubator and under constant darkness. Three of the PDA plates were used as controls, which were saturated with distilled water, while the other three plates were saturated with an equal amount of the 1-20 dilution ratio mixture of caffeine and IBMX in order to cover the entire plate. All six plates were then left to soak for 10 minutes. 
          The spatula and forceps were sterilized by soaking in ethanol and then being placed under the flame of an alcohol lamp, and this sterilization step was repeated before every transition to a different plate. Then for each PDA plate separately, the lid was opened and two 1 cm x 1 cm squares were cut from the PDA and scooped out and disposed of. Once sterilized again, the spatula and forceps were used to cut out and transfer blocks of P. polycephalum stock culture from the P. polycephalum plate to each precut well in each of the six PDA plates. Precautions were taken to use blocks of P. polycephalum with visible strands, and that were not from the center of the stock plate, as to avoid the waste excreted by the organism. The plates were then closed, taped shut, and covered in aluminum foil. A small window (less than 0.5 cm square) was cut into the foil for each plate in order to let light shine in. Finally, the six plates were placed sitting flat inside the light box in the laboratory so the results were not confounded by gravitaxis.  
	In order to score the six plates, we returned both 18 hours and over 24 hours later to examine the results. We retrieved the plates from the light box and labeled the location of the window before removing the aluminum foil. Using a ruler, the distance that the slime mold migrated was measured for each of the six plates by measuring from the current edge of migration to the nearest edge of the originating slab. The number of hours between the start and end of the assay was calculated, and the direction of the migration were calculated. A statistical two sample t-test was conducted to analyze the significance of the results by comparing the control and treatment groups. 


Results:
The trend displayed by the data for this experiment showed that there was no substantial difference between treatment groups. One of the control plates was the only one to show any migration of the P. polycephalum, of 12mm away from the light, while the other five plates each showed 0mm migration. Therefore, the control group displayed an average of 2mm migration and the treatment group treated with caffeine and IBMX displayed an average of 0mm during the 18 hours. The statistical two sample t-test compared the two groups of data and showed that the data was not significant, with a p-value of 0.34089, degrees of freedom of 10, and t-stat of 1. 


Discussion:
The results displayed by this experiment did not support the hypothesis, as there were minimal results in general and very little difference between data of the treatment groups. One control plate showed a 12mm migration away from the light, and the rest of the five plates, both control and treatment, did not display any migration in either direction. We expected that the inhibitors caffeine and IBMX would inhibit the cAMP phosphodiesterase enzyme and increase the amount of cAMP, thus causing the P. polycephalum to show positive phototaxis towards light, however this was not the case. The cAMP-mediated pathway is involved in phototaxis and converts ATP to cAMP, activates PKA and the phosphorylation of enzymes. The pathway stops with the presence of the phosphodiesterase enzyme because it breaks down cAMP.  Caffeine and IBMX are both inhibitors that are known to inhibit cyclic phosphodiesterase, which would then increase the cAMP and enhance PKA activity (Dixon: 2011). The increase in cAMP was then supposed to increase positive phototaxis according to our predictions. This data led us to the belief that this problem with the results occurred due to contamination of the plates. The most major problem with the experiment is that the PDA plates were likely tainted and thus did not allow or support the movement of the P. polycephalum in any direction. Research that we conducted prior to the experiment led us to believe that the inhibiting of cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is the enzyme that breaks down cAMP, would prevent the inactivation of the second messenger and thus cause an increase in cAMP that would drive cAMP-mediated pathway. Studies on the effect of IBMX on phototaxis have shown that the intracellular cAMP level influences the direction of migration in cells, therefore the higher levels of cAMP caused movement towards the light. The cAMP signals a response to affect cell direction toward light (Boonyareth: 2000). 
However, during our experiment the bacteria that contaminated the PDA plates outcompeted the P. polycephalum and prevented it from growing as expected. PDA plates were used to study phototaxis because they eliminate confounding stimuli, however in a future experiment, I would like to try to use a different type of plate, like water agar because it has not shown these contamination issues in the laboratory. Also for this reason, I would want to study the effect that caffeine and IBMX has on chemotaxis of P. polycephalum as well because it can be done on water agar. In a prior study on chemotaxis of P. polycephalum, researchers found that cAMP and cAMP phosphodiesterase enzymes affect the motility of the P. polycephalum, and so “terpene molecules” would have an inhibitory effect on these enzymes, causing a chemotactic effect on motility of the P. polycephalum (Delacycostello: 2013). Therefore, I would want to study the effect the inhibitors from our experiment would have on chemotaxis instead, because they are known to increase cAMP This experiment did not support the hypothesis or research on the inhibitors and processes of the behavior of P. polycephalum due to contamination factors of the PDA plates. However, future experiments can be conducted to improve this experiment and learn more about the cellular behaviors of P. polycephalum, including phototaxis and chemotaxis specifically.
