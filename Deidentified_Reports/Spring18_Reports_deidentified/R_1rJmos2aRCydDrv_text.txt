Title: Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta splendens Not Effected by Blue-Dyed Water

Abstract:
Agonistic behaviors are prevalent throughout the animal kingdom, which makes the study of them relevant to understanding the ecology, genetics, and evolution of both individual species and trends among all animal species. Our experiment examined the agonistic behaviors of males of one particular fish species, Betta splendens, which react aggressively in the presence of male conspecifics. As agonistic behavior relies on the ability to first identify the target of a display, we decided to test the impact of a Betta's ability to distinguish the color of another male as it relates to levels of aggression. We hypothesized that, if placed in blue-dyed water where a fish's color was very similar to its environment, blue Betta splendens males would exhibit less agonistic behavior towards each other than if in clear water. We tested this by allowing male Bettas to interact in an environment with clear water, then with water dyed by blue food coloring. We used a paired t-test to evaluate our data, which revealed no significant difference between agonistic behavior levels between the clear and blue-colored water environments.

Introduction:
Agonistic behavior has been observed in many species across the animal kingdom. Species use agonistic displays when engaged in intraspecific and interspecific competition, which can include competing for resources or a mate. Usually such behavior consists of physical signals which serve as a way to deter the competition and prevent more dangerous methods of resolving conflict. If the conflict can be resolved without harm to the organism, energy is saved and the organism's survival is not at risk. Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are well known for intraspecific agonistic displays and highly aggressive fighting between males.  Studying such agonistic behaviors of animals can elucidate the relationships of that animal with other organisms and its environment. In this experiment, we explored the question of how Betta splendens recognize each other and initiate agonistic displays. The basis of our experiment rested on the idea that color plays a significant part in determining the reaction of one male of this species to another. The study of body color in relation to the agonistic behavior of another Betta fish has showed that generally, a male will respond with the most aggression toward a male with coloration the least like its own (Thompson and Sturm 1965). A red fish, for example, would respond the most to a green fish, less to red, and the least to blue (Thompson and Sturm 1965). We reasoned that if color was a determining factor in conspecific male recognition, similarity in color to the environment would lessen the ability of males to identify each other and the likelihood of engaging in agonistic displays. We hypothesized that if placed in blue-dyed water, the ability of male Betta splendens of blue coloration to recognize each other would diminish, and agonistic behavior would, therefore, decrease.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment used three sets of two male Betta splendens. The first set included a purple fish and a blue fish with a red pelvic fin tip. The second set included a dark blue fish and a second fish with a gradient light to dark blue coloring and red fin tips. The third set included one dark blue Betta and a dark blue/purple Betta. The experiment began by placing the first set of fish in a tank in which they were separated by an opaque barrier. The Bettas were given 5 minutes to adjust to their new environment. Then, the opaque barrier between the two fish was removed while a clear glass barrier remained so that they would perceive each other while unable to make physical contact. Their behavior was observed for 5 minutes before the barrier was replaced. Data recorded included the time until the first agonistic behavior was displayed by either male, total broadside displays, total facing displays, and total instances of darting motion observed of both males during the trial. Broadside displays include the extension of the pelvic fin, tail beating, and tail flashing. Frontal displays include holding the pectoral fins forward, spreading the opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes. We defined "darting" as a rapid movement made towards the opposing male.  This procedure was repeated with the other two sets of male Bettas. Next, the same procedure as above was conducted once more for all three sets of fish, but this time three drops of blue food coloring were added to water on each side of the tank. The fish were given at minimum five minutes to recover from their last agonistic encounter and five minutes to adjust to their new, blue environment before beginning another trial. Data was recorded as before, and at the end all data was analyzed using a one-tailed paired t-test (p &lt; 0.05). It should be noted that, to carry out a paired t-test, we created a composite score for each group of Bettas before and after the administration of blue dye. Frontal and broadside displays counted for one point each, while darting counted for 1.5 points each.

Results:
The data yielded no clear connection between blue water color and level of agonistic behavior, which was determined by the frequency and type of display. Set one Bettas displayed a moderate amount of agonistic behavior in the clear water, but none whatsoever in the blue water. Yet, the set 2 Bettas displayed moderately in the clear water but with a very high intensity in the blue water. It was noted that the dark blue Betta from set 2 displayed much more actively than the one of gradient coloring. Set 3 Bettas, on the other hand, displayed very similarly in both trials. Thus, the data here indicated no significant difference between agonistic behavior of Betta splendens in blue and clear water (t-stat = 0.17, df = 2, P = 0.88).

Discussion:
Color did not seem to be a major factor in the ability of the Betta splendens males to identify and direct displays at each other. The blue water and Bettas were similar in coloration, theoretically making body color a trait that does not as readily trigger an agonistic response. The  experiment, however, did not indicate a significant difference in agonistic interactions despite water color (Figure 1). Still, Betta splendens also recognize each other by silhouettes and texture (Bando 1991), so the shape of expanded fins and the appearance of scales allows them to identify and respond to other males.  In addition, research has found that greater brightness and color of an opposing male increased the agonistic response (Bando 1991), which would seem to contradict the results of our experiment. Nevertheless, it is possible that a combination of factors—color, silhouette, and texture—is used for conspecific male identification. This would suggest that silhouette and texture could still be used to identify another male, and the reduction in ability to distinguish that fish's color from its surroundings would not be enough to reduce agonistic behavior.  
	The data from this experiment also shows a large difference in agonistic behavior displayed by the second set of Betta splendens when compared to the other two sets. The composite behavioral score is especially high for the trial in blue water, where the second set's value of 44.5 is compared with values of 0 and 2 from the other two sets (Figure 1). Betta splendens generally display behaviors that are individual but consistent over a variety of contexts and interactions (Dzieweczynski and Forrette 2013). As a result, it is reasonable one fish may tend to display more aggressively than another. As we noted during the experiment, one of the Bettas in set two accounted for most of the recorded behavior during both trials. It is possible the characteristically individual behavior of this fish accounted for this notable difference in set two's composite score.
