Title: The effect of K+ channel blocker TEA on muscle contraction in a Rania pipiens leg

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of a potassium channel blocker on the muscle contractions of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle. The blocker we used was Tetraethylammonium (TEA) and it was injected into the muscle. To send the stimulus, we attached electrodes to the siatic nerve of the leg and measured the contractions with an iWorks device. We hypothesized that the leg would experience prolonged contractions compared to the controll group as well as longer periods of relaxation due to the achievement of fatigue. The results we obtained were statistically significent and it showed the TEA was an effect blocker.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we tested the reaction of a Rania pipiens leg when injected with a K+ channel blocker. The goal of this lab was to observe the difference in contraction in the frog leg after stimulation. When the muscle is stimulated, both the neurons and muscles work together to produce a reaction. First, a stimulus is presented and an action potential is send through the neurons to the muscle junction. Depolarization of the cells begins and an action potential is achieved. Once the AP is achieved, an influx of Na+ depolarizes the cell leading to the opening of potassium channels to repolarize it. Once it arrives, calcium enters the axon after being released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing acetylcholine to be released and this binds to the muscles fibers. Myosin then begins to bind to actin fibers to begin contraction. If this repolarization doesn’t happen, the muscles experiences uncontrolllable spasms until fatigue [Lotshaw: 1997]
Muscle contractions are separated into three period which are the latent, contraction, and relaxation period. The latent period is the time from when the stimulus is delivered to the first indications of contraction in the muscle. The contraction period, is the time it takes the muscle to reach its peak contraction after the latent period. The relaxation period is the time the muscle takes to return to resting tension after reaching its peak contraction [Silverthorn: 2010] For this experiment, we hypothesized that by injecting tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) into the gastrocnemus muscle in the leg of a Rania pipiens, the muscle to go into more intense contractions, or cramp, until ATP is expended and the muscle goes into a delayed fatigue in comparison to the controll. The reason for this is the inability for K+ to enter and repolarize the neuron [Armstrong: 1971]. 


Materials and Method:
We were provided 3 Rania pipiens frog legs that we skinned and cut to expose the gastrocnemus muscle. We then tied the muscle on a string and then hung it up on a force transduction machine. After this, we pinned the leg down to stabilize it before connecting the data acquisition machine (iWork) and the two electrodes were placed under the siatic nerve to send the stimulus. We utilized labscribe with the settings at 0.8 V, 0.5 Hz, and 5 pulses. We performed tests before injecting the potassium blocker, TEA, to measure the twitch duration and relaxation period. After the preliminary tests, we injected 0.1 Ml of TEA into the gastrocnemus, again, recording twitch duration and relaxation period. This process was performed the same for all 3 legs. After, we found the average for both tests and standard deviation to perform a paired t_test to analyze our results. 

Results:
In graph 1, we can see the large difference between the two graphs displaying the controll and the test groups. The averages we observed were 335.6 ms relaxation time in the controll group versus 1030 ms relaxation time in the test group. This difference is a result of the fatigue achieved by the test group when it is no longer able to sustain the contraction that results from the lack of repolarizing that the potassium channel usually completes. Also, the standard deviation for the controll group is 39.88 ms while the test group is 138.88 ms which shows there was more variety in the relaxation times experienced by the test group compared to the controll group. Lastly, the p_value for the relaxation values was 0.011 which shows that our data is statistically significent since it is above the 0.05 significance value. This helps show that it is very low probability that these values were obtained by chance. 

Here in graph too, we again see a large difference in the distribution between the controll and the test group. The average twitch duration for the controll group was 432.78 ms while the test group was 1151.67 ms. This difference is a result of the increased contraction experienced by the frog leg due to the blocking of the potassium channels by TEA. When the channels are blocked, no repolarization takes place so the contractions last longer. We also witnessed a standard deviation of 62.36 ms for the controll group versus 136.84 ms for the test group. Lastly, the p_value for these results was 0.0096, which, is less than the 0.05 significance value showing that it is very unlikely these values observed were due to chance. 
	


Discussion:
According to the data we see broad differences between the test performed with TEA and the test performed without TEA for both relaxation and twitch duration. These claims are backed up by the gap between averages and standard deviations within the two groups. The reason for this is when the TEA is added, it blocks the potassium channels which inhibits the neurons ability to repolarize itself leading to the longer contractions. Also, we see the long relaxation periods experienced by the TEA injected tests because when the muscle contracts and hits fatigue, it takes time for the muscle to finally contract again. According to the p_value, both of these were statistically significent. The p_value for the twitch results was 0.0096 and for relaxation it was 0.0109. Both of these are under the 0.05 significance test showing that if we were to repeat the experiment, the probability the values we obtained were by chance. The results we got further support our hypothesis that the injection of TEA will lead to the muscle experiencing uncontrolllable spasms and them only ceasing once fatigue has been reached.
