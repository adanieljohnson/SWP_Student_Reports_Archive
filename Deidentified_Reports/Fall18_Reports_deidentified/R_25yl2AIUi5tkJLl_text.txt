Title: Fluridone's effect on Photosynthesis 

Abstract:
This experiment tested the pigmentation bleaching attributes of fluridone on photosynthesis rates using the chloroplast from spinach leaves. To do this we diluted 10 test tubes, five of which were controll, and five of which were experimental and contained fluridone. We then placed them in light for ten minute increments three time and recorded the absorptions of each one after each increment in order to find the percent change of absorption over time. We found that the addition of fluridone did in fact slow the rate of photosynthesis. Each of our values decreased at a steady and significent rate with a P-value of 0.00138 after conducting a two sample T-test. The data reveal that pigmentation is necessary for photosynthesis to be carried out effectively.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis takes place in an organelle called the chloroplast. The light-capturing photosystems of chloroplasts and bacteria are proteins that are plugged through internal, energy-transducing membranes, thylakoids. Each photosystem is a complete structural and functional unit that contains two essential components. The primary component is the reaction center, which allows an energized chlorophyll molecule to lose an electron to an acceptor molecule, thus initiating and powering electron transport. These pigment molecules absorb light, and keep the reaction center supplied with excitation energy. [Allen,2002] Photosynthesis is a precise process that of which requires particular conditions in order to conduct properly. In this experiment we will be using fluridone herbicide which is primarily used to bleach plant pigment.  Carotenoids and chlorophylls are essential constituents of photosynthetic membranes. The lack of carotenoids results in a block in membrane formation and the concurrent bleaching of the organism. [Popova, 1998] One problem that could arise from pigmentation bleaching in plants is that the chloroplast, the main site of photosynthesis, would be unable to absorb light without its green pigmentation. Light, which is then used in the electron transport chain would no longer be able to react in order to create a proton concentration gradient. This would then in turn would disable the plant from creating NAD+, ATP and glucose efficiently. Based on this information, we hypothesize that the addition of Fluridone herbicide will decrease the activity of photosynthesis due to the bleaching of the plant pigment, because it will inhibit light absorption.

Materials and Method:
1.       Pack a mortar and pestle, and a beaker into ice to cool.
2.       While the mortar and pestle are cooling, dry them off then put spinach leaves (4) and 10 Ml of grinding buffer into the pestle.
3.       After grinding for a couple minutes add 10 more Ml of grinding buffer to the pestle.
4.       Pour these contents into a beaker, draining it through cheesecloth, and centrifuge it for ten minutes.
5.       After the contents have been centrifuged, prepare the following test tubes.
6.       Prepare the above test tubes and label them 1-11 (eleven should be the blank)
7.       Start with 100 nanoliters of chloroplast in all test tubes except for the blank
8.       Mix the tubes quickly after adding the chloroplast
9.       Transfer to curettes immediately blank the spectrophotometer with the absorbance set at 600 nm
10.   Place all test tubes under equal light exposure for ten minutes
11.   Blank photo spectrometer and record absorbances for all 10 test tubes
12.   Repeat the process of leaving the test tubes in light for 10 minute increments and reading the absorbances directly after two more times. Totaling 30 minutes by the final round
13.   Calculate the percent change between each interval
14. Run a paired T-test to determine significance


Results:
Our results show that the experimental groups percent change over time were larger than the controll group. Both groups remained consistent increasing in percentage over time, all of the percentages became more negative over time. The absorbances of the experimental group were also much higher than the absorbances of the controll group. Iike figure two, figure one’s experimental and controll groups both revealed the absorbance rates becoming more negative over time consistently  

Discussion:
The absorbances of the experimental group treated with 1 Ml of fluridone had large absorbances to begin with and after three trials of light had decreasing absorbance rates which indicates the slowing of the photosynthetic process. These results are apparent in figure one where the average absorbance after ten minutes of light exposure was 2.26nm and then decreased by the 30 minute mark to 2.03nm which is a five percent decrease overall which can be seen in figure two. After running a two sample T-test our results were a P-value of 0.00138 which we can consider significent since it is smaller than 0.05. With these results we can reject the null hypothesis and accept our alternative hypothesis that we hypothesize that the addition of Fluridone herbicide will decrease the activity of photosynthesis due to the bleaching of the plant pigment, because it will inhibit light absorption. This is due to the fact that when chloroplast loses its pigmentation it is no longer able to absorb light as efficiently which in turn slows the rate of photosynthesis. Our findings were consistent with the findings of Yoshioka who found that to analyze the effect of ABA on the salinity-related signal transduction for regulation of gene expressions, ABA biosynthesis was inhibited with fluridone [Yoshioka et al. 1998]. Though her results were not the same the similarity lies in the inhibition of ABA which is a component which would effect and slow the rate of photosynthesis much like our experiment demonstrated. Furthermore, fluridone is used in many aquatic settings which could be hurting and affecting the rest of the environment. Specifically fluridone is used to controll certain weeds such as, Aquatic weeds, barnyardgrass, Bermudagrass, blackgrass, cocklebur, crabgrass, foxtails, jimsonweed, Johnsongrass, ragweed, velvetleaf and many others. [Balyszak, 2016] Though our experiment effectively demonstrated that fluridone, through pigmentation bleaching, slows the rate of photosynthesis significently, there are some factors that could be improved upon. For example, fluridone is primarily used on aquatic plant, and plant susceptibility to fluridone is associated with its uptake rate and rate of translocation, therefore, by using spinach leaves which is not an aquatic plant, the uptake may not have been as effective by its chloroplasts.
