Title: Hunger driven aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins – commonly known as betta fish – are known to display agonistic behaviors as a warning sign when opposing betta fish encroach on a fish’s territory. These behaviors come in a wide variety from broadside movements to pelvic fin flashing. This experiment focuses on how betta fish react to intruders when they are starved of food and energy. We tested the behaviors of five different betta fish before and after being fed, hypothesizing that the fish would be less likely to display agonistic behaviors when they lack food as a resource. After running the experiment and analyzing the data with a paired t-test, we found that our results were not statistically significant. However, these results did not appear to be conclusive since levels of aggression appeared to vary from fish to fish, and we were confined to a small sample size. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish or betta fish, are a tropical species of fish that are now well known for their use as household pets. Over the years, betta fish have been popularized due to their variety of vibrant colors. Betta fish are also known to be extremely territorial, and have a fixed action pattern to display agonistic behaviors towards other betta fish when they feel their territory is being threatened. [Simpson, 1968],[Klopfer,1990] Examples of these agonistic behaviors include broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These behaviors display aggression towards intruders as a warning sign that the fish will fight for its territory. This experiment focuses on how Betta spelndens display aggressive behaviors towards encroaching fish based on a limited resource: food. We hypothesize that if a betta fish is starved of food, it will be less likely to display agonistic behaviors towards intruders since it will have less energy. Therefore, the fish will choose not to display aggressive behaviors, as it would be an extra expenditure of a resource that has been limited. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment used a glass fish tank divided into three sections using a transparent glass panel. One betta fish was placed in each of the perimeter sections of the tank to be used as controls. Then, a fish starved of food was placed in the middle section and its actions were observed over the course of a three minute period. This process was repeated for five starved fish. After each starved fish’s responses were recorded, each fish was fed and a given a 10 minute period of rest. Then, the fish were once again placed in the middle section of the tank and their behaviors were recorded. A paired T-test was used to compare the levels of aggression in the fish before and after they had been fed. 


Results:
For both groups, there was one fish that consistently displayed high levels of aggression that did not match the rest of the fish. This fish may be considered to be an outlier, as it contributed to extremely high standard deviations for both the control and experimental group. However, even after excluding this fish as an outlier, our hypothesis was rejected, as the results of a paired t-test were not statistically significant (t-value=2.91, df=3, p-value=0.062)


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that Betta splendins will display lower levels of agonistic behaviors was not supported. Although the fish appeared to display less aggressive behaviors, the results of a paired t-test proved that these results were not statistically significant. However, this may be due to our extremely low sample size. In the future, this experiment may yield statistically significant results if there were more fish to work with. Additionally, this experiment may have yielded better results had we given the fish a larger break time to eat and digest the food they were provided in between observations. However, betta fish are no longer bred for their aggression, so their agonistic behaviors may have been reduced over time. [Brannan, 2015]
