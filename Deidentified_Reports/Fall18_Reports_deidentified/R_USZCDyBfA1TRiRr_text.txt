Title: The Negative Effects of JH Analog Hormone Precor on the Growth of Menduca Sexta

Abstract:
Menduca Sexta is the insect being studied in this experiment. We used this type of insect because researchers have had a good understanding of the life cycle of Menduca Sexta. The development of the insect from an egg to an adult is largely influenced by different types of hormones. The main functional hormones are Ecdysterone (20E) and Junvenile Hormone (JH). Both of these hormones have influence on the growth of the insect and especially, the pupation. In the experiment, we had two groups of 4 caterpillars in each – one was the controll group and the other was the experimental group. In the experiment, five drops of the JH analog, precor, were added to the caterpillar’s food. Our hypothesis was that the precor would make the caterpillars grow larger in weight because they would take longer time to pupate. We used two-sample t_test to analyze the data and the result was that our hypothesis was rejected. Five drops of precor in the food would not affect the growth in the weight of the caterpillars. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera and it has a life cycle of 19 to 23 days to grow from eggs to adult moths. The life cycle of Manduca Sexta is an example of a holometabolous life cycle which means the major body recognition is formed during pupal metamorphosis. Before the pupal metamorphosis, there is one life stage point called commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is controllled by Ecdysterone (20E) and Junvenile Hormone (JH). 20E regulates the timing of molting during the insect development and additional functions in adult insects. “JH plays a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult” [Larry: 1975]. “During the larval stages high titres of the hormones prevent differentiation and in a typical case, hormone titres are relatively high during early larval instars but decreases in the late instars preceding metamorphosis” [Larry: 1975]. Normally, Manduca Sexta has five larval instars and up to the fourth instar, JH levels stay fairly high. At the end of the fourth instar, JH levels drop to a very low level and remain at low concentration until the insect reaches the commitment pulse. This phenomenon shows that JH inhibits the pupating stage of Menduca Sexta. Precor, also named methoprene, acts as the JH analog and is used in the experiment. In the experiment, two groups of small Menduca Sexta caterpillars were fed food with water and food with precor respectively. The hypothesis was five drops of precor in the food would cause caterpillars to grow larger in weight because they need more time to hit the commitment pulse in order to pupate. 

Materials and Method:
Two containers with four caterpillars in each are set up for the experiment. The caterpillars are chosen according to similar sizes and lengths for further comparison. Each caterpillar lives in separate cubicles. The controll group receives ten grams of food with five drops of water and the experimental group receives ten grams of food with five drops of precor. The food is changed every two days to make sure it is not dried out. All Menduca Sexta caterpillars are kept in the same incubator at 28℃, in a 12 hour dark; 12 hour light cycle. The caterpillars are weighed for 7 days to calculate the average increase in weight. Then a two-sample t_test is used to analyze the data and get the conclusion.

Results:
The average growth of the controll group was 1.063g and the average growth of the JH experimental group was 1.096g. The standard deviations of controll and JH group were 0.718 and 0.639 respectively. The two-sample t_test p_value was 0.954. 
There was one caterpillar in each group did not grow during the first week. However, caterpillar 3 in the JH group started to grow at the beginning of the second week. Also, caterpillar 1 and 4 in the controll group started to pupate at the end of the second week. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was five drops of JH analog precor would make caterpillars grow larger in weight as they need more time to hit the commitment pulse. However, according to the two-sample t_test, the p_value was larger than the significance level of 5% so the statistic result could not prove the hypothesis was acceptable. The experimental phenomenon demonstrated that five drops of precor did not have a significent effect on the growth of Menduca Sexta caterpillars. 

Even though the two caterpillars did not grow during the first week, we still included them in the result since there would be similar random situations in the nature. After two weeks of the experiment, caterpillar 3 in the JH group started to grow. If we had the experiment run for another week the result might be different. Also, although we failed to prove the hypothesis, we can still make some other conclusions using the observations. For example, at the end of the second week, two caterpillars in the controll group started to pupate but all four caterpillars in the experimental group remained in the caterpillar state. So we could hypothesize that precor does have influence on the growth of Menduca Sexta caterpillars, but we cannot make an exact conclusion according to our experiment. Also, there is another reason why our hypothesis was rejected, as it usually takes Menduca Sexta caterpillars 19-23 days to pupate. However, in the experiment, we only observed the caterpillars for seven days. We might have been able to observe the apparent influences of the precor if the experiment had lasted longer. 

Research says, the application of the juvenile hormone analog will prevent the change in protein synthesis which should stop before the metamorphosis. “Thus, the intermolt change in the lamellar assembly process appears to result from hormone-induced changes in cuticular protein synthesis” [WILLIAM: 1986]. So the precor is supposed to affect the growth of caterpillars. There are several ways we can change the experiment in order to have a better understanding of the effects of the precor. For example, we can use more caterpillars to reduce the percent of the outliers. Also, we can add groups of seven drops of precor or even ten drops, to see if the amount of the precor would largely influence the experiment result. The most important improvement is that the experiment should be carried out for more than at least 23 days, which is the theoretical time for a caterpillar to pupate. 

After we actually figure out the practical effect of the precor, we can apply it in the agricultural industry, as the caterpillars of Menduca Sexta are thought to be pests because they live on crops and grains. If we can know what exact amount of precor would have how much effect on the caterpillars, we can inhibit caterpillars to turn into adult moths which will reproduce more caterpillars to harm the farMland. So the application of precor can be used to reduce the influence of the caterpillars on the agriculture.
