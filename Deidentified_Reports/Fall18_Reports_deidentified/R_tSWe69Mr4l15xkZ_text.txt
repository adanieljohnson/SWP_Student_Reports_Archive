Title: The Increased Mean Weight Effects of the IGR Precor on Larval Stage Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates the type of molt during the development of Manduca sexta. Insect growth regulators (IGR) affect JH by either mimicking or inhibiting JH’s natural function. Precor is an IGR that mimics JH function. We decided to investigate the effects on larval Manduca sexta in order to monitor the effects the Precor had on weight and larval development. The control was fed a diet based on manufacturer instructions and the experimental had drops of Precor added to it. All other variables were kept constant. Data was analyzed using a one-tail T test which showed that the data collected was marginally significant but not enough to fully support our hypothesis. We had caterpillars from various larval stages and it is  possible that the Precor affected caterpillars in different stages differently. Scientists can use this collected data in order to better understand the effects of IGRs that mimic JH.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, the horn caterpillar, is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera which includes butterflies and moths.Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates the type of molt during the development of Manduca sexta. The hormone exerts “biochemical restraint” on cellular transformation which cause metamorphosis of an insect to take place [Williams : 1965]. Insect growth regulators (IGR) affect JH by either mimicking or inhibiting JH’s natural function [Johnson : 2018]. Precor is a type of IGR that mimics JH. We decided to determine the effects of Precor of early larval stage Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta is the ideal organism to experiment with because we know a lot about the average life cycle and maturation process of these insects. When JH levels drop very low and Ecdysterone levels rise, the larva reaches the commitment pulse where it begins to pupate. We hypothesize if the Manduca sexta are given Precor with their food that they will continue to gain weight. This is a plausible hypothesis because the Precor will mimic the role of JH and the Manduca sexta will not reach their commitment pulse and will not pupate.  


Materials and Methods:
There was one treatment group and one control group. Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars somewhere between the third and fourth larval stage were selected and divided into two groups of four. Each caterpillar was placed into its own separate rearing jar. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets. The 4 control caterpillars received ten grams of Great Lakes Manduca diet (GLM) prepared according to manufacturer instructions with three drops of water. The 4 experimental caterpillars received ten grams of GLM diet with three drops of Precor added in place of the water. Initial weight measurements of all eight caterpillars were taken in grams. Measurements were taken every other day for two weeks and recorded. Food was changed when it had dried out. Observations of all caterpillars were recorded as well. To evaluate the data recorded, a one-tail T test was used.


Results:
The control and experimental caterpillars appeared similar in size and shape for a week, but the control group developed black spots/lines on their backs. All the caterpillars ate well except for the caterpillar in the experimental group that appeared diseased. The caterpillar was shriveled and ate very little compared to the others and later died. At the beginning of the second week, both groups appeared at rest/immobile. When disturbed, the control did not move whereas the experimental squirmed violently when disturbed. At the end of the two weeks, all of the caterpillars in the control group had pupated while none of the experimental caterpillars did. Those that did pupate gained weight more slowly toward the end and ultimately lost weight once pupation had begun. The mean change in weight for the control was 5.32g ∓ 0.93g, which was the standard deviation for this group. The mean change in weight for the experimental was 8.1g ∓ 2.80g, which was the standard deviation for this group. As shown in Figure 1, there is a change in weight between the control and the experimental groups and that it is not significant (0.06). While the results were not fully supportive of our hypothesis, they can be considered marginally significant. 


Discussion:
We hypothesized that if the Manduca sexta were given Precor with their food that they would continue to gain weight. Our hypothesis was supported because the experimental group did continue to gain weight, but statistically the results could not be seen as significant because the p value calculated was too high (0.06). The reason that our p value was too high was because the experimental group caterpillars were underweight because often times we came in and they had not eaten majority of the food provided. We had caterpillars from various larval stages and it is also possible that the Precor affected caterpillars in different stages differently. JH mimics are known to disrupt embryonic and larval insect development [Payen : 1977]. Our p value could be seen as marginally significant and for this reason our hypothesis could not be supported.  We speculate that will further testing in which all our caterpillars live, our hypothesis could be supported by experimentation. The control group did go through pupation and the experimental group did not, which suggests that the Precor can do its job as a JH mimic and disrupt the larval development. It would be interesting to expand this experiment and see how varying amounts of Precor impact larval development.  In the future, the experiment could be expanded to measure the effects of JH on other organisms including humans to see if there are possible patterns in regards to development. A study measuring the impacts of JH on humans could impact the way we look at many growth defects and apply those to the growth affects seen in Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
