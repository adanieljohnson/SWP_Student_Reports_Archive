Title: Negative Effects of Insect Growth Regulator, Precor, on the Development in Terms of Weight of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Our experiment is testing the effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR), precor, on the weight development of the Manduca Sexta, specifically the commitment pulse. We hypothesize that the addition of precor will inhibit the Maduca Sexta in reaching the commitment pulse, obstructing pupation and resulting in a continuous weight increase. In order to perform our experiment, we have a controll group and an experimental group which receives precor. Our results show the controll group following the normal life cycle of the Manduca Sexta, reaching the commitment pulse and beginning to pupate, while the experimental group does not reach the commitment pulse and continues to increase in weight. (P= 0.318996) In conclusion, the addition of precor inhibits the commitment pulse, resulting in a prolonged larval stage and continuous weight increase in the Manduca Sexta.


Introduction:
Our experiment is testing the effects of an insect growth regulator (IGR), specifically precor, on the development of the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta is an exemplary model organism for our experiment in that the life stages and hormone releases/responses have been widely studied, giving us an ideal basis on which to interpret and discuss our results. The addition of an insect growth regulator like precor affects the normal development of insects, specifically the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is the stage at which the Juvenile Hormone release slows, and the Manduca Sexta begins pupating [Johnson: 2016]. Most species will respond to an IGR treatment by continuing larval, nymphal, or pupal forms, in which they continue to increase in weight between immature and adult forms without pupating [Staal: 1975]. Our chosen IGR, precor, forces the insect to remain in a juvenile state, inhibiting the commitment pulse and continuing growth and weight increase [Izadi: 2005]. The biological question we are asking is that if the precor is added to the food of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar, will the weight of the caterpillars increase, and will the commitment pulse be inhibited? We hypothesize that the addition of precor will inhibit the Manduca Sexta in reaching the commitment pulse, obstructing pupation and resulting in a continuous weight increase.


Materials and Method:
In order to answer the question of whether or not the addition of precor to the food of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar will result in a weight increase, and whether or not the commitment pulse will be inhibited, we will need to have a controll group as well as an experimental group with the addition of precor. The weight of the experimental group of caterpillars will act as our dependent variable, while the addition of precor will act as the independent variable. Eight Maduca Sexta caterpillars were obtained and were randoMly split into two groups of four: one being the controll group and the other being the experimental group. Two containers with four cells each were prepared with breathing holes and labeled in order to distinguish between the two groups. 10g of caterpillar food was measured for each caterpillar (80g total). The food was stirred and split up into eight separate containers containing 10g of food each. Seven drops of di water were added to four of the containers, stirred, and then these four 10g blobs of food/water were placed in the four separate cells of the controll group container. Seven drops of precor were added to the remaining four containers, stirred, and then these four 10g of food/precor blobs were placed in the four separate cells of the experimental group container. The weight of the four controll group caterpillars was recorded in grams, and then they were placed in their cells, while the four experimental group caterpillars were weighed in grams and then placed in their own cells. All eight caterpillars were weighed and observed every other day for one week, and the same process was used to change food when necessary. In order to evaluate the results, we used a two sample T test, reporting a one tailed p value which tells us whether our results were due to chance or whether there is a significent interaction between our two variables.


Results:
Figure 1 shows the average increase in weight of both the controll group and treatment group, with the average weight increase of the controll group being 1.413 g per day, and the average weight increase of the treatment group being 1.199 g per day. The average growth rate of the treatment group is slightly higher than that of the controll group, resulting in an average final weight for the controll group being 7.05 g and an average weight for the treatment group being 8.07 g. The p value of 0.318996 indicates no statistical significance. 


Discussion:
The average weight increase and the final average weights of both the controll and experimental groups parallel our hypothesis which states that the addition of precor would inhibit the commitment pulse and result in an ongoing weight increase as shown in the greater average weight increase of the treatment group. Figure 1 displays the average growth rates of both the controll and experimental groups, resulting in a higher average growth rate of the treatment group. This higher average growth rate once again supports our hypothesis in that the treatment group had an inhibited commitment pulse and an elongated span of weight increase. In calculating the average growth rate for the controll group, we threw out the data observations for caterpillar 1, as this caterpillar failed to increase in weight at all and ended up dying in the middle of our experiment. Since we threw out caterpillar 1 of the controll group from our data analysis, we only had 3 controll group caterpillars compared to our 4 treatment group caterpillars. Due to the limited number of controll group caterpillars, our data analysis is likewise slightly limited in its representation of the entire population of Manduca Sexta. Our two-sample t test resulted in a one tail p value of 0.31899. We saw a general pattern of support of our hypothesis in the average growth rates of both the controll and experimental groups; however, the difference was not statistically significent. The high p_value points towards the fact that this is a very limited study with small controll and treatment groups. One week prior to our final recording, our controll group had pupated while our treatment group had continued to increase in weight and showed no sign of the commitment pulse. These observations additionally support our hypothesis that the addition of precor would obstruct the commitment pulse and sustain weight increase. Furthermore, these results hold strong both Izadi and Staal’s prior-mentioned findings that insect growth inhibitors like precor will force the insect to remain in a juvenile state, inhibiting the commitment pulse and sustaining an increase in weight between the immature and adult forms [Staal: 1975], [Izadi: 2005]. For future tests, larger controll and treatment groups would allow us to analyze data that is more representative of the entire population of the Manduca Sexta. Furthermore, if we were to continue our experiment for one week longer (total of two weeks), we would likely be able to observe the controll group entering the commitment pulse, while continuing to observe an increase in weight of the treatment group.
