Title: Betta Splenden Aggression: The Effects of Water Color on Agonistic Behaviors 

Abstract:
he main objective of this experiment was to test if water color has an effect on Betta Splendins agnostic behavior. Our hypothesis supported that water color would in fact have an effect of levels of aggression of Betta males. By placing a glass divider between two males and then removing the partition and ranking each male’s behavior in both clear, red, and green water, we determined that our results were not statistically significent and our alternative hypothesis was rejected. If this experiment was produced in the future, it is suggested to leave a longer resting time between betta male interaction as to not tire the fish and to prevent habituation. 

Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, combines careful observation and evolutionary biology in order to fully understand physiological purposes for behavior. With patient observation, scientists can successfully study animal behavior with respects to ethology. In this study, we observed the Betta Splendins, or common Betta fish. One characteristic that makes the Betta a particularly great organism for studying ethology is their colorful displays of antagnostic behavior during intraspecific instructions [Simpson: 1968]. By analyzing broadside and facing movements, the specific behaviors male bettas enact when antagonized, a larger understanding of social interaction with aggression and species interaction can be understood. This experiment tested the effects of different water color on antagnostic behavior between to Betta males. Our independent variable is the changing water colors, and our dependent variable is the amount of aggressive behavior between the two males. We hypothesize that water color will present a significent difference in agnostic interaction between betta males. 


Materials and Method:
First a ranking system was created in order to classify each male’s agnostic behaviors: 1-no aggressive behavior, 2-pelvic fin flickering and the presence of erect pectoral fish, 3- tail beating, and spread gill cover, 4-tail flashing and red mane behaviors, and finally 5- physical contact and attack. Two tri divided tanks were taken and divided into three sections. Four random Betta males were then selected, labeled and paired together. The first pair interacted in clear water with a glass partition between them and then allowed to rest for five minutes. After rest, the glass partition was removed and each male Betta in the pair was given a rank for personal agnostic behavior. Each pair of Betta males was tested in the same way in each color condition- both green and red. Four drops of nontoxic food coloring were used to color both the green and red food coloring. We ran two anova tests to determine if there was a statistically significent difference in aggressive behavior in clear or colored water.

Results:
When comparing the average rankings of agnostic behavior in the presence of a glass partition, our results were not statistically significent (f (11) =0.0842, p=0.462). Similar to that of the glass partition, the trials ran without the glass partition to divide the males proved not statistically significent either (f (11) = 0.206, p= 0.0818). Figure one supports the trend of overall higher male aggression without the presence of a male divider. Perhaps the most visible in the red water, agnostic behavior of all the males in the red water was ranked at an average of 2.25 +/- 1.26 with the presence of a glass divider. Without the divider, an average of 3.25 +/- 1.71 was given to characterize the sum of male betta interaction in red water. 

Discussion:
Average aggression level with and without a glass divider proved to be not significently statistically significent in any of the three-color conditions. In this case, our alternative hypothesis was rejected that water color does indeed have an effect on betta male aggression. One major aspect that may have led to the rejection of our hypothesis was the fact that our beta fish may not have had a lot of time to rest in-between the numerous trials conducted. Perhaps accustomed to the stress, the bettas began to habituate into their changing environments and were less concerned by perceived threats. This could have greatly decreased their agnostic behavior. In a somewhat similar study it was found that with the presence of red flashing lights, male betta behavior was more aggressive than normal [Braud: 1969]. While our experiment did not include colored lights, both present an experiment manipulating the perceived surroundings of Betta males. In the future, this study can be improved with longer waiting times between trials to ensure the fish do not tire. This study could also be used to help understand the ways in which fish would act more aggressive in certain environments, and to produce fish populations with less perceived threats.
