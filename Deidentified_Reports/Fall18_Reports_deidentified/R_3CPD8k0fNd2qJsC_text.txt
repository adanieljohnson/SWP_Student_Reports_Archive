Title: Effect of Tank Size on Aggression Levels in Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their agnostic (or aggressive) behavior in response to other Betta fish. By observing the behavior of male Betta splendins put together in varying tank sizes, much can be learned about how (1) the space in between fish affects their aggression level toward each other and (2) whether having a larger tank space lowers aggressive behavior simply because the fish are able to coexist in the same tank without noticing each other. Two sets of male bettas were used for observation in a large tank and a small tank and their total aggressive behavior was calculated (TAB). Results of the study were significent and the initial hypothesis that Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when together in the small tank was supported.


Introduction:
Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their agnostic (or aggressive) behavior in response to other Betta fish. These intraspecific responses vary in the level of aggression. There are two main classes of agnostic behavior, facing and broadside, with several behaviors increasing in aggression in each class [Johnson:2018]. Environmental factors may play a role in which behaviors a Betta displays. A study on the aggressive behavior in fish found that B. splendins actively explore new environments, and when they see stimuli (either another fish or an inanimate object), they act out in aggressive ways [CITE]. The level of aggression, however, can vary depending on whether the fish saw the stimuli immediately, or whether the fish coexisted with the stimuli unknowingly for a period of time prior to noticing it. 

By observing the behavior of male Betta splendins put together in varying tank sizes, much can be learned about how (1) the space in between fish affects their aggression level toward each other and (2) whether having a larger tank space lowers aggressive behavior simply because the fish are able to coexist in the same tank without noticing each other. Two tank sizes will be used (one small and one large), and it is hypothesized that male Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when put together in the small tank than the large tank and that when in the large tank together, the fish will not notice each other right away. 

Materials and Method:
Each observation period will proceed for 5 minutes and will be followed by a 5-minute rest period. For the first experiment, two male Betta fish will be placed into a small tank at opposite ends using a net. There should be no barriers in the tank. The fish will be observed for 5 minutes and a tally chart will be kept to track the number of times each fish displays one of the six aggressive behaviors. After 5 minutes, barriers will be placed in between the fish to separate them and the rest period will begin. This same experiment will be repeated with another set of two new male Bettas. 

After the rest period is finished, each of the two sets of male fish will complete the same exercise in the larger tank. Fish will be placed in the tank at opposite ends again using nets and the same tally chart will be kept for these next two runs. After 5 minutes of observation in the tank, fish will be removed from the large tank and placed into small tanks with barriers to rest. Each behavior was assigned a rating based on level of aggression of the behavior, and the frequencies that the behaviors were repeated were multiplied by the rating (1, 2 or 3). Next, the sum of all of the numbers for a particular fish was calculated and this was called the total aggressive behavior (TAB). TAB values for each of the 4 fish were used in an unpaired t_test comparing small to large tank size. 


Results:
Results showed that average TAB was higher for fish in the small tank than for fish in the large tank (t_stat=2.878, d.f.=3, P=0.0318). 
It was not able to be determined whether fish noticed each other immediately as patterns were not consistent and no statistical analysis was run since there was not enough data. 

Discussion:
Results of the study were significent and the initial hypothesis that Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when together in the small tank was supported. While completing the experiment, it was not possible to determine whether Bettas noticed each other immediately or not. In comparison to the study mentioned earlier, Bettas most likely did not notice each other immediately when in the large tank since it took a few minutes for aggressive behavior to begin. Results of this study and others alike prove that the amount of space in between two male Bettas affects how they interact with each other. In the future, this study may be improved by testing several tank sizes, rather than just two in order to generate a curve to see at what tank size aggressive behavior decreases.
