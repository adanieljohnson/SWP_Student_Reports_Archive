Title: Manipulating the instar phases and pupation of the manduca sexta caterpillar with growth regulating hormones

Abstract:
Hormones regulate growth and regulatory functions in many species.  The Tobacco Hornworm—also known as the manduca sexta—is one of these species whose growth is regulated by a couple different hormones: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E).  In conjunction, these hormones control when and how the caterpillars will molt into the next instar, or when they will pupate [Johnson, 2018].  The hypothesis of this experiment is that over exposure to 20E will delay the molting and prevent pupation.  This was tested by giving a group of treated caterpillars 20E hormone in their food and comparing their growth (body mass) with a control group.  The results, as expected, were that the treated caterpillars’ growth was stunted and none pupated.  The statistical tests confirmed this for there was a significant difference in the average mass of each group (t-stat= 2.01, df=6, P= 0.09).


Introduction:
Hormones are necessary for the growth and regulation of many different species.  One of these species is the manduca sexta, also known as the Tobacco Hornworm.  The manduca sexta matures into an adult in a holometabolous life cycle in which molting separates the instars and pupal phases.  This is all dependent on the hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which initiate and regulate these phases.  These two hormones work together to regulate aspects of the molt for JH is necessary for the type of molt whereas 20E is critical for the timing of the molt.  In this experiment, levels of 20E hormone were manipulated to test the hypothesis that when manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to high levels of E20, their growth will be stunted, and they will not be able to mature to the next instar or to the pupal stage [Johnson, 2018].

Materials and Methods:
Eight manduca sexta caterpillars were separated into two groups of four—one being the control group and the other being the experimental/treated group.  Two containers with four compartments (one compartment for each caterpillar) were prepared with two air holes punched into each compartment.  10 grams of food were measured for each caterpillar and 6 drops of 20E were added to the food of the treated group.  The mass (grams) of the caterpillars was measured everyday* for 13 days and observations were taken.  Food was replenished as needed.

*There were three days that the caterpillars were not measured because the lab building was not accessible


Results:
Observations were made beginning on day 3 of the experiment.  Frequently recurring observations were made regarding the mass and overall health of each caterpillar group.  The control group was observed to be larger and thriving more than the treated group.  On Day 6, the caterpillars—both the treated and control groups—became lethargic and did not have interest in their food.  There was also liquid beginning to collect in the containers for the food appeared to be more wet than when the experiment was originally set up.  It was noted on Day 7 that all of the caterpillars no longer looked to be healthy, and they continued not to eat.  On Day 8, it was observed that the amount of liquid in the containers became more substantial and Caterpillar #1 was presumed dead because of lack of response to being handled.  The caterpillars continued to lose weight.  Caterpillar #4 was presumed dead on Day 11 because it appeared to be decomposing.  Only 2 caterpillars (#2 and #3) pupated.

Discussion:
The results from this experiment support the originally stated hypothesis that when the caterpillars are exposed to an increased level of the 20E hormone, their growth and ability to molt into the next instar are obstructed so that they cannot pupate.  This was directly supported by the evidence that the caterpillars from the group treated with 20E hormone were significantly smaller than the caterpillars from the control group (Figure 1).  The statistical analysis also proved that the mean mass of these groups—the control and the treated—significantly differ (t-stat= 2.01, df=6, P= 0.09).  Therefore, the 20E hormone significantly manipulated the caterpillars’ ability to molt into the next instar, and pupation.
