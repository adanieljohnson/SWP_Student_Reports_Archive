Title: Effect of increased juvenile hormone mimic on the development of larval Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The hormones JH and 20E are critical in the development of Manduca sexta. A drop in JH and spike in 20E leads to metamorphosis. The objective of the study was to determine whether or not manipulating the levels of JH in Manduca sexta’s diet had an effect on its weight. Levels of JH were manipulated by adding a JH mimic to the diet of the treatment group of Manduca Sexta and compared to a controll group given distilled water. The mean difference in weight of the treatment group was much higher than the mean difference in weight of the controll group. There was a critical point in which JH levels must drop, thus, addition of JH inhibited the pupation of Manduca sexta larvae but did not have a significent effect on the weights of the organisms. 

Introduction:
Hormones are chemical messengers that have the important job of regulating processes of development such as growth or metamorphosis. Without cues from hormones, development can be interrupted, stunted, or accelerated. In this experiment, we examine the effect of hormones on Manduca Sexta or the tobacco hornworm.  Manduca sexta is a holometabolous organism, meaning larvae engage in a series of instars, or molts before commencing metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. Hormones are the chemical signals responsible for driving this process. Research suggests, the initiation of metamorphosis in Manduca Sexta is stimulated by Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecydysterone (20E) [Browder: 2001]. JH determines the nature of Manduca Sexta’s molt, while 20E regulates the type of molt [Hiruma: 2003]. The two hormones fluctuate throughout the life span of Manduca Sexta. During the final instar when the larva reaches an appropriate size, the brain is signaled to decrease JH levels, and increase 20E levels [Hiruma: 1998]. This change in hormonal balance is the signal that induces metamorphosis. This study addresses the question of what happens to the development of Manduca sexta when the level of JH is manipulated. We hypothesized that if additional JH was added to Manduca Sexta’s diet, then the mean weight of Manduca sexta receiving the treatment would be larger than the controll group of Manduca Sexta because the treatment group would stay in the larval phase and continue eating, while the controll group would develop normally.

Materials and Method:
Manduca sexta were raised in an artificial lab setting in which a group of eight organisms of equal size were separated into groups of four and placed into a gated container with two holes punctured on the sides. The containers were labeled “controll” or “treatment” and each cell was numbered from one to four. Each organism was placed in an individual cell. Manduca sexta were given a diet of 10 grams of food per cell and were fed every other day. To test the effects of a Juvenile hormone mimic, the treatment group of Manduca sexta received a diet of 10 grams of food and 5 drops of Precor, a JH mimic. The controll group was given a diet of 10 grams of food and 5 drops of distilled water. The containers were stored in an incubator set at a constant temperature of 26 degrees. Every other day at 3 PM, the respective weight of each organism was monitored and recorded. After each visit the current weight was subtracted from the weight of the previous check-in. At the end of the experiment, the average weights of the controll and treatment groups were calculated for each check-in. These means were used to calculate the overall mean of the controll group and treatment group. Finally, the two means were compared using a two-sample t test and the results were analyzed.

Results:
The mean difference in weight of the controll group was 0.88g and the standard deviation was 3.15. The mean difference in weight of the treatment group was 2.33g and the standard deviation was 0.81. The two means were compared using a two-sample t test that resulted in a P value of 0.48 (t_stat= 0.76, d.f. =4, P= 0.48). At the beginning of the experiment, the weights of both the controll and treatment groups were increasing. However, on Day 3, the weights of the controll group began to decline and one Manduca sexta in that group pupated. At the same time, the weights of the treatment group kept increasing. On day 7, the weights of the controll group were significently lower than those of the treatment group. Table 1 shows the mean differences in weights of the caterpillars per check in period. One week after day 7, all of the organisms in the controll group pupated and the treatment group remained large.

Discussion:
Figure 1 shows the difference in means between the controll and treatment groups. The mean of the controll group is much smaller than the mean of the treatment group suggesting that the institution of Precor into Manduca sexta’s diet caused an increase in weight by preventing the organism to engage in the commitment pulse and pupate. However, this is not shown by the results of the two-sample t test. Our results are not statistically significent, suggesting that there is enough evidence to conclude that there is not a difference between the mean difference in weights of the controll and the treatment groups. This could be due to our sample size or the number of data points we recorded. For the next experiment, we should use more Manduca sexta, and record their changes in weight more frequently for a longer period of time. These results partially support the hypothesis because the Manduca sexta in the treatment group did stay in the larval phase and continued to eat while the Manduca sexta in the controll group gained weight for a period of time, lost weight, and then pupated, indicating that JH does have an effect on the larval development and inhibition of pupation in Manduca sexta, but does not have a significent effect on the weight of the organisms. In a similar study testing the different effects of insecticides that used JH and 20E agonists, the implementation of the insecticide bisacylhydrazine, which acts as a 20E agonist, in the diet of many different lepidopteran larvae, including Manduca sexta, induced lethal molts. Also, when testing insecticides with JH agonists in the German cockroach Blatella germanica researchers discovered that increased JH led to permanent larvae or sterility of adults [Carlson: 1998]. This study shows the importance of hormones in the development of insects and that if normal levels are manipulated, or critical periods of hormone levels rising or dropping are not met, defects such as sterility or permanent larvae can occur. This is good information to use as the usage of pesticides increases and delays or accelerates the development of insects by disrupting the critical periods in which hormones must fluctuate to advance growth.
