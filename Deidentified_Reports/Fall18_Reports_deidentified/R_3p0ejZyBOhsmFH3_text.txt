Title: The Negative Growth Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In our experiment, we used the Manduca sexta as our model organism for testing the effects of Precor, a drug that enhances Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH is the main hormone responsible for the pupation phase in the Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that if you add JH to the Manduca sextas’ food, then it will grow past the pupation point, never hit the commitment pulse, and be larger than the control group. We separated 8 caterpillars into groups of 2, in which one group was the control group while the other was the experimental group, or specifically the group that receives the hormone. We added 5 drops of Precor to the experimental group’s food and 5 drops of water to the control group’s food. Our major finding was that there was no significant weight difference between the two groups, however there was a huge difference in their appearance, especially after 2 weeks of growth. After 2 weeks, two of the caterpillars in the control group pupated while the ones in the experimental group still showed no signs of pupation. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar has 5 instars during its growth to adulthood. During the 5th larva instar, it begins to pupate, but this only occurs once it has enough energy and nutrients to do so. Another signal that aids in the correct timing of pupation is hormone levels. The two main hormones that play a role in Manduca sexta development is the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone (20E). 20E is required before every molt within development, while the JH hormone is required during all larva stages except the 5th. During this stage, JH drops significantly, and this is a strong signal for pupation to begin. This stage is also referred to as the commitment pulse, since the Manduca sexta is coming to the pupation stage. With this being said, body size is ultimately controlled by 20E and the timing of the onset of JH decay, which leads to pupation. (Davidowitz et al. 49) With this in mind, we hypothesized that if you add JH to the Manduca sextas’ food, then it will grow past the pupation point, never hit the commitment pulse, and be larger than the control group. We will have discovered if the high JH levels that are added in their food through a JH enhancing hormone called Precor contributed to lack of pupation. The Manduca sexta was a model organism for this experiment due to its easily comprehensible larva stages and hormone control. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we gathered 8 Manduca sexta that were roughly 2 weeks old. We separated them into two groups (4 in each group) and labeled one group the control and the other the experimental group, or more specifically the hormone receiving group. We placed 4 caterpillars in a 4-cell plastic container (each in a separate cell) and repeated this process for the experimental group. For the control group, we added 10g of Manduca sexta food along with 5 drops of water to each cell for each caterpillar. We made sure the food was mixed up so the water would be consistent throughout. For the experimental group, we added 10g of Manduca sexta food along with 5 drops of Precor (the JH enhancing drug) to each cell for each caterpillar. Like the control group, we also made sure the food was mixed so that the Precor would be consistent throughout. We examined them for a week and took their weight measurements daily. We changed their food as needed, which was about every 2-3 days. We used the standard T-Test to measure the significance of the average weight difference in each group. 

Results:
The bar graph shows that our data is not significantly different. The general trend of the difference in weight was not different throughout the experiment. The general trend was that the caterpillars gained weight at a normal rate. The experimental group was no larger than the control group. We also completed the T-Test, and our P-value was 0.95. 

Discussion:
The average weight difference was not significant, as we can see from our P-value, however the appearance of the caterpillars did change between the groups. Towards the end of week 1, we could see some of the caterpillars from the control group beginning to pupate, while the ones in the experimental group remained the same. We only recorded for 1 week but left the caterpillars in their containers with fresh food for an extra week. Even without taking measurements, we can conclude that the JH hormone prohibited the commitment pulse because two of the caterpillars from the control group had fully pupated while the ones in the experimental group still showed no signs of pupation. This is important to keep in mind next time this experiment is conducted. We should have recorded for two weeks in order to capture the change within our data, however even if we had kept recording the weight measurements, it does not seem like the weights would have been significantly different, only the timing of the pupation.
