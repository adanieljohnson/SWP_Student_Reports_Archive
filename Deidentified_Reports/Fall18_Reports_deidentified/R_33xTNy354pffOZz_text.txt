Title: Concentration of Ethanol in Rania pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle has No Effect on Twitch Amplitude

Abstract:
Movement, or contraction, in skeletal muscle is the result of a biological process known as excitation coupling. Where the sarcomere, a unit of muscle cells, shortens in response the firing of an action potential by the nervous system. Ethanol, or ethyl alcohol, has been known to block or slow down excitation coupling in skeletal muscle. It was hypothesized that if Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle, a skeletal muscle, was treated with ethanol there would be a statistically different average twitch amplitude compared to muscle treated without ethanol. The average twitch amplitude was determined of three replicates before being treated with ethanol, then after with a transducer. The data was not statistically significent (t=0.0248, d.f.=2, p=0.98). This could be the result of a low concentration of ethanol in the treatment of the muscle.

Introduction:
Organisms move as a function of muscles. Voluntary muscle movement is controllled by the striated or skeletal muscles. These muscles contain many myofibrils organized by structures known as sarcomeres. Contraction is transduced by a biological process known as excitation coupling; motor neurons transmit an action potential down to synaptic terminals where calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This results in the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine generating an action potential down the muscle cell. After the action potential has reached the end of the muscle cell, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.  Ethanol has been found to interfere with the neuromuscular system signals in skeletal muscle [Cofán: 2000]. In a study focusing on the effects of ethanol on the excitation of calcium ions during contraction in isolated mouse skeletal fibers, it was found that ethanol reduces the calcium ion level in the sarcoplasmic reticulum loading stage [Cofán:2000]. The gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, our model organism for this investigation, responds to excitation coupling in the sarcomere, similar to mouse skeletal muscle. The response to one contraction is known as a twitch. We can measure the effect of ethanol on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens by comparing its twitch amplitude before and after the addition of ethanol into the neuromuscular system. Since ethanol has shown to be inhibitory in other skeletal muscle studies, it can be hypothesized that if Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle, a skeletal muscle, was treated with ethanol there would be a statistically different average twitch amplitude compared to muscle treated without ethanol. 

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipien legs were collected and degloved. The gastrocnemus muscle and a portion of the Achilles tendons in each Rania pipiens leg was detached. Then, a Rania pipiens leg was strung to the force transducer. The program LabScribe was used to record the threshold of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle. LabScribe was set to the parameters: 5 pulse, frequency 1Hz, pulse width (W) 5ms, pulse amplitude 0.000V. The threshold stimulus of the muscle was determined to be 0.3V. Next, 1V was added to the threshold found in order to determine the stimulus for the investigation. Three pulses were conducted at 1.3V. The amplitude of each contraction was recorded. After, 0.2Ml of 2% Ethanol was injected into the same gastrocnemus muscle by a syringe. After a five-minute waiting period three pulses were conducted at 1.3V. This was repeated for two other Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles. Each contraction was recorded. The data was analyzed using a two-tailed paired t_test.

Results:
The average twitch amplitude was determined by collecting three twitch amplitudes before the addition of ethanol and after in each of the three Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles. The average twitch amplitude for the muscles treated before ethanol was injected into the muscle was 0.4303 +/- 0.1579 amps. The average twitch amplitude after the muscles were treated with ethanol was 0.4313+/- 0.1139 amps. The data was not statistically significent (t=0.0248, d.f.=2, p=0.98).

Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported; the p_value was greater than 0.05. Therefore, ethanol does not affect the twitch amplitude of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle. This could be due to the low concentration of ethanol used to treat each replicate. In a study looking at the effect of ethanol on the excitability and neuromuscular transmission of frog skeletal muscle, it was demonstrated that ethyl alcohol reduces excitability in neuromuscular transmission [Inoue: 1967]. The study determined that at the concentration of ethyl alcohol increased, there was an increase in the amount of calcium needed to depolarize the muscle cell [Inoue: 1967]. This response blocked the action potential production in the frog skeletal muscle [Inoue: 1967]. The study looked at the muscle exposure of 2% and 3.5% ethanol concentrations in comparison to 0% ethanol in 6 frog skeletal muscles. They recorded data after 30 minutes of exposure [Inoue: 1967]. This is contrary to our study that only looked at the twitch amplitude after 5 minutes of exposure to 2% ethanol. For further study, there should be higher concentrations of ethanol exposed to the gastrocnemus muscle in the Rania pipiens, for a longer duration of time in order to yield more accurate data. More accurate data will create a clearer picture about how ethanol effects the skeletal muscle of the Rania pipiens. Continued investigation of the effects alcohol has on skeletal muscle will allow us to learn more about the physiological effects of alcohol not only in Rania pipiens, but in human skeletal muscle as well.
