Title: Blocking pupation by reducing E20 hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
Ecdysterone, 20-hydroxyecdysterone or 20E for short, is a hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars. Secreted by the prothoracic glands at the back of the head and thorax, this hormone regulates timing of molting in addition to regulating some functions in adult moths. Juvenile hormone, secreted by the corpus allata from glands on either side of the foregut, regulates the type of molting in addition to regulating some functions in adult moths. With the introduction of a hormone blocker, the life cycle of a Manduca sexta caterpillar will be drastically altered. Without both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, Manduca sexta are likely to die. Blocking ecdysterone at the commitment pulse will inhibit growth and prevent the caterpillar from molting. Adding a certain number of drops of 20E blocker to the food of an experimental group and water drops to the other tested this theory. By the conclusion of the experimental tests, the group introduced to 20E blocker, with 1-part Aza guard and 1250-parts water, were dead or close to it while the control group had molted. 

Introduction:
Hormones are responsible for two of the main sets of activities that must be carried out to sustain life: coordinate activities of various parts of the body and regulate growth and development. Manduca sexta caterpillars have a homometabolous life cycle that is governed by hormones. The stages of this cycle, which is typically 39-48 days long, include egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The pupal stage can be identified by reduced movement. The transition between stages is induced by hormones. Ecdysterone (20E) regulates the timing of molting, which occurs during the transition between stages. Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates the type of molting. This is a critical point in which the amount of these hormones alters the cycle of the Manduca sexta. Without the presence of both hormones, the caterpillars will die. During the commitment pulse, which occurs during the 5th instar period, JH levels drop slightly and 20E rises. This is the first time 20E has risen while JH is low. At this stage, the Manduca sexta changes to a pupa. It is essential that each hormone reaches the respective threshold and does not arrest at a subthreshold. [Champlin: 1998]. Due to proliferation being controlled by hormones, the adjustment of either concentration can throw off the cycle [Champlin: 1999]. We hypothesize that, if the ecdysterone (20E) hormone is blocked, then the growth of the caterpillars with halt, causing the caterpillar to be unable to go through molting/ecolosin and move into the next stage in their life cycle and, therefore, their weight should remain constant. 

Materials and Methods:
Two groups of four caterpillars in the 4th or 5th larval instar were selected. Each caterpillar received 10g of food. The control group received 7 drops of distilled water while the experimental group received 7 drops of the 20E blocker, Aza guard (1:1250). The two groups were placed into identical plastic containers with four separate slots and a removable lid. Holes were punched in the containers, so the caterpillars could breathe, and the containers were placed in the incubator. At about 2pm daily, the caterpillars were massed, waste was removed, and food was replaced as needed. In addition to measuring the effects of the 20E hormone blocker introduced, qualitative observations, such as weight, life cycle changes, or lack thereof, were also recorded. A two sample T-test was used to analyze the results. 

Results:
The calculated p-value was P=0.370066 with t-stat 1.051969 and DF=3. The caterpillars were visibly changed from the initial observation to the final day of measurements (Fig. 1). Of the control group, three of the four caterpillars had pupated and the fourth had a hard coating but had not yet pupated. In the experimental group, three appeared to be dead, as they did not respond to any stimuli. Two remained a light green/white color while the other two were brown. All were very squishy. The difference in weight of the control group ranged between 2.96, -0.52, -2.31, and -0.19 and between -0.45, -0.66, -1.73, and -0.30 for the experimental group. The caterpillars weight switched from increasing to decreasing between 9/7 and 9/9. After the maximum point was reached, the control group lost group 4.54, 3.61, 4.22, and 5.3 grams respectively and the experimental group had 3.52, 2.05, 1.24, and 3.74 grams lost respectively.

Discussion:
The mean percent increase was much larger than expected. It was not statistically significant in comparison to the experimental group and, therefore, does not support the hypothesis. However, this does not consider the growth that Manduca sexta sustain during their lifetime. Initial and final masses for each caterpillar are used, which off puts the calculation. Each caterpillar reaches a maximum, critical weight before the commitment pulse, whereupon the caterpillar stops eating and will sustain a loss of nutrients and water [Nijhout: 1974]. This drop is evident in Figure 2, which examines the change in weight over time for each caterpillar. On the other hand, the pattern of weight loss from the maximum point to the final measurement shows more weight being lost in the control than in the experimental group, which does support our hypothesis. The qualitative data collected also supports our hypothesis that the 20E blocker would halt or slow the growth cycle of the caterpillars. As combination Figure 1 shows, the Manduca sexta caterpillars treated with 20E hormone blocker did not pupate. 20E caused them to either attempt to molt or stop the cycle all together, both resulting in death. Out of this experimental group, little movement and lack of vibrant color indicated subjects 2, 3, and 4 were dead, though only 2 and 4 appeared to have attempted to pupate, as they were more brown in color. The 20E blocker seemed to have worked more quickly on experimental caterpillar 1, as it did not change color much but was dead by the end of the study. Those that pupated, 2, 3, and 4 of the control group, were brown in color with a casing around them. Only one caterpillar, control caterpillar 1, did not pupate but was dark brown, as if about to pupate. This research is important because it allows us to have a better understanding of how we can rid the environment hazards such as the Manduca sexta that contaminate and eat tomato plants. Introducing hormone reduction and increase methods can also allow farmers and environmental engineers to reduce the use of pesticides.
