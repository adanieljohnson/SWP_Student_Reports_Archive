Title: Calcium ions increasing the growth of Physarum polycephlaum and failing to grow

Abstract:
Physarum polycephlaum is a type of slime mold that is a yellowish color and grows in dark, moist environments. Slime mold uses signaling pathways to respond to its environment, and these pathways are run by secondary messengers, such as calcium ions. We hypothesize that the slime mold with the abundance of calcium ions will grow more than the controll and more than the EDTA + strontium chloride mold. The slime mold was placed in PDA plates that were soaked in calcium ions, EDTA + strontium chloride, and controlls that were not soaked in anything. The plates were then placed in an incubator and sealed in a black bag to prevent light coming in. After 24 to 48 hours, the growth was measured and a one-way ANOVA test was run for significance. There were no results for this lab because the slime mold went into a hibernated state before the experiment began. A biological reason for this is that one night the room where the slime mold was store rapidly became too cold from the seasonal freezing temperatures of the North Carolina climate and caused the environment and the slime mold to dry out, causing the slime mold to convert to a passive state. Future experiments will be helpful in seeing how rapid changes in environments affect the growth of Physarum polycephlaum. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephlaum is a type of slime mold that is a yellowish color and grows in all places that are most suitable to its liking of darkness and moistness. The plasmodium is a yellow color and moves like a giant amoeba, deploying a network of protoplasmic tubes while searching for food, which typically consist of bacteria, spores and micro-particles [Costello: 2014]. P. polycephlaum is a good model organism for this experiment because it is not a microscopic organism, eliminating the need for a microscope. In addition, P. polycephlaum has a fast response to environmental stimuli and is a resilient organism, reproducing fairly quickly. P. polycephlaum reproduces and moves by the plasmodia undergoing sporulation and meiosis, producing spores that release haploid amoebae upon germination [Adler: 1974]. Slime mold functions in its environment by responding to environmental factors through signaling pathways. These signaling pathways controll the slime mold's responses to external events.
This slime mold has a signaling pathway modeled on two different types of receptors called G-protein receptors and ion-coupled receptors. These signaling pathways controll the movements of the slime mold and regulate responses to its external environment. A signal transduction pathway relies on a cascade of messengers and proteins to carry out a response to an environmental stimulus. The process of these pathways is the binding of proteins or ions to trigger a secondary messenger, such as calcium ions, in order for the response to occur. The secondary messenger of calcium plays a role in neuronal gene expression, energy production, membrane excitability, and cell survival [Kawamoto: 2012]. The role of calcium in P. polycephlaum is necessary for the slime mold to move and grow. This experiment will focus on how calcium levels and calcium receptors affect the growth and movement of the slime mold through different levels of calcium ions present in order to have a better understanding of how secondary messengers influence the slime mold's responses. We hypothesize that the slime mold with the abundance of calcium ions will grow more than the controll and more than the EDTA + strontium chloride exposed mold. 


Materials and Method:
First, the concentrations of EDTA + strontium chloride and calcium ion solutions were diluted. This was done by adding 20 Ml of distilled water to 1 Ml of EDTA + strontium chloride and 20 Ml of distilled water to 1 Ml of calcium ions. After the dilution was completed, three PDA plates were each saturated with 5 Ml of the EDTA + strontium chloride dilution, and three PDA plates were soaked with 5 Ml each of the calcium ion dilution. PDA plates are potato dextrose agar, which means that they have food in the agar gel, instead of having to pour oatmeal flakes on the water agar. The plates were left to soak for 10 minutes before draining the excess solution. After the 10 minutes passed, a 1 cm by 1 cm square was cut in each of the plates, for a total of nine plates, including the three controlls. The utensils were sterilized in ethanol before the cutting began and sterilized after the squares were cut. Then, the utensils were sterilized once again in ethanol, and nine 1 cm by 1 cm squares were caught from the center of the slime mold stock plate. The utensils were then sterilized after the cutting was complete. One square of the stock plate slime mold was then placed in each of the nine PDA plates. The PDA plates were then taped shut, put in a dark black bag, and placed in the incubator for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the plates were observed, and if no growth was observed, then the plates were placed back in the incubator for another 24 hours. After 24 or 48 hours, the plates were removed and using a ruler, the distance of growth of each of the slime molds was measured in centimeters. Once all the data was collected, the plates were disposed of in the trash, and a one-way ANOVA test was run at the 0.05 alpha level to test for significance [Johnson: 2016].

Results:
The slime mold failed to grow during the span of the 48 hours. The results should have shown that the most growth was seen in the PDA plates soaked in the calcium ions, and the least amount of growth should have been observed on the PDA plates soaked in the EDTA + strontium chloride solution, as seen in the predict graph in figure (1.1). The one-way ANOVA test should have shown a significent difference between the average growth of the PDA plates with calcium ions and the controll, the controll and the EDTA + strontium chloride plates, and the calcium ion plates compared to the EDTA + strontium chloride plates. 

Discussion:
The goal of this experiment was to observe the effects of calcium ions and calcium receptors on Physarum polycephlaum. The results of this experiment were inconclusive because the slime mold failed to grow, and no results were able to be determined. The calcium ions should have allowed faster and more growth of the slime mold, and the EDTA + strontium chloride plate should have prevented most growth, as predicted in the hypothesis. This is due to the fact that the secondary messenger of Ca2+ was blocked from reaching its receptor, essentially paralyzing the slime mold from responding to any stimuli in its environment. The abundance of Ca2+ should have caused more binding and faster binding to the receptor, creating a faster response to stimuli, like food, in the adjacent vicinity of the slime mold. This would have caused more growth. 
There are many biological reasons why the P. polycephlaum failed to grow, such as the incubator was not dark, hot, or humid enough to support the growth of the slime mold. Another biological reason argues that before the experiment began, the slime mold was stored in a room affected by fluctuating temperatures. Slime mold is so temperature sensitive that even small temperature differences cause marked differences in the time of mitosis in petri dish cultures of P. polycephlaum [Mohberg: 1977]. One night, as winter weather began to bring freezing temperatures, the poorly insulated room's temperature began to rapidly drop. This fast drop in temperature caused the slime mold to enter into a passive state called sclerotium to protect itself from harsh environments. It has been concluded that low temperature disrupts microfilament structures that are necessary for the maintenance of the elongated cell shape by inducing intracellular Ca2+ release [Uyeda: 1985]. This means the slime mold movement essentially stopped due to the cold air affecting the microtubules used for slime mold movement. Cold air brings dry humidity, which creates a dry environment for the slime mold and dries it out. This dry humidity and cold temperature is a harsh environment for P. polycephlaum to survive. The combination of the cold and dry humidity could have caused the slime mold to essentially hibernate before the start of the experiment, causing no growth to occur. This experiment creates the need to conduct future experiments on how P. polycephlaum reacts to drastic changes in its environment as well as how slime mold reacts to the cold. Also, this brings the need for future experiments to see how calcium ions and receptors are affected by the cold as well. This will help prevent future experiments working with P. polycephlaum from failing and offer insight into how slime mold and other mold can be prevented and controllled in residential living spaces.
