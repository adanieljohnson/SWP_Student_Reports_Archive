Title: Juvenile Hormone Mimic causes stunted growth and instar-transition inhibition in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, we looked at Manduca Sexta, or the tobacco hornworm caterpillar to test the effects of Juvenile Hormone, by using G-Regulator, on the size and stage of the caterpillars. Juvenile Hormone is one of the hormones that effects growth, along with Ecdysterone, in the tobacco hornworm. These hormones work together to initiate the pupation and instar changes in the caterpillars. We hypothesized that when provided with the hormone every other day, the treated caterpillars would grow larger in size compared to the controll caterpillars. We also hypothesized that the treatment caterpillars would not pupate. Both groups were fed the same amount of food, but every other day, the treatment group received 5 drops of G-Regulator, a JH mimic, in their food. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in size between the treatment and controll groups. However we were able to reject the null-hypothesis that there would be no differences in pupation between the two groups. Pupation was initiated in the controll group, but prevented in the treatment group. Using this knowledge, we can understand that the weight of caterpillars drops as they enter pupation. We also are able to see that manipulation and administration of growth hormones, can inhibit caterpi

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, a homometabolous insect (Johnson: 8), is often used as a model organism in scientific experiments. It is considered a strong model organism due to its relatively quick life cycle and quick life stage changes. It also has many easily measurable qualities (Vogt). Naturally, inside of the manduca sexta, input through the nervous and endocrine system affect the brains responses to bodily processes in the form of output signals. These output signals are found in the form of brain-derived hormones and can affect growth, development, behavior, and physiology of the specimen (Johnson: 10). Then, activation and organization effects work together to respond to the environment within the endocrine and physiological systems.  (Johnson: 11). As we take a closer look into the endocrine system, we see that the main hormones influencing growth in manduca sexta are Prothoracicotropic, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. In our experiment we focused on how Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH) cooperate within the organisms. Ecdysterone, effects the timing of the molting process. Juvenile Hormone controlls and maintains the kind of molting that occurs in Manduca sexta. When JH levels begin to drop between the 4th and 5th instar, ecdysterone levels rise, together initiating the commitment pulse.  This indicates that the caterpillar is large and nourished enough to pupate and become an adult moth (Johnson: 12). The commitment pulse launches a set of behavioral, genetic, morphological, and physiological changes. Physiologically the caterpillars will begin to dark to a brownish color preceding pupation (Johnson: 13). Other experiments, including a case study on the effects of flossflower, containing a JH mimic, prevented pupation in the caterpillars when the hormone was given in moderation. It also caused the larvae to grow larger (Johnson: 14). In this lab, we looked at Manduca Sexta, or the tobacco hornworm caterpillar to test the effects of Juvenile Hormone, by using G-Regulator, on the size and stage of the caterpillars. We hypothesized that when provided with the hormone every other day, the treated caterpillars would grow larger in size compared to the controll caterpillars. We also hypothesized that the treatment caterpillars would not pupate.

Materials and Method:
Our independent variable was the amount of G-Regulator administered. Our dependent variable was the size of the caterpillars and the stage of the caterpillars. Our controlls were the species of caterpillar, bins, air holes, amount of food, environment, temperature, and length of experiment. 
As far as our steps in this experiment. We first, put aside two identical plastic bins, with four compartments in each bin. One bin was labelled “Control” and the other “Treatment”. We then, weighed and recorded the weights of each caterpillar, in grams,  labelling them with numbers and randoMly assigning them to the treatment or controll group. We also recorded the physical characteristics of the caterpillars. Each group was provided with 10g of food which is placed in their respective compartments. Before pla
cing the treatment group’s food inside their compartments, we added 5 drops of G-regulator to each serving, using a pipet and  mixing the hormone into the food. We then put tops on the bins and placed the bins in the incubator. Everyday, we replaced 10g of food and cleaned the bins of poop and leftover food using a wet paper towel. While cleaning, we obtained a third bin with four compartments and placed the caterpillars in the extra bin. We repeated the weighing and recording of physical characteristics of the caterpillars each day. The difference was that every other day, the treatment group received 5 drops of G-regulator in their food, while the controll group received the same amount of food without hormones. Statistically, we ran a two-tailed T-test comparing the means of the treatment and controll groups’ sizes. 


Results:
The controll and treatment group started out around the same size. After the second day, it became clearer that the controll group was gaining more mass than the treatment group. The standard deviation in the beginning was very small, but increased as the experiment continued. At day 9, the controll and treatment group were similar in mass again, until the treatment group surpassed the controll group on the 14th and 15th day (Figure 1).  The P value of the two-tailed test was 0.75 which is above .05. Qualitatively, the controll caterpillars (Figure 2) turned a yellowish-brown prior to pupation. The treatment caterpillars turned a lighter shade of blue (Figure 3).


Discussion:
We had hypothesized that the treatment group would be larger in size compared to the controll group, and the the treatment group would not pupate. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that the treatment group will be smaller than the controll group because of the high P value of the two-tailed test. The However, our hypothesis partially aligned with our results as we hypothesized that the treatment group would not pupate over the course of the two weeks, and none of the caterpillars in the treatment group pupated. The data that the controll group’s mean weight until day 9 is greater than the treatment groups mean weight makes sense, because the treatment group was being provided with JH. By regularly receiving the JH the treatment group’s levels would not drop low enough to reach commitment pulse. Without the commitment pulse the larvae would be unable to enter pupation (Johnson: 12). When the controll group started to pupate around day 9, the mean weight decreased which suggests in pupation the caterpillars are lighter than their larval form. Since the treatment group did not pupate, they never experienced this drop off in weight. Secondly, in the case study, the group that received flossflower with G-regulator was larger when the G-regulator in the food was present, but at a lower percentage. Our results of the treatment group being larger in size than the controll group is consistent with the previous Flossflower study. By successfully preventing pupation in the treatment group, it is possible that JH hormone can be manipulated in insects to prevent pest issues in crops and the agricultural world.
