Title: Agnostic Behaviors in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins otherwise known as Siamese Fighting Fish are indigenous to Thailand [ADJohnson: 2016]. The males of this species of fish, are known for their aggressive behaviors towards other B. splenden males. During this experiment, the aggressiveness of these fish was tested to see what could cause them to be more aggressive. A toothbrush was used for vibration, and one of the two fish were vibrated, and afterward, they were allowed to look at one another for interaction over the course of five minutes. The hypothesis was not supported, and the fish responded negatively toward vibration. Each of the fish showed signs of significently less aggression than before the fish was vibrated.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to analyze the ethology of B. splendins, and to understand when they become most aggressive. Ethology is the study of animal behavior. B. splendins display certain types of agnostic behaviors. There are two types of agnostic behaviors. One is intraspecific, which includes both broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. This includes levels of increasing aggressiveness: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. There are also three facing movements that B. splendins display and these are also movements of increasing aggressiveness: the first occurs when the fish faces its opponent with pectoral fins erect, and usually at the same time, the opercula spreads, the more aggressive facing behavior occurs when the male B. splenden protrudes it’s branchiostegal membrane under the opercula [ADJohnson: 2016]. If a B. splenden has its water vibrated, then it will respond more aggressively toward the other male fish.

Materials and Method:
First, four fish and a toothbrush were collected. Then the four fish were separated into two pairs. All fish were males, and they were each numbered. The toothbrush was then turned on for the vibration effect and placed into one fish from each pair’s water for two and a half minutes. Then, the middle white partition was removed and both male B. splendins were allowed to interact with one another for five minutes, and then had a break of five minutes to ensure the fish were not being overworked. A paired t_test was used to analyze their behavioral data, and the aggressiveness of the B. splendins was recorded. Each action was recorded either under broadside movements or facing movements. Then, based off of each fish’s action, their behavior was recorded using a one for least aggressive, or three for most aggressive.

Results:
The total facing and broadside movements that were displayed was greater before vibration than after (4.2 +/- 0.66) (Fig. 1). Fish two demonstrated higher agnostic behavior before vibration (4.8 +/- 0.25). Furthermore, fish three demonstrated much more aggression before vibration (4.38 +/- 0.25), rather than after (1.93 +/- 0.66). Additionally, fish four contributed to this pattern with an aggression sum ofs (4.41 +/- 0.25) before, and (3.33 +/- 0.66) after. By using a paired t_test, this data showed that the vibration significently decreased the B. splendins aggressiveness. (t_stat = 5.53, d.f. = 3, p = 0.012)

Discussion:
The hypothesis that B. splendins would be more aggressive if their water was vibrated, was not supported. Throughout the experiment, the fish showed less aggressiveness in response to swimming in a somewhat vibrated area. It was observed that sometimes the fish displayed less aggressiveness rather than more after being vibrated for two and a half minutes.
