Title: The Powerhouse of Mitochondria: Photosynthesis 

Abstract:
Autotrophs use chloroplasts to generate ATP from sunlight in a process called photosynthesis. We hypothesized that spinach prefers low levels of light, while kale prefers high levels of light to generate ATP. Both spinach and kale leaves were compared in regard to light absorbance, which was measured using a spectrophotometer. A mortar and pestle was used to ground the leaves into a paste, which was then mixed with a grinding buffer. The slurry was then filtered and analyzed in the spectrometer, which reported the levels of light absorbance for both spinach and kale in both light and dark conditions. Both data sets were tested for significance using a two-tailed t_test. The light conditions had 0.0366, which is significent. Likewise, the dark conditions had a 0.050, which is also significent. The data showed spinach to have a lower absorbance than kale in both light and dark conditions. Since a lower absorbance is equal to a higher photosynthetic rate, we had concluded spinach had a higher photosynthetic activity in both light and dark conditions because spinach has a higher overall leaf surface area than kale, which allows for a lower absorbance and higher overall photosynthetic activity than kale. 


Introduction:
In order to live and generate ATP, organisms must gain energy from some external source. For autotrophs, energy is generated in a process known as photosynthesis. This energy is released by means of glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and respiration in the mitochondria of cells. Photosynthesis and respiration are two of the most important metabolic processes for producing energy in autotrophs. Photosynthesis and respiration involve oxidation-reduction reactions (commonly known as redox reactions). In redox reactions, high energy electrons are released by electron donors like NADH into the electron transport chain. As a result, protons can be moved against their concentration gradient across the lipid bilayer in mitochondria, and larger complexes use these protons to synthesize ATP. In photosynthesis, the following reaction occurs:
	6C02 + 12H2O -&gt; C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2 
This reaction is a redox reaction, and is light dependent. As a result of this reaction, carbon dioxide and water are converted into glucose, water and oxygen. This is significent because the autotroph uses the glucose for ATP production and energy in glycolysis, and the mitochondria in heterotrophs use the oxygen byproduct for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. In other words, heterotrophs use the oxygen byproduct of photosynthesis to live. Additionally, carbon dioxide is toxic to heterotrophs, and autotrophs remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into useful oxygen by means of photosynthesis. [Semer : 2018] Photosynthesis occurs in two stages; light dependent reactions, which require light for ATP production, and light independent reactions, which do not require light to convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. [He : 2018] For this experiment, two model organisms were used to compare photosynthetic activities; spinach and kale. Spinach grows ideally in low levels of light, and kale grows optimally at higher levels of light intensity. If the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts in spinach and kale were compared at their optimal conditions, both plants should exhibit relatively high amounts of photosynthetic activity. With this in mind, spinach leaves should exhibit higher rates of photosynthetic activity at lower levels of light, and kale leaves should exhibit higher amounts of photosynthetic activity at higher light levels. 


Materials and Method:
To compare the amount of photosynthetic activity in each type of plant, in part one of our procedure we packed a mortar, pestle, a 150Ml beaker, and 3 Ml centrifuges into an ice bath. Then, we retrieved 6 spinach leaves, and 6 kale leaves. The central veins were then removed from all of the spinach and kale leaves, and the veinless spinach leaves were then added to the mortar and pestle along with 10Ml of cold grinding buffer. [Zimmerman : 2013] The spinach leaves were then ground into a smooth slurry that was free of clumps. 10 more milliliters of grinding buffer were added, and the green slump was strained through a cheesecloth into the 150Ml beaker. The kale was treated in the same manner as the spinach, as it was place into the mortar with 10Ml grinding buffer, ground into a slurry, mixed with 10 additional Ml of grinding buffer, and strained through a cheesecloth into a separate 150Ml beaker. Both the spinach and kale were placed into two 50Ml centrifuge tubes, one for each plant type. Each sample was spun at 200x6 in a spectrometer with a balance tube. [Parker : 2018] Then, the supernatant was poured out of each centrifuge tube, which was separate from debris. The samples were then centrifuged at 1000x6G. Finally, 200Ml of each sample was collected and placed in a micro meter. In the second part of our procedure, 10 test tubes were labeled as follows: for the blank and regular controlls, one tube was labeled “8Ml H2O”, and another was labeled “2Ml Reaction Buffer”. The reaction buffer in this procedure is 100mm phosphate with a PH of 6.3. For the kale, one tube was labeled “6Ml H2O”, another was labeled “2Ml 130 mm DCP”, and a final tube was labeled “2Ml reaction buffer”. The test tubes for the spinach were labeled in a similar manner, as one tube was labeled “6Ml H2O”, another tube was labeled “2Ml 130Ml DCP”, and a final tube for the spinach was labeled “2Ml reaction buffer”. After this labeling process was completed, 100Ml of enriched chloroplasts was added to each test tube. Then, 100Ml of kale enriched chloroplasts was added to test tubes 3-6. Immediately after addition of the enriched chloroplasts, the test tubes were mixed vigorously. In order to ensure both data sets were statistically significent, a two-tailed t_test was performed for both sets of data. 


Results:
This graph shows the absorbance rates of spinach and kale in bright conditions, measured by the spectrophotometer. The spinach is represented by the blue bar line, and the kale is represented by the orange bar line. After 10 minutes of full sun exposure, these absorbance rates were recorded. A two-tailed t_test was conducted, and a P. value of 0.0366 was deduced.

This graph shows the absorbance of spinach and kale in dark conditions, measured by the spectrophotometer. The spinach is represented by the blue bar line, and the kale is represented by the orange bar line. After 10 minutes of full darkness, these absorbance rates were recorded. A two-tailed t_test was conducted, and a P. value of 0.050 was deduced.


Discussion:
When looking at graph one, spinach shows approximately 0.24nm less absorbance than kale in sunlight, indicating there is more photosynthetic activity by spinach in lit conditions than kale. This data is significent because a two-tailed t_test derived a p_value of 0.0366 for this data set. Likewise, spinach also showed more photosynthetic activity than kale in dark conditions, as spinach exhibited 0.26nm less absorbance than kale. This data set is statistically significent, as the p_value is 0.050. This similar net difference in absorbance can be explained because kale has larger leaf surface area. As a result, more chloroplasts in spinach are exposed to sunlight in comparison to kale, which explains why spinach has a higher photosynthetic activity than kale. [Weng : 2011] According to our data spinach and kale both favor light conditions, as spinach showed a 0.24nm decrease in absorbance once exposed to light when compared to dark conditions on itself. In other words, spinach showed a higher photosynthetic rate in light. Likewise, kale showed a 0.25nm decrease in absorbance once exposed to light when compared to dark conditions on itself. In other words, kale also showed higher photosynthetic activity in light. Overall, when comparing spinach and kale to each other, spinach more photosynthetic activity than kale in both sets of conditions, due to the larger exposed surface area of the spinach leaf in comparison to kale.
