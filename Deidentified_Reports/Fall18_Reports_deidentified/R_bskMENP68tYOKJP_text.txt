Title: The Effects of Water Color Change in Relation Betta splendins’ Agonistic Behaviors

Abstract:
This experiment was carried out in order to study the antagnostic behaviors of Betta splendins.  This is a species of fish in which the males will attack each other, and even fight until one of them is dead.  The Betta fish have antagnostic behaviors which they will usually show before they attack or if they are, for some reason, unable to attack.  These behaviors include tail beating, pelvic fin flickering, and protruding branchiostegal membrane etc… 
To some species, color is a major antagonizing factor.  Therefore, in this experiment, four fish will be put into three different water color treatments.  The treatments will be clear (controll), red, and blue.  The hypothesis is that the fish will be more antagnostic towards each other when put into the red treated water.  However, the data showed that the fish exhibited the most aggressive behaviors when exposed to the red treated water environment.  Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected.  However, it is possible that some conflicting variables, such as visibility, could have had negative effects on the accuracy of the observations.   


Introduction:
This experiment will consist of testing how water color affects fish aggression.  The fish species being used is entitled Betta splendins.  These are colorful fishes that tend to be extremely aggressive towards its own species.  In this experiment, only makes will be tested.  This is because only males are agnostic towards other males.  
The experiment will consist of changing water colors.  The water will be changed into blue and red, and the controll will be clear water.  Color is used within the animal kingdom for a mass variety of reasons, from mate selection to antagonizing other animals.  This experiment will test to see if Betta fish are caused to be more antagnostic due to water color change.  Therefore, the hypothesis is that the fish will be most aggressive whenever the water is red. 


Materials and Method:
For the experiment, four Betta fish will be experimented on.  Fish 1 and Fish 2 will be put in the same tank of water.  Fish 3 and Fish 4 will be put into the same tank, as well.  The fish will be able to see another, but they will not be able to physically attack each other because they will be separated by a piece of clear glass.  
Each set of fish will be put into clear water as a controll for five minutes.  Then each set of fish will be put into red water for five minutes.  Then each set of fish will be put into blue colored water for five minutes.  Each set of fish will have their behaviors observed and recorded during each test.  The aggressive behaviors will be recorded and put into a data format to enable data to support or reject the hypothesis.  
The behaviors will be ranked as such:
•	Broadside Movements
o	Erect Pectoral Fins= 1
o	Spreading Operculum=2
o	Protruding Branchiostegal Membrane=3
•	Facing Movements
o	Pelvic Fin Flick= 1
o	Tail Beat= 2
o	Tail Flash= 3
The duration of the fishes’ agnostic behaviors will also be timed, and this time will be a factor within the aggression scale:
Minutes	Multiplier
Under 1 	1
1-2 min	1.1
2-3 min	1.2
Over 3 min	1.3


Results:
The data shows that the fish exhibited the most aggression during the controll treatment.  When under the red and blue water color treatments, the fish showed a lack of aggressive behavior, and the ANOVA shows that the data was not significent: (fs=0.158, d.f.=11, P=0.856).  

Discussion:
Discussion:
The data has caused the hypothesis to be rejected.  This is because when the fish were in the red water treatment, they exhibited less aggression when in comparison to the clear water (the controll).  However, there could, possibly, be a conflicting variable.  The colored water itself could have served as this conflicting variable.  This is because the colored water made it much harder to see the fish.  This lack of clear vision could have prevented us from seeing all aggressive actions.  It also could have prevented the fish from being able to clearly see each other.  
Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected, but these conflicting variables could have caused this.  To prevent these conflicting variables from being present, it would be possible to simply add lass dye to the water because this would greatly enhance visibility for both the fish and the observers.
