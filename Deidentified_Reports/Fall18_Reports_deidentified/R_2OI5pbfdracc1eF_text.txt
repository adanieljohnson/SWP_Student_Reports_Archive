Title: A Study of Growth Hormones: How the Manduca sexta was Negatively Influenced by the Addition of an Ecdysone (20E) Inhibitor to their Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) Diets.

Abstract:
In this experiment we intended to observe the effects of introducing an ecdysone (20E) inhibitor on the growth and development of the species Manduca sexta. We predicted that the hormone inhibitor would stop the caterpillars from developing. We had two groups of four, one being the controll group and the other being the experimental. The experimental group was given everything the controll group was (Food, water, oxygen) except for the addition of ten drops of an ecdysone hormone inhibitor. The controll group was able to grow and develop rapidly and enter different developmental stages. The results indicated that the controll group differences in weight from the starting day compared to that of the last day were much larger than that of the experimental. The experimental group did not grow nor develop and eventually each caterpillar died. The results we got from the two sample one tail t_test indicated our results were significent.

Introduction:
The species being tested, Manduca sexta, is a species of hornworm, or caterpillar. The Manduca sexta species has several different developmental stages. It begins as an egg but eventually hatches into a larva. The larva has five instar stages where it slowly grows in size and prepares for its first molt to become a pupa. The pupa stage of development is the last stage until it can mature into being an adult. This whole process happens in 40-49 days. The juvenile (JH) and ecdysone (20E) hormones are essential to the development of the Manduca sexta. JH stays in high concentrations when the insect is a juvenile but then slowly decreases after its juvenile stage is complete. The juvenile hormone does increase in concentration before it molts to become a pupa. The hormone ecdysone fluctuates much more, usually having large spikes in its concentration before molting. There is a small spike in 20E concentration before the pupa stage which is called the commitment pulse which is a way of signaling to the insect that it is time to pupate. [Johnson: 2018] The prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) is another hornworm hormone that influences the development of the Manduca sexta. The PTTH stimulates the prothoracic glands to secrete the molting hormone ecdysone, without PTTH then there would be no ecdysone and no development. [Nijhout: 1971] To determine how hormones effect development of the species our lab group decided we should observe the effects on the Manduca sexta if the hormone ecdysone(20E) was inhibited. We predicted that if the Manduca sexta’s 20E hormone was inhibited than it would not be able to pupate or develop, whereas those that were not inhibited, the controll, would grow and develop rapidly. 



Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis our lab group set up two groups of four. The first group, or the controll, had four Manduca sexta caterpillars each in a separate container. The controll group was given the same amount of food and water as that of the experimental group. The experimental group also had four caterpillars each of which were in separate containers. The experimental group was given the same amount of food and water; but were also given 10 drops of an ecdysone hormone inhibitor. All environmental conditions remained the same for both groups.  The caterpillars were weighed everyday for two weeks and food was replaced when needed. The statistical test that we performed was a two sampled one tail t_test.



Results:
Looking at the data one can see the controll group differences between day 1 and day 12 are 9.93, 10.61, 8.49, and .45 compared to the experimental group differences which are 0.52, 0.41, 0.44, and 0.45 (Figure 4 and 5).  On average the controll group weights were larger than that of the experimental which is indicated by figure one. Figure 2 and 3 show the progression of caterpillar development based on their weights. In the experiment we noted that the controll group were much larger and had brighter colors. The experimental group experienced no growth and eventually died (Figure 3.) We completed a two sample one tail t_test which determined that our results were significent because the value, 3.57E-7, was much lower than one. In order for the P value to be significent it must be below 0.05 and not significent if it is above 0.05. 

Discussion:
The developmental process of the Manduca sexta is completed in only 40-49 days, and our lab was only two weeks long indicating that the developmental process could not have finished [Johnson: 2018]. The hormones involved in this process are the juvenile hormone (JH), ecdysone hormone (20E), and Prothoracicotropic (PTTH). Through thorough research it was discovered that the hormone PTTH plays a key role in the development of these insects. PTTH allows for the secretion of ecdysone and without it it would lead to the death of the insect. [Nijhout: 1971] The caterpillars that were in the experimental group that received an 20E inhibitor did in fact die, proving that without PTTH the insect can not live long.  Our group hypothesis was that the experimental group, being introduced to a 20E inhibitor, would not grow and develop into a pupa. Our hypothesis was supported, in that the caterpillars did not grow or develop into a pupa, however, all of the experimental group died after day 8 which was unexpected.  A possible reason why the caterpillars died so quickly was because they did not consume hardly any of the food that we provided. The food eventually became hard, brown, and crusty. The ecdysone hormone may have played a role in depressing the caterpillar’s appetite. The controll group ate the food rapidly while the experimental group , exposed to the inhibitor, ate very little which indicates that the inhibitor played a role in depressing the caterpillars appetite.  Overall, we can recognize that growth hormones contribute a major amount to the development of the Manduca sexta species, and we can potentially connect this to similar hormones in related organisms. In future experiments, one might compare differing doses of hormone mimics, as well as testing hormone mimics against one another. Another potential experiment one could test is if ecdysone influences the diet of an insect. I observed in the experimental group that the food that was available was not being eaten, or at least not at a steady rate, which made me wonder if the hormone affects the appetite of these creatures.
