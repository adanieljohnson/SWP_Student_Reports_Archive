Title: Comparing Mean Root to Shot Ratio of Mung Bean

Abstract:
Resource availability has a direct impact on the allocation of resources within plant, this allocation has a direct correlation to the root to shoot ratio of a plant. During this experiment we were testing the impact that the allocation of sunlight would have on Mung Beans. We hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of Mung Bean plants would be higher in the plants that were deprived of direct sunlight. We tested this hypothesis with two groups over two weeks, one group was in direct sunlight while the other group was under a dark mesh fabric. We treated both of the plant groups equally, planting in the same soil and watering daily. Our hypothesis was supported by the data we found. The root to shoot ratios were significently greater in the dark treatment group than the light. This difference can be attributed to the lower amount of sun exposure, causing the plant to allocate more resources to increasing shoot surface area for solar energy intake and increasing root size in order to obtain more nutrients.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is an important topic in biology as a whole, specifically, evolutionary biology. Variation in resource allocation occurs because of differences in the chemical composition of structures, and the numbers of different structures a plant can produce [Agren: 2003]. The allocation of resources is an important aspect of the reproductive strategies of plants, plants allocate differently depending on the environmental conditions [Bazzaz: 1987]. Resources obtained from the environment and manufactured in the plant are allocated to various plant parts and perform a range of functions [Bazzaz: 1997]. This allocation directly effects the root to shoot ratio, plants optimize their behavior by maximizing their relative growth rate [Ryan: 2016]. Resource availability is a selective pressure that directly affects plant phenotype due to resource allocation. Sunlight and solar energy are vital resources for plant growth as one of the primary components required for photosynthesis. Lack of solar resources would negatively impact plant growth with the lack of food, limiting nutrient uptake and other processes. Mung beans (Vigna radiate) [Soule: 1981] are a small sprouting plant that produce protein rich beans when fully grown. We hypothesis that Mung beans grown in a dark environment will have a higher root to shoot ratio then those in the light environments because there will be a limit of resources available through the shoots and leaves.

Materials and Method:
In order to collect relevant data, we will examine the growth of two sets of Mung Beans, one set will be deprived of sunlight while the other will receive it. First plant both sets of Mung Beans. Add miracle grow and water to both sets. Place one set of Mung Beans under a dark mesh fabric and place the other set in direct sunlight. Water both sets of plants daily for two weeks. At the end of the two weeks remove both sets of plants from the soil, and rinse excess dirt. Remove the root from the shoot of each plant and measure them separately. Measure the height and weight of the root and shoot of both sets of Mung Beans. Then perform a statistical two tail two pair t_test to find the p_value. 

Results:
The root to shoot ratio of the Mung Bean that grew without sunlight is noticeably higher in both height and weight. The plants from the dark environment have a greater standard deviation. The t_test for the weight produced (p value= .0019, t-value=3.3, degree of freedom 38). The t_test of the weight produced (p value= .0058, t-value=3.3, degree of freedom 38)

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the data. The root to shoot ratios were significently greater in the dark treatment group than the light. This is because the Mung Beans with less sun exposure allocate more resources to increasing shoot surface area for solar energy intake and increasing root size in order to obtain more nutrients. This is not necessary for the plants that had constant light exposure, therefore, there ratios remained lower. This illustrates an example of the effects solar resource limitation can have on allocation. This study could have been improved by an increased observation time to allow the Mung Beans to become fully grown. It could have also been improved by testing multiple plants as opposed to only the Mung Bean.
