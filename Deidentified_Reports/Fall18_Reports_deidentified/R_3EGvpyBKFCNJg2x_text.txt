Title: Effect of Tetraethylammonium on Relaxation Period of Frog Legs

Abstract:
In this lab, we dissected the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg. The Nerve and muscular systems work together in organisms to perform a quick response to stimuli in the environment. We shocked the gastrocnecmius muscle in order to determine the threshold voltage of the leg in order to have a controll. We then injected tetraethylammonium, potassium blocker, in the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog using a syringe to see if relaxation time would increase. We used a paired t_test to analyze the data. When potassium blocker was added the length of the average relaxation time generally tended to increase but not significently. Our results did not significently support our hypothesis that the addition of potassium blocker would increase the length of relaxation time in the treated frog legs.

Introduction:
The nerve and muscular systems work together in organisms to perform a quick response to stimuli in the environment. Within these systems an action potential is sent down an axon to the neuromuscular junction. Sodium, Calcium, and Potassium all play a role in the ultimate movement of the muscle. Potassium is abundant within a cell. During hyperpolarization Na+ channels close and K+ channels open which make the inside of the cell more negative which is a feedback to decreased negativity in the cell after depolarization [Johnson: 2018]. Experiments in the past have tested the effects of potassium modulators like tetraethylammonium on the contractility of isolated human ureter rings. These experiments found that the contractile period is increased with the use of potassium blocker [Soares de Moura: 2005]. The way that the potassium blocker was shown to increase the contractile period, we want to see if potassium blocker is able to increase the relaxation period of the gastrocnemus muscle in frogs. We hypothesize that adding potassium blocker to the gastrocnemus muscle would cause the length of the relaxation period to increase compared to that of the untreated leg.


Materials and Method:
We started this experiment by exposing the skin of the frog leg by using forceps to pull the skin towards the foot. We then separating the inner thigh muscles to reveal the white sciatic nerve and the nearby blood vessels. In the LabScribe software we set the pulse amplitude to 0.000 V, the number of pulse to 1, the Frequency to 1, and the pulse width to 5 ms. We hit record to stimulate the nerve.  We increased the voltage in 1.0 V increments to determine the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation. After finding the threshold potential for each frog leg, we added 0.1Ml of potassium blocker, 100mm of tetraethylammonium, to the gastrocnemus muscle of the leg using a syringe. We then continued to stimulation the nerve and record the corresponding relaxation time. We used a paired t_test to analyze the average difference between the length of the controll group’s relaxation period and the length of the treatment group’s relaxation period.

Results:
Overall, the addition of the potassium blocker in the treatment groups did seem to correlate to an increase in the length of the relaxation period, but not necessarily do so significently. We carried out a paired t_test on the average relaxation time of each of the frog legs in the controll and treatment condition. The average difference was 74.2 +/- 36.4 ms. The p_value was 0.102. The t-value was 2.88 and there were 2 degrees of freedom. Figure 1 shows the differences in the mean length of contraction between the controll and treatment groups. The controll group had a mean of 122ms+/-25.3ms and the treatment group had a mean of 196.2ms+/- 30.1ms.

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that the addition of potassium blocker would increase the length of relaxation time in the treated frog legs. The average relaxation period of the treatment groups was longer than that of the controll, but not statistically significent. Even though when an action potential is sent, K+ reenters the cell in order to repolarize and hyperpolarize it. When K+ is blocked, there is an increase in depolarization time of the cells compared to when K+ is naturally able to enter. The action potential for the muscle to contract was sent to the neuromuscular junction, but the signal to relax did not increase in time as. In the study we found, the contractile period of the human ureter rings was increased when treated with tetraethylammonium, but our experiment suggested that we cannot say that relaxation period also increases under these conditions [Soares de Moura: 2005]. The large amount of standard deviation could be due to the varied amount of liquid on the frog legs. This could have caused the shock to disperse farther than expected and not directly to the leg. The next logical step for this study is to work to study the effects of another sort of blocker like calcium on the relaxation period, or to do further research into the effects of potassium blocker on the contractile period as conducted in the ureter study. This type of experiment can be extended to other parts of the human nervous and muscular systems in the way it was used for the ureter ring [Soares de Moura: 2005].
