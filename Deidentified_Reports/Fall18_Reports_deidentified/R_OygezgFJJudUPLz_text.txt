Title: Use of Tubocurarine as an inhibitor for Acetocholine binding in the post synaptic cleft to limit muscle twitch response in frog legs

Abstract:
The acetocholine inhibitor, tubocurarine, limits the muscular response to a stimulus on a frog leg. The process of a neuromuscular synapse is dependent on the transportation of acetocholine across the synaptic cleft and its binding with the ligand gated channels on the post synaptic membrane. By injecting frog legs with a stimulus, getting a base muscular response, and then applying tubocurarine and applying the same stimulus and recoding the effects, it is clear that injecting tubocurarine as a acetocholine inhibitor limits the capability of the muscle to elicit a response. 

Introduction:
All organisms contain motor neurons. These motor neurons are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord [Bio Resource Guide: 2014]. Axons from the motor neurons reach into the muscles to points called neuromuscular junctions. At these regions the message to stimulate the contraction of a muscle is passed through action potentials. When the action potential reaches a synapse the potential triggers the release of sodium ions which depolarizes the pre-synaptic membrane. This depolarization triggers the release of calcium ions into the pre-synaptic terminal. The calcium ions cause the vesicles containing the neurotransmitters, in this case acetocholine, to bind to the presynaptic membrane. This binding releases the acetocholine across the synaptic cleft. At this point the acetocholine binds to the receptors on the post synaptic membrane. This binding of the ligand gated channels causes them to open, allowing sodium ions to depolarize the membrane and the action potential carries out through the rest of the neuron. Acetocholinesterase then breaks the acetocholine off of the receptors and the acetocholine is then returned to the presynaptic terminal where ecdysone regenerates the vesicles which take up the recycled acetocholine. Tubocurarine acts as an inhibitor to acetocholine by blocking the binding site for acetocholine and its ligand gated receptor [Starke: 1989]. By introducing tubocurarine into the synaptic cleft it is possible to limit the amount of muscular response because the acetocholine, which is needed to trigger the action potential that leads to the muscular response, cannot activate the necessary channels. We hypothesize that if we inject Tubocurarine into the muscle of a frog leg, that we will see a decrease in muscular contraction seen in a decrease in amplitude of the voltage generated by the response. 


Materials and Methods:
We obtained three frog legs. We then took the skin off of the legs, separated the gastrocnemius from the bone of the frog and separated the sciatic nerve from the muscle surrounding it. We then took our first frog and tied the gastrocnemius with string and raised the gastrocnemius so that it was perpendicular to the table and thus the rest of the frog leg. We the injected the electrodes used to apply the stimulus directly into the muscle. We then applied four different stimuli of .75 volts and recorded the amplitudes. We then injected the frogâ€™s muscle with tubocurarine using a syringe. At this point it was essential to move the two other frog legs away from the leg being tested to ensure that no tubocurarine contaminated the control readings. We then applied the tubocurarine injected, frog leg with .75 volts and again recorded the amplitude. We repeated these steps for the subsequent two frog legs. At this point we took the average of our four tests for each leg, control and experimental, and applied a paired one tail t-test analysis on the data. 

Results:
Our results show that there is a decrease in the recorded amplitude after the tubocurarine is added to the muscle. There is an oddity in the third and final frog leg, where we see an already lowered starting amplitude and then an even lower experimental amplitude. In looking at the data and figure one, the control frogs all output a higher amplitude than the experimental, however the amount that the control and experimental differ by changes each trial. The average the average of the group after the injection of Tubocurarine was significantly smaller than its mean before the injection (t-stat = 4.53, df = 2, P = 0.0456). 

Discussion:
Our lab was statistically conclusive enough to determine that we confirmed our hypothesis, adding the tubocurarine to the frog leg decreases the muscular response we observed. I am confident that we had a source of error in the third frog leg and that that error came from the fact that we did not properly apply frog ringer to the leg while it sat, waiting to be tested. This undoubtedly messed up our data and if we were to perform this test again, we would be sure to apply frog ringer consistently to the leg to be sure that there was still ATP in the leg to be used for the muscular twitch response. This procedure needs to be run again, with more frog legs and with proper administering of frog ringer to the waiting legs. With more frog legs there would be better statistical data and we would be able to conclude that our data is significant. In repeating this study, we would replicate everything again except for the first instruction in the procedure and changing three frog legs to six frog legs would undoubtedly result in better data. Although this data is rendered inconclusive, we have shown that injecting tubocurarine into the frog leg causes a decrease in muscular response. This proves that having tubocurarine act as an inhibitor binding on the ligand gated ion channel that acetocholine is meant to bind on hinders the ability for the synapse to trigger the action potential to flow throughput the neuron leaving the post synaptic terminal. This is important data because understanding how this process is restricted can help us to understand health issues like snake bites, where the snake venom acts in the same way that tubocurarine does and causes muscles to lock up and sends the victim into paralysis.
