Title: Unit One: Resource Allocation in Oilseed Radishes

Abstract:
In this experiment, we tested how Oilseed Radishes (Raphanus sativus) allocate their resources by comparing root to shoot ratios of radishes grown in direct sunlight versus radishes grown in the shade. We hypothesized that radishes grown in the direct sunlight would have a smaller root to shoot ratio than radishes grown in the shade. We based this hypothesis on another, similar experiment we performed involving Buckwheat which supported the idea that root to shoot ratios would be higher in plants that had more limited resources. To preform our current experiment, we planted 40 oilseed radish seeds evenly distributed in 8 separate pots. In the greenhouse, 4 pots were placed under a shade cloth and 4 were placed in direct sunlight. We kept them there for 2 weeks. At the end of that period, we performed a two sampled t-test. Our results showed that our hypothesis should be rejected because the average root to shoot ratio was higher in the plants grown in sunlight rather than the ones grown in shade.

Introduction:
Like any other living organism, plants have to compete for limited resources in their environment. The term for the way that plants use and distribute their resources is called “Resource Allocation.” In plants, we can measure resource allocation by examining root to shoot ratios between plants grown in different conditions. In this lab, we will be doing just that with Oilseed Radishes (Raphanus sativus). One very important resource to almost all plants is sunlight because it is needed for most plants to photosynthesize. When plants do not have access to sunlight, their investment in producing the enzyme RuBisCo (which is involved in carbon fixation) decreases, leaving more resources allocated to the plants shoots. [Bazzaz, Fakhri A.: 1997] Any factor that limits carbon intake, like a lack of sunlight, would cause resources to allocate towards the shoots. [Coleman, James S. et. al.: 1989] Based on this information, we hypothesize that radishes grown in the direct sunlight will have a smaller root to shoot ratio than radishes grown in the shade.

Materials and Methods:
We gathered 40 Oilseed radish seeds that had been soaked in water for 24 hours and a tray of 8 pots to plant the seeds in. We filled the pots with soil, placed 5 seeds in each pot and covered the seeds with more soil. Next, we watered our seeds (with about 100mL of water each) and moved the tray into a greenhouse. We positioned the tray so that half of the pots were under shade and half were in the sunlight. Every day for two weeks, we watered the radishes at about 6pm. After this two-week period, we harvested 3 of our plants from each pot and measured all of their root and shoots (in weight (g) and in length (cm)) in order to compare their root to shoot ratios. We also performed a two-sampled t-test for length and weight.

Results:
Our mean for the root to shoot ratios of radishes in adequate sunlight was 0.29  0.14 grams. With the plants grown in the shade, the mean root to shoot ratio for their rate was 0.18  0.12 grams. This is drastically different from the length root to shoot ratios of our 12 radish plants. When grown in sunlight the mean was 2.09  0.84 cm and, in shade, it was 1.65  0.81 cm. It is also worth noting that, when comparing root to shoot ratio means for length vs weight, the standard deviation is higher in the weight means than in the length. From our two-sampled t-test, we calculated that our df = 22 for both length and weight. In the root to shoot length ratio, t-value = 1.33078 and p = 0.098445. In the root to shoot weight ratio, t-value = 1.927311 and p = 0.033476.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that radishes grown in the sunlight would have smaller root to shoot ratios than those grown in shade, however, this was not the case. Overall, and on average, the plants grown in sunlight had larger root to shoot ratios in length and in weight. In a previous lab we preformed based on plant resource allocation, the length was statistically insignificant just like in this lab. All of this may be due to an error in the way we planted our radishes. Oilseed radishes grow best in cool, moist conditions, but the greenhouse we put our plants in was fairly warm most of the time. The USDA claims that radishes are not “tolerant” of shade, so it is possible that some of our shaded radishes weren’t shaded enough or that our sunlit radishes were slightly shaded. [Jacobs, Alayna A.: 2012] Additionally, we may have planted the radishes too deep into the soil since light can only penetrate the soil so far [Hyo-Jun Lee et. al.: 2016] and radishes need to be planted ¼ to ½ of an inch below the soil and we did not measure this. One last thing that could have affected our radish growth is the fact that our pots were placed in a tray. We watered our plants well but maybe the tray prevented water from leaving the pots and caused standing water to be in them. Oilseed radishes do not grow well in very wet soils, so it is possible that we over-watered them. [Ray Weil et. al.: 2009] If we were to re-perform this study, learning more about Oilseed radishes in terms of how they should be planted and how they allocate resources in their natural environment would benefit us greatly.
