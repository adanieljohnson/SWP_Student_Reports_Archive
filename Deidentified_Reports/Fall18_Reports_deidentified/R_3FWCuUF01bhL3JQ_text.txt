Title: Effect of Azaguard on growth and pupation of the Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is of the Order Lepidoptera, which includes moths, butterflies and also suppers. They go through a holometabolous life cycle that includes 4 different major life stages that start with the egg, then 5 larval instars, followed by the pupa and ending with an adult moth. The development of the Manduca Sexta is controlled by 3 hormones, Prothoracicotropic, Edysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. Edysterone in particular regulates the timing of molting during development. However, certain IGRs or insect growth regulators can block or activate these active processes. In our experiment, we are looking how the Edysterone inhibitor Azaguard affects the growth of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. We hypothesized that the IGR “Azaguard” would stunt the growth of the caterpillar and halt the pupation of the caterpillars. To test we measured the growth of two groups of caterpillars, one being the control which we gave a regular diet, and the test group whose food we added Azaguard over the course of 12 days. After experimentation, we concluded that the hypothesis was supported as the treatment group caterpillars were smaller than the control group and didn’t pupate. This experiment helps to explain how organisms use hormones to control homeostasis and respond to environment.

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is of the Order Lepidoptera, which includes moths, butterflies and also suppers. They go through a holometabolous life cycle that includes 4 different major life stages starting with an egg. The egg then goes through 5 different instar larval stages increasing in size and length while also developing internal and external structures such as the head, mandible (chewing mouthpart), and prolegs. After the 5th instar, the larvae molts to the pupal stage. The pupa is enclosed in a cocoon and has space for developing wings and has a straw like proboscis for eating. The pupa then develops into the final stage of an adult moth. The development of the Manduca Sexta is controlled by 3 hormones, Prothoracicotropic, Edysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. Edysterone in particular regulates the timing of molting during development. However, certain IGRs or insect growth regulators can block these active processes [1]. In our experiment, we are looking at how Edysterone inhibitors affect the growth and development of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. We hypothesized that the IGR “Azaguard” would stunt the growth of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar and halt the pupation of the caterpillars.

Materials and Methods:
First, we collected 8 caterpillars in the 5th instar and measured their masses. We then divided them into 2 groups, the control and the test group, and placed each caterpillar in its own container. The control group was fed a diet of 10g of Manduca food along with 10 drops of distilled water. The test group was fed a diet of 10g of Manduca food with 10 drops of Azaguard inhibitor. Over the course of 12 days, the caterpillars’ masses were recorded and food was replaced when needed. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at the same temperature with the same light and dark cycle.

Results:
Based on Figure 1, along with the observations collected the Azaguard did have an effect on the growth of the Manduca Sexta. Both groups initially grew at a rapid rate up until Day 3 of the experiment. Then on Day 4 they began to get smaller at a very rapid rate until Day 5. On Day 5, the control group started to show signs of pupating. Both groups slowly and steadily declined in size throughout the rest of the experiment. Something critical to note is that on Days 10 and 11 three caterpillars in the treatment group died or showed signs of death. Also, the largest caterpillar in the experiment came from the treatment group. At the end of the experiment, the control groups had a higher average weight (4.975 g) than the test group (4.37) over the course of experimentation. The T-Test however showed that statistically there is no significance between the data of the mean of the control group compared to the treatment group (t-stat= 1.1703, df= 6, P= 0.2863).

Discussion:
The hypothesis we set out to prove was supported. None of the caterpillars in the treatment group developed to pupation and they were smaller than the control group, with the exception of Test Group Caterpillar #4. One reason for this could be that it consumed more of its food than the other caterpillars, because of inconsistent feeding patterns, which was throughout the experiment a significant source error. Some days food wasn’t replenished when needed and the caterpillars were left with food that they couldn’t eat. The loss of weight in the control group can be attributed to the “wandering stage”, in which larvae feeding stops and the larvae is focused on pupating [2]. Another source of error in the experiment can be attributed to possible inaccuracies in measuring, i.e. round off error. In the future, to make for a more accurate and precise experiment we could possibly look at the effects of both Edysterone inhibitors and activators to see if both have an effect on the species as well as a more precise feeding schedule. This experiment can be used as a source of information for the pest control industry. IGRs are more environmentally friendly and less toxic than most traditional insecticides. Also, this experiment helps to explain how organisms use hormones to control homeostasis and how they respond to their environment
