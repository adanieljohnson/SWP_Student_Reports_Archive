Title: Simulated herbivory affects resource allocation and root-to-shoot ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Resource allocation has been maintained as an important study in ecological biology due to its vital influences on the longevity and overall health of plants [McConnaughay.: 1999]. To further monitor the necessity of proper resource allocation, I have studied the resource allocations in plant that undergo herbivory conditions in which plants are simulated to experience damage by insects. As pests and insects continue to exploit plant leaf areas through consumption, the growth of plants can be susceptible to harm by deformation. Through this experiment, I have observed the effects of herbivory on plant resource allocations in radishes (Raphanus raphanstrum). I have hypothesized that radishes in herbivory conditions would grow longer shoots and root systems while controllled plants with no manipulation would not. The reasoning for this would be that the plants in herbivory conditions would attempt to combat less nutrient intake and decreased photosynthetic rates in the leaves by growing longer roots and shoots so as to absorb more nutrients from the environment. The resulting data from the experiment did not show significent difference in the length root-to-shoot ratio but did show significent difference in weight root-to-shoot ratio. The lack of significance in root length between 

Introduction:
This experiment observes the natural allocation of resources in Raphanus raphanstrum (radishes) that have undergone herbivory conditions. Herbivory conditions, in this study, are characterized by the deformation of plant leaves through insect and pests’ consumption. Radishes typically hold large leaf surface areas, allowing insects and pests to obtain nutrients from ingesting large segments of their leaves [Masters: 2001]. Past research has shown that the supply of resources such as nutrients tend to show positive correlation with plant growth, therefore, it can be assumed that plants with smaller surface areas due to herbivory will show a decrease in supplies of resources [McConnaughay.: 1999]. In this experiment, I have compared the natural growth of radish plants without herbivory to the growth of that of plants with simulated herbivory in an attempt to determine if there is a significent difference in resource allocation between these two groups. In order to definitively measure growth in the two groups, root-to-shoot ratios of plants from each group have been calculated. I hypothesize that radishes that undergo herbivory conditions should grow longer shoots and root systems. The reasoning for this being that, due to deformed leaf areas, the plants attempt to compensate for the decrease in absorption of resources by growing longer shoots and roots to gain more nutrients from the environment. This would, therefore, result in higher root-to-shoot ratios for herbivory-simulated plants instead of higher root-to-shoot ratios for the controllled radish plants in natural conditions.

Materials and Method:
	I obtained eight soil cups filled with Raphanus raphanstrum seeds and designated four cups as the controlls and four cups as herbivory. Water, sunlight, and typical conditions were provided daily in a greenhouse so as to not induce any outside factors for affecting growth. Once leaves began to grow in the first five days, I began clip the leaves of the plants designated as “Herbivory conditions” with a hole-puncher to simulate insect or pest manipulation. This was done daily to ensure leaf area was properly reduced. After a period of two weeks, I compared the weights (grams) and heights (mm) of the controll group and herbivory group. Five plants from each cup of each group were measured, resulting in 40 plants being measured. In order to definitively quantify the observed differences, I compared the two groups’ heights and weights through a two-sample one-tailed t_test. The resulting root-to-shoot ratios allowed for better understanding of the difference in their allocations of resources.

Results:
	The resulting data from the experiment showed that the average root-to-shoot length ratio for herbivory-designated plants was 2.66 +/- 0.48 mm, as depicted in figure 1. This is lower than the average root-to-shoot length for the controlls (3.38 +/- 0.54 mm), as shown in figure 1. However, the data for weights between the two groups showed a different result. The average root-to-shoot weight ratio for herbivory plants was 2.67 +/- 0.17 g, while the average root-to-shoot weight ratio for controll plants was 2.75 +/- 0.17 g, as shown in figure 2. The resulting mean ratio for root-to-shoot length was statistically significent (t_stat = 2.47, d.f. = 22, P = 0.01), and the resulting mean ratio for root-to-shoot weight was not statistically significent (t – stat = 1.83, d.f. = 6, P = 0.058). The controll plants tended to grow more elongated shoots, growing larger in height than the plants that underwent herbivory conditions. However, the root length of both groups did not show significent difference in length, and both groups did not show any difference of greenery or health.

Discussion:
I hypothesized that radish plants that undergo herbivory conditions would grow longer roots in comparison to plants in the controll group. This, however, was not supported by the resulting root-to-shoot length data. There was no significent difference in average root lengths measured between the plants of the two groups, suggesting that herbivory does not directly affect the growth of root systems. A probable explanation for these results could be that the decrease in leaf area caused by manipulation caused a lack of intake of energy and nutrients through decreased photosynthetic rates. This would, in turn, result in less energy available for plant growth [Smith: 1989]. A decrease in allocated energy does not allow for more growth in respect to surface area of leaves and root length. Alternatively, there was a significent difference in average root-to-shoot weights measured between the two plants of the groups, suggesting that there could be a direct correlation between deformation of plants by herbivory and overall weight of their roots. This counters the above explanation and hinders the obtainment of a definitive explanation for the resulting observations. Past research has shown that the period of observation is vital for accurate understanding of resource allocation and plant behavior; therefore, I can infer that the observation period may have been too short to accurately describe plant behavior in the presence of herbivory conditions [Baskin: 1998]. This experiment, along with past research, allows for students to understand that detrimental effects on resource allocation can occur when herbivory is forced onto radish plants [Agrawal: 1999]. One could improve this experiment by extending the period of observation for plants under herbivory conditions in order to obtain more defined data, and further experimentation with herbivory could provide more insight into the different resource allocation behaviors of other plants including other agricultural crops, allowing individuals to develop better method of combatting pest infestations and other insect-caused complications.
