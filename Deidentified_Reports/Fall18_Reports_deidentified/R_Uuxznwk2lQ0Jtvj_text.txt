Title: Inhibitory Effects of Ethanol on Rania pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Muscle contractions are essential for the movement of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. To better understand how these muscles fatigue and what compounds accelerate this fatigue, we began to ask what the effects of introducing ethanol into a Rania pipiens muscle would be. In our experiment, we hypothesized that if we injected 2 Ml of a .01% ethanol solution into the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens, there would be a significent difference in the twitch threshold of that muscle and a gastrocnemus muscle without an ethanol injection. We applied three pulses at the threshold voltage + 1V to three Rania pipiens legs, first without ethanol and then with the ethanol injection, and recorded the voltage of the twitch amplitude for each experimental and controll trial. After performing a two-tailed paired t_test, we calculated a p value of .99, which clearly showed that our hypothesis was not supported at the .05 probability level. These results suggested that such a low concentration of ethanol did not cause a significent difference in twitch amplitude of the experimental and controll groups of Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms are responsible for movement, and are innervated by motor neurons. These nerves stimulate muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling, where action potentials spread down the nerve and cause the myofibrils to shorten.  Muscle contraction will change in response to how it is stimulated, and if it is stimulated for a long period of time, it will run out of ATP and the actin and myosin cross-bridges will start to separate. This process is called muscle fatigue. Previous research has shown that alcohol misuse frequently leads to muscle weakness, and a specific study concluded that ethanol produces an inhibitory effect on sarcolemma Ca2+ influx, weakening the excitation-contraction coupling process in skeletal fibers in mice [Cofán: 2000]. Based on this information, we began to ask what effect ethanol would have on muscle contraction in the frog Rania pipiens. The intent of our experiment to answer this question was to inject ethanol into the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens and observe the twitch amplitude in comparison to a gastrocnemus muscle without an ethanol injection. Therefore, we hypothesize that there will be a significent difference in the twitch amplitude between the gastrocnemus muscle with the addition of ethanol and the gastrocnemus muscle without the ethanol injection.

Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipiens leg were selected and placed in a dissecting pan. Using a pair of forceps, the skin was pulled down each leg to expose the inner thigh muscles. The sciatic nerve was exposed by separating the thigh muscles, and the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated by cutting the Achilles tendon. Using string, the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended from the force transducer, and probes were inserted into the muscle to deliver the electric current. Using the LabScribe to record the threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle, we set the parameters to 5 pulse, 1Hz frequency, a pulse width of 5 ms, and a pulse amplitude of .0000V. The threshold was found by increasing the amplitude by 0.5Hz until the threshold was reached. We conducted 3 pulses at the threshold voltage + 1V without adding any ethanol for each of the three Rania pipiens legs, and recorded the voltage of the contractions. After determining the threshold, we injected the gastrocnemus muscle with 2 Ml of a .01% ethanol solution and allowed it to sit for 5 minutes. We then conducted three pulses with the same parameters with each Rania pipiens leg and recorded the voltage of the contractions. After performing this, we used a two-tailed paired t_test to compare the voltage of the controll and experimental groups.

Results:
As we performed our experiment, we observed a noticeable twitch in the muscle when we applied each shock, and observed smaller twitched after the shocks had been applied multiple times. We also observed that the gastrocnemus muscle would swell and become larger when injected with the ethanol solution. As shown in Figure 1, at a threshold of 1.3V, the average twitch amplitude for the controll groups were .430V, and the average twitch amplitude for the experimental groups were .431V. We used a two-tailed paired t_test to determine if these results were statistically significent, where our degree of freedom was 4, and the t-value was .0089. The two-tailed paired t_test determined a p_value of .99, which was greater than the alpha level of .05 we tested it against. This determined that the mean twitch thresholds of the experimental group were not statistically significently different from those of the controll group.

Discussion:
From the results of our experiment, we determined that our hypothesis stating there will be a significent difference between the twitch amplitude of the gastrocnemus muscle in the controll group and the experimental group was not supported. The calculated p_value, which was .99, was much higher than the .05 alpha level, meaning that there was no statistical significance between the two groups. Because of these results, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. One of the explanations for this lack of significance could be that there was simply too low of an ethanol concentration in the solution, and therefore the ethanol did not have a potent enough effect on the muscle. Because ethanol’s biological properties cause it to break down muscle, a concentration higher than .01% could have had more of an inhibitory effect on the muscle when it was injected with the solution. A higher concentration could be used in a future study with muscle and ethanol, to further observe the effect of ethanol on muscle fatigue and twitch amplitude. Another possible explanation of the lack of significent difference could be because the muscle tested was not part of a living organism, and therefore the ethanol had a different effect on the non-living muscle than it would have on a living muscle. Further analysis of ethanol and its inhibitory effects on muscle could be relevant since previous research has shown the negative effects of alcohol on muscle performance, and it is important to understand how and why this occurs [Cofán: 2000].
