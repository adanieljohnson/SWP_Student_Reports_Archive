Title: pH effects on photosynthesis in spinach leaves

Abstract:
The effects on varying pH levels on electron transport activity in spinach leaves was evaluated. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and certain bacteria capture energy from the sun by using chemical energy stores in covalent bonds, potential energy in redox potential, and electrical and chemical gradients generated across a lipid bilayer. Experimentally, the rate of photosynthesis can be measured using the examination of the rate of electron transfer. Leaves were spun in a centrifuge to get concentrated chloroplast. The ending pellet was resuspended and separated among 3 tubes with differing pH solutions- pH 5, pH 7, and pH 10. Each tube was mixed with DCIP and placed under a light for 30 minutes. Absorbances were recorded every 20 minutes. it was hypothesized that samples place in acidic and basic pH solutions would show a decrease the rate of electron transfer. The rate of electron transfer showed an increase in all three pH solutions during the 30-minute duration. Our results were not significant due to the p-values being 0.101 and 0.466. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants and certain bacteria capture energy from the sun by using chemical energy stores in covalent bonds, potential energy in redox potential, and electrical and chemical gradients generated across a lipid bilayer. The products produced from photosynthesis allow other cellular processes to occur. These processes include glycolysis or cellular respiration. Photosynthesis captures energy in light as well as carbon dioxide and water in order to make usable fuel in the form of glucose as well as water and oxygen, which is then expelled as a waste product. The solar energy is first captured in the chloroplasts and excites the electrons. Next, a chemical reaction is triggered that cleaves water molecules, releases electrons, and creates a proton gradient. The electrons that are released are stored as NADPH. The protein gradient that is generated from the release of electrons fuels the production of ATP (Johnson, 2016). Experimentally, the rate of photosynthesis can be measured using the examination of the rate of electron transfer in leaves. In our study, the rate of electron transfer can be measured by recording the absorbance of different solutions exposed to different conditions in a spectrophotometer. This is done using DCIP which can be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis. When exposed to light, DCIP is decolorized by chemical reduction. As electrons are transferred, DCIP accepts electrons and therefore becomes colorless. As DCIP becomes colorless, the light transmittance can be measured in a spectrophotometer. We will know if electrons are successfully transferred seeing a decrease in absorbance. According to a study, toxic conditions will reduce the activity of chloroplasts (Wenping et. Al, 2017), which is measured through the rate of electron transfer. We will be isolating one aspect of the conditions, the pH of the solution. We will be preparing solutions at three different pH levels- pH 5, pH 7, and pH 10. We hypothesize that both acidic and basic solutions will decrease the rate of electron transfer. 

Materials and Methods:
We placed the motor and pestle, medium sized beaker, and centrifuge tubes into ice to cool. Removed the large central veins from the spinach leaves and rinsed with water. Then the leaves were added to the motor and pestle as well as 10 mL grinding buffer. The leaves were grinded to a thick paste and an additional 10 mL grinding buffer was added, the solution was mixed and strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a cooled beaker. 200 µL of filtered liquid was transferred into microtube “A”, placed on ice and the remainder of the solution was transferred into centrifuge tube A. This was spun for 3 minutes at 4°C and the spun liquid was placed into centrifuge B. 200 µL was removed into microtube B, stored on ice, and centrifuge B was spun at 4°C for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in 15 mL grinding buffer. 5 mL of resuspension was placed into 3 test tubes and 5 mL of one pH buffer in each was added as follows- pH 5, pH 7, and pH 10. This was spun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in about 3 mL grinding buffer to concentrate chloroplasts. Then 10 large test tubes were labeled and 3 replications of each sample group (pH5, pH7, and pH10) and one blank solution were prepared. The blank received 8 mL water, 2 mL reaction buffer and 100 µL of B suspension. Each pH solution received 6 mL of water and 2 mL of 100 mM DCIP. 100 µL of the concentrated chloroplast solutions was added to the designated tube, 3 tubes for each chloroplast pH solution. Immediately after addition, the solution was transferred into cuvettes. The spectrometer was blanked and absorbances were measured at time 0 (T0). Cuvettes were placed in a rack and placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. Absorbances were read again (600 nm) for T10, T20, and T30, waiting 10 minutes between each measurement. Percent change was calculated between each interval [absorbance at T0 – absorbance at Tn] / absorbance at T0. The change in absorbance versus time for each of the three measurements was plotted on a graph and a 2-sample t-test was run to test significance. 

Results:
The absorbances increased in each pH solution during the 30 minutes that the solutions were exposed to light. The absorbances for pH 5 went from 0.399 to 0.416, absorbance for pH 7 went from 0.519 to 0.527, and the absorbance for pH 10 went from 0.511 to 0.519. The increasing absorbance values were supported by percent change values of 2.51 to 4.26% in pH 5 and 1.17% to 1.57% pH 10 after a 30-minute incubation period (figure 1). A 2-sample t-test produced p-vales of 0.101 and 0.466.  The standard deviations for pH 5 were +/-0.0236, +/-0.025, +/-0.026, +/-0.025, pH 7 were +/-0.006, +/-0.006, +/-0.007, +/-0.009, and for pH 10 +/-0.034, +/-0.0306, +/-0.031, +/-0.0313 for each of the 4 ten-minute intervals respectively (figure 2).

Discussion:
Plants need a specific environmental pH in order to carry out photosynthesis. If the environmental pH level is too high or too low, the enzymes in the plant can denature, slow, or even stop working altogether. The enzymes are no longer able to carry out photosynthesis to their full potential. As the environmental pH moves away from the suitable pH, the rate of electron transfer will then decrease. During this lab, we tried to determine if the changes in pH in solutions would have an effect on the rate of electron transport. We hypothesized that the acidic and basic pH solutions would show a decrease in absorbance. Our hypothesis was rejected because the rate of electron transfer for both basic and acidic solutions increased as opposed to decrease. The percent changes increased every interval for pH 5 and the first two intervals and then stayed steady for pH 7 and pH 10. The percent change increased from 2.51% to 4.26% for pH 5, from 1.16% to 1.54% for pH 7 and from 1.17% to 1.57% for pH 10 (Figure 1). We would expect the rate to decrease because of a study that tested the effect of pH on photosynthesis and found that photosynthesis was the most effective at pH 6 and lower and higher pHs decreased photosynthesis efficiency (Danilov and Ekelund) The pH 7 is the same as water, and very similar to the reacting buffer (pH 6.5), so we didn’t expect there to be any changes in this solution, however it increased as well. The p-value from the statistical test comparing pH 5 to pH 7 was 0.101 and comparing pH 7 to pH 10 was 0.466, meaning that our results were not significant. We could have possibly run into some error because the centrifuge did not appear to spin as effectively as it did in week one, causing the pellet to not be as concentrated and slightly more liquified. This would’ve affected our results because some of the concentrated chloroplasts in the pellet could have been poured out when transferring tubes. By knowing how pH levels affect photosynthesis we could use this knowledge in fertilizer production to determine what is the best pH for plants to grow in.
