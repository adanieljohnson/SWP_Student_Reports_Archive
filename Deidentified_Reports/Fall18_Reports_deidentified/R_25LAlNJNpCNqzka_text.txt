Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone on weight in Manduca Caterpillars

Abstract:
Our initial goal in this experiment was to determine if there was a significant difference in weight between manduca sextas that were fed a regular diet and those who were fed a normal diet with the addition of a mimic juvenile hormone. Considering that the juvenile hormone plays an essential role in the pupation process of manducas, we hypothesized that the group fed the mimic juvenile hormone would have a more significant difference in weight compared to the group that were only fed a regular diet with the hormone mimic. We set up an experiment using 8 manducas divided evenly into 2 groups. We observed the two groups for a total of 12 days, feeding them regularly each day. In the end, we found that our results did support our hypothesis. Our treatment of the mimic hormone had a direct effect on the weight of our experimental manducas, but however, since our p-value was more than 0.05, our results of the mean weight difference was simply due to chance. 

Introduction:
Manduca sextas, also known as tobacco hornworms belong to the family of Order Lepidoptera, which include all butterflies, moths and skippers (AD Johnson). While under constant conditions in a laboratory, the life cycle of manducas can range from 39 to 48 days. The timing of this cycle can be longer or shorter in outdoor conditions, depending on the quality of diet and the average daily temperature. Within this time frame the caterpillars will change into 5 different instar larvae, until they finally pupate. Once pupation occurs, the manduca has 19-23 days left in their life cycle to grow into a full-grown adult moth. This cycle of metamorphosis would not be possible without two very important hormones working together, Ecdysterone (20E) and the Juvenile Hormone (JH). These two hormones help regulate the timing and type of molt the instar larvae will have. Ecdysterone being in control of timing, and the JH in control of the type of molt (AD Johnson). According to an article found in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Frederik and Williams conclude that the secretion process of ecdysterone is the same for all insects. The two comment, “we know that, in most and perhaps all insects, the brain controls the secretion of ecdysone by the action of its tropic hormone on the prothoracic glands (Frederik and Williams 1974).” This means that the brain is the main control system of hormonal activity in manducas, which allow them to properly grow and pupate during their life cycles. For this lab we tested the effects of an additional JH mimic being added to the diet of manducas, and how this change will affect their overall change in weight during their life cycle. We chose this experiement because it will be interesting to see how manducas respond to additional JH being added to their normal diet, and by measuring their weight would give us a clear sense of the changes as they were happening compared to our control group. In our study, we hypothesize that the experimental group, given the additional JH mimic will show a significant increase in weight in comparison to our control group who were fed a regular diet. 

Materials and Methods:
We will first start by placing four manducas in a plastic container divided into four compartments for our control group. We then will mix together 10 grams of food for each caterpillar without the JH mimic, with only four drops of water added. For our treatment group, we will do the same thing by placing four manducas into a container with four compartments, with the same type of food. But unlike the control, we will be adding 4 drops of JH mimic instead of four drops of water. There will also be 10 grams of food fed daily to each caterpillar in our treatment group. We will monitor and feed both groups for a span of 12 days, weighing each of them in grams daily, and monitoring their changes in color. Daily photos will be most effective in allowing us to see color change during metamorphosis and pupation in each group. For our results we will be collecting a mean, standard deviation, and p-value as normal for both groups. A bar graph will be used to visually interpret the differences in weight between the first and last day of the study for both groups. A two-sample t-test, with a two-tailed p-value will be used to compare the mean weight difference in each group. 

Results:
After collecting our mean of weight differences in Figure 1, it was shown that our treatment group had a higher mean of difference in weight from the beginning of the experiment up until the last day. Our dependent variable was the weight of the manduca (in grams) and the independent variable being the JH mimic hormone. We calculated a mean of 0.915 for our control group and a mean of 1.975 for our treatment group. Also for our control we found a standard deviation of 2.312, and 4.519 for the experimental group. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was a difference in weight between the manducas fed a normal diet and those who were fed the JH mimic hormone. But it was not due to our treatment process. Our results showed a p-value of 0.690779 for mean weight difference, which is significantly higher than .05. This means that the data collected from both groups were not caused by our treatments but was simply due to chance. To compare our results to a similar study, it was noted in the Journal of Experimental Biology that Manudca sexta were found to have a lower average in weight before the release of PTTH. Frederik and Williams state, “It follows, therefore, that the weight of these larvae 24 h before PTTH release represents the lowest weight at which these larvae can become committed to release PTTH (Frederik and Williams 1974).” Just like in our study, Frederik and Williams observed a group of tobacco hornworms who had not yet released their PTTH hormones, as a result these caterpillars were measured as having a lower weight than the hornworms in the study that had already released their PTTH hormone. Despite the treatment group having a higher mean of weight difference, it was surprising to see our p-value was still very high. Initially I hypothesized that our p-value would be less than .05, but in this case, our treatment was still not considered significant. Our hypothesis was not supported in this study.
