Title: The Effects of Lanthanum Trichloride and light on Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleated, unicellular protist that is very advantageous to study due to its easily observable, yet complex cellular processes. With certain changes in the environment, physarum will initiate signal transduction pathways to perform contractile movements away from or towards a stimulus. Calcium is instrumental in the function of these signal transduction pathways. In this lab, physarum is tested with the added conditions of light and lanthanum trichloride, a calcium inhibitor. Six water agar plates, and six diluted lanthanum trichloride-soaked PDA plates were prepared. Three of each type of plate were tested in light for phototaxis and three of each type were tested in an incubator for chemotaxis with oatmeal added as nutrients. The physarum were left for 24 hours in the previously stated conditions. Then, the distance and direction the physarum travelled on each plate were recorded. It was found that there was no clear pattern in the movement of the physarum despite the changed environmental factors. This could be due to the fact that the lanthanum trichloride was diluted too much or improper preparation of the physarum.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is a multinucleate syncytium, or a mass of multiple nuclei housed in a single plasma membrane. Physarum is advantageous to study and is often used in labs because it is very easy to observe its various complex cell processes. Firstly, a microscope is not needed to watch physarum growth. Secondly, a physarum mass, called a plasmodium, undergoes mitosis all at the same time making it very easy to examine. Additionally, physarum have a shared ancestry with humans, so we have many of the same signal transduction pathways. Since human cells are difficult to study, physarum have become a very popular species used to investigate cellular signaling. Although physarum does not have complex nervous systems, it still exhibits intelligent behaviors such as finding the shortest route to a food source and forming a network that maximizes cellular resource distribution [Oettmeier: 2017]. All of these behaviors can be studied to further our understanding of complex cellular processes. 
	Physarum spend most of their life cycles in the plasmodial stage where all of the nuclei are diploid. However, when certain environmental changes are implemented such as light, heat, or decrease in food, physarum initiate their reproductive cycle [Costello: 2013]. During their reproductive cycle, the different key characteristics and behaviors of physarum can be observed. In this lab, various conditions were applied to the physarum to test the effect on their growth and behavior. 
	The inhibitor lanthanum trichloride will be used to see if it affects the physarum’s growth towards food. Lanthanum trichloride is a calcium channel blocker. Calcium plays an important role in controlling the motile activity of physarum [Beylina: 2004]. Without the release of calcium, the signaling pathway of physarum is disrupted. In the IP3-mediated path, calcium is needed to bind to the calcium-regulated proteins that control (either stimulate or inhibit) the change in the activity of the physarum. If calcium activity is blocked by the lanthanum trichloride, it is likely the physarum will not be able to move [Johnson: 2018]. 
Physarum can sense molecules in its environment and perform contractile movement toward or away from this source. This is called chemotaxis. Under normal conditions, physarum grow towards food. It is expected that the lanthanum trichloride will cause negative chemotaxis (growth away from the food source). The inhibitor will also be tested in light. Movement away from light is called negative phototaxis. Oftentimes, physarum will migrate away from light; however, the addition of the inhibitor would likely cause the physarum to move towards light in search for nutrients. The physarum will not be able to perform contractile movements away from light (negative phototaxis) or towards a food source (positive chemotaxis). 


Materials and Methods:
Six water agar plates and six PDA plates were obtained. Lanthanum trichloride was diluted with a 20:1 ratio of water to lanthanum trichloride. The six PDA plates were soaked in 5 mL each of the diluted lanthanum trichloride solution for 10 minutes. A 1 cm x 1 cm cube was cut out of the center of all 12 plates. Ethanol was used to clean the spatula after each cut. Physarum from a provided sample were also cut into 1 cm by 1 cm cubes and placed into each cube previously cut on the plates (12 cubes of physarum for 12 plates in total). Three of the water agar plates and three PDA/lanthanum trichloride plates were then covered in foil with a square in the top center for light to be allowed in. These six plates were put in light for 24 hours for phototaxis to be measured.
	Five oats each were then placed in the remaining six plates to be a food source. These 6 plates were put into an incubator at 24 ℃ for 24 hours for a test of chemotaxis. 
After 24 hours in each condition, the tangent of growth of the physarum was measured on each plate. The direction of growth was also noted. 
The results were analyzed using two two-sample T-tests (since two separate tests were conducted) with alpha values of 0.05.


Results:
For the chemotaxis test, all three control physarum migrated towards the food while two of the physarum plates treated with lanthanum trichloride moved towards the food and one group did not move at all. The average tangent length of movement can be seen in Figure 1. 
	For the test in light (phototaxis), the control group of physarum all migrated towards the light. One of the physarum plates treated with lanthanum trichloride moved towards the light, one moved away, and one did not move at all. The average tangent length of movement can be seen in Figure 2. 
	The first two-sample t-test comparing the chemotaxis conditions yielded p-value of 0.65. The second two-sample t-test comparing the conditions in the test for  phototaxis yielded a p-value of 0.24. 



Discussion:
This lab tested the effects of light and lanthanum trichloride on Physarum polycephalum. It was hypothesized that the addition of lanthanum trichloride, a calcium channel blocker, would cause the physarum to move away from their food source (negative chemotaxis) and towards the light (positive phototaxis) in search of nutrients. While the control physarum acted as expected in the chemotaxis test, the lanthanum trichloride did not inhibit the experimental group to the extent expected. The control physarum tested in light moved towards the light (positive phototaxis) which was unusual, while the physarum with lanthanum trichloride had varying responses to light. 
According to Beylina et al., other commonly used and reliable calcium channel inhibitors such as Gd 3+ and La3+ successfully disabled the contractile movement of physarum [Beylina: 2004]. There could be a few reasons the lanthanum trichloride, another reliable inhibitor, did not work as successfully. Firstly, the PDA plates were soaked in a 20:1 diluted solution of water to lanthanum trichloride. This is a very diluted concentration of inhibitor. It is likely that the physarum would have responded better to the inhibitor had it been more concentrated and subsequently more detectable. It has also been proven by research that sometimes physarum kept under illumination can store calcium [Häder: 1985]. This could explain why the phototaxis test did not work. The physarum had been stored for a few weeks in an incubator that was lit. It is possible that because of this, calcium had been stored in the physarum prior to our lab experiment. The availability of calcium due to this previous storage could be the reason that even though the IP3 calcium channels were blocked by the inhibitor, the physarum still was able to perform contractile activity. 
While the results were not what was expected, this experiment was still a valuable endeavor. If we were to conduct another experiment with more concentrated lanthanum trichloride and better-prepared physarum, the data would likely be very promising as it has been researched many times in the scientific community already. For example, one application of lanthanum trichloride in everyday life is it is used to treat pools to stop the growth of algae. This algae likely has a very similar genome to the physarum and comparable signaling pathways. This is just one simple instance in which the study of physarum has been advantageous to our society as a whole. However, physarum are even being used for greater purposes. Recently they have begun to be used to study the origins of awareness, intelligence, cognition, and decision making [Oettmeier: 2017].
