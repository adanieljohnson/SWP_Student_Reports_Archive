Title: The decrease of aggressive behavior of Betta splendens in murky water conditions

Abstract:
Physical behaviors are important to observe because they regulate social interactions involving aggression and sexual activities. In most organisms, males have to compete with other males within their species to mate with females and have different tactics for competition. This study focuses on aggressive behavior in Betta splendens because they have clear visual displays of aggression. Due to many environmental issues, aquatic environments are becoming polluted and water quality is changing. The focus here is on the turbidity of water and how it effects aggressive behavior in the fish. It was hypothesized that when in murky water, the males will not be able to visualize each other as clearly and will spend less time engaging in aggressive behavior (indicated by the branchiostegal membrane protruding). Two fish in clear water and two fish in murky water were observed when allowed visual contact for three trials each with a duration of five minutes observation, five minutes rest. The results supported the hypothesis that there would be more aggressive behavior between males in the clear water than the murky water conditions. This led to the conclusion that murky conditions cause the males to be less visible to one another and therefore less likely to show aggressive behavior. 

Introduction:
Studying behavior in organisms is important in understanding the physiological purposes for specific behaviors and how they have been shaped by evolution. Sexual selection is a main subset of natural selection that revolves around the competition for mating. In most species males are forced to compete for females to reproduce their genotype, resulting in a higher fitness. This study looks at the behaviors that result because of intra-sexual selection with male to male competition within the Betta splendens species. More specifically, it will focus on aggressive behavior displayed by the males to scare off the opponent before having to physically fight. Betta splendens is an ideal organism because of its clear displays of movement and color change. They have two types of aggressive tactics called broadside and facing movements. This procedure measures the most aggressive of a Bettas facing movement which is the protruding of the branchiostegal membrane located underneath the opercula because it is a clear movement to measure. A study that focused on the effect of turbidity on the foraging behavior of chinook salmon concluded that foraging rates were reduced at higher turbidities for prey at the surface, middle and bottom of the ocean. However, for the surface and benthic prey, the foraging rates were highest at intermediate turbidity levels. This suggested that the fish flourish the best in medium turbid conditions because it reduces the risk to predators. [Gregory: 2001]. This brought up the idea of whether clear water conditions effects intraspecific species behavior. It is possible that changing the environment can physically hinder the organism (obstruct sight) or maybe cause stress and confusion. One study looked at anxiety-related behavior in fish through the use of the scototaxis behavioral model dealing with dark/light preference. When fish that have a preference for the dark were placed in a tank that is half black and half white, an increase in dark compartment activity should reflect anxiety-promoting behavior. [Maximino: 2010]. This is an example of how drastic changes in environments can stimulate anxiety responses in organisms, resulting in irregular behavior. This also demonstrates how toxic substances like crude oil in aquatic environments can elicit stress and have negative effects on aquatic organisms. Humans are negatively impacting the environment daily, so studies on how changes in water quality affects organisms are very important. Ultimately with all of this information in mind, it was decided that adding soil to the water to make it murky would create more of a struggle for the two betta fish to visualize one another. Therefore, it was hypothesized that there would be more aggressive behaviors (indicated by the amount of time the branchiostegal membrane is expanded) from the male fish in clear water conditions, than the amount of aggressive behavior in murky water conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
There were four male betta splendens placed into two separate tanks. Two fish were placed in a tank with normal treated water, while the other two fish were placed in a tank that was created murky with vermiculite soil. Additionally, the two fish in both tanks were physically separated by a glass and opaque barrier. The glass barrier allowed for the fish to see one another, but not come into physical contact, while the opaque barrier didn’t allow for visual or physical contact. The two groups were observed separately but with the same process. The opaque barrier was removed and for five minutes the fish were observed, a different observer for each fish. The aggressive behavior was measured by timing how many seconds each male protruded the branchiostegal membrane, creating a red “mane”. After the five minutes, the opaque barrier was returned, and they were given five minutes to rest before repeating this process twice more. The six values in seconds from each tank were averaged together and a one tailed two-sample t-test was used to compare the amount of aggression in the different conditions. A critical p-value of less than 0.05 was desired for the data to be significantly different.  

Results:
There is an observable difference between the means of the time spent demonstrating aggressive behavior by the male fish. As seen in Figure 1, on average the fish in clear water conditions spent more time with the branchiostegal membrane protruding than the murky water fish. The mean of the clear water conditions is significantly different than that of the experimental group. (t-stat=2.2, df=10, p=0.026). Although the standard deviations are noticeably large, the difference is still apparent and significant with the control group at an average of 81.37 seconds (83.91) and the experimental group at an average of 5.65 seconds (8.17).  


Discussion:
The results supported the hypothesis that there would be more aggressive behavior between males in the clear water than the murky water conditions. This suggests that the murky conditions cause the males to be less visible to one another and therefore less likely to feel threatened and show aggressive behavior. A study on changed environmental conditions weakening sexual selection in another fish species looked at the effects of eutrophication and increased algae growth. They found that enhanced algae growth increases the costs of mating because it induces an increase in the time and energy spent on the process of finding and choosing a mate. [Candolin: 2006]. This means that there is a high investment for a smaller return, which is unfavorable for the species. This specific study demonstrates reduced visibility due to dense vegetation, which is not far from the study of this paper. They explain the negative effects of eutrophication which arises from an increased input of nutrients, resulting in a harmful rise in the growth of filamentous algae and phytoplankton. [Candolin: 2006]. The studying of these behaviors is important because male animals demonstrate aggressive behaviors to mate with females and allow for the fittest alleles to survive and pass on to the next generations. Males not only fight for mating with females, but they also fight for space and resources like in another study on Betta splendens. The study looked at protectiveness over nest sites and a competition for space. [Bronstein: 1981]. Similar to this paper’s experiment, the males demonstrated the visual aggressive signals without ever actually coming into contact which suggests that there is a large energy cost with that and a threat to survival. Some flaws in this personal experiment include using two different fish for the two different water conditions meaning these fish could have already had predisposing behaviors that causes them to act differently from one another. Evidence for this flaw is that one fish hardly moved and never displayed any aggressive behavior. A way to fix this is by using a larger sample size and then using the same fish in both conditions. For future experiments one might suggest using a range of water conditions and also introduce new aspects to the tank like food and females to evoke competition between the two males. Other than the large standard deviations, this experiment had clear significantly different results. In conclusion, betta males are more likely to demonstrate aggressive behavior when they can clearly see their competitor and their environment is undisrupted.
