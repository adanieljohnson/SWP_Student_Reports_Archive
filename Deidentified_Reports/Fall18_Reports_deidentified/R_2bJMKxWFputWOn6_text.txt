Title: Aspergillus flavus outcompetes Physarum polycephalum  in both caffeinated and uncaffeinated environments

Abstract:
We sought to better understand nerve signaling by studying the effects of caffeine on the cAMP-mediated pathway and its effects upon the activity of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. We attempted to study this by treating Physarum with caffeine, a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, the enzyme that inhibits the cAMP-mediated pathway. We proposed that Physarum treated with caffeine would move more quickly towards food than Physarum not treated with caffeine. One treatment set was a 20mM caffeine solution, another was brewed coffee, and the third was a controll. After two days, we found no growth of Physarum, and thus were unable to support or refute our hypothesis. We found another mold to have grown on all of the agar plates, apparently outcompeting Physarum and killing it. It is also possible that we treated Physarum with a toxically high amount of caffeine. Future experiments should attempt to perform our experiment using stock plates that have exclusively Physarum. Ideally, they would also treat Physarum with a wide range of caffeine concentrations.

Introduction:
Multinucleated syncytia are a form of organism in which many nuclei share a single plasma membrane. These nuclei and the surrounding cytoplasm form a “plasmodium.” The “true” slime molds form plasmodia, with all nuclei acting and functioning as one. Physarum polycephalum is one such example of a slime mold and our model organism.
	The defining feature of syncytia is its incredible singularity of function. A clear example is that of “multiple fission,” or synchronized nuclear mitosis [Britannica: 2016]. A 1966 study suggested that this synchronicity arose from a stimulus substance formed in the cytoplasm that transfers to the nuclei shortly before mitosis occurs [Rusch, 1966]. In another study, researchers determined that when two plasmodia are fused together, the newly united nuclei initiate mitosis all at the same time [Sachsenmaier: 1972]. Likewise, researchers have found that Physarum plasmodia create networks of tubes throughout the cytoplasm that enable movement of nutrients throughout the organism, and that it does so very efficiently; the plasmodium, if presented food, will concentrate on the food source and engulf it before creating short, thick, and maximally efficient tubes to whatever of the plasmodium is left without direct access to the food [Nakagaki: 2004]. One more instance of Physarum unity is its mobility. The plasmodium can “crawl” along a surface in search of food by extending its leading edge outwards through the use of actin microfilaments. It can also determine the most efficient migratory pathway to food; Physarum in mazes have been able to determine the shortest route to food and then bring the whole of the plasmodium to that food along the determined path [Johnson: 2016]. 
These mass actions in Physarum polycephalum are enabled by cellular signaling pathways that allow communication between all parts of the plasmodium. A major signal transduction pathway used by Physarum is the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated pathway, a type of G-protein coupled receptor pathway. This pathway is inhibited by the enzyme phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cAMP [Johnson: 2016]. Research has determined that xanthines, of which caffeine is a type, inhibit phosphodiesterase, and that this activity may be responsible for its stimulant effects [Choi: 1988]. In other words, caffeine prevents inhibition of the cAMP-mediated pathway, making more cAMP available to cells and thus providing more energy. Research has also found that phosphodiesterase inhibitors, including caffeine and other xanthines, have positive chemotactic properties for Physarum, indicating that they are attractants for the organism [Kincaid: 1979]. The cAMP-mediated pathway is not only relevant to Physarum; many organisms, including humans, use this pathway, and experiments concerning it are highly relevant for understanding human cellular biology. In addition to its phosphodiesterase inhibition, caffeine is also a competitive inhibitor of adenosine, a chemical with depressant properties; this is a competing theory as to why caffeine is a behavioral stimulant [Howell: 1993]. 
The purpose of our experiment was to observe the effects of caffeine on available energy to Physarum polycephalum, as visualized by its movement. We hypothesized that providing caffeine to Physarum polycephalum would increase its rate of movement towards a food source. 


Materials and Method:
We began with fifteen agar plates. We treated five of these plates with a 20mM caffeine solution, five different plates with brewed coffee, and the five untreated plates were a controll. Both caffeinated treatments received 4 Ml of either the coffee or the caffeine solution. We had two stock plates of Physarum polycephalum grown on agar with oats for nutrition. Using a sterile flathead spatula, we cut out 1x1cm wells in all of the agar plates as close as possible to the rim of the plate, cleaning and sterilizing with ethanol between different treatments. We then cut the Physarum colonies on the stock plates into 1x1cm cubes in a lattice pattern; using sterile forceps, we picked up the most densely-populated cubes and placed them in the cut wells on our agar plates. We then poured four or five oats onto the agar diametrically across from the Physarum transplants, maximizing the distance between the Physarum and the food source. We then placed the lids atop the agar plates and taped them shut. In order to provide a controll for light, we placed all of the agar plates into opaque black plastic bags. We then placed them in an incubator set at 26±1°C and allowed them 28 hours to grow.
If had been able to collect meaningful data, we would have measured the distances travelled by the Physarum plasmodia, measuring from the stock well to the furthest point of movement. To calculate speed, we would have divided the distance travelled by the amount of time spent in incubation. We would have performed a one-way ANOVA to compare our treatment groups.


Results:
	Unfortunately, we were not able to collect meaningful data. After the initial 28-hour growth period had elapsed, we found no growth of Physarum, nor any traces of it. We found instead signs of an unknown brown/black organism’s growth towards the food. We allowed the Physarum another 24 hours to grow; however, after that time had elapsed, there was still no sign of Physarum growth. After a week, we found that the plates had been colonized by a different organism that grew a fluffy brown mass atop the agar. 
	As the Physarum failed to grow, we could not collect any data regarding its movement towards food nor regarding the speed of movement. However, we did have an expectation for how the Physarum plates would look, for both controll and caffeinated treatments.  


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was neither supported nor refuted by our data. We had predicted that if Physarum polycephalum plasmodia were treated with caffeine, then they would move more quickly towards a food source. However, we were not able to collect any data, as none of our Physarum cultures showed growth or movement. If our caffeine-treated Physarum had grown towards food significently faster than our controll Physarum, we believe that this would have been due to the inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase by the caffeine. Research has shown that caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase activity [Choi: 1988]. Phosphodiesterase inhibits the cAMP-mediated pathway by breaking down cAMP into ATP; therefore, inhibiting phosphodiesterase should keep cAMP available and allow the cAMP-mediated pathway to continue functioning, making more energy available to the cell. We proposed that this increase in available energy would have enabled the Physarum to be more active and to move faster towards the desired food source. Caffeine is also a competitive inhibitor of the chemical adenosine, which is associated with depressant properties [Howell: 1993]. This should not have countered the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibition, but rather reinforced them, providing an even greater positive effect upon Physarum movement.
	If our caffeine-treated Physarum had not grown towards food significently faster than our controll, it could have been for a number of reasons. It may have indicated that the inhibition of phosphodiesterase by caffeine did not greatly impact the cAMP-mediated pathway. This is not particularly likely, as past research has widely supported the finding that caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase, the cAMP-mediated pathway inhibitor. This effect would most certainly have impacted the functioning of that signaling pathway. What is more likely is that the effect on the cAMP-mediated pathway did not have any great impact on the activity of Physarum. If inhibiting phosphodiesterase did not make more energy available to Physarum, then the caffeine-treated mold would not have moved any faster than the controll mold. This would perhaps indicate that the cAMP-mediated pathway was not the primary motor for Physarum movement, or even not a motor at all. Future experiments could have then been performed to determine which pathway is primarily responsible for the movement of Physarum, and from there how that pathway could be manipulated to alter Physarum movement. While we did not consider adenosine inhibition in our initial experimental design, we can also consider it now: if our caffeine-treated, and therefore adenosine-inhibiting, Physarum had failed to move towards food faster, it would also have indicated that adenosine inhibition did not have a significent impact on Physarum activity. 
	Another potential reason for caffeine-treated Physarum to not have moved significently faster was that they were not treated with enough caffeine to produce a significent effect upon them. However, this seems quite unlikely, as they were treated with massive amounts of caffeine relative to their physical mass when compared to humans.
	If our caffeine-treated Physarum had actually moved slower towards the food source, it may have indicated a negative effect of caffeine upon the movement of the mold. This may have been the result of a negative impact upon the long-term viability of Physarum when the cAMP-mediated pathway is allowed to run indefinitely due to the inhibition of phosphodiesterase. In humans, caffeine is toxic in high quantities, which is largely ascribed to the inhibition of adenosine [Kerrigan: 2005]. If enough caffeine is consumed, a fatal overdose can occur. It is therefore possible that we poisoned our Physarum by treating it with too much caffeine, which could explain why we observed no growth at all.
	While we did not successfully grow Physarum, we did grow a different organism on our agar plates. The organism was apparently another type of mold: it grew in a concentrated fluffy brown mass with a seeming network of thin black tendrils emanating outwards from it. Judging by its appearance, we believe this to be Aspergillus flavus, an opportunistic crop pathogen. A. flavus can grow in almost any crop seed, such as the oats we used as a food source; it also produces the dangerous compound aflatoxin [Klich: 2007]. It seems highly probable that this highly toxic mold simply outcompeted Physarum, spreading its toxins across the agar plate and killing the Physarum, thereby preventing any growth. Because A. flavus and Physarum, both being molds, prefer the same environmental conditions – sugar, warmth, darkness, and high moisture – there was no environmental selection in favor of either type of mold, giving the toxic A. flavus a leg up with all other factors equal. 
	Future experiments could repeat our setup, ideally with cleaner stock plates that only had Physarum polycephalum growing on them. No matter what the relative speeds were, researchers could try repeating the experiment using a broader variety of caffeine concentrations and comparing the results. If they found caffeine-treated Physarum to move faster towards food than a controll, they may attempt to distinguish between the effects of phosphodiesterase inhibition and of adenosine inhibition. If they found that caffeine-treated Physarum grew slower than a controll towards food, they could perform other experiments with caffeine on Physarum to see if they could determine other negative effects. If there was no significent difference between the treatment groups, researchers could test the effects of other xanthines upon the movement of Physarum plasmodia.
