Title: The Effect of Different Wavelengths of Visible Light on Photosynthetic Rate

Abstract:
The main objective of this lab is to study the effect of different wavelengths of visible light on photosynthetic rate. Change in absorbance over time is inversely related to photosynthetic rate.  This means one can indirectly observe the electron transfer that occurs in photosynthesis by tracking the percent change in absorbance. Different wavelengths of light may affect the rate of electron transfer. The treatments the enriched chloroplasts are exposed to in this experiment are darkness, white light, red light, and green light. The model organism used is spinach because it is a leafy, green plant. This means it has plenty of chloroplasts and reflects green light. The alternative hypothesis is that red light will have a greater magnitude of percent change, which will in turn mean a better photosynthetic rate. The null hypothesis is that wavelength of light has no effect on percent change in absorbance/electron transfer. The p_values came out to be above the significance level, meaning that the alternate hypothesis could not be supported. Further studies would have to be done to reject the null hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Unlike heterotrophs, photoautotrophs do not depend on an external source of organic compounds for energy used in respiration, a cellular metabolic process. They undergo photosynthesis to transform light energy into the chemical energy used in respiration. These two metabolic processes are dependent of each other because they are essentially opposites. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to produce glucose and oxygen. Meanwhile, respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. 
	Focusing on photosynthesis, it is a two-stage metabolic process, consisting of light dependent and light independent reactions. In the light dependent reactions, light energy is used to create a proton gradient for ATP synthesis [Johnson:2016]. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that absorbs visible light to start this process. Throughout this reaction in Photosystem II, electron transfer occurs. A way to measure the electron transfer is through a Hill reaction, in which DCIP and water are reduced with light [Johnson:2016]. DCIP is naturally blue, and when reduced, it changes into a colorless solution [Johnson:2016]. Measuring the change in absorbance can help one observe the amount of electron transfer that occurred. A higher percent change in absorbance would mean there was more electron transfer, meaning there was a more efficient photosynthetic rate. To summarize, absorbance over time is inversely related to photosynthetic rate. 
	With this method of observing photosynthetic rate, one can test how environmental factors can affect electron transfer. One factor that may affect electron transfer is the wavelength of visible light the chloroplasts are under. Since chlorophyll is green, it reflects green light. Meanwhile, studies have shown that chloroplasts absorb red and blue light the most because it closely resembles solar energy [Zhen:2017]. This is because solar energy consists of infrared and ultraviolet light, which have wavelengths that are close to that of red and blue light. With this information, researchers have said that “red light can increase photosynthetic efficiency” [Zhen:2017]. With this information, the alternate hypothesis is that the chloroplasts from spinach under a red wavelength of visible light will undergo of faster rate of electron transfer and therefore better photosynthetic rate than any other wavelength of light tested. The null hypothesis is that wavelength of visible light has no effect on electron transfer. The negative controll will be chloroplasts under darkness, and the positive controll will be white light. The two wavelengths being tested will be red and green light. The reasoning for red light being better for photosynthesis is that chloroplasts absorb this wavelength more efficiently than green or white light. With more light being absorbed, more electron transfer should occur. With this said, the enriched chloroplasts from Spinach leaves under red light will have the highest percent change in absorbance when compared to other wavelengths of visible light. 


Materials and Method:
Before starting the Hill reaction, the enriched chloroplasts were obtained from four spinach leaves. After removing the central veins from them, we dried off any moisture and grinded them up for a few minutes. While grinding, we added 10 milliliters of grinding buffer, 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer. After grinding it to a green paste, we added 10 more milliliters of grinding buffer. The slurry solution was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth. The filtered suspension was transferred to a 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked A and spun at 200 G for three minutes at 4°C. Following the spin, the supernatant was poured into another centrifuge tube marked B and spun at 1000 G for ten minutes at 4°C. After removing everything but the pellet in the tube, 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to it. Finally, the tube was shaken thoroughly to make sure the enriched chloroplasts were evenly distributed. 
To continue the experiment, thirteen test tubes were set up according to their treatment. One test tube made up the blank, containing 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. The rest of the twelve test tubes contained 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Three test tubes were set aside for each treatment group, consisting of chloroplasts under darkness, white light, red light, and green light. After setting the spectrophotometer to 600 nanometers, 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts were added to each of the thirteen test tubes. Once the contents were mixed thoroughly, the mixtures were all added to their own respective cuvette. Following the blanking of the spectrophotometer, the absorbance was recorded for each cuvette, being “Absorbance at Time Zero.” The cuvettes were then put under their respective treatment. The “Dark” cuvettes were placed inside a drawer, the “White Light” cuvettes sat under a normal lamp, the “Red Light” cuvettes sat under a lamp with a red filter, and the “Green Light” cuvettes sat under a lamp with a green filter. After 10 minutes, the absorbance was recorded again, and each cuvette was placed back in their respective treatment. This was repeated at the twenty- and thirty-minute interval. All the results were recorded in a table, calculating percent change between each time interval. Finally, A two sample one-tailed t_test with equal variance was used to determine significance. It was conducted with a significance level of 0.05 and had 2 degrees of freedom.


Results:
The average percent change of each treatment was compared to the percent change of the enriched chloroplasts under red light because it had the highest percent change. It therefore serves as a good basis for comparison. As seen on Figure 1, percent change in absorbance was tracked over a 30-minute time period. The enriched chloroplasts under red light had the most percent change with a mean of -44.76±41.5%. Following, the chloroplasts under green light had a percent change with a mean of -35.01± 8.7%. White light then had an average percent change of 25.43±7.14%. Lastly, darkness had an average percent change of -1.96±0.8%. As these numbers from Figure 1 show, the chloroplasts under red light showed a large standard deviation. The p_value when comparing the chloroplasts under red light and darkness was 0.0688. The p_value between the red light and white light was 0.2182. Finally, the p_value when comparing green and red light was 0.3333. All the p_values were above the significance level of 0.05. None of the groups compared were statistically different from one another. 

Discussion:
As the different two sample t_tests show, there is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The p_values were all above the significance level of 0.05. There was no significent difference in percent change when enriched chloroplasts were exposed to different wavelengths of visible light over a 30-minute period.  One red flag from the data are the error bars. Specifically, the standard deviation for the chloroplasts under red light came out to be ±41.5%. This spread of data suggests that the results for the treatment were not consistent with each other. A source of error that could have caused this large deviation is that some of the cuvettes had black markings on the top of them. This could have caused the absorbance reading to be higher than it should have been. The higher the magnitude of percent change, the more electron transfer that was undergone. The red light did have the highest rate of change, but none of the p_values suggest for strong evidence towards it having significent difference in percent change. Even the p_value between the chloroplasts under red light and darkness was not statistically significent. This calls for further testing because it is proven that plants have a higher photosynthetic rate under light than they do under darkness. Chloroplasts in a leafy, green like spinach require light energy for the light dependent reactions. Under no light, the chloroplasts would only be able to undergo the light independent reactions, such as the Calvin cycle. With this information, there should have been a significent difference in percent change. Next time, cleaner cuvettes should be used to minimize the flaw in absorbance reading. This could minimize the abnormally large standard deviations, as seen on Figure 1. Like Shuyang Zhen and More Iersel have said on their research paper, red light increases photosynthetic efficacy, and they explain how chloroplasts absorb red light the best, meaning they obtain more light energy [Zhen:2017]. With this background knowledge, there is reason to do further testing on the subject.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure shows the percent change in absorbance after a time span of 30 minutes. Percent change was used to observe photosynthetic rate under different wavelengths of visible light. The number of trials done for each treatment were three, meaning it has degree of freedom of two. From left to right, the standard deviations from the error bars are respectively -1.96±0.8%, -25.43±7.14%, -44.76±41.5%, and -35.01± 8.7%.*************************************************************************
