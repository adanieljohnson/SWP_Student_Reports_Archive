Title: The decreasing effect of limited light availability on the root:shoot weight and length ratios of Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Resource allocation is of vital importance to Vigna radiata, and to plants in general. Plants have the ability to change their morphological traits in order to obtain the resources they require for life and reproduction. If the availability of one these resources becomes more scarce, then the plant will alter its morphology to accommodate. With a positive change in morphology, the plant is expected to grow and produce a higher yield, which the agriculture business can implement to produce the best yields. It is hypothesized that if Vigna radiata is raised in an environment with decreased light availability, it will have a lower root:shoot than a Vigna radiata raised in an environment with full light exposure. To test this theory, Vigna radiata seedlings were planted and raised with full and limited light availability. After two weeks, the root:shoot weight and length ratios of the plants were significently different, with a smaller average root:shoot for the plants raised in partial light availability. This meant that the plants raised in with partial light availability had a greater biomass of its shoots in an effort to maximize surface area to obtain sunlight. This sunlight was then used to aid the plant in photosynthesis.

Introduction:
Resource allocation is of vital importance to plants. All plants have certain resources, like water, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and soil nutrients, that they must obtain in order to survive. Of these resources, one of the most important resources is light. It affects their survival rate by increasing locations to photosynthesize, their morphology and growth patterns, photosynthesis rates, and the overall metabolism of the plants [Zhang: 2018]. Light availability depends on a variety of components: geographic location, density and type of surviving plants, and weather [Lawn: 1983]. An common issue often faced in the agriculture industry is the importance of plant density and crop spacing. People often research in the hopes of finding the optimal plant spacing to maximize yields. Variations in crop spacing leads to variations in light availability as plants that are closer together have to compete for sunlight. As a result, plants undergo morphological changes in an effort to obtain more of the resources that they are unable to collect [Zhang: 2018]. Another common idea is to introduce agroforestry to field planting, as it may be able to provide shade conditions that allow for optimal growth (and higher yields) of crops. 
	Each plant can be divided into two regions, the roots and the shoots. The roots of a plant consist of the anatomy of the plant that is below ground. The roots of a plant are responsible for the allocation of water and essential nutrients like nitrogen and potassium. In comparison, the shoots of a plant consist of the stem and leaves of a plant. The shoots are responsible for the allocation of carbon dioxide and light [Rachaputi: 2015]. As a result, they can change their growth patterns to create more surface area for obtaining sunlight and nutrients to the soil. A root:shoot can be taken of the mass or the heights, and comparisons of intraspecific variation can be used to see how plants adjust to changing light availabilities [Waring: 2016].
	The model organism for this experiment is Vigna radiata, also known as the mungbean. The mungbean is a highly nutritional food and feed legume crop, and it is very important in the economies of many countries. The production and consumption of mungbeans is most common in Asia, and the demand for this crop is quickly increasing [Rachaputi: 2015]. As a result, there is a new push to develop more successful and ecologically responsible ways to increase mungbean yields to meet this demand [Rachaputi: 2015]. Potential ideas involve changing the light availability to mung beans by crop density or agroforestry in the hopes of creating higher yield and survival rates of mung beans plants. It is hypothesized that if Vigna radiata is raised in an environment with decreased light availability (representing a higher crop density), it will have a lower root:shoot than a Vigna radiata raised in an environment with full light exposure (representing a lower crop density).


Materials and Method:
Three plant trays were filled with vermiculite, and were presoaked with water. Then, in each tray, two rows of three indentions were made, and two seeds were placed in each indention. This totals thirty-six seeds in the three trays, which were then lightly covered with fertilizer and watered again. Then, three more plant trays were created in the same way. The first three trays were then placed in the green house with direct sunlight, and the other three were placed under the shade tent in the green house. For the next two weeks, these plants were watered once a day around noon. 
	After two weeks, six plants were removed from each tray by the following procedure. The first tray was taken, and the plastic tray was removed and the entirety of the soil and roots were submerged in a tub of water. Six plants were then gently detangled and rinsed off with water. They were then patted dry with a paper towel. All six plants were then placed in a weigh tray and massed. The plants were then cut at the root shoot junction, and the roots of all six plants were massed, and the shoots mass was then calculated. The maximum root length and maximum shoot length were measured in millimeters. These measurement procedures were then repeated for the remaining five trays. The root:shoot (R:S) of the masses and maximum lengths of the two regions were calculated for each tray. A two-tailed t_test was then used to determine significance, with a critical value of p=0.05.


Results:
The average weight R:S of the plants raised in full light exposure was 0.6145 +/- 0.0258, and the average R:S of the plants raised in partial light exposure was 0.3310 +/- 0.0261, which can be seen in figure 1. These two averages are significently different (t=13.378, d.f.=4, p=0.00018). The average length R:S of the plants raised in full light exposure was 0.6321 +/- 0.0646, and the average length R:S of plants raised in partial light is 0.4150 +/- 0.0688, which can be seen in figure 2. These two averages are significently different (t=3.983, d.f.=4, p=0.01635).

Discussion:
Because the root:shoot weight and length ratios are significently different, we can conclude that our results support our hypothesis. This means that the availability of resources can cause phenotypic variation within the same species. Plants will use the majority of their energy to maximize their ability to obtain the nutrients that are limited [Zhang:2018]. This is why the plants in partial light maximized their shoot length and mass in order to create more areas to absorb the limited light and undergo photosynthesis. This is important because, if the plant is not a root vegetable or other underground crop, the taller the plants are, the better they are at growth and the more likely to produce a healthy yield. These findings are important because they can direct the mungbean industry to consider using denser crop fields in an effort to increase crop yields. In a time when the demand for greater crop yields is so high, this information can lead to greater yields without creating new crop fields. Future directions for experimentation could be using more light availability levels stretched over a larger range to find the optimal light availability for mungbean growth. This information could then be used it to determine the optimal crop density for the largest yield.
