Title: Physarum polycephalum: Caffeine’s Inhibitory Influence on Migration Towards Food Source

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to use Physarum polycephalum to test the effects of caffeine on signaling transduction pathways. If the caffeine levels surrounding the Physarum are increased, then the distance of migration towards a food source will be decreased and reflect caffeine’s ability to inhibit the function of phosphodiesterase within the cAMP-mediated pathway. This inhibition will increase intracellular levels of cAMP which can inhibit cell growth. The growth is measured by soaking agar plates under different caffeine concentration mediums including water, coffee, and 20 mM caffeine with the caffeine solution being the most concentrated. The distances the Physarum traveled towards food were measured in cm. The experiment had inconclusive data with a lack of any Physarum growth which was likely due to the presence of Aspergillus flavus that would compete with the Physarum for growth in the agar plates. The experiment used a one-way ANOVA test and the p value was 2.71E-11. The data is contrasted by previously published studies that demonstrate the inhibitory effects of caffeine on cell growth. Research on Physarum can be applied to studies on caffeine function in humans because the mechanisms for signal pathways are very similar between the two organisms.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the effects of caffeine on signal transduction pathways. The specific organism used in this experiment is the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This organism consists of multiple nuclei within a single membrane that all undergo mitosis simultaneously [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, Physarum is a model organism for this experiment because it allows experimenters to observe the signal transduction pathways of multiple nuclei within a single membrane all at once. Physarum is capable of intelligent behavior in regards to obtaining food. The slime mold has been studied responding to different chemicals in its environment on paths towards food. One study discovered that the mold had a preference for non-oxygenated terpene and terpene-like compounds in contrast to terpene-based alcohols [DeLacyCostello: 2013]. This experiment highlights the slime mold’s preference for selective chemicals in its environment to maximize its ability to obtain food. 
In this study, caffeine is used to determine its effects on the ability of Physarum to reach food. Although caffeine is typically known as a stimulant for humans, it has been seen to negatively affect signal transduction pathways in Physarum. A study discovered that when caffeine was repeatedly applied to the cytoplasm of Physarum, longer responses were noted and eventually no response was present at all [Matthews: 1977]. Caffeine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor which functions within the cAMP pathway. The cAMP pathway is a G-protein coupled pathway with the effector enzyme being adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP into cAMP [Johnson: 2018]. cAMP diffuses through the cell to bind to different substrates that can be activated to phosphorylate other enzymes and either activate or silence them [Johnson: 2018]. Phosphodiesterase acts to break down cAMP and stop the cAMP pathway [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, when caffeine is added to a cell, it will inhibit the effects of phosphodiesterase and enable the production of cAMP. An increase in cAMP production has been seen to have inhibitory effects because inhibition of phosphodiesterase has been seen to promote apoptosis in different types of cells including cardiomyocytes, mesangial cells, and lymphoma cells [Ladilov: 2014]. These negative effects of caffeine should prevent cell growth in this experiment and limit Physarum’s ability to obtain food. If the caffeine levels surrounding Physarum polycephalum are increased, then the distance the mold travels towards food will decrease.

Materials and Method:
A total of 15 agar plates were prepared. Five controll plates were water agar plates. Five test plates were prepared by pipetting 5 Ml of a 20mM caffeine solution onto the plate. The plates were soaked in the caffeine solution for five minutes. The caffeine solutions were removed after soaking. Five other test plate were prepared by pipetting 5 Ml of chilled coffee onto the plate. The coffee was One Coffee brand and medium roast. The plates sat with the coffee solution for five minutes. The coffee solutions were removed after soaking. Each plate had a 1cm x 1cm block of the Physarum stock plate inserted into one side using a sterilized spatula and pair of forceps. 4 oats were placed at the opposite end of the plate. All preparations were then secured with tape and wrapped in foil to be placed in an incubator for 48 hours. After incubation, the distance the Physarum grew towards the food was measured in centimeters. A one-way ANOVA test was run to determine if the data was statistically significent.

Results:
The data expected would have seen that the caffeine treatment leads to the shortest distance of Physarum growth because it has the highest concentration of caffeine. This would be followed by coffee because it has a more diluted concentration of caffeine. The controll plates should have the greatest distances of Physarum growth due to the lack of caffeine. 
The data actually only saw growth in one of the fifteen plates after 48 hours. The majority of the other plates were colonized by a brown mold, most likely Aspergillus flavus, and none of the other plates appeared to have residue from Physarum growth.

Discussion:
The data was not able to support the hypothesis because no Physarum growth was noted. These cultures shut down normal growth which was not an expected result. The failure for the mold to grow was most likely due to the brown mold present in the plates after the incubation period. This mold was most likely Aspergillus flavus, which would have acted to compete with the Physarum and inhibit growth. Aspergillus is a type of mycotoxin which is a secondary metabolite synthesized by certain fungi [Diener: 1987]. Mycotoxins are poisonous and can cause death when they are present in food consumed by animals and humans [Diener: 1987]. The presence of this mold likely competed with the Physarum since it is a toxin and prevented migration towards the oats.
Additionally, previous studies have examined problems with the use of agar plates that concluded they cannot discriminate between the direct effects on migration and the indirect effects on growth due to the unknown nutritional status of the plasmodia [Knowles: 1978]. Plates able to support rapid growth were found to depress migration of the Physarum which remained in its original position until all nutrients were exhausted [Knowles: 1978]. Therefore, since the Physarum in the experiment conducted had an unknown amount of nutrients already present, these nutrients could have inhibited migration and provide a possible explanation for the lack of growth seen in the plates. Future experiments should provide Physarum with a known nutritional status to ensure that the cells do not have an excessive amount of nutrients already present that would inhibit migration. Additionally, it was found that inhibition of migration was brought on by some sugars like sucrose which support little growth due to osmotic effects [Knowles: 1978]. Since sugar was present in the coffee solution prepared, it could have contaminated the agar plates and led to an inhibition of Physarum growth.
The data expected would have shown increases in caffeine concentration leading to a decrease in migration distance. Caffeine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that acts on the cAMP pathway. cAMP pathways stop when phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, inhibition of phosphodiesterase causes the same responses as stimulation of the production of cAMP [Johnson: 2018]. Increases in cAMP can cause a delay or inhibition in cell division which has been observed in experiments with Tetrahymena and mouse spleen cells [Timson: 1977]. A drop in intracellular levels of cAMP can be followed by a change in the expression of genes implicated in the cAMP pathway which has been observed in experiments using the fungi Saccharomyces cerevisiae [Kuranda: 2006]. Since caffeine increases intracellular levels of cAMP which inhibits cell division and alters gene expression, caffeine should have inhibited the growth and migration of the Physarum polycephalum. The information obtained in this experiment is applicable to other studies because the pathways exhibited by Physarum, including the cAMP-mediated pathway, are similar to those in humans and can aid in further studies. Caffeine research can therefore be conducted on the slime mold without using humans to determine health effects that could pose dangers to the test subjects. In this way, caffeine testing on Physarum can contribute to medical applications for humans through an indirect and safe approach.
