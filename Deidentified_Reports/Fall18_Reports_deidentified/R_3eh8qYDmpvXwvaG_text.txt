Title: The Effect of Increasing Juvenile Hormone on Development in Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is a tobacco leaf defoliator native to North and South America. Pest control options have been explored in the attempt to control this pest to manipulate their maturation, as they are only a pest when in their larval form. In this experiment, a JH+ group of four caterpillars were given Juvenile Hormone in their food for two weeks and were compared to a control group of four caterpillars. At the end of the two weeks, the average maximum masses of the JH+ group were statistically significantly higher than the average maximum masses of the control group. The control group also progressed into the pupal stage of development, unlike the JH+ group which remained in the larval stage. This concludes that the addition of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars does not allow them to progress into the pupal stage of development like normal. Juvenile Hormone should not be used as a pesticide on Manduca​ sexta caterpillars as it would keep the caterpillars in the larval stage longer and allow them to consume more tobacco leaves.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth native to North and South America. Naturally, the Manduca sexta has five larval instars that are each separated by a molting period. The progression of the insects’ development is driven by the presence or absence of several hormones [Byron: 2017]. One of these hormones is Juvenile Hormone (JH). Juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allatum, glands located on either side of the foregut. In organisms, the role of Juvenile Hormone is to control what the organism will become after a molt. If abundant JH is present, the caterpillar will molt into a larval stage caterpillar. If there is little JH, the caterpillar will pupate. In a case study in the lab manual, an experiment was previously conducted to determine the effects of giving Manduca sexta varying percentages of Blue Floss flower, a JH mimic, on length and mass the caterpillars when added to their food for one week [Johnson: 2016]. Similar to the case study, this experiment aims to discover the effect of increasing JH on the physical characteristics, including mass, after it is no longer produced naturally, just before the commitment pulse. In contrast to the case study, this experiment also analyzes the development and maturation of the caterpillars, including the ​length of time until pupation, over the course of two weeks. I hypothesize the increase in JH will result in the caterpillars growing larger in weight(grams) compared to the control group. I also hypothesize the caterpillars treated with Juvenile Hormone will not pupate and therefore remain in the larval stage until they die.

Materials and Methods:
 Eight caterpillars were randomly divided into two groups of four, control group and JH+ group. Each group was placed in a container with four separate wells for each caterpillar. Each day, the caterpillars were given ten grams of food. The JH+ group was given four drops of Precor solution mixed in their food per day. The masses of each caterpillar were obtained each day. Qualitative observations, such as the length of time until pupation, color, and activity were recorded each day. The experiment lasted for two weeks, and the final weights of the caterpillars were recorded. A two-sample t-test​ was conducted to determine if the average maximum growth was significantly different for caterpillars given Juvenile Hormone compared to a control group.


Results:
Both groups began at similar average weights. The JH+ Group began to have larger average masses than the control group after only a few days, and after two weeks the difference between the average masses was very significant(Figure 1). All of the masses for the JH+ group were larger than the mass of the control group(Table 1). The averages of the maximum masses of the caterpillars were plotted were used to conduct the two-sample t-test. The JH+ group also had a higher average maximum mass, 16.88g, than the average maximum mass of the control group, 9.74g, after two weeks(Figure 1). As the experiment progressed, the JH+ group became a lighter blue and consumed and defecated considerably more than the control group. All the caterpillars in the Control Group pupated after thirteen days. The results of the two-sample t-test are​ (t=5.603, df=6, p=0.00138).


Discussion:
The results of the two-sample t-test indicate there is a significant difference in maximum growth between the JH+ and the control groups over the course of two weeks. Since the caterpillars in the JH+ group did not pupate, and the all the caterpillars in the JH+ group did, there is evidence to assume increasing JH has an effect on the time in which Manduca sexta pupate. The presence of abundant Juvenile Hormone at the time of the molt from the 5th instar to the pupa results in the 5th instar larva molting into a larger larval instar sometimes called the 6th instar. This is why the caterpillars in the JH+ group experienced an​ increase in size at the same time the control group formed pupas, as the JH+ group molted into a 6th larval instar[Johnson: 2016]. In the future, a similar experiment to this one could be conducted over a larger period of time to see if a group of caterpillars given extra Juvenile Hormone would eventually form pupas. As stated in the hypothesis, the caterpillars in the JH+ Group had a higher average mass that the caterpillars in the control group at the end of the two weeks and did not pupate. In addition to the hypothesis, the JH+ Group also had a higher average maximum mass than the control group over the course of the two weeks.
