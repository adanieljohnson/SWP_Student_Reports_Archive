Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Wild Pea Plant Growth

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the plants ability to allocate recourses to where they are most needed and to increase the plants ability to receive an increased amount of resources in the future. Sunlight is a particularly important resource as it is required for photosynthesis in plants. The following experiment analyzes how the environmental variable of sunlight affects the way wild pea plants allocate resources so that they are able to achieve an optimal rate of photosynthesis and growth. This variable was tested by placing wild pea plants in two treatment groups, with one placed in full sunlight and the other place in shade. 

Introduction:
Sunlight is an essential factor in plant growth. Sunlight energy is what allows for plants to take carbon dioxide and water and convert it into glucose and oxygen. Plants exposed to minimal sunlight would be “predicted to shift resources toward stem and leaf growth, and to pigments associated with light capture” [Coleman: 1999]. Plants will typically allocate resources to leaves because it will increase surface area and allow for greater light absorption. In an experiment with Impatiens parviflora, under different light conditions extending from full sunlight to the artificial equivalent of woodland shade there were observed “changes in leaf structure and in the operation of the photosynthetic mechanism” [Evans: 1972]. This allocation of resources would allow the plant to obtain additional light energy so that it can perform better photosynthesis. With full exposure to sunlight plants are able to grow more successfully than plants without sufficient sunlight because the increased amount of sunlight allows for a higher rate of photosynthesis. This experiment analyzes the growth of wild pea plants in both natural and reduced sunlight. Pea plants, also called Lathyrus odoratus are part of the Fabaceae family and native to the Mediterranean region [Chittendon: 1956]. Typically, these plants are grown in woodlands, chaparral and scrub habitats. Like all plants they require light energy to make glucose and grow and without sufficient light energy, pea plants allocate resources for survival. The following experiment tests the effect of natural and low light conditions on pea plant growth. It was hypothesized that if the pea plants receive more light they will grow more successfully and therefore have a higher mean mass.

Materials and Methods:
	To test the hypothesis, pea plants were place under two different treatments. Each treatment consisted of a six-compartment tray. Each compartment was filled ¾ of the way with soil and fertilizer was added to each compartment for each treatment. Five wild pea plants were planted in each compartment after being soaked in water for one hour. To plant the seeds, a one-inch deep hole was created in each of the four corners of the compartment and in the center. The seeds were placed in the holes then re-covered with soil. The two trays were labeled treatment one and treatment two. Treatment one was placed in natural sunlight while treatment two was placed under shade. The artificially reduced sunlight was created using a shade tarp. Over the span of ten days the pea plants in both treatments were watered every day for a duration of 3 seconds per compartment using the watering can. After ten days passed, measurements were taken. Three randomly selected pea plants were carefully removed from each compartment so that no roots were broken off the plant. The individual masses of each pea plant (a total of 18 per treatment) were weighed and recorded in grams. The 18 masses recorded for treatment one were averaged and the 18 masses recorded for treatment two were averaged as well. After obtaining the average mass for each treatment group, a two-sample t test was conducted.  

Results:
The experiment revealed that the mean mass in grams for the plants in treatment one was 1.572 (mean +/- 0.32) and the mean mass for treatment two was 1.466 (mean +/- 0.33) [Figure 1]. From the two-sample t-test, the data presented a t-stat of 0.97, a degree of freedom of 34, and a two-tailed p-value of 0.341. The two-tailed p value calculated from the two-sample t-test was less than 0.05 therefore the results of this experiment were not statistically significant (t-stat = 0.97, df = 34, P = 0.341).  

Discussion:
The results did not support the alternative hypothesis that treatment one would have a significantly larger mean mass because it was exposed to more sunlight. The hypothesis was not supported because the results of the experiment were not statistically significant.  It is possible this outcome occurred because the pea plants maintained enough nutrients in their seeds to not rely heavily on the rate of photosynthesis for healthy growth and survival. Furthermore, it is possible the experiment did not take place over a long enough period of time (took place over ten days) and therefore significant data was unable to be collected. In addition, pea plants are able to survive in low light conditions therefore it is possible that the plants were receiving sufficient light for photosynthesis [Chittendon: 1956]. Plants are able to allocate resources so that they can survive and do well in low light conditions as Evan’s explains in a similar experiment “the effect of holding the carbon dioxide concentration in the cellular spaces of the leaves adjacent to the mesophyll cells almost constant…makes a contribution to the ability of certain plants to succeed in deep shade” [Evans: 1972]. To extend this experiment, root to shoot ratio can also be calculated after measuring the individual lengths and masses of the roots and shoots. Observations of the pea plants while collecting data revealed that the roots of the plants that were exposed to sunlight were longer than the roots of the shaded plants whereas the shoots of the shaded plants were taller than the shoots of the plants exposed to natural light. Calculation of the root to shoot ratio will provide more information on  the health of each plant which will give new insight into plant growth. Overall, the allocation strategies used by the pea plants in the experiment was unclear. In recent studies shifts in the allocation patterns of plants that have been placed under changing environmental conditions have been proven to maximize plant growth [Fakhri: 2008]. Therefore, we can predict that with further observation by conducting a longer lasting experiment, or by taking different measurements, pea plants will exhibit similar behavior.
