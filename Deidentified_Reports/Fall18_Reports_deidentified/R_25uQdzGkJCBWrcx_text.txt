Title: The effects of Glyphosate and Paraquat on Photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica

Abstract:
Hypothesized that the rates of photosynthesis will decrease in Kale in the presence of both herbicides, Paraquat and Glyphosate an ultimately testing to see which will be more effective. Done by enriching the chloroplasts, and measuring the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of various concentrations of Paraquat and Glyphosate. A one way ANOVA was ran to test if there was a significent difference between the means was found with a p &lt; 0.05. It can be concluded that the rate of photosynthesis decreased in the presence of the two herbicides after 20 minutes in sunlight and that the better herbicide of the two was Glyphosate. Future research should be done exploring the effects of other herbicides.


Introduction:
The plant is a very complex autotrophic organism, so they produce their own food and energy through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, many things have to happen in order for the plant to successfully produce  a substrate for respiration in order to obtain ATP which is the biologically usable form of energy. First, chloroplasts must absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules, then electrons excited by captured solar energy leave carrier molecules. Electron excitement triggers a chemical reaction that cleaves water to release electrons that replace the ones that just left the carriers and generate a necessary proton gradient. These high energy electrons are then stored as NADPH, and the H+ gradient that powers ATP synthesis. The electrons on NADPH and the ATP are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules [Johnson: 2018]. This process can be affected by many factors such as light, pH, temperature or carbon-dioxide concentration. Another thing that can affect photosynthesis is a photosynthesis inhibiting herbicide. Photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides work by blocking the transfer of electrons. Without electron transfer, energy from the sun cannot be transformed into energy that is usable by plants to generate new tissue and sustain life [Lehman: 2017]. In our experiment we wanted to test the effect on photosynthesis in the Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica (Kale) organism with two different common herbicides, Paraquat and Glyphosate. We hypothesize that the rates of photosynthesis will decrease in the presence of both herbicides. Which will be more effective is what we would like to see. We chose Kale as our model organism because it is known to have the highest rates of photosynthesis in comparison to other leafy greens and since it is easily attainable [Erwin: 2017].  Paraquat and Glyphosate were the herbicides of choice because of their known potency with Kale plants [NCSU: 2017]. 


Materials and Method:
The first part of the experiment was to enrich the chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. This involved first packing a mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into a crushed ice bath to cool down. Next, while the mortar and pestle were cooling, the large central veins from 1 medium sized Kale leaf was removed and then rinsed off and blotted for excess water. Once the mortar and pestle were cold, they were wiped dry,and then and then the Kale leaves were added. 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was also added to the mortar and we began to grind the Kale until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves was left. An additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added and mixed with the Kale slurry, the entire mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. The green liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. The supernatant was poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”.  We then centrifuged the 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. The supernatant was then poured into a clean 50 Ml tube marked “C”, carefully as to not disturb the pellet. We then added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. These are the enriched chloroplasts we then used for the remainder of the experiment.The next part of the experiment was to set up test tubes with the appropriate amounts of buffer, DCIP, distilled water, herbicide and enriched chloroplasts. We had one blank tube with 8 Ml of water, no DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer and no herbicide. Then, 3 tubes with 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 1 Ml of Glyphosate. Then, 3 tubes with 3 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 3 Ml of Glyphosate. Then, 3 tubes with 1 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 5 Ml of Glyphosate.Then this was repeated with Paraquat. Then, another 3 tubes with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml DCIP and 2 Ml of buffer. Finally, we added 100 µl of enriched chloroplasts to all the tubes, they were placed in light for 20 minutes total. After waiting the appropriate time, we measures absorbance in a Genesys 20 spectrophotometer at 600 nM and recorded the various absorbances. We used an one way ANOVA to interpret our results.


Results:
The experiment yielded on average an increase in absorption after 20 minutes of in light (Table 1). A one-way ANOVA was ran to test if there was statistical differences between the concentration of different herbicides used. The results yielded were statistically significent, there is a difference between all groups with a p_value &lt; 0.05 (Table 2). This difference was graphically depicted on Graph 1, we can visually see this.

Discussion:
The results of our experiment supported our hypothesis that the rate of photosynthesis would decrease in the presence of a herbicide. We observed a significent increase in absorption with the presence of both herbicides therefore we can conclude that the rate of photosynthesis was lowered (Table 1). This is important because farmers who grow Kale know that they should use Paraquat since it disrupts Kales photosynthesis the least. Since herbicides are used to disrupt or stop photosynthesis in unwanted plants a farmer would want one that disrupts it in the weeds surrounding the Kale but not the Kale itself, therefore Paraquat is the better choice for Kale farmers. We can conclude that the better herbicide (being defined as disrupting photosynthesis) is Glyphosate in comparison to Paraquat on the Kale chloroplasts (Graph 1). Future research should be done exploring the effects of other herbicides in order to introduce a conclusive study showing the best and worst herbicides for the Kale plant. Some other herbicides that can be tested are Prefar, Aim and Command [Dittmar: 2018].
