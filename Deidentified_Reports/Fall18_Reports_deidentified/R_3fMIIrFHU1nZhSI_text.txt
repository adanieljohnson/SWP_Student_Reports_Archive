Title: The Influence of an Introduction of Sodium in an Electrically Stimulated Gastrocnemius 

Abstract:
In this experiment we intended to determine the effects of introduction of sodium (Na+) on the strength of an action potential in the gastrocnemus of a frog. We predicted that the introduction of sodium would result in the muscle contracting stronger than if it had not been introduced. We had three frog legs. The controll group was the three frog legs before their injection of sodium. The frog legs became the experimental group once the injection was carried out. The experimental group showed no stronger contraction forces once they were injected with sodium which did not support our hypothesis. The results from the statistical test indicated that our results were insignificent. 

Introduction:
In this lab, we isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg to demonstrate the basic properties of neuromuscular controll. The sciatic nerve is the longest and largest nerve in the body and measures three quarters of an inch in width. It originates in the lower back in a network of nerves called the sacral plexus. The sciatic nerve enables movement and feeling in the legs. [Eidelson: 2018] The gastrocnemus is the calf muscle which the sciatic nerve stimulates. Na+ or sodium has a direct relationship in the creation of all action potentials in all muscles including the gastrocnemus. Sodium creates a charged membrane which allows for the creation of action potentials and without it we would not be able to send neural impulses. The controll in this experiment is the contraction force in the frog legs that are not yet injected with sodium. The independent variable is the force of the contraction and the dependent variable is the injection of sodium (Na+). Considering the relationship sodium shares with the creation of action potentials, we predict that with the introduction of sodium into the muscle will result in the muscle to contracting stronger than when not introduced. 

Materials and Method:
To test if there is a relationship between the introduction of sodium (Na+) and the strength of a contraction we have to first dissect the frog leg. The procedure must be done carefully to make sure no nerve tissue or muscle tissue is torn. The same dissection will be done to each frog including the removal of the skin and the apical detachment of the gastrocnemus. With each of the frog legs we will first record their contractions without the dependent variable and then proceed to inject .1 Ml of sodium and then record the contraction force. We will record our observations and measurements on the first three controll frog legs and the observations and measurements on the three experimental frog legs in order to determine if sodium influences neuromuscular controll. To statistically test our results, we will engage a one-tailed paired t_test. 



Results:
The statistical test results indicate that the P value was equal to .7037777 which is greater than .5 thus our results are insignificent. (Table 2). Table Two shows the average difference between the two points, .013333, and the other statistical test values. There was a  very small amount of change in the contraction of the muscles when observing solely its movements. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that our group created was not supported. Looking at the data in the able we only see one leg, leg 2, experience stronger force contractions when injected with sodium. The other legs experienced either the same force or a slightly weaker one. The statistical test we performed also told us that our results were insignificent indicating that we must accept the null hypothesis which is that the injection of sodium suddenly into a muscle does not affect the strength of the muscles contraction. The conclusion that the injection of sodium into a muscle does not affect the force of the contraction makes sense because once the membrane of an axon is depolarizing it cant force another repeated action potential. Action Potentials also have a threshold meaning that once the threshold is reached the action potential is fired it must depolarize. The only thing the injection of sodium will do is prevent the muscle from fully repolarizing, resulting in in the firing of a weaker response. We see this happening in all the frog legs. There are instances where the experimental frog leg expelled a larger force contraction  especially in the beginning. These small force contractions are the last contractions that the muscle can produce until it must repolarize and thus the force decreases. Overall, we observe that there is no relationship between the addition of sodium and the strength of a contraction.
