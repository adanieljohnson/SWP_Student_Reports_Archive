Title: Juvenile Hormone Mimic causes stunted growth and instar-transition inhibition in Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, we looked at Manduca Sexta, or the tobacco hornworm caterpillar to test the effects of Juvenile Hormone, by using G-Regulator, on the size and stage of the caterpillars. Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone are hormones that affect growth in tobacco hornworms, and together they initiate pupation and instar changes in the caterpillars. We hypothesized that hormone provision every other day, will cause treated caterpillars to grow larger than the controll caterpillars, and that the treated caterpillars would not pupate. Both groups were fed the same amount of food, but every other day, the treatment group received G-Regulator, a JH mimic, in their food. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in size between the treatment and controll groups, but we rejected the null-hypothesis that there would be no pupation difference between the two groups. Pupation was initiated in the controll group, but prevented in the treatment group. We see that manipulation and administration of growth hormones, can inhibit, or at least postpone caterpillars’ from becoming adult moths. Looking forward, hormones in insects can be manipulated to prevent pest issues in adult forms.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, a homometabolous insect [Johnson: 2018], is often used as a model organism in scientific experiments. It is considered a strong model organism due to its relatively quick life cycle and rapid transition of life stages. The size and inner functions of the tobacco hornworm are easily measured compared to those of other species [Davidowitz: 2006].  These important inner functions occur when input in the nervous and endocrine systems affect the brain’s response to the bodily functions in the form of output signals. These output signals take the form of brain-derived hormones and can affect growth, development, behavior, and physiology of the specimen [Johnson: 2018]. Then, activation and organization effects work together to respond to the environment within the endocrine and physiological systems [Johnson: 2018]. As we take a closer look into the endocrine system, we see that the main hormones influencing growth in Manduca Sexta are Prothoracicotropic, Ecdysterone, and Juvenile Hormone. In our experiment, we focused on the cooperation between Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (JH) within the organisms. Ecdysterone, effects the timing of the molting process. Juvenile Hormone controlls and maintains the kind of molting that occurs in Manduca Sexta. When JH levels begin to drop between the 4th and 5th instar, ecdysterone levels rise. Together these hormones initiate the commitment pulse which indicates that the caterpillar is large and nourished enough to pupate and become an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. Weight gain occurs so that the organism is physically prepared as well as hormonally prepared to carry out this next stage. The commitment pulse launches a set of behavioral, genetic, morphological, and physiological changes. Physiologically the caterpillars will begin to dark to a yellow-brownish color preceding pupation [Johnson: 2018]. Other experiments, including a case study on the effects of flossflower, containing a JH mimic, prevented pupation in the caterpillars when the hormone was given in moderation. It also caused the treated larvae to grow [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, we looked at Manduca Sexta to test the effects of Juvenile Hormone, through administering G-Regulator, on the size and stage of the caterpillars. We hypothesized that when provided with the hormone every other day, the treated caterpillars would grow larger in size compared to the controll caterpillars. We also hypothesized that the treated caterpillars would not pupate.


Materials and Method:
We first, put aside two identical plastic bins, with four compartments in each bin. One bin was labelled “Control” and the other “Treatment”. We then, weighed and recorded the weights of each caterpillar, in grams, labelling each with a unique number and randoMly assigning them to the treatment or controll group. We also recorded the physical characteristics of the caterpillars. Each group was provided with 10g of food which was placed in their respective compartments. Before placing the treatment group’s food inside their compartments, we added 5 drops of G-regulator to each serving, using a pipet and mixing the hormone into the food. We then put tops on the bins and placed the bins in the incubator. Everyday, we replaced 10g of food and cleaned the bins of waste and leftover food using a wet paper towel. While cleaning, we obtained a third bin with four compartments and placed the caterpillars in the extra bin. We repeated the weighing and recording of physical characteristics of the caterpillars each day. The difference was that every other day, the treatment group received 5 drops of G-regulator in their food, while the controll group received the same amount of food without hormones. Statistically, we ran a two-sample, two-tailed t_test comparing the means of the treatment and controll groups’ size difference between the first day, and the day of the largest average sizes of each group prospectively.


Results:
The average change in size from the first day to the peak day of the controll group was 10.225 mg +/- 1.701g. The average change in size from the beginning to peak day of the treatment group was 10.954g +/- of 2.567g. There were 6 degrees of freedom. The t-value obtained from the two-tailed, two-sample t_test was 1.194. The P-value of the one-tailed t_test was 0.139. The P-value of the two-tailed t_test was 0.278. Qualitatively, the controll caterpillars (Figure 2) turned a yellowish-brown prior to pupation. The treatment caterpillars turned a lighter shade of blue (Figure 3).

Discussion:
We had hypothesized that the treatment group would be larger in size compared to the controll group, and that the treatment group would not pupate. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that there will be no difference in size or physical appearance between the treatment and controll group because of the high P value of the two-tailed test. However, our hypothesis partially aligned with our results as we hypothesized that the treatment group would not pupate over the course of the two weeks, and none of the caterpillars in the treatment group pupated. It makes sense that the treatment group did not experience a drop-off in weight, because by regularly receiving the JH, the treatment group’s hormone levels did not drop low enough to reach commitment pulse. Without the commitment pulse the larvae would be unable to enter pupation [Johnson:2018]. When the controll group started to pupate around day 9, the mean weight decreased suggesting that during pupation, the caterpillars are lighter than in they are as larvae. Since the treatment group never reached a definitive“peak” in terms of weight, it is possible that the peak would eventually happen, but we did not capture it in our experimental time frame. It can also mean that the treatment may not end up pupating all. After all, the treatment group did not turn yellow like the pupated controll caterpillar. Secondly, in the case study, the group that received flossflower with G-regulator was larger when the G-regulator in the food was present, but at a lower percentage. Our results that the treatment group was larger in size than the controll group is consistent with the previous Flossflower study. By successfully preventing pupation in the treatment group, it is possible that JH hormone can be manipulated in insects to prevent pest issues in crops and the agricultural world.
