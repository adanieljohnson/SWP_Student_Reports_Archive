Title: Comparing the Effects of 2,4-D and Paraquat Herbicides on Electron Transport

Abstract:
This experiment aimed to determine the differences in the herbicidal effects of two solutions, paraquat and 2,4-D. It was hypothesized that paraquat would be the more effective electron transport inhibitor based on its electron accepting capabilities. The experiment was designed by creating three groups, one controll and one of each herbicide, in solution with Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts and electron accepting molecule DCPIP, which changed colors when reduced. The absorbance was taken over a period of 30 minutes, and this data was analyzed to show statistical significance between 2,4-D and the controll, but not between any other groups. This led us to reject our hypothesis, as it was clear that 2,4-D had the most impact on the rate of electron transport. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, protists, and select bacteria to harvest energy. Photosynthetic activity in complex plant cells happens in organelles known as chloroplasts. Photosynthesis involves coupled reduction-oxidation reactions, which create an electrical current. This electrical current causes a proton gradient, which provides the energy necessary for ATP synthesis. The coupled redox reactions make up the “electron transport chain”. In nature, the electron transport chain uses the electron-carrying molecules NADH and NADPH. In this experiment, we will use DCIP, as it makes a distinct and measurable color change when it is reduced. Therefore, we can measure the rate of electron transport by measuring absorbance. The first two stages of photosynthesis are light-dependent​ and are referred to as photosystems I and II. The third stage of photosynthesis is not light dependent. Herbicides are solutions that can be used to alter photosynthesis. Herbicides can act through numerous mechanisms at any stage of photosynthesis. A study conducted in 1975 showed that 11 herbicides acted through two different mechanisms to slow photosynthetic activity. Five of the herbicides acted before illumination began, and six of the herbicides acted only post-illumination (Alsop, Moreland. 1975). In this experiment, we will compare the effects of two different common herbicides, paraquat and 2.4-D, on the rate of electron transport in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea (commonly known as spinach). Spinach is an ideal model for monitoring electron transport rates as it is very easy to isolate and enrich the chloroplasts in spinach. Paraquat is an electron-acceptor, so it will act by inhibiting the electron transport chain  (Fukushima, et al. 1993). The herbicide 2.4-D is an auxin-type herbicide, so it has a much different mechanism of inhibition, affecting the plant signaling molecule auxin to slow the plant from transporting effectively (Mann, et al. 1965.). We predict that the herbicide paraquat will have a greater effect on slowing down the rate of electron transport in spinach, which will lead to lower absorbance rates. This is likely to occur because paraquat has a direct effect on the transport of electrons within chloroplasts.

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, we directly compared both herbicides to a controll group of chloroplasts with no herbicides present in solution. To set up the experiment, we obtained four spinach leaves that were provided in the lab. In order to isolate the chloroplasts, we placed the four leaves in a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of buffer solution (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), and grinded to a slurry. We then added an additional 10 Ml of buffer solution, and continued to grind. We then strained the solution through a cheesecloth and collected the liquid. The liquid was spun in a centrifuge for 3 minutes at 1200 rotations per minute. We then spun the chloroplast suspension in at 2800 rotations per minute for 10 minutes. The pellet from the second spin was used for the remainder of the experiment. We labelled 13 test tubes, one blank, four controll tubes (labelled #1-4), four tubes with paraquat (labelled #5-8), and four tubes with the herbicide 2,4-d (labelled #9-12). To the blank, only 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) was added. To test tubes #1-4, we added 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. To tubes #5-8, we added 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of paraquat. To tubes #9-12, we added 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of 2.4-d. Once the tubes were ready, we added 100 μl of our enriched chloroplasts to each tube. We then transferred a small amount of each mixture to cuvettes, blanked the spectrophotometer (set at 600 nm), and measured and recorded the absorbance of each solution. We placed each tube under alight and allowed them to sit for ten minutes. After ten minutes, we measured the absorbances again, and calculated the percent change between the initial absorbance and the absorbance after ten minutes. We then repeated this step at 20 minutes and at 30 minutes. After we had recorded all of our data, we used multiple two-tailed t_test in order to determine whether or not there was statistical significance between the controll group and herbicide groups. The t_test was performed with the paraquat group and the controll group, as well as the 2,4-D group and the controll group, and finally, between the paraquat group and the 2,4-D group. The values used for the t_test were the values calculated for the total percent change between zero minutes and 30 minutes.

Results:
Statistical test: Two-tailed t_test
	The t_test that was performed on the paraquat and controll groups showed no statistical significance between the means of each group (p value = 0.0699, d.f. = 3, t stat = -2.764). The t_test that was performed for the 2,4-D group and the controll group did show statistical significance (p value = 0.0147, d.f. = 3, t stat = -5.087). The t_test between the paraquat and 2,4-D groups also showed no statistical significance (p = 0.054, d.f. = 3, t stat = -3.084). 


In figure one, all three groups show a trend of a lower absorbance over time. The absorbance in the controll group was initially higher than both herbicide groups. After 30 minutes, the herbicide 2,4-D was much higher than that of the controll and the paraquat herbicide groups. In figure two, the percent change of 2,4-D was much lower than the percent change of the paraquat and controll groups. The controll group was higher than the paraquat group, but the percent change at 20 and 30 minutes of the controll group was nearly the exact same. 


Discussion:
	The results of this experiment show that it is likely that each herbicide, paraquat and 2,4-D, have different mechanisms of inhibiting plant growth. This data is somewhat concurrent with the data found in the 1975 experiment (Alsop, Moreland. 1975.) The data shows that 2,4-D had more impact on the rate of electron transport than did paraquat. By referencing figure 1, it is clear that the paraquat group and the controll group have very similar representations on the graph. The absorbance of the 2,4-D group remained much higher than the absorbances of the controll group and the paraquat group (figure 1). The paraquat and controll group were both allowing DCPIP to be reduced, while the 2,4-D group was not. The t_test determined that there was statistical significance between the 2,4-D and the controll, but not between the paraquat and the controll, or the 2,4-D and the paraquat. The paraquat was essentially less effective than the 2,4-D at inhibiting electron transport. This means that we must reject our hypothesis, considering that we predicted paraquat to be the more effective inhibitor of electron transport. This rejection could be explained in a number of ways. DCPIP could have been a much more efficient electron acceptor than paraquat, 2,4-D could have been a more efficient inhibitor of electron transport, etc. (Fukushima, et al. 1993.). However, we were correct in assuming that paraquat and 2,4-D acted through different mechanisms, as it is safe to assume that if both herbicides acted through identical mechanisms, the results of this experiment would have been much more similar. Therefore, our results do concur with The Alsop and Moreland experiment from 1975. In terms of real-world​ application, this does not mean that 2,4-D is a better herbicide than paraquat, only that it is a better inhibitor of electron transport. If you wished to determine which was a better herbicide, there are several other factors that would need to be considered, and a much different experiment would need to be designed. This concept of herbicidal effects on Spinacia oleracea could be taken in a number of different directions and could be monitored at all stages of photosynthesis.
