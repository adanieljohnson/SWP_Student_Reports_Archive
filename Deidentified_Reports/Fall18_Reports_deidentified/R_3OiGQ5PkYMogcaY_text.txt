Title: Effects of juvenile hormone analog on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
Regulation of hormones is important in controllling growth and development in biology. Pesticides often include insect growth regulators to controll the insectâ€™s progression through its life cycle and stages of growth. In this experiment, we look at the growth of Manduca sexta larvae in response to the introduction of an analog to juvenile hormone. The expectation was that the analog would increase the growth of Manduca sexta larvae due to the inhibition of pupation caused by the presence of juvenile hormone. Our data demonstrated no significent difference in the weight and length of larvae that received the analog and larvae that did not receive the analog. When observing the growth of both groups and the pupation of the controll group, difference in growth is more likely to appear at the 5th instar rather than through the entirety of the larvae stage.

Introduction:
The topic of interest of this experiment is the effects of hormones and insect growth regulators in insect development. Hormones are crucial in the growth and development, and they play important roles in the molting and metamorphosis of insects. The tobacco hornworm, or Manduca sexta, is a species that has four stages of development: egg/embryo, larva, pupa, and adult. In order to move from one stage to the next, Manduca sexta must undergo the molting process. Juvenile hormone (JH) is produced by the corpus allata, and it lays a crucial role in regulating growth, development, and molting in many insects, including the Manduca sexta. JH levels are high during the larval stage of the Manduca sexta, but they decrease as the larva enters the pupal stage [Weeks: 2003]. JH allows the larva to continue growth until it is large enough to enter the pupal stage. JH levels fall when the larva has growth the appropriate size, which triggers pupation. High levels of JH inhibit the secretion of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). During the 5th instar, or the final instar of the larval stage, the corpus allata stops production of JH, and PTTH is secreted [Nijhout, Williams: 1974]. The presence of PTTH triggers the secretion of ecdysone (20E), which is present in high amounts in the pupal stage of development [Weeks: 2003]. Precor, or methoprene, is a JH analog that is typically used as an insecticide. Precor is an insect growth regulator (IGR) because it alters the regulatory processes of hormones that are necessary in the natural development of insects such as the Manduca sexta [Tunaz, Uygun: 2004]. Precor mimics JH. Therefore, Precor is expected to prevent the Manduca sexta caterpillars from maturing into the pupal stage. If the analog of juvenile hormone Precor is reintroduced in the larva stage of the Manduca sexta, growth of the larva will increase without progression into the pupal stage.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of varying weights and lengths were selected and divided into two groups with four caterpillars in each. Two containers, each with four compartments, were used as the rearing containers, and each caterpillar was placed in its own rearing compartment. Holes were punctured into each compartment to allow air flow. Four caterpillars in the controll group were given 10 g of food with 5 drops of water. Four caterpillars in the experimental group were given 10 g of food with 5 drops of the juvenile hormone analog, Precor. All caterpillars were stored in the same incubator under the same conditions. All caterpillars were weighed and measured every day for a period of 12 days using a standard balance and ruler. The caterpillars were fed every 2 to 3 days. A two-sample t_test was used to determine differences in weight and length between the controll group and the experimental group.

Results:
The mean weight of the controll group was 3.97 g, and the mean weight of the experimental group was 4.86 g (Fig. 1). The mean length of the controll group was 5.25 cm, and the mean length of the controll group was 5.81 cm (Fig. 2). The standard deviation for weight of the controll group was 0.98, and the standard deviation for weight of the experimental group was also 0.98 (Fig. 1). The standard deviation for length of the controll group was 0.61, and the standard deviation for length of the experimental group was 0.38 (Fig. 2). We used the two-sample t_test to statistically analyze our data. The means of the weight of the controll group and experimental group were not significently different (t_stat = 0.71094, d.f.= 22, P= 0.24). The means of the length of the controll group and experimental group were also not significently different (t_stat = 1.04364, d.f.= 22, P= 0.15). The hurricane prevented us from collecting data for days 9, 10, and 11. When observing the caterpillars on the final day of the experiment, we noticed that our controll group was developing a brown exterior, while the experimental group remained the same bright green coloring. The weight and length of the pupating caterpillars was smaller than the controll group (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Prior to day 9, both groups had the same pattern of growth.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of a JH analog would increase the growth of the larva was unsupported. From our data, we observed no significent difference between the growth of the controll and experimental groups. Our observations support that the JH analog, Precor, prevents pupation because our controll group was observed to be entering the pupal stage, while our experimental group did not display any signs of transitioning. However, our measurements of weight and length did not have a p_value under 0.05, indicating that the addition of Precor into the diets of Manduca sexta at the larval stage does not influence size. Our findings suggest that Precor only inhibits the progression into the pupal stage with no effect on growth and size. However, our inability to collect data during the hurricane may have affected our results and observations. Our data in the last four days may suggest a difference in growth at late in the larvae stage during the 5th instar, but this also may be attributed to the normal shrinking of the caterpillar as it enters the pupal stage. Understanding how juvenile hormone analogs influence the growth and development of Manduca sexta larvae could further our understanding of insect growth regulators and the effects of such regulators on the insect.
