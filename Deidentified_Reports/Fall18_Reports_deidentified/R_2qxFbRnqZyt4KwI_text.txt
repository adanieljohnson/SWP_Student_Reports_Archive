Title: An Analysis of the Effects of Different pH Levels on Percent Change of Photosynthetic Activity in Spinach Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effect of different pH levels on percent change of photosynthetic activity of spinach chloroplasts. It was hypothesized that the chloroplasts incubated in a pH of 6.5 would have the highest photosynthetic activity while the other two pH levels’ activity would be decreased to the negative effects of the pH on the cell’s ability to undergo photosynthesis. The chloroplasts were separated the from the other materials and debris that make up the spinach cell using a fast and slow centrifuge spin. They were then separated into three groups and treated with pH buffers of 2.0, 6.5, and 10.0. The chloroplasts were centrifuged again after being incubated in the pH buffers in order to then removed the buffers and the samples were split into three groups of test tubes as part of a Hills Reaction. Each absorbency was taken at time zero using the spectrophotometer set at 600nm, and after thirty minutes, the absorbencies were taken again and recorded as data. A t-test was used to analyze our results, and with a p-value of less than 0.05, it was determined that our data is statistically significant and the original hypothesis was accepted.


Introduction:
It is necessary for every living organism to have a way to harvest energy to carry out its daily metabolic processes. Humans as well as plants and the smallest bacteria have specific ways that they take in energy and convert it to a usable form. There are three possible sources of energy for living things: chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as a redox potential, or the formation of a type of electrical or chemical gradient created across a membrane’s bilayer [Munekage: 2004]. Plants, some protists, and certain bacteria capture energy from the sunlight, and use photosynthesis, glycolysis, and respiration to transfer and then release that energy into a form that they can use [Johnson: 2018]. Chlorophyll in the chloroplasts of a spinach leave, for example, is the site for photosynthesis because they are able to absorb solar radiation. In this experiment, we will find the density of chloroplasts in spinach leaves and determine the plant’s photosynthetic reduction activity using the Hills Reaction after soaking the chloroplasts in three different pH levels: 2, 6.5, and 10 [Munekage: 2004]. Based on the absorbance given off by 2, o-dichlorophenol indophenol, we will be able to measure electron transfer reactions that occur on a cellular level while photosynthesis is occurring. We hypothesize that the chloroplast treated at the middle pH level of 6.5 will have the highest amount of photosynthetic activity while the pH levels of 2 and 10 will have much lower amounts of photosynthetic activity due to the fact that proteins begin to denature at pH levels that are either too acidic or too basic for them to function properly.


Materials and Methods:
First, we packed a mortar and pestle, a beaker, and test tubes into ice to cool. We removed the central veins from our spinach leaves and rinsed and then dried each leaf. After putting our cleaned leaves into the mortar, we added 20ml cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine Buffer at a pH of 8.0) and began to grind it until we had a thick paste with no large pieces left. Then, we strained this through three layers of cheesecloth. We the liquid into a 50ml centrifuge tube, A, which we put in the centrifuge along with a balance tube. We did the first spin at 200xG for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After the spin, we poured the supernatant into our second 50ml centrifuge tube, B, and left the pellet in tube A. We centrifuged tube B, again with a balance tube, but this time, at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. When the second spin was done, we poured the supernatant of “B” out into a new 50ml tube marked “C” and added 15ml grinding buffer to tube B and stirred gently with a pipet in order to re-suspend the pellet. We took the sample B pellet that we had just re-suspended and split it into three 50ml centrifuge tubes. We added 5ml of appropriate pH buffer (pHs of 2, 6.5, and 10) to each of the tubes. After 10 minutes of the chloroplasts incubating in the pH buffers at room temperature, we centrifuged these three tubes at 1,000xG for 5 minutes in order to remove the pH buffers. Finally, we poured out the supernatant and re-suspended each of the pellets by adding 5ml of cooled grinding buffer. We split each of these tubes into three test tubes in order to complete three different trials for each pH level. We had one blank tube in which we put 8ml of water, no DCIP, and 2ml of Reaction Buffer. In tubes 1-3 we tested a negative control in which we had no chloroplasts, 6ml of water, 2ml of 130mM DCIP, and 2ml of Reaction Buffer. In tubes 4-12, we had 6ml water, 2ml 130mM DCIP, 2ml Reaction buffer, and the respective pH level chloroplasts. After preparing the triplicated of the tubes as described above, we turned on the spectrophotometer and set it to read at 600nm. Finally ready to begin the assay, we added 100l of chloroplasts to the blank and tubes 4-12 and mixed the tubes. We transferred each mixture to cuvettes, blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm, and took and recorded absorbencies for each tube. Then, we let the test tubes sit on a sunny window sill for thirty minutes, re-took the absorbencies for the last time, and recorded the data. We used a one-tailed t-test to statistically analyze our data to figure out whether the results were significant.


Results:
In order to obtain our results, we took the percent change of our absorbencies for each test tube and averaged them. In general, there was a very clear distinction between the chloroplasts that were soaked in a pH 6.5 buffer and all the other tubes, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1 shows that the pH 6.5 buffer chloroplasts had a percent change of almost 90% meaning there was a high rate and amount of photosynthetic activity. Meanwhile, the chloroplasts that had been incubated in pH 2 and 10 buffers both had percent change of photosynthetic activity below 5%, almost no change. Surprisingly, the negative control which did not have any chloroplasts present had a middle value for its percent change at 17.4%. We used a statistical t-test to determine if our results were statistically significant. Our p-value was less than 0.05 which means that this data is statistically significant.

Discussion:
Overall, this experiment was successful as our data supported our original hypothesis which stated that the chloroplasts incubated in a pH 6.5 buffer would have normal photosynthetic activity while the chloroplasts that were exposed to the pH 2 and pH 10 buffer will have very low photosynthetic activity as the proteins that take part in this process will denature and be unable to carry out the reaction. The percent change for the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts incubated in a pH 6.5 buffer was just under 90%, meaning that it had a high amount of activity during the 30 minutes that we left it to undergo photosynthesis. The chloroplasts that were treated with the pH 2 buffer had a percent change of just above 1% while those that were treated with pH 10 buffer had a percent change of just below 5%. These very low levels of photosynthetic activity make sense because these pH levels are too acidic and too basic for any enzymes and proteins to be able to undergo any metabolic processes [Liu: 2008]. Our negative control had a percent change of photosynthetic activity of about 17% which is higher than both of the percent changes of the two of the pH levels tested. The fact that our results are statistically significant is important in nature because of the detrimental effects that phenomena like pollution and acid rain can have on living organisms. As show in one experiment, “Photosynthetic rates in Platanus were reduced after exposure to [simulated] rain of pH 2.0” and similar results have been found in numerous other studies [Neufeld 1985]. If low pH levels destroy plants growth and ability to function, this could potentially have a large impact on the crop industry, for example, if it were exposed to this type of phenomena. It would be interesting to do this experiment again, but with a narrower range of pH levels tested. We have already found that photosynthetic activity is effected by different pH levels, however, using pH levels that are closer to a pH of 6.5 would allow us to asses just how impactful pH level are on photosynthesis.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure shows the effect of the different pH levels on the percent change of photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts. It is evident that there was the highest amount of photosynthesis at a pH of 6.5, while tubes with pHs of 2 and 10 and with no chloroplasts greatly decreased the amount of photosynthesis that occurred.
