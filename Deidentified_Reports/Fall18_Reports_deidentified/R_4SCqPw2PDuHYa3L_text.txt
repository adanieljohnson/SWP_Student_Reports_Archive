Title: The Effect of Seltzer Water on Photosynthesis as Measured by Absorbance due to Reduction of DCIP

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a vital process that includes converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose in the presence of sunlight.  Chloroplasts were isolated and suspended in both carbonated water and distilled water in order to analyze the differences in absorbance based on the reduction of DCIP.  The carbonated water did not statistically significently show a decrease in the percent change of absorbance when compared to distilled water.  This finding disagreed with our hypothesis as well as previous studies that were completed looking at the effect of CO2 on photosynthetic processes.  In a larger perspective, CO2 from the globe can affect photosynthesis; in today’s time, global warming from increased human activity may negatively affect photosynthesis in plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is used by plants in order to capture and store energy from the sun.  The stored energy is harnessed by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and respiration occurring in the mitochondria.  Photosynthesis is one of the most important metabolic processes carried out by living organisms.  Photosynthetic processes involve many reduction and oxidation reactions, pump protons across a lipid bilayer generating a proton gradient which synthesizes ATP.  Electrons are also transferred onto carrier molecules so that the electrons can be used in other reactions.
	A simple equation for photosynthesis is shown by: 6 CO2 + 12H2O  C6H12O2 + 6 H2O + 6 O2.  An important and crucial component of the reaction is sunlight, which drives the reaction.  It also requires chlorophyll, Mn2+ ions, several electron transport complexes, and an intact phospholipid bilayer so the proton gradient can be produced.  During a photosynthetic reaction, the chlorophyll function to absorb light.  The electrons are excited by this light which prompts them to leave the carrier molecules; water is then cleaved by a triggered reaction in order to release electrons to replace the electrons that left to create the proton gradient.  Lastly, the electrons on NADPH and the ATP are used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon CO2 molecules.  Photosynthesis occurs in three stages:  the first two reactions are known as the light-dependent which use absorbed protons to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH.  The light-dependent reactions also create the proton gradient used to synthesize ATP.  The enzyme RUBISCO used ATP and NADPH to combine 1-carbon CO2 molecules with 5-carbon ribulose phosphate molecules to create 6-carbon glucose molecules.
	Photosynthesis will be altered if unfamiliar solutions are added to plants.  For example, carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis, as shown previously, to produce glucose and ATP, the energy currency of the cell.  Too much or not enough carbon dioxide will have an abnormal effect on the plant’s growth as well as the photosynthetic processes.  We hypothesize that if we add carbonated water to the chloroplasts of spinach leaves, the CO2 will combine with RUBISCO and reduced NADPH.  This will then combine ribose and glucose at a quicker rate so photosynthesis will increase.  In a recent study, researchers looked at the effects of CO2 on photosynthesis in tomato plants; results showed that the carbon dioxide increased the rate of photosynthesis [Lanoue: 2018].  In terms of absorbance, if photosynthesis increases, the absorbance will decrease.  Therefore, since CO2 is a reagent in the reaction of photosynthesis, the increased amounts of carbon dioxide from carbonated water will drive the reaction to produce more glucose in order to achieve equilibrium.
	To measure the rate of photosynthesis, DCIP can be used as an alternative to NADP+ because it is also an electron accepter.  When DCIP is reduced, it turns from blue to colorless.

Materials and Method:
We placed a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to make it cold.  We removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and rinsed remaining leaf pieces with tap water.  Excess moisture was dabbed from the leaves. Once the mortar and pestle were cold, it was dried it, and the spinach leaves were added.  We added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  The spinach was grinded until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves remaining.  We then added an extra 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed with the spinach slurry, and strained all of the green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the cold beaker.  We transferred the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged it at 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  A balance tube was included in the centrifuge.  We poured the supernatant out of the tube into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube.  We were careful NOT to transfer the debris at the bottom of the centrifuged tube.  We centrifuged the 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  The supernatant was poured into a clean 50 Ml tube without disturbing the pellet.  We added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the undisturbed pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet.  We placed 10 Ml of the re-suspended chloroplasts and 10 Ml of distilled water in a 50 Ml tube.  In another 50 Ml conical tube, we placed 10 Ml of the re-suspended chloroplasts and 10 Ml of seltzer water.   Both 50 Ml tubes were centrifuged at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  We poured off the supernatant and re-suspended both chloroplast pellets by putting 10 Ml of grinding buffer in each tube. 
8 large test tubes were labeled as shown below, and placed in a tube rack.  We turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to measure at 600nm.  We prepared 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes, but only 2 test tubes of the blank.
Once test tubes were prepared, we added 200 μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepared previously to all tubes.  The chloroplasts suspended with distilled water were placed in the 3 test tubes labeled “Chloroplasts, with Distilled Water” as well as one of the blank tubes.  The chloroplasts suspended with seltzer water were placed in the 3 test tubes labeled “Chloroplasts, with Seltzer Water” as well as the other blank tube.  Each tube was mixed immediately after adding chloroplasts, and then transferred to cuvettes.  We immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm using the corresponding blank tube.  Then, we immediately measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm.  These were Time Zero data points.  After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer with Sample 0 and measured the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm.  After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total), we blanked the spectrophotometer, and measured the absorbance a second time for each sample.  After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) we blanked the spectrophotometer again and measured absorbance one more time for all samples.  These results were then compared using an independent one-tailed t_test, with equal variance, in order to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between chloroplasts treated with carbonated water and chloroplasts treated with distilled water.


Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the carbonated water decreased the percent change of absorbance measured at 600 nm.  However, based on statistical results, the carbonated water did not show a statistically significent decrease in the percent change in absorbance when compared to distilled water (t = 1.065, d.f. = 5, p = 0.17).  The means of percent change for distilled water are as follows:  16.39, SD = 0.11 at 10 minutes, 31.44, SD = 0.17 at 20 minutes, and 45.15, SD = 0.23 at 30 minutes.  The means of percent change for carbonated water are as follows:  11.53, SD = 0.06 at 10 minutes, 22.77, SD = 0.05 at 20 minutes, and 27.95, SD = 0.06 at 30 minutes.  


Discussion:
As shown in Figure 1, our hypothesis was not supported- we hypothesized that the increased carbon dioxide from the carbonated water would increase the rate of photosynthesis which would cause the percent change in absorbance to be much higher for carbonated water than for distilled water.  However, as shown in the results, the carbonated water had a lower percent change on absorbance than the distilled water, but it was not statistically lower.  The decreased percent change of absorbance indicated that less photosynthetic activity occurred.  This finding completely contradicts our original assumptions as well as a recently completed study.  This study showed that increased CO2 in Rice npp1 caused the plant to display rapid growth [Inomata: 2018].  Although our results do not agree with previous studies completed by measuring the effects of CO2 on photosynthesis, we can assume that excess CO2 does still have an effect on the photosynthetic activity in plants.  Globally, CO2 may become an even greater problem due to global warming; therefore, it is important to consider the effects of carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis.
