Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Insect Growth Hormones are hormones in insects that affect development. In Manduca Sexta insects, juvenile hormone(JH) and E-20 regulate development and eventual growth into an adult. Our experiment was designed around determining if increased JH would keep the larvae at a larval stage and allow it to grow larger before adulthood. The caterpillars in the treatment group were fed food with artificial JH, along with a control group who received food with no added supplement. The experiment was unsuccessful in determining whether the JH made them grow larger over the same amount of time. However, based on visual observation, it was clear that the JH had an effect on the insects development. This observation being that the treatment group remained bright in color, while the control group began molting and entering their final stages of development before adulthood. Overall, the experiment failed to support our hypothesis, but it did prove that increasing JH will prevent the larvae from developing at a normal rate.

Introduction:
Hormones often have powerful influence in nature. This influence can range from growth, to inciting actions. In insects, such as the Manduca Sexta, juvenile hormone and E-20 are the main developmental hormones. E-20 regulates timing of molting during development while juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during development. These hormones are considered Insect Growth Regulators (IGR’s). The first observation of IGR’s was accidental. Lab grown linden bugs were placed on paper towels that unknowingly contained juvabione ;an IGR compound. This resulted in failing of the insect to reach adulthood[Tunaz: 2004]. Recognizing the significant effect of IGR hormones from this discover, we will be experimenting on the effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca Sexta’s development. This experiment will involve increasing levels of juvenile hormone in the larvae through placement of imitation hormone in their food source and observing its effects. We hypothesize that increased JH levels will retain the caterpillars in a juvenile state and increase total growth before adulthood.

Materials and Methods:
In order to conduct this experiment,8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars were separated into two 4-cell containers. Each getting their own cell. Caterpillars 1-4 are a part of the treatment group, while caterpillars 5-8 are a part of the control group. In the treatment group, their food was treated with 4-6 drops of hormone. Their food was treated with the JH-mimic hormone every other day of food replenishment. Every day, the caterpillars were weighed and the weight was recorded for monitoring their total growth. After compiling all data collecting during the two week period, a one-tail two-sample T-test with an alpha(α) value of 0.05 was used to determine if the results for the control and treatment group were significantly different. This will allow us to determine whether the results collected from the treatment group were out of coincidence, or there was a significant difference.

Results:
It was observed that the experimental group had much brighter green color compared to the control group which was beginning to turn brown; an indicator of molting. The treatment group exhibited a numerical difference from the control group in terms of average growth rate. The average overall weight change for the control group and treatment group was 6.17g and 6.97g, respectively(Figure 1.). Placing the average weights displayed in Figure 1 into a graph yields Figure 2. Based on a  single-tail two-sample t-test using the data in Figure 1,(t=-0.387; PVal=0.351 ) we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

Discussion:
The purpose of the lab was to determine whether increasing the juvenile hormone(JH) in Manduca Sexta caterpillars would make them remain in a larval stage and grow larger; similar in the strength of effect that juvabione had on the linden bugs when IGR’s were first discovered[Tunaz: 2004].  Unfortunately, our experiment was not long enough to come to a strong conclusion. Based on our two-sample t-test, our hypothesis was not supported . There is not strong enough evidence to show that the JH allowed the treatment group to grow larger and remain in the larval stage despite empirical evidence indicating that the treatment group had a higher average growth rate. However, based on visual observation, it was clear that the JH was having an effect. It kept the treatment group in a younger stage of development throughout the course of the experiment. The treatment group remained bright green as they continued to grow, while the control group appeared to begin its final molting stage; indicated by their brownish color. Although our hypothesis about continued growth could not be supported, based on the visual observation, it did suspend the treatment group in a continual larval state. This experiment can be improved and yield stronger results by increasing the amount of JH as well as extending the length of the experiment to at least a month. I believe this would yield stronger data that better supports our hypothesis.
