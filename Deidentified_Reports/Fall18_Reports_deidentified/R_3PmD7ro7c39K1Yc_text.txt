Title: The Effects of Precor on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
	Insect growth regulators (IGRs) have become an effective mechanism for pest controll as they target the development of insects by causing abnormalities in hormones that inhibit their chance for survival. We examined the effects of an insect growth regulator, Precor, which raises levels of juvenile hormone (JH) in holometabolous insects. We tested the hypothesis that the juvenile hormone analog, Precor, would increase the growth of Manduca sexta. In our study we compared the growth of two groups of Manduca sexta larva. One group received a diet with Precor solution added, while the other received a normal diet with no Precor. While the results showed greater growth in the group treated with Precor, the difference in growth was not significent enough to conclude that the Precor had affected the growth of the treatment group. The results however, did reveal that none of the Manduca sexta treated with Precor did not pupate, while all of the surviving subjects in the controll group reached the pupal stage. The result helped shape ideas for future studies, that would examine the effect of Precor on the rate of pupation within a larger sample.

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are an emerging approach to insect pest controll that differ from traditional insecticides. IGRs use substances that can adversely affect the growth and development of insects by causing abnormalities that reduce insect survival. The Manduca sexta, is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. In its holometabolous life cycle, it undergoes metamorphosis after transitioning from the larval to the pupal stage. In order for this transition to occur the Manduca sexta must reach the commitment pulse, a signal that tells the larva it is ready to pupate. The Manduca sexta caterpillar must be large enough with enough stored nutrients to complete the next step in development. A hormone that plays an important role in Manduca sexta development is juvenile hormone (JH), which is important for facilitating early growth. At the start of development in the larval phase the Manduca sexta produces large amounts of JH to stimulate rapid growth. As it progresses through the larval stage and nears the pupal stage, JH levels decrease. At the commitment pulse JH levels are very low and remain low during metamorphosis. We are interested in testing the effects of an IGR called Precor on the development of the Manduca sexta. Precor is a juvenile hormone analog, meaning it raises the levels of JH hormone in all parts of larval development. We hypothesize that if Precor is added to the food of the Manduca sexta caterpillar then the resulting higher levels of JH will lead to an increase in its growth in weight.


Materials and Method:
In setting up our experiment we decided to set up two groups of four Manduca sexta caterpillars, making one the treatment group to receive the Precor and the other, the controll to receive a normal diet. In the treatment group, we fed each caterpillar 10 grams of good, with 7 drops of Precor added and mixed into each 10 gram increments. In the controll group, we fed the caterpillars 10 grams of the same food without any Precor. Each group was placed in four-celled clear plastic containers with each caterpillar being placed in its own cell. Holes were punched into the containers so the caterpillars would be able to breath. The caterpillar food was replenished every two days in amounts of 10 grams, adding 7 drops of Precor for the experimental group. Our independent variable was the presence of the Precor in the caterpillar food. Our dependent variable was the growth of the caterpillars by weight in grams. We measured this by collecting the weights of each caterpillars every two days, then subtracting the difference in weights between each day. This was done mainly due to the the fact that caterpillars started out with different weights. Measurements were recorded for one week. A two sample t_test was conducted to determine the significance of our data. 


Results:
When comparing growth between the controll and treatment group we found that the treatment group experienced more growth over the week-long period of development. Figure 1 provides the increases in weight between each day that weights were recorded. From September 6th to September 8th, the controll group had a higher average growth of 1.368 g while the treatment group had an average growth of 1.048 g. From September 8th to September 10th the average growth of the treatment group increased significently to 2.995 g compared to an average growth of 2.46 g in the controll group. From September 10th to September 12th this trend continued as the treatment group grew an average of 3.15 g while the controll group grew  an average of 2.54 g. On the final day of data collection we found that one of the caterpillars in the controll group had died. This caterpillar did not have an increase in weight from the 10th to the 12th. When taking the averages of these separate growth increases, we calculated that the controll group grew an average of 2.123 g every two days, while the treatment group grew an average of 2.398 g every two days. The average growth rate of the of the treatment group is not statistically significently different from the controll group (t_stat = .35, d.f. = 4, P = 0.74). Although data collection and feeding were completed after one week, when disposing of the Manduca sexta a week later we discovered that the three surviving subjects in the controll group had all been able to pupate , while none of the subjects in the treatment group had reached the pupal stage.
