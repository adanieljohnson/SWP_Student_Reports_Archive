Title: Effect of Tetraethylammonium Chloride on Threshold for Action Potential in Rana Pipens

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to measure the amplitude of the threshold for action potentials delivered in the Gastrocnemius muscle through stimulation of the Sciatic Nerve of the Rana Pipens species of frog. Based on primary literature and knowledge of the ion channels involved in delivering action potentials, we predicted that the blockage of the K+ channels due to tetraethylammonium chloride would increase the threshold for action potentials to be fired in the gastrocnemius muscle. The threshold was measured using a force transducer which was able to detect the amplitude of the threshold through an electrode following stimulation. Our data was statistically insignificant so we were not able to provide biological explanation for results nor were we able to reject the null hypothesis. It can be concluded that due to all of our legs presenting complications in measuring the amplitude of the threshold, it would benefit a future experiment to expand the number of legs used in order to discard data from legs with complications. 

Introduction:
Muscle contractions and practically all bodily functions are reliant on the muscular system in a series of contraction and relaxation. These series of contraction and relaxation are controlled by nerve cells which fire action potentials in order to propagate the electrical signal and control many muscle fibers and muscles as a result. Na+ and K+ ions are responsible for the propagation of these electrical signals as the electrochemical gradient assists in the propagation of the electrical signal between the Nodes of Ranvier on the axon of the nerve cell. The flow of Na+ and K+ ions through their respective voltage gated and leaky channels in order to depolarize, which creates an action potential, and immediately after repolarize and even sometimes hyperpolarize in order to achieve resting potential, which must be achieved in order to prepare for another action potential to be fired through depolarization. The blockage of any ion channels in this system would prevent the action potential from functioning and propagating as normal. Although the biological question that comes to mind is what types of changes in ion channels’ functionality will warrant what types of effects on action potential propagation. The research article published by A.L. Kleinhaus explained a similar phenomenon by explaining that in their study of a frog dorsal root ganglion cells, frog neuromuscular junction and squid stellate ganglion cells which all showed that Intracellular TEA prolonged the action potentials which the depended on an increased threshold in order to prolong and gradual development of the depolarization of the cell. [Kleinhaus, 1975]. This begins to answer the biological question that reflects that the blockage of a K+ channel will increase the threshold for action potential due to the fact that the action potentials are prolonged and gradual. We are asking this question because it is important to understand what effects changes in ion channels will have on the functionality of firing action potentials down an axon in order to send an electrical or chemical message to the postsynaptic cell on the other side of the synaptic cleft. In this experiment we plan on using the Rana Pipens species of frog in order to observe the effect of the blockage of K+ channels on the threshold for action potentials sent through the Sciatic nerve to stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle. The Rana Pipens species is a great model organism to study this because the neuromuscular system of the Rana Pipens is similar to the neuromuscular system of most mammals to which this information can be applied. Based on the research literature by A.L. Kleinhaus and knowledge of how important the K+ channels are to the firing and propogation of action potentials, we expect that the treatment of the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.1mL tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), the independent variable, will increase the threshold for action potentials, the dependent variable, to propagate throughout the muscle.  

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we were able to take three similarly sized Rana Pipens frog legs that had been severed at femur to hip joint and were responsible for degloving, isolation of the gastrocnemius muscle, which was cut at the Achilles tendon, and sciatic nerve. After this we were able to attach the Achilles tendon to a string on the force transducer and adjust the tension in order to record accurate Amplitude observations and apply Ringer’s solution to the legs. The force transducer is then connected to the software LabScribe which was able to accurately predict the Amplitude of each stimuli. For this experiment we were able to test the amplitude of the threshold (mV) by adjusting the voltage of the Stimuli (V) created by the force transducer. The threshold (mV) was determined for each leg prior to the gastrocnemius muscle being injected with 0.1mL of 100mM tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA).  A paired t-test was used in order to analyze the data from this experiment. 

Results:
Upon observation, legs #1-#3 displayed twitching without being stimulated by the force transducer. Nevertheless, The first two legs displayed a lower threshold once being treated with tetraethylammonium, The third leg displayed an increased threshold after being treated with TEA. The experimental results from leg #2 displayed the lowest amplitude for threshold of both the experimental and control groups.  The experimental results from leg #3 displayed the highest amplitude(mV) for threshold.  The average of the threshold of the group treated with TEA was not significantly greater than the average of the threshold before being treated with TEA (tstat= 0.896198 df=2 p=0.464722)

Discussion:
Based on our data, seen in Figure 1, the treatment of the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.1mL of 100mM TEA chloride decreased the threshold values. Our data was not significant as revealed by the P value greater than 0.05 which means that our data cannot refute the null hypothesis and the data cannot be explained through biological processes. As a result, our hypothesis was refuted due to the threshold decreasing instead of increasing, as predicted, but due to the data being insignificant and due to the unstimulated muscle contractions that affected the measured amplitude for threshold no biological explanation can be applied. Due to the data not being statistically significant, our data can neither support nor refute the results discussed in the published review by Kleinhaus. Kleinhaus described how the blockage of K+ channels increased the prolongation of the action potential which increased the threshold required for another action potential to be produced [Kleinhaus,1974]. While this is what was expected to happen, once again, the data being insignificant means that we are not able to confirm that the blockage of the K+ channel caused an increase in threshold for action potential. One way to improve this experiment would be to increase the number of frog legs to test in order to be able to reject any legs that presented complications with measuring threshold.

Figure 1. Effect of Tetraethylammonium chloride on the threshold for action potential in Rana pipens frog legs. Legs had observed abnormalities and complications with contracting without stimulation. Three Rana pipens gastrocnemius muscles were tested for threshold values and then the gastrocnemius was injected with 0.1mL 100mM of Tetraethylammonium chloride and then tested for threshold values. Control Legs (Blue) before being treated with TEA Chloride had an average threshold value of 0.0343mV. Experimental Legs (Orange) following being treated with 0.1mL mM TEA Chloride had an average threshold value of 0.01743mV. Each bar is the mean of the three legs threshold values for both control and experimental groups; Error value for control was +/- 0.0196 mV. Error Value for experimental was +/- 0.01609mV.   *************************************************************************
