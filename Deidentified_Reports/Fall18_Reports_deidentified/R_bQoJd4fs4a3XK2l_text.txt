Title: Investigation on PKA’s role in cellular migration of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Tumor metastasis starts when the cancer cells invade surrounding tissues through cellular movement. Blocking cellular migration might be a potential way to stop metastasis. It is known that cellular movement is accomplished through actin disassembly and assembly for which protein kinase A is responsible. Thus, in this experiment, PKA’s role in cellular migration of Physarum polycephalum, is of particular interest. It is predicted that when PKA is inhibited, cellular movement is then blocked. But the data obtained rejected the hypothesis. It might be explained by the failure of inhibitory chemicals, curcumin, to meet the threshold for Physarum chemoreception. Future investigations with more comprehensive designs need to be done. 

Introduction:
Cancer has long been a nightmare for human beings. The uncontrollable tumor metastasis usually starts with the invasion of cancer cells into surrounding tissues, which is mainly accomplished by cellular migration, promoted by the protrusive activity of the cell membrane along the extracellular matrix[Yamaguchi: 2005].  Furthermore, the migration of a cell usually involves using different signaling pathways as the cell needs to respond to external environments to decide where it should move to. In this process, the external stimulus firstly activates the according receptors on the cell, and usually, the stimulus then passes down the information through a cascade of events. As a result, the study of cellular signaling pathways and their roles in cellular migration has been even more important given the current situation of cancer research. 

Nowadays, Physarum polycephalum, a certain kind of slime mold, is a popular model for investigations on cellular regulation, locomotion… due to its easy method of cultivation and observation [Oettmeier: 2017]. Most of Physarum signaling pathways are regulated by G-protein coupled receptors, which, stimulated by extracellular event, activate a G-protein complex that later bind to a membrane bound effector. The effector then turns ATP into Cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP), which acts as a second messenger that activate Protein Kinase A subunit(PKA) in the cell, which is responsible for stimulating transcription factors, and other metabolic enzymes or factors[Johnson: 2016]. The movement of the Physarum serves as a way for the organism to explore the external environment and searches for nutrients and food for growth.  The migration of Physarum is believed to be achieved by actin microfilament, a cytoskeleton structure. More specifically speaking, the movement of the Physarum requires membrane protrusion and retraction, which are governed by actin assembly and disassembly. We are interested in finding out if PKA also regulates this important behavior of cell. There are findings that indicate the fact that the assembly and disassembly of actins require PKA regulation, and that the extension of cells which is governed by Rac and Cdc42 depend on the PKA[Howe: 2004]. So, we hypothesize that when the PKA is inhibited, there cellular migration is consequently blocked.  


Materials and Methods:
In order to test our hypothesis on the signaling behaviors of Physarum when the PKA is inhibited, we used 6 water agar plates to provide culture environments for the Physarum samples, labelling the six into three control groups and three treatment groups. Giving the 20X undiluted curcumin chemical solution, which is a chemical that blocks the activity of PKA, we diluted it into 1X of 30mL, and added 10mL of the diluted chemical into each of the treatment plates to let the plates absorb the chemicals. After 10 minutes, we poured the remaining solutions out of the culture agars. We then cut a 1X1 cm block in the center of each of the 6 water agar plates and put one block of Physarum sample in. Before wrapped the agar plate with foil paper, we added 2 pieces of oatmeal near the edge of plates to induce the growth of Physarums. Finally, the culture plates were wrapped and put into a black bag and then put into a drawer. After 24hrs, we measured the longest distance travelled the Physarum and calculated the average growth rate in each group. Then we compared the averaged growth rates between control group and treatment group by using a 2-sampled T-Test, with the significant value of 0.05.

Results:
The groups with the presence of curcumin (20.0010.58) have a slightly higher averaged growth rates compared to the control groups (19.5014.08); it is also noticeable that the standard deviations of the mean values are large, indicating the lack of precision. And there is no statistically significant difference between the two growth rates (t= 0.0491, p=0.963, df= 4). These facts indicate that the Physarum samples treated with the curcumin had nearly the same level of growth when compared to Physarums in the control groups during a given period of time. 

Discussion:
As shown in figure 1, the Physarum that is treated with curcumin shows a slightly higher growth rate than the one grows without the presence of the chemical. However, there is no significant difference between the growth rates of two groups, which means that curcumin, which is believed to block PKA, fails to inhibit the activity, cellular migration, of the Physarum. Also, the large error bars shown by the figure indicate there is a huge fluctuation of the data obtained. Our hypothesis that inactivity of the PKA restricts cellular migration seems to be rejected given the data yielded. There are a few possible reasons for this: curcumin solution is too diluted, and the absorption time of the curcumin is too short. According to Ueda and other scholars, the plasmodium of Physarum usually reacts to different chemical environments by moving towards or away from them in the same ways as some higher vertebrates do: the reception of a chemical stimuli from the external environment will generate a potential change in the intracellular space, inducing a series of subsequent response. And in order for the membrane potential to be generated, the chemical should always meet a threshold value, called C_th by Ueda and his colleagues[Ueda: 1975]. The two possible inconsistencies pointed out earlier would all result in the concentration of curcumin fail to reach the threshold of chemoreception of Physarum, thus curcumin fails to inactivate PKA in Physarum. Thus, future investigations may yield more reliable results if the concentration of curcumin is increased. In addition to this, because that the data obtained in this experiment shows there is a large standard deviation, which suggests that the fluctuations of the data set, future experiments should try to use more replicas and a longer incubation time, as the Physarum usually goes through a searching process for food[Johnson: 2016]. Last but not the least, Ueda also pointed out in their article that the temperature would affect the threshold value of chemoreception by Physarum[Ueda: 1975]. In our experiment, we simply placed the Physarum samples in a drawer. Future experimental designs should try to hold the temperatures constant. 

In all, PKA’s role in cellular migration is not supported by our experimental data, but there is an extensive of findings claiming that PKA is crucial for cytoskeleton assembly and disassembly, which is responsible for cellular movements. Future studies should draw lessons from our experiment for more reliable results so that more potential therapies for tumor cells metastasis can be found.
