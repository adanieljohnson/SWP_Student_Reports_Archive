Title: Effects of Territory on Aggressive Behavior of the Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendes) 

Abstract:
Aggressive behavior is fundamental in nature and is the focus of this experiment, where the agnostic behaviors of the Siamese betta fish (Betta splendes) were studied to understand how territory could affect the species. It was hypothesized that the fish would exhibit an increase in agnostic behavior after having been placed in a small, 5-gallon fish tank, where territory is severely limited as opposed to a significently larger, 20-gallon fish tank. Throughout the experiment, four betta fish were obtained and placed in a large tank (controll) in pairs of two and then in a smaller tank (experimental), where each time, the number of reactions was recorded. The total number of reactions of the four fish were averaged in terms of those produced in the large versus the small tank and the means of these two groups were compared. Regarding the results of the experiment, there was no significent statistical difference between the two groups. However, the data did move in the direction that I expected as there was an increase in agnostic behavior after the fish had been placed in the smaller tank. It is likely that these results can be attributed to the insignificent size difference between tanks. 


Introduction:
Competition is an important topic in behavioral ecology as the behavior serves as a fundamental biotic factor used by species in order to obtain limited resources (food, water, territory) [Dzieweczynski:2016]. There is a wide spectrum whenever it comes to competition. In order to break-down this range, ecologists categorize competition as either interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species) [Dzieweczynski:2016]. Nevertheless, competition is not often a straightforward concept. The reasons for producing aggressive behavior and the way in which varying species produce such behaviors yields an even wider spectrum regarding competitive behavior, which leads to a multitude of method for studying this biotic factor. In recent studies, researchers have been able to observe aggressive behavior in intraspecific relationships through the use of the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendes) -- a species commonly known to utilize aggressive behavior in order to portray itself as a competitive species [Dzieweczynski:2016]. The species serves as the ideal model for studying aggressive behavior as it is a territorial animal that can display an array of colorful reactions whenever engaged in a competitive situation. Among the Siamese fighting fish, intraspecific behaviors include two types of movements—broadside and facing movements [Johnson:2018]. Broadside movements are displays performed whenever a fish turns its side toward an opponent. Typical behaviors in this position (in order of increasing aggressiveness) include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson:2018]. Regarding facing movements, there are also three that the fish may exhibit. Again, in order of increasing aggressiveness, they include erecting pectorals fins, spreading gill covers, and creating a red mane [Johnson:2018].  As a result of conducting these studies, researchers have found evidence supporting the idea that placing male Siamese fighting fish in close proximity (limiting territory) increases aggressive behavior [Dzieweczynski:2016][Matos:2002][Teresa:2012]. This idea was the focus of study in this experiment where I studied the relationship between territory and aggressive behavior within intraspecific relationships. Due to their observable reactions, I used the Siamese fighting fish as a model for this experiment where I observed how placing Siamese fighting fish in a small tank affects their behavior. I hypothesized that placing the fish in smaller tanks would increase their aggressive behavior—if two Siamese fighting fish are placed in a small environment, then they will exhibit more aggressive behavior than if they were placed in a larger environment.


Materials and Method:
In order to carry out this experiment, I obtained four male Siamese fighting fish and placed two at a time (labeled fish A and B) inside a twenty-gallon fish tank (large) and allowed them to interact with one another for sixty seconds. Within those sixty seconds, the number of aggressive behaviors they exhibited was recorded. Next, fish “A” and “B” were placed in a significently smaller five-gallon fish tank (experimental), where the number of aggressive behaviors they exhibited was counted for another 60 seconds. The same procedure was followed for the other two fish labeled “C” and “D”. After Counting the number of aggressive behaviors for each fish in each tank, the total number of aggressive behaviors exhibited across all fish were averaged together for the large tank (controll group) and the small tank (experimental). I observed for statistical differences between means of the two groups with the use of a one-tailed, paired t_test.


Results:
After placing the betta fish in the smaller tank, it has been observed that the experimental group had a larger mean value regarding the numbers of aggressive behaviors (6±1.41) in compassion to the large tank (4.75±2.5). These results show that the means between small and large tanks were not statistically significent (t_stat=1.6, d.f.=3, P=0.19)(figure 1), suggesting that tank size did not cause a significent effect on aggressive behaviors.


Discussion:
Although this data moved in the direction that we expected (the experimental group yielded a higher number of aggressive behaviors) it was not statistically significent, and therefore, did not support my hypothesis (figure 1). More than likely, the experimental group yielded a higher mean due to the small size of the five-gallon tank, which limited territory and forced the fish to interact. The reason as to why the difference may have been non-significent however may have been because the method used for testing for differences in agnostic behaviors is not exactly ideal. As recent studies explain, there are a variety of ways to measure aggressive behaviors within the Siamese fighting fish. Being able to identify and quantify all of the individual agnostic behaviors within a short time frame is a difficult task [Peake:2006][Brown:2017]. It is likely that while we were conducting this experiment, I was not able to identify all of the aggressive behaviors produced by the betta fish once they were placed in the smaller tank. Once placed within close proximity, the fish were producing reactions more quickly, making it difficult not to miss some of them. This is especially likely considering the species, produces a number of reactions simultaneously (i.e. spreading gill covers and creating a red mane). This makes it likely that there were more reactions produced by each betta fish, while in the smaller tank, but they were likely missed. It is also likely that the differences in tank sizes between the large and small tanks were not great enough. In an experiment where researchers aimed to study the effects of territory on the behavior of crayfish, biologists conducted a similar experiment where they placed two crayfish at a time in a small tank and counted their aggressive behaviors and then compared the data gathered to the data gathered after having placed them in a larger tank. [Church:2017].  The researchers found that there was no statistical difference in aggressive behavior among the crayfish. They attributed these results to the small difference in tank size between the small and large tank. [Church:2017] Upon repeating the experiment, researchers found that increasing the difference in tank size lead to an increase in difference in aggressive behavior between the crayfish—the new experiment utilized a one-tailed paired t_test, which produced statistically significent data [Church:2017]. In terms of future experimentation, repeating this experiment with two fish tanks where the disparity in their sizes is much larger could likely produce significently significent data. For example, in this experiment, I utilized five-gallon and twenty-gallon sized tanks. Instead, I could replace them with five-gallon and fifty-gallon sized tanks. Along with this, applying other method for quantifying aggressive behavior could aid in increasing the accuracy of measuring this behavior. For example, increasing the amount of time in which the species was observed after having been dropped in the tank from sixty seconds could make it more practical in terms of calculating the ratio difference in aggressive behavior between the small and large tank without having to necessarily count every individual aggressive reaction. Measuring the amount of time that it takes for the fish to produce an initial agnostic reaction after being placed in each tank could be used to quantify these behaviors with the shortest time yielding higher aggression. Also, measuring the amount of time in which the fish interact aggressively before separating could be a method used in terms of determining the betta fish’s aggressive behaviors. Combining these method could produce more accurate results by yielded data regarding agnostic behaviors from varying perspectives; aiding our understanding of how significent a factor territory can be whenever regarding intraspecific relationships among species.
