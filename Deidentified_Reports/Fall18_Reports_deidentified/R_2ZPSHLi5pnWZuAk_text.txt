Title: Manduca sexta Exposed to Increased Levels of Juvenile Hormone Display Significant Mean Change in Weight

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone and ecdysone both play a major role in the development of Manduca sexta. We decided to investigate how higher levels of juvenile hormone affect the weight of Manduca sexta, and we hypothesized that increased exposure to juvenile hormone would result in a change in weight between the controll and experimental groups. Each caterpillar received ten grams of food; the controll caterpillars had five drops of water added to their food, while the experimental group had five drops of juvenile hormone added to their food in order to maintain the same consistency. We took weight measurements every day, and after two weeks, we calculated the mean change in weight for both groups. The results were analyzed using a two-tailed two-sample t_test. There was a statistically significent difference between the means of the two groups. Studies on hormones, such as this one, can benefit the medical field, especially in regard to developmental research.

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in development. In the case of Manduca sexta, a moth that is considered a pest, juvenile hormone and ecdysone (20E) are especially important for metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta are a good model organism, because they have a relatively short lifespan and do not require a large habitat. According to a Harvard University study, a Manduca sexta must reach a weight of around five grams and experience a decline in juvenile hormone in order to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. Since these two factors are linked, if the level of juvenile hormone inside the caterpillar is increased, then its weight will change. Studies like this one are important, because if scientists can understand how hormones impact caterpillars, they can use their findings to predict how the same hormones affect other organisms, including humans. This information is especially relevant in the medical field and in studying development.

Materials and Method:
We tested our biological hypothesis on eight Manduca sexta. The eight caterpillars were split into two groups: one controll group and one experimental group. Caterpillars one through four made up the experimental group and caterpillars five through eight made up the controll group. The two groups were given different diets. The controll group was given standard food from the lab, while the experimental group was given the same food with juvenile hormone added. More specifically, each caterpillar was given ten grams of food. For the experimental group, five drops of juvenile hormone were added per ten grams of food. For the controll group, five drops of water were added per ten grams of food in order to mimic the wetter texture of the experimental food. Food was replaced when the caterpillar finished it or when it became dried out. Each caterpillar lived in its own section of a plastic box with air holes cut out for breathing. The plastic boxes were kept in a refrigerator, and all other conditions were kept constant. Photographs and weight measurements were taken in grams each day, and changes were observed and recorded for fifteen days. Last, a two-tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
At first, both groups steadily increased in growth. Caterpillar number 5 grew the least overall, but it may have been diseased, since there was a brown growth around its neck throughout the whole experiment. Around day twelve, the controll caterpillars began to turn brown in color, while the experimental group was still bright green. The controll caterpillars also lost weight before pupating, while the experimental group had steady growth throughout. On day fifteen, three of the controll caterpillars were pupating, while none of the experimental caterpillars were pupating. The mean change in weight of the controll group was 7.65 ± 2.73 grams. The mean change in weight of the experimental group was 13.63 ± 1.38 grams. As shown in Figure 1, there was a statistically significent difference in weight between the two groups (t_stat = 3.91, d.f. = 6, p = 0.00788). Therefore, Manduca sexta weight was impacted by an increase in juvenile hormone in this case.

Discussion:
The results were significent, because the p value was 0.00788, which is less than 0.05. The caterpillars that consumed the food with five drops of juvenile hormone grew significently larger than those in the controll group. Thus, the hypothesis is supported, meaning there was a change in Manduca sexta weight as a result of extra juvenile hormone in their diet. This makes sense, because without a decline in juvenile hormone, the Manduca sexta are not signaled to pupate. A drop in juvenile hormone is what leads to the release of prothoracicotropic hormone, which provokes the release of ecdysone, which initiates pupation [Nijhout: 1974]. This explains why the controll caterpillars could pupate and why the experimental caterpillars did not. Instead of pupating, the experimental caterpillars continued eating, and therefore continued growing. The more they grew, the more they ate, leading to a significent difference in weight. In the future, it would be interesting to see if the experimental caterpillars would still pupate if we stopped giving them extra juvenile hormone around day twelve or thirteen, or if their bodies would already be too concentrated with the hormone, meaning they would not pupate. Information from this study can be used to predict how juvenile hormone affects other organisms, including humans, especially in regard to development.
