Title: Effects of pH on the electron transport and photosynthetic activity in kale leaves  Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
Brassica oleracea, plant species for kale, is able to capture energy through chloroplasts through the process of photosynthesis.  When thinking about the proton gradient and ATP synthesis in Photosynthesis, we hypothesized that the acidic treated conditions would lead to a higher electron transport and photosynthetic activity because of the ability to give up the acidic proton.  The hypothesis predicted was tested through treating B. oleracea under acidic, neutral, and basic conditions.  This was done by enriching chloroplasts through differential centrifugation and then being chemically treated with the different pH conditions, before further undergoing the Hill reaction, and measuring the rate of absorbance.  Our results compare the means of the acidic treated and basic treated chloroplasts to the neutrally treated chloroplasts to determine the statistical significance.  We found that there was a statistical significance in the acidic treated chloroplasts to the neutral treated chloroplasts and no statistical significance in the basic treated chloroplasts.  Our findings can be used to better understand the effects of pH in terms of pollution and better understand how different pH conditions affect environmental life, in general.  

Introduction:
All organisms must directly or indirectly capture their energy from chemical energy which is stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction potential, or an electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer (BIO214 Lab Manual).  Kale is part of a plant species, B. oleracea, which also includes cabbage, collard greens, broccoli, etc.  There are many different types of plants, including kale, that are able to capture and store energy through the process of photosynthesis.  Kale leaves have a pigment molecule, chlorophyll, which allow them to be a good photosynthesizing plant.  The process of photosynthesis occurs in three steps through light-dependent and light-independent reactions.  The light-dependent reactions generate reducing power in the form of NADPH and it also generates the proton gradient which then drives ATP synthesis through Photosystems I and II.  The light-independent reactions through the enzyme RUBISCO uses ATP and NADPH in order to synthesize 6-carbon glucose molecules (BIO214 Lab Manual).  
The Hill reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light.  We know from earlier experiments on photosynthesis, that electron transport chains that are found in chloroplasts are able to pass electrons to other electron acceptors besides NADP+, like 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol.  A DCIP reduction is used to help record the rate of electron transfer because of a color change from blue to colorless (BIO214 Lab Manual).  
The purpose of this experiment was to test how acidic and basic conditions would affect the electron transport and therefore photosynthetic activity in kale leaves.  Kale leaves, B. oleracea, were used in this experiment because they are commercially and easily acceptable and they are also cheap.  They can also be manipulated easily because of their larger size and availability.  

According to, Effect of pH on chloroplast photosynthesis, the pH optimum for chloroplast photosynthesis was found to be between 7.8 and 8.2 (Huber 1979).  When thinking about which pH treated condition would have a high electron transport and therefore photosynthetic activity, it was hypothesized that the acidic conditionally treated chloroplasts would have a high electron transport and also photosynthetic activity over the basic conditionally treated chloroplasts.  Our lab group hypothesized this because we know that acids can easily give up their acidic proton, whereas bases do not have this property.  Hence, the acidic conditionally treated chloroplasts at a pH of 2 will have a high electron transport and photosynthetic activity when compared against the controll.  



Materials and Method:
In order to understand the photosynthetic activity of kale leaves at different pH's, we first needed to enrich chloroplasts by differential centrifugation so that the best aliquot was chosen.  In order to enrich the chloroplasts of the kale leaf, the large central vein was removed from one large-sized kale leaf.  The leaf was then placed in a cooled mortar with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH of 8.00).  This was ground with a pestle until it was a thick paste and then an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was mixed in.  The mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled medium-sized beaker.  200 μL of the filtered liquid from the beaker was then transferred into a microtube labeled "Sample of A" and was stored on ice.  The remaining of the mixture in the beaker was transferred to a 50 Ml chilled centrifuge marked "A" and spun at 200 times the force of gravity (1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  The supernatant from tube "A" was poured into another 50 Ml chilled centrifuge tube marked "B".  200 μL of liquid was removed from tube "A" and was placed into a microtube labeled "Sample of B" and was stored on ice.  The 50 Ml centrifuged tube labelled "B" containing the chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1000 times the force of gravity (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  The supernatant from tube "B" was poured into another 50 Ml chilled centrifuge tube marked "C".  20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the undisturbed pellet and suspended with a transfer pipet.  200 μL of this re-suspended pellet was placed into a microtube labeled "Sample of B Pellet" and was stored on ice.  Additionally, 200 μL of liquid was removed from tube "C" and was placed into a microtube labeled "Sample of C" and was stored on ice.  We knew from earlier experiments that Sample B had the greatest enrichment of chloroplasts, so Sample B would be used for the rest of the experiment.  
	Once Sample B was prepared, 15 Ml of this sample was transferred into three different centrifuge tubes labeled, "Acidic Treated", "Neutral Treated", and "Basic Treated".  5 Ml of pH 2 buffer was added to the "Acidic Treated" centrifuge tube, 5 Ml of pH 6.5 buffer was added to the "Neutral Treated" centrifuge tube, and 5 Ml of pH 10 buffer was added to the "Basic Treated" centrifuge tube.  The mixtures were allowed to sit for 10 minutes before being respun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes.  Once respun, the pellets were resuspended and will later be transferred into the respective test tubes labeled 0-9.  
	While the enriched chloroplasts were being spun, 10 large test tubes were labeled 0-9.  The test tube labeled 0, the blank, was prepared using 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH of 6.50).  The test tubes 1-9 were then prepared using 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer.  When ready to begin the assay, 100 μL of acidic treated enriched chloroplasts were added to tubes 1-3, 100 μL of neutral treated enriched chloroplasts were added to tubes 4-6, 100 μL of basic treated enriched chloroplasts were added to tubes 7-9.  After the enriched chloroplasts were added, the test tubes were mixed immediately, and the mixtures were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes.  The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nanometers using the solution in test tube 0.  Once blanked, the absorbance values of all the other samples from tubes 1-9 were taken at 600 nm, these are the time zero data points.  The samples in the test tubes were then placed on a sunny windowsill for 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked again using Sample 0 and the absorbance values of each sample was taken at 600 nm.  These absorbance values were measured twice more after 10-minute intervals.  The percent change in absorbance was calculated at the 10, 20, and 30-minute intervals.  In order to analyze the significance of the results, two sample t_tests were performed on the basic and acidic condition.  This allowed us to compare the results to the controllled condition at a pH of 6.5.  The results from the experiment may be found in the results section of this report.  



Results:
When looking at Figure 1, one can see that the chloroplasts treated under acidic conditions had a steady increase in absorbance over the 30-minute interval.   The chloroplasts treated under neutral conditions had a decrease in absorbance during the first 20 minutes of the 30-minute interval, but then had a sharp increase during the last 10 minutes of the 30-minute interval.  The chloroplasts treated under basic conditions had a slow increase in absorbance during the first 20 minutes of the 30-minute interval, but then a sharp increase during the last 10 minutes of the 30-minute interval, which one is able to see in Figure 1.  Overall, we are able to see that on average the reaction that proceeded under the acidic treated conditions had a much larger increase in absorbance values over the 30-minute interval than did the basic treated conditions.  
	When looking at Figure 2, one can see that the percent change from the 10-minute interval to the 20-minute interval at all the different pH treatments were not very large, but the percent change from the 20-minute interval to the 30-minute interval was large.  In order to understand the statistical difference of the acidic and basic treated chloroplasts as compared to the neutral treated chloroplasts, a two-sample t_test was performed.  The two-sample t_test showed that the mean value for the acidic, pH of 2, condition's photosynthetic activity was statistically significently different as compared to the neutral, pH of 6.5, photosynthetic activity (t=2.8701, d.f.=3, p_value=0.028).  When a two-sample t_test of the mean value for the basic, pH of 10, condition's photosynthetic activity as compared to the neutral, pH of 6.5, photosynthetic activity was run it was not statistically significently different (t=2.0984, d.f.=3, p_value=0.083).  


Discussion:
The two-sample t_test lead us to reject the null hypothesis for the acidic pH as compared to the neutral pH but accept the null hypothesis for the basic pH as compared to the neutral pH.  This allowed us to determine that there was no difference between the acidic treated chloroplast mean and the neutral treated chloroplast mean, and a significent difference does exist.  Additionally, there was difference between the basic treated chloroplast mean and the neutral treated chloroplast mean, which allows us to say that a significent difference does not exist.  As we observed in our experiment, the acidic conditions lead to an increased absorbance and an increase in electron transfer as compared to the basic conditions, which lead to a decreased absorbance and decrease in electron transfer.  These results allow us to reject our initial hypothesis.  
	When measuring the absorbance values for the acidic treated chloroplasts, we found that acidic conditions caused the electron transfer rate to decrease because of the increase in absorbance values.  We know that as absorbance values increase, the photosynthetic activity decreases, thus the electron transfer rate also decreases.  When the chloroplasts were treated under acidic conditions in this experiment, the electrons in the electron transport chain were not able to be transferred as quickly so the color change from blue to clear was not as fast, so the absorbance values increased over time as opposed to decreasing.
	Additionally, when measuring the absorbance values for the basic treated chloroplasts, we found that basic conditions also caused the electron transfer rate to decrease because it also had an increase in absorbance values, just at a slower rate.  The negative percent change that was noted in Figure 2 for basic and acidic conditions also shows that the rate of electron transfer is decreasing.  
	The results of this experiment were slightly supported by conclusions from the study, Characterization of Factors Affecting the Activity of Photosystem I Cyclic Electron Transport in Chloroplasts.  They found that when shifting the pH from neutral to acidic it led to a complete inhibited electron transport activity, thus no photosynthetic activity (Okegawa et al, 2008).  This finding supports our experimental results.  But, when shifting the pH from neutral to basic it led to increase in electron transport activity, thus an increase in photosynthetic activity.  This finding does not support our experimental results.  
	All of these findings are important when considering the environmental effects that pollution has.  We can think about how an increase in pollution leads to acidic and basic conditions in soil, which has an effect on the electron transport and photosynthetic activity.  Understanding this decrease in electron transport activity at differing pH values is important because it could lead to inactivity in photosynthetic activity and then death of an organism without the proper energy demands that are needed in photosynthesis.  
	I believe it is important to further test the effects of acidic and basic conditions on photosynthesis.  This will give us a better understanding of the effects it has on the transfer of electrons in electron transport activity and also the photosynthetic activity.  Another test that would be interesting would be to test the photosynthetic effects when in light and dark conditions.  The study, Effect of external pH on the growth, photosynthesis and photosynthetic electron transport of Chlamydomonas acidophila Negoro, isolated from an extremely acidic lake, shows that a lower pH is more optimal for photosynthetic activity for C. acidiophilia in dark conditions then a neutral or basic pH (Gerloff-Elias et al, 2005).  It would be interesting to similarly test this for B. oleracea.  It is important to continue to study the effects of pH on different aspects our of lives to understand the effect of pH.
