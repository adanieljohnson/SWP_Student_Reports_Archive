Title: The Effects of Acid Rain on the Root/Shoot Ratio of Pisum sativum

Abstract:
Both living and non-living factors influence plant growth. Plants allocate their resources differently between their roots and shoots so that parts of the plant lacking in a particular resource can adapt in order to have access to that resource. A way to measure resource allocation is to determine the root/shoot ratio of a plant. Typically, the root/shoot ratio is smaller when the plant is larger. I hypothesize that Pisum sativum, or field peas, treated with acid rain will have a larger root/shoot ratio than the peas treated with tap water, because I except acid rain to stunt the growth of the field peas. To test this hypothesis, I planted 80 seeds treated with mirgrow into eight pots. Then, I covered the seeds with vermiculate and watered them with either acid rain or tap water daily. After two weeks, I measured the root/shoot ratio of a total of 18 plants. I used a one tailed two-sample t-test to evaluate my results. My data supported my hypothesis because the plants treated with acid rain had a larger root/shoot ratio in regard to both length and weight. This was because the field peas had to allocate resources to the roots in order to find the nutrients they were being deprived of. 


Introduction:
In ecological communities, plants interact with each other. Biotic (environmental stimuli from living organisms) and abiotic factors (stimuli from non-living sources) contribute to these interactions. These two factors affect anything from energy capture and nutrient absorption to reproduction. Plant interactions revolve around obtaining nutrients in order to stay alive, but resources are limited and therefore organisms need to allocate their resources between their roots and shoots in order to obtain the nutrients they need.

Allocation patterns for a species are genetically determined, but in some cases, plants can allocate their resources in response to environmental changes [Johnson: 2018]. Individuals modify their allocation patterns in order to best adapt to the abiotic changes the environment presents. This is called allocation plasticity [Weiner: 2004].

Plants vary in how they allocate their resources between their different parts. Increased allocation to the leaves leads to a high growth rate when light is plentiful [Johnson 2018]. Stems are the supporting structure in plants and play a role in light capture. In many plants there is a tradeoff in resource allocation between the stem and leaves. The stem and leaves make up the shoot system and the roots serve as the primary source of absorption. When nutrients and resources are plentiful, the plant will flourish, but when nutrients are scarce, plants must allocate their resources to the roots, so the roots can grow and try to thrive in a dry environment. In general, when nutrient availability increases, plants allocate less resources to their roots because as nutrient availability increases, much less effort is required to acquire resources [Argen: 2003]. 

Resource allocation is measured by a plants root/shoot ratio. This is measured by dividing the biomass of the root by that of the shoot. This is an accurate measurement of allocation because nutrients from the soil must move from the roots where it is absorbed, to the shoots. In general, the root/shoot ratio decreases when plant size increases [Monk: 1996]. 

Biotic interactions between plants and microorganisms can be affected by acidic conditions. [Cheplick: 1993]. Acid rain is any form of precipitation that is very acidic and possess elevated levels of hydrogen ions [Lal: 2016]. The low pH of acid rain typically stunts the growth of plants by stimulating abnormalities in the metabolism of plants [Lal: 2016]. It can be concluded that since the acid rain stunts plant growth, field peas will be smaller and therefore, I hypothesize that the field peas treated with acid rain will have a larger root/shoot ratio than plants treated with tap water. 


Materials and Methods:
First, I obtained field peas that had been soaking for 24 hours in water. Next, I labeled eight pots and filled them to the top with vermiculite. Then, I pre-watered all eight pots and added 50mL of mirgrow. To place the field pea seeds in the pots, I put an indentation in the vermiculite and put two seeds into each depression. Each pot had 10 seeds, so this made for a total of 80 planted seeds. Lastly, I covered the seeds with vermiculite and watered four of the pots with tap water and the other four pots with acid raid at a pH of 3.5. I continued to water the plants every day for two weeks. After two weeks, I measured the root/shoot ratio of length and weight of the pea plants. This measurement consists of weighing and measuring the length of both the root and shoot, and then dividing the mass or length of the root by that of the shoot.  I measured nine plants treated with acid rain and nine plants treated with tap water. To evaluate the data, I used a one tailed two-sample t-test with the average root/shoot ratio of length and weight. 

Results:
Figure 1 indicates that the mean root/shoot ratio of weight of field peas treated with acid rain (1.589 ± 0.29) is larger than mean root/shoot ratio of length of peas treated with tap water (1.02 ± 0.18). The one tailed two-sample t-test indicated that the mean root/shoot ratio of weight of the peas treated with acid rain was statistically significantly larger than that of the peas treated with tap water (t-stat = 6.867, df = 34, P = 3.29E-8). In comparison, figure 2 shows that the mean root/shoot ratio of length of field peas treated with acid rain (0.929 ± 0.153) is also larger than the mean root/shoot ratio of field peas treated with tap water (0.606 ± 0.067). And after preforming the two-sample t-test, it was determined that the mean root/shoot ratio of field peas treated with acid rain was also statistically significantly larger than that of the peas treated with tap water (t-stat = 8.18, df = 34, P = 7.61E-10). This demonstrates that for both length and weight the root/shoot ratio was larger for plants treated with acid rain than plants treated with tap water. 

Discussion:
I was able to support the hypothesis for this experiment because the plants treated with tap water had a statistically significantly smaller root/shoot ratio compared to that of the field peas treated with acid rain. These results can be attributed to the fact that the plants treated with acid rain had to develop a more intricate root system in order to get the resources and nutrients they needed. The plants treated with tap water did not have to allocate resources to their roots in order to get nutrients. They were given the water and resources they needed without any perturbing outside forces acting on them, so they grew taller and weighed more. Therefore, the root/shoot ratio decreased because plant size increased [Monk: 1996]. According to a similar study, at seedling growth level the plants showed the highest seedling growth in controls (water). The acid rain inhibited both root and shoot length, therefore increasing the root: shoot ratio [Shaukat: 1998]. 

If I were to repeat this study, I would separate the pots. When I watered the plants sometimes the acid rain would leak into the control group, possibly inhibiting seedling growth. Clearly this was not a major issue, as our results were statistically significant, but maybe the acid raid had a minor effect on growth of the field peas that I was unable to see. I would also like to study the effect of light on root/shoot ratios. Since the shoots are the light capturing organ of the plant, I would assume that the resources would be allocated to the stem, increasing the growth of the stem and decreasing the size of the roots.
