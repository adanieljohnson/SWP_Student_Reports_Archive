Title: Effect of Sudden Changes in Light Presence on the Behavior of Male Betta Splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins exhibit a wide range of intra-specific, agnostic behaviors that make it possible for researchers to observe and quantify interactions between unprovoked male and female Bettas. This experiment seeks to analyze the effect of a prolonged period of darkness on the aggressive behavior of male Bettas. In this experiment 4 groups of 2 male Bettas were analyzed as the male Betta splenden were placed side by side in a tank and separated by a glass divider. Two groups experienced a prolonged period of darkness then were suddenly introduced to a light environment while the other 2 groups remained in the light environment for the duration of the experiment. The aggressive behaviors of the Bettas were observed and quantified to determine the effect of the sudden change of light presence on the fish. 

Introduction:
Organisms have different intra and inter-specific agnostic behaviors that can be analyzed to better understand animal behavior. This lab focuses specifically on the intra-specific behaviors between male Betta splendins. Betta splendins were chosen for this experiment because they exhibit a wide range of intra-specific aggressive behaviors. The aggressive displays of Betta splendins are “highly stereotypic, conspicuous, and well documented”, which contributes to why they are a good species to study in terms of animal behavior [Doutrelant:2001]. Betta splendins, also known as Siamese Fighting fish are native to Thailand and can be found in the wild can be found in inland waters of the Orient [Hargrove: 1999]. Intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins include two main types of movements; broadside movement and facing movements. This lab will examine and quantify male Betta splenden behavior to determine the level of aggression Bettas show towards one another after being in darkness for 4.5 hours then suddenly being placed in a light environment. In similar experiments, researchers place Betta splendins in “complete darkness which effectively stopped all responding” [Hogan: 1970]. The fish are essentially kept in a state of relaxation while in a dark environment. Betta broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements include facing with pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula and showing red mane. Other agnostic behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head and arching the back. It was hypothesized that male Betta splendins kept exposed to a sudden change from a dark environment to a light environment would alarm Male Betta splendins and cause them to be more aggressive towards each other compared to male Betta splendins kept in a light environment the entire time. 

Materials and Method:
A total of 8 male Betta splenden were collected. Two Betta splenden were placed in a glass tank and were separated by a removable opaque plastic divider and a glass divider. The tank was labeled group 1. Three replicates of the tank were made for a total of 4 tanks with 2 Betta splendins each, labeled groups 1,2,3 and 4. Groups 1 and 2 served as the controll groups whereas groups 3 and 4 served as the experimental groups. Groups 3 and 4 were placed in a cabinet to simulate a dark environment for 4.5 hours whiles groups 1 and 2 remained in a light environment. When collecting data and making observations, the fish were brought into or stayed (depending on which group) in the light environment and the opaque divider was removed allowing the Betta splendins to become aware of each other’s presence. Data was collected for a total of 5 minutes. The agnostic behavior of the Betta splendins was quantified by counting the number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by each fish and timing the duration each fish showed his red mane. An unpaired t_test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
The average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by male Betta splendins who remained in the light (groups 1 and 2) was 17.25 (mean ± 18.71) [Figure 1]. The average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by Betta splendins who received the dark treatment (groups 3 and 4) was 11.5 (mean ± 13.30) [Figure 1]. The average duration of the red mane exhibited by Betta splendins who remained in the light was 101.75 seconds (mean ± 97.34) and for Betta splendins who received the dark treatment the average was 68.25 seconds (mean ± 84.26) [Figure 2]. The unpaired, one tailed t_test performed between the number of aggressive behaviors between each treatment group proved that there was no statistical significance in the increase of instances of agnostic behavior in different treatments (t stat: 0.50, d.f.: 6, p value: 0.317). The unpaired, one tailed t_test performed between the duration of red mane between each treatment group proved that there was no statistical significance in the increase of time Betta splendins flashed their red mane (t stat: 0.52, d.f.: 6, p value: 0.310).

Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, the hypothesis that placing Betta splendins in a dark environment prior to observing their interactions would increase their aggression was rejected. The relationship between the results of each treatment proved to be statistically insignificent based on the results of the unpaired, one-tailed t_test. Though not to a significent extent, the Betta splendins that were exposed to darkness were less aggressive than the Betta splendins in the controll group which may be because the darkness relaxed the fish to a point where they were minimally active [Hogan: 1970]. While quantifying the data for the experiment, controll group 1 appeared to be an outlier. The Betta splendins in group 1 behaved exceptionally aggressive toward one another, each of them holding their red manes for approximately 3 minutes which is three times the duration of the second group of most aggressive fish. For future studies, to further examine the effect, in any, of light and dark environments on Betta splendins, experimental groups can be kept in a dark environment for a longer period of time or Betta splendins can be observed for longer durations of time. In a study that analyzed the onset of combat in male Betta splendins, it was observed that aggressive behaviors between Betta splendins can occur over a long period of time and may not even appear until after a few hours [Bronstein: 1983]. Additionally, in a study that examined the effects of photoperiod on Betta splenden reproduction rates, it was concluded that reproduction rates were most successful when Betta splenden were exposed to an equal amount of darkness and light as opposed to mostly light [Giannecchini: 2012]. Therefore, it can be determined that Betta splendins are benefited by darkness in different aspects such as reproduction which qualifies as a behavior.
