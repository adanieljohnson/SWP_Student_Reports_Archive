Title: The presence of lidocaine in Rana pipiens does not significantly affect the amplitude of gastrocnemius contraction 

Abstract:
Na channels are largely responsible for the conduction of action potentials in the neuromuscular system. Healthy conduction of action potentials to neuromuscular junctions results in a sustained number of neurotransmitters diffusing to the muscle fiber, which ultimately leads to regular muscle contraction. The results of the presence of lidocaine, a Na channel blocker, was studied in conjunction with the amplitude of gastrocnemius contraction in Rana pipiens. We predicted the experimental group, injected with lidocaine, would show a decrease in amplitude of contraction. After recording the average amplitude of muscle contraction for the control and experimental groups for 3 different legs, we found that the results were not statistically different. The null hypothesis could not be rejected, however these results led to further research and the conclusion that lidocaine is linked to decreased muscle contraction through blocking the conduction of action potentials in the neuromuscular system. Future experiments with a larger sample size would help in confirming an inverse relationship between lidocaine and the amplitude of muscle contraction. More knowledge of lidocaine’s effects could be beneficial in managing muscular diseases such as Muscular Sclerosis. 

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system is crucial in sensing and responding to both internal and external environments. The brain controls this system, communicating with motor neurons, which command a motor unit consisting of skeletal muscle fibers and neuromuscular junctions. The motor unit works to formulate an appropriate response within milliseconds to a specific stimulus, through muscle contraction. The brain sends neural signals, relayed through action potentials in the axon of motor neurons, which innervate muscle fibers and branch out towards neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2016]. Neurotransmitters are released from the presynaptic neuron and diffuse to the muscle fiber, causing action potentials to travel down the muscle fiber, ultimately resulting in muscle contraction. Action potentials depend on the opening of voltage gated sodium channels and are crucial in the complex process of muscle contraction. Lidocaine is a common anesthetic, which blocks sodium channels, such as the voltage gated sodium channels responsible for relaying action potentials down nerves and into muscle fibers. Research has shown that in patients with Multiple Sclerosis, lidocaine almost completely abolished reoccurrence of painful tonic seizures, and other positive symptoms [Sakurai 1999]. Muscle contraction amplitude may be decreased with the presence of lidocaine due to the blocking of sodium channels along the axons of nerves that innervate muscles. A decrease in functioning sodium channels leads to fewer action potentials reaching the neuromuscular junctions of a muscle fiber. Because action potentials sum spatially and temporally to create muscle contraction, fewer action potentials would lead to a decreased amplitude of contraction. In our experiment, the independent variable is the presence of lidocaine and the dependent variable is the amplitude of muscle contraction in the gastrocnemius. Will the presence of lidocaine limit action potentials in motor units and as a result decrease the amplitude of muscle contraction? In this experiment, we will attempt to answer this question by introducing lidocaine to the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius of the northern leopard frog, Rana pipiens, belonging to the Amphibia class. If 0.1mL of 25mm lidocaine is injected on the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens, then the amplitude of the gastrocnemius contraction will decrease. 

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, we will use three frog legs and each leg will provide both control and experimental group data. We placed each leg in a dissecting pan and peeled away the skin with forceps. The leg was moistened with Ringer’s solution as needed. We used a probe to separate the thigh muscles and locate the sciatic nerve. The nerve was carefully freed from the muscle. Next, the gastrocnemius was isolated and hung vertically by string tied to the loop of the force transducer. The thigh was secured flat to the dissecting pan with pins. Two electrodes were placed on the sciatic nerves and were used to conduct current to the nerve. The software, Lab Works, was used to administer and record voltages and amplitudes of muscle contraction. For every trial, the stimulus amplitude and the frequency were held constant, at 1.2V and 1Hz respectively. The control data for the leg was run first, administering 5 pulses which produced a myogram. The amplitude of the muscle contraction from each pulse was then recorded. Next, 0.1mL of 25mm lidocaine was injected into the gastrocnemius, a few drops of the 0.1mL was placed on the sciatic nerve. The experimental data was produced in the same manner, producing a myogram from which muscle contraction amplitudes were recorded. The averages of the five amplitudes of muscle contraction in both the control and experimental groups were taken for the three legs. A one-tailed paired t-test was run with a significance level of .05. 

Results:
Shown in Figure 1, the average amplitudes for the control groups were .934V +/- .4V for leg 1, .2872V +/- .4V for leg 2, and .202V +/-.4V for leg 3. For the experimental groups injected with lidocaine, the average amplitudes were .046V +/-.036V for leg 1, .087V +/-.036V for leg 2, and .016V +/-.036Vfor leg 3. The two bars in the figure represent the standard deviations. When utilizing a one-tailed paired t-test, a p-value of .208 was found, a t-value of 1.833 was found, and 2 degrees of freedom were used. We concluded that the difference in amplitude of muscle contraction shown between the control and experimental groups is not statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Based on our results, the null hypothesis, that there is no statistical difference between the average amplitude of muscle contraction without the presence of lidocaine and with the presence of lidocaine, cannot be rejected. Although the data did not provide a statistically significant difference, the presence of lidocaine resulted in a lower average amplitude of contraction for all three legs. This decrease in contraction amplitude with the presence of lidocaine raised further questions. A study done on rats has shown that lidocaine inhibits smooth muscle contraction in the tail. The findings suggest that lidocaine depresses adrenergic neurotransmission, leading to the inhibition of the smooth muscle [Szocik:1993]. A decrease in neurotransmitter release would cause weaker action potentials traveling through the nervous system, towards the neuromuscular junction. This may result in a dampened action potential in the muscle fiber, ultimately resulting in a smaller amplitude of muscle contraction. However, rats belong to a different class than Rana pipiens and the gastrocnemius is skeletal muscle fiber rather than smooth muscle found in the tail, so this finding does not sufficiently explain our scientific question. A study involving patients with Multiple Sclerosis, lidocaine almost entirely abolished the reoccurrence of painful tonic seizures, due to its ability to block Na channels. The study confirmed that lidocaine blocks Na channels in a frequency and voltage-dependent way, which blocked fibers that are responsible for some of the negative symptoms stated. Presumably, lidocaine reduces the current of action potentials in demyelinated portions of nerve axons, essentially blocking the conduction of the action potential [Sakurai:1999]. Na channels are responsible for conducting action potentials down the axon at the demyelinated portions, depolarizing the section of the nerve above the threshold. Depolarization occurs when these sodium voltage-gated channels open and sodium rushes in the axon, increasing the positive ion concentration inside the cell. When the threshold is met, an action potential occurs and transfers the neural signal down the myelinated axon until it reaches another demyelinated portion. Blocking the conduction of the neural signal through closing the Na channels would stop the signal from reaching its target cell, such as a muscle fiber. Ultimately, if the action potential did not reach the muscle fiber, no muscle contraction of that fiber would occur. In theory, lidocaine present on the sciatic nerve should result in a decrease in gastrocnemius contraction. If our experiment was repeated with a larger sample size, a statistically significant average decrease in amplitude of contraction would be expected in the group with lidocaine present. A better understanding of Na voltage-gated channel blockers, such as lidocaine, would be extremely beneficial in treatment and management of muscular diseases.
