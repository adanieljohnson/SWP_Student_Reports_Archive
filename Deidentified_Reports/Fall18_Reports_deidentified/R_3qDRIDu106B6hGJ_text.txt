Title: The influence of space allowance on the agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behaviors under laboratory or natural settings, trying to uncover the physiological purposes for these behaviors. Agonistic behaviors are one of the animal behaviors that help the animals secure territories, find mates. An intraspecific agonistic behavior occurs between individuals within a species, and space allowance is one of the factors that affect it. In this experiment, the agonistic behavior of Betta splenden was examined, and the hypothesis was if two Betta splendens were put into a larger tank, their agonistic behaviors would decrease compared to their behaviors in a smaller tank. The hypothesis was not supported. Past literature was studied and the reason why it was not supported was possibly because of the insignificant differences between the two tanks. Future study is required for supporting this hypothesis.


Introduction:
The study of ethology is the scientific and objective study of animal behaviors, usually referring to the responses of the targeted animals to stimuli under natural or laboratory conditions. It involves the insights and theories from ecology, genetics and particularly evolutionary biology. Often thought to be originated from Charles Darwin, behavioral studies, however, first came in sight worldwide with the work on the animal behavior of Niko Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch in 1973 when the won the Nobel Prize. Ethologists try to understand the physiological purposes for behaviors, and how evolution and natural selection have shaped their behaviors. [Johnson:2016]
Aggression, which is also called agonistic behaviors, is one of the animal behaviors that ethologists examine., as it is related to the interaction and evolution of animals in natural settings. In the process of evolution, aggressive behaviors are often related to competition over resources and mates. Conflicts in aggression include darting and biting, but most of the time the animals display behaviors that exerts no physical harm such as the display of their size and weapons. [Huber:2011] Aggression is considered to help secure the territories and resources, and the aggression between male species for a mate results in the selection of a healthier and stronger animal. Evidence from several species of mammals has also suggested the observed increase of aggression in the female during lactation aims to protect the infants. [Maestripieri:1992]
Aggression can be categorized into interspecific aggression and intraspecific aggression. Interspecific aggression is the aggression between different species, which most of the time can be observed between prey and predator. Intraspecific aggression is the aggression in one species, thus often related with the competition of accessing resources and breed opportunities. In this experiment, the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendens are examined.
The Siamese fighting fish, which is the Betta splenden, was originated in southeast Asia. The size of the male Betta fish is often larger than female, with male reaching 5cm and female reaching 4cm. Betta splendens are highly territorial and males of Betta fish tend to display agonistic behaviors against each other if kept in the same tank. The intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two types of movements: broadside movement and facing movements. Broadside movements involve, in an escalating level of aggression intensity, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing while facing movements include facing an opponent with pelvic fins erect, spreading gill covers and protrude branchiostegal membranes. [Johnson:2016]
There are lots of factors that affect the aggression of Betta splendens and other animals generally, and space allowance is one of them. In this experiment, I investigated the effect of space on the agonistic behavior of betta fish. In previous studies, it had been proved that increasing feeding space allowance decreases competition and aggression in lactating dairy cows. [DeVries:2004] Also, reducing space allowance increased aggression behavior in adult pigs. [Barnett:1993] The effect of the size of the space on the agnostic behaviors in Betta splenden has not been studied. I hypothesized that if two Betta splendens were put into a larger tank, their agonistic behaviors would decrease and become less intense compared to their behaviors in a smaller tank. 


Materials and Methods:
Two water tanks of different sizes were obtained and filled with water. One tank had the volume of approximately 5L, and the other had the volume of 1L. Two Betta splendens were originally placed in the smaller tank, with white plastic dividers separating them, preventing them from encountering each other. Then, the divider was removed and 1 minute was kept after the two fish began interacting with each other. The agonistic behaviors were recorded during the 1-minute period. The divider was restored to separate the two betta fish and was kept undisturbed for ten minutes before the next step. Then, the two fishes were transported from the smaller tank to the larger one simultaneously. They were placed at two sides of the tank away from each other. Next, a period of 1 minute was kept after the two fish began interacting with each other. The agonistic behaviors were recorded during the 1-minute period. Numbers from 1-3 was assigned to each of the two groups of agonistic behaviors (broadside and facing) based on the intensity of them according to the lab manual:
Pelvic fin flickering – 1
Tail beating – 2
Tail flashing – 3
Pectoral fins erecting – 1 
Spreading gill covers – 2
Showing red mane - 3 
For each fish, the total number representing their agonistic behavior intensity was calculated. The procedure was repeated on another pair of betta fish. A one-tailed paired t-test was used in determining the result.



Results:
The mean agonistic behavior number for the small tank was (6 +/- 1.41) and (4.75 +/- 2.5) for the large tank. (Figure 1) The results one-tailed paired t-test showed that there is no significant difference between the mean agonistic behavior number for the small tank vs. large tank. (t-stat = 1.67, df = 3, P = 0.194) 


Discussion:
As shown in the result, it did not show any significant difference between the mean agonistic behavior number between small and large tank. The hypothesis of if two Betta splendens were put into a larger tank, their agonistic behaviors will decrease and become less intense compared to their behaviors in a smaller tank was not supported. It was possibly because that the environment of the tank was oversimple and differences between the two tanks were small that the fish did not notice the change in the environment. In a study on Midas cichlid, a common aquarium fish, it was discovered that time spent behaving aggressively, which was also agonistic behavior intensity, was not associated with small-scale differences in group size or available space. It was also discovered that agonistic behavior was significantly lower in a large aquarium with a complex habitat. [Oldfield:2011] In another study investigating the aggressive behavior of Oryzias latipes, it was discovered that under the laboratory setting, reducing the amount of space available Oryzia latipes from 1 to 1/16 liter per fish did not alter the consequences of competition as long as the accumulation of waste products was prevented and food was supplied in excess. [Magnuson:1962] Though there was a general trend in our data indicating that betta fish in a smaller tank displayed more agonistic behaviors, it was observed that the fish did not show any significant difference between the behaviors in the two tanks. The time they took to encounter each other was longer than that they had taken in the smaller tank. I concluded that the differences between the small and large tank in the experiment were not significant enough for betta fish to detect. The experiment did have some weaknesses: the behaviors of betta fish was observed subjectively that could result in inaccurate data because some of the agonistic behaviors such as tail beating and spreading the gill cover was hard to observe. Also, because the bottom of the water tank was reflective, the betta fish sometimes displayed agonistic behaviors against its mirror image so that it might already be experiencing habituation during the 10-minute resting period. For study in the future, to obtain the best result, the tanks must not be reflective and should contain significant differences between each other in either size or the environment. Also, other fish species should be examined to determine whether space has influences on the agonistic behavior of fish.
