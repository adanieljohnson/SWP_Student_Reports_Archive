Title: Testing the Effects of 20mM and 10mM Caffeine Concentrations on Phosphodiesterase in the Physarum polycephalate cAMP Signal Transduction Pathway 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a model organism that behaves similarly to single celled organisms, deeming itself useful in studying the mechanisms of signal transduction in biochemical pathways. Signaling in Physarum is managed by pathways regulated by G Coupled Receptors. One of the major G-Coupled Receptor pathways is the cAMP pathway. Adenylate cyclase is activated for the purpose of binding to several substrates including Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates other enzymes, activating or silencing, until the signaling transduction pathway is terminated by phosphodiesterase. Caffeine is known to inhibit phosphodiesterase’s production, thus stopping signal termination and increasing Physarum’s directional motility. This experiment was designed experiment to test two different concentrations of caffeine, 20mM and 10mM. These solutions were pipetted onto PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates with samples of Physarum to test how the caffeine concentrations affected Physarum movement. 20mM was thought to produce the most movement in Physarum when compared to the 10mM and the controll group. A halt in Physarums’ movement caused limited movement, thus producing inconclusive data for this experiment. If the hypothesis was supported, caffeine would have a dosage effect on Physarum movement.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum exudes behavior similar to single celled organisms. This allows Physarum to be a useful model organism in studying the workings and mechanisms of signal transduction in biochemical pathways. Physarum spend most of their lives in the plasmodial stage as a flat mass that inhabits decomposing leaves and debris. (1) While Physarum seem to be simple organisms, their behavior can be understood as complex as the organism modifies its behaviors to, “allocate biomass” and “derive an optimal diet” from its enviroment. (K. Alim 2013) (2) Physarum engulfs bacteria and other debris and transports nutrients from them, using signal transduction and the movement of actin filaments.
Like cells, Physarum, respond to their environments in many different ways. These behaviors include hardening into a state of hibernation when beginning to reproduce, cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis, and chemotaxis. (1) Cytoplasmic streaming activity is the directional change of cytoplasmic flow for cellular materials. Phototaxis the migration of the Physarum towards or away from light. Finally, Chemotaxis is the movement of the slime mold closer or away from a chemical source. Physarum utilize all these behaviors, initiated by transduction signaling, to survive in their environments. 
Signaling in Physarum is coordinated by intracellular signal transduction pathways. This transduction signaling in the Physarum is regulated by G Coupled Receptors and ion coupled receptors. (1) G-Coupled Receptors have two major pathways in which signals are produced, the cAMP pathway and the IP3 pathway. During the cAMP pathway, adenylate cyclase, an enzyme, converts ATP to cAMP, and is activated for the purpose of binding to several substrates including the enzyme Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates other enzymes, with activation or silencing, until the signaling transduction pathway of cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase, effectively ending the signal. 
During this experiment, the objective was to determine how different concentrations of caffeine can affect Physarum’s movement. Caffeine is regarded as an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity during the cAMP pathway and is also known as chemoattractant for Physarum. (3) In the G-Coupled Receptor cAMP pathway, this causes signals to continue without being inhibited and thus affecting the motility of Physarum. As a result of this inhibited phosphodiesterase activity, it was hypothesized that there would be increased movement in Physarum that were treated with caffeine when compared to controll groups, also that the Physarum that were treated with the higher concentration of caffeine (20mM) would have more movement when compared to the lower concentration (10mM).


Materials and Method:
	To begin, nine PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates were obtained along with three aliquots of 20x stock solutions of caffeine. After this, two different caffeine dilutions of 10mM and 20mM were prepared. The 20mM solution was prepared by adding 10Ml of water to 1Ml of caffeine, while the 10mM solution was prepared adding 0.5Ml of caffeine to 19.5Ml of water. A line was drawn through half of each of the PDA plates, along with two 1cm squares that crossed through each line. Then, 5Ml of diluted caffeine were pipetted onto each of the experimental PDA plates (three 10mM and three 20mM). A controll group of three PDA plates was also crafted. The treatments soaked into the plates for fifteen minutes, then the excess solution that remained on the PDA plate was blotted with a Kimwipe. After that, a metal spatula was utilized to cut 1cm squares of Physarum from stock plates, placing them on the drawn squares of each PDA plate, each sample culture plate was then wrapped with aluminum foil, labeled, and then placed into a light box. The next day, results for the movement of each of the experimental samples was determined by a ruler in millimeters. After recording results, a one tailed ANOVA statistical test was used to determine the differences in means between each treatment group and the controll. This determined if the different dilution concentrations had significent effects on the movement of the Physarum samples.

Results:
The expected results of caffeine (10mM and 20mM) on Physarum were that the caffeine would inhibit the production of phosphodiesterase causing an increase in distance moved for the sample. The samples that were treated with higher concentrations of caffeine would move further than those samples that were treated with the lower concentrations. There results were to be calculated using a one-tailed ANOVA statistical test, that would compare the means of the experimental and controll groups to one another.
The results displayed in figure 1 are the results that were actually obtained from this experiment, while the results of figure 2, are an example of what the data should have been in this experiment if the hypothesis was supported. Figure 1 displays the average distance the Physarum moved for each of the three experimental groups. The controll group had an average movement distance movement of 2.67mm. The 10mM caffeine experimental group had an average distance of 0mm. Lastly, the 20mM caffeine group had an average distance of 2.67mm. This was not the data expected, as the controll and 20mM caffeine had the average, and the 10mM caffeine group did not move at all.
In figure 2 the expected results are displayed. The controll group had an average movement distance movement of 2.67mm. The 10mM caffeine experimental group had an average distance of 4.67mm. Lastly, the 20mM caffeine group had an average distance of 6.34mm. 
Based on a one-way ANOVA statistical test, if this were the data, the difference between the means of the different groups would be significent because the p_value obtained from the statistical test is less than 0.05 the alpha value for this experiment. Upon further inspection of the Tukey-Kramer post hoc test, significent differences between all means of the three experimental groups would be revealed when the means are compared to one another. (f-stat=30.33, degrees of freedom=8, p_value= 0.000729.)


Discussion:
During this experiment there was a biological issue with the sample Physarum cultures that caused a shutdown of normal growth behaviors. This disrupted the attaining of viable data from this experiment that supported or contradicted the hypothesis. The shut down in the growth of Physarum cultures may have been caused by colder temperatures in the lab or inadequate nutrition for the Physarum. (4) These conditions can lead to the formation of sclerotium, which is the resting state for a slime mold in which it remains dormant, thus preventing growth. The behavior could also be the result of a production of a pseudosclerotium which occurs when there is rapid desiccation of slime molds. (4) According to J.A. Jump, if a rapid drying of the plasmodium occurs, pseudosclerotium can happen, causing nuclei in the sample to undergo significent distortion, thus, the, organism can no longer resume normal growth after dormancy induced by the formation of sclerotium. The Physarum in lab, may have undergone rapid environmental changes that may have affected their ability to exhibit normal growth behaviors. 
As stated previously, Physarum have behavior similar to single cells when responding to different environmental changes. The intracellular signaling in Physarum causes behavioral changes in Physarum, such as moving away from sunlight or moving closer to food. 
The purpose of this experiment was to determine how 20mM and 10mM caffeine concentrations affected the movement of Physarum. (3) Since caffeine is a chemoattractant and inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, it can lead to further directional movements of signals in the G-Coupled Receptor cAMP pathway. It was hypothesized that Physarum treated with a 20mM concentration of caffeine would move further than the controll group. This hypothesis is supported by the sample data, as the 20mM caffeine treatment group moved 6.34mm which is significently higher than the 10mM caffeine group. The 10mM caffeine group moved 4.67mm, which is further than the untreated controll group that only moved 2.76mm. From this data, a dosage effect could be inferred, as a higher concentration of caffeine resulted in further growth of the Physarum. 
While other investigations have found that caffeine may increase the motility of Physarum through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase in the cAMP pathway, this experiment must be repeated in order to attain tangible data that supports the hypothesis. Next trial, the environmental conditions and care a Physarum must be meticulously controllled for so that relevant results can be obtained from the next experiment.
