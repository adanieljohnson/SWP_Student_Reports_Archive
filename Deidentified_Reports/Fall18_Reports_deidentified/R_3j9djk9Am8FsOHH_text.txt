Title: The Effects of Added Sodium on the Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction of the Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is vital for our bodies to communicate with the outside world and with other parts of our bodies. In the Rania pipiens frog, the neuromuscular system is vital in the gastrocnemus muscle for a quick response time to jump away from any predators coming its way. In this experiment, we studied the effects of injecting a sodium solution into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg. Our expectation was that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase. We measured the amplitude and the threshold of three frog legs before and after injecting them with a sodium solution. Our data showed that there was a trend at maximum amplitudes such as 4.0 V and 5.0 V because the amplitude of the muscle of the three frogs before the injection was higher compared to the amplitude of the leg after the injection which proves that our hypothesis was not supported. 

Introduction:
The Rania pipiens or the northern leopard frog has long hindlegs to help it jump away from predators or catch prey. Its hindlegs need to have a very fast reaction time from the moment it sees predators. That is one reason the neuromuscular system is so important in the frogs hindlegs. The neuromuscular system can respond within milliseconds and unitizes nerves and muscles to respond to signals from the external and internal environment. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to the muscle fiber and triggers the opening of chemically gated sodium channels so sodium rushes into the motor neuron causing an action potential. The action potential causes the muscle fiber to shorten and causes the muscle to move. In frogs, the sciatic nerve controlls the movement of the gastrocnemus muscle and the gastrocnemus muscle is very important for the frogs jumping ability, so it has a lot of neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. A study was done in Seattle, Washington on the effects of hypertonic solutions on the contraction of frog skeletal muscles. They found that a cell could not be repolarized when Na+ was introduced into a membrane and discovered that this must be because the membranes may not be permeable to sodium [Gordon: 1970]. My hypothesis is that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we measured the amplitude and threshold of three frog legs of roughly the same size and weight. We removed all the skin from the frog legs and periodically sprayed them with Ringer’s solution. Taking one frog, we then exposed the sciatic nerve and attached the gastrocnemus muscle to a string at 90 degrees to the rest of the leg. We attached a probe onto the gastrocnemus muscle as close to the base as possible. We then measured the amplitude in mV and threshold of the muscle at various stimulus amplitudes from 0.1 to 5.0 V. We took the measurements at one pulse, 50 Hz, and 5 W(ms). We then injected the muscle with 0.1 Ml of a Ringer’s solution with 200 mM of sodium added and measured the amplitudes and threshold again. We repeated these steps with the two other frog legs to have comparable data. A paired t_test was used to find if the amplitude of the muscle at a stimulus amplitude of 5.0 V was significently different before and after injection of sodium Ringer’s solution.

Results:
The amplitude of the frog muscle before and after the injection had mostly varied results. For two frogs, the threshold after the injection was a smaller amplitude compared to the threshold before the injection but for one frog the opposite was the case. We also had varied results over the three frog legs for low stimulus amplitudes (0.0 V – 2.0 V). We did however notice a trend across the three frog legs at maximum amplitudes such as 4.0 V and 5.0 V. As shown in Figure 1, the mean of the amplitude of the muscle of the three frogs before the injection was higher compared to the amplitude of the leg after the injection. We ran a paired t_test and found that the mean of the amplitude at a stimulus amplitude of 5.0 V before the injection of sodium Ringer’s solution statistically significently different than that of the mean of the amplitude before the infection (t_stat = 4.93, d.f. = 2, P = 0.039).

Discussion:
My hypothesis that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase was not supported by our data. At high stimulus amplitudes (4.0 and 5.0 V), the amplitude of the muscle was lower when the sodium Ringer’s solution was injected into the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle. A study was done by Fenn, Cobb, and Marsh on the effects of sodium and potassium on frog’s sartorius muscles. Frog’s sartorius muscles were soaked in sodium and potassium solutions and the results found that the sodium content of normal frog muscles is relatively not diffusible through the muscle fibers [Fenn: 1934]. These results could explain why our data had such varied results because the excess sodium could not diffuse into the muscle fibers and cause higher muscle contractions like we originally thought.
