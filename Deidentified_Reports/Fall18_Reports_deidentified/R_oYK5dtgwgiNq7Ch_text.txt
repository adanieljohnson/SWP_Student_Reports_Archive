Title: Effects of Tetraethylammonium on Rana Pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle Relaxation

Abstract:
A chemical known as tetraethylammonium demonstrated potassium-blocking properties in a previous experiment. Additionally, previous experiments have administered an electrode stimulus in the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana Pipiens by stimulating the sciatic nerve and causing muscle contractions. Based on these experiments, the group hypothesized that if 0.1 mL of tetraethylammonium was injected into the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana Pipiens, the relaxation period of the muscle contraction would be longer than when it was under control circumstances. This was carried out by gathering 3 individual legs and placing electrodes into the Gastrocnemius muscle. A control voltage to be given by the FT-302 was determined per leg based on myogram consistency. For each leg, the group recorded the relaxation period 5 times, injected tetraethylammonium, then recorded another 5 trials. The group discovered that the average relaxation period for treatment trials was longer than that of the control for all 3 legs. This is shown by a two-sample, paired T-test that yielded a greater mean relaxation period for the treatment group.  However, the P-value was 0.09 (cutoff 0.05), therefore data was not statistically significant.  Overall, the alternate hypothesis was partially supported.

Introduction:
Neurons transmit their signals through what are known as action potentials.  This action potential is initially caused by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which then binds with receptors on the membrane of a muscle fiber.  This is because the binding of acetylcholine to postsynaptic receptors allows sodium ions to enter the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels and potassium ions to leave as the cell begins to depolarize.  This is followed by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels that allow potassium to come back into the cell and sodium flows back out, contributing to repolarization.  This occurs in local currents all the way down an axon of a neuron until the action potential arrives at a neuromuscular junction within muscle fibers.  The action potential causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The release of calcium ions activates contraction of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018].  Furthermore, in a previous study, a group of scientists explored the function of a chemical called tetraethylammonium on molluscan neurons.  Their results indicated that this chemical may have an effect on the action potentials of neurons by delaying potassium from both leaving and re-entering the cell [Hermann: 2018].  In Rana Pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog, the neuromuscular junction lies in the leg of the frog between the Sciatic nerve and the Gastrocnemius muscle.  This is where nerve impulses that will stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle to contract will pass through.  Frog muscles have been stimulated using external electrodes on the Sciatic nerve by other scientists [Johnson: 2018].  Our group’s experiment wants to mimic the action potentials and contractions just as these scientists have done while also testing the effect of tetraethylammonium on the contraction and relaxation of the gastrocnemius muscle.  If a control voltage (specific to each Rana Pipiens leg) and 0.1 mL of tetraethylammonium are administered to the Gastrocnemius muscle, the group hypothesizes that the relaxation period following muscle contraction will take longer than one without tetraethylammonium.  The Rana Pipiens is the preferred organism for this experiment due to the time it takes to dissect and prepare along with its consistency in producing measurable muscle contractions.


Materials and Methods:
First, the group gathered 3 amputated Rana Pipiens legs and cut off outside skin.  The group then prepared the Gastrocnemius muscle in each leg by cutting connective tissue to free up the Sciatic nerve and other parts of the muscle.  The cut end of the Gastrocnemius muscle was tied by a string to an FT-302 force transducer at a length with no slack and the other end was pinned to the base work station for stability.  Electrodes were lightly inserted into the muscle and connected to the FT-302.  The group calibrated the machine and then administered impulses at various voltages for the first frog leg in order to view what voltage would yield the most consistent contractions, therefore deeming this voltage the control voltage for that specific leg.  The contraction and relaxation times (in milliseconds) were recorded for five trials at this control voltage.  The group then injected 0.1 mL of tetraethylammonium via syringe into the Gastrocnemius muscle, waited, and then administered the control voltage for five different trials.  In total, the contraction periods, relaxation periods, and amplitudes of every muscle contraction in both control and treatment groups were recorded and compared as this procedure was repeated for the other two frog legs.  The average relaxation periods for each Rana Pipiens leg in both control and treatment trials were calculated and graphed.  These values were inserted into a two-sample, paired T-test.  The group’s significance cutoff value was a P-value of 0.05.


Results:
Figure 1 shows that the average relaxation period for all 3 frog legs was greater following the injection of Tetraethylammonium than it was under control circumstances.  Each required a different control voltage to be administered and varied in age and size.  The average relaxation period for leg 1 after treatment was 52 milliseconds longer than the control.  This average relaxation time was also 25 milliseconds longer post-treatment for leg 2 and 86 milliseconds longer for leg 3.  The overall average relaxation time of the 3 legs was 122 milliseconds under control circumstances and 176.33 milliseconds post-treatment.  Two sample, paired T-test results yielded a mean of the treatment data that was higher than the mean of the control data.  The P-value was 0.09, degrees of freedom were 2 and the T-value was 3.07.


Discussion:
As a previous study demonstrated that tetraethylammonium had a delaying effect on both the exit and re-entry of potassium ions, it is possible that tetraethylammonium had a similar effect on our group’s data as well [Hermann: 2018].  If tetraethylammonium does, in fact, delay potassium ions, this would most likely affect the action potentials of neurons and therefore the corresponding responses in organ fibers such as muscles.  The group hypothesized that, given the potential potassium blocking properties of tetraethylammonium, the muscle contractions of the Rana Pipiens’s Gastrocnemius muscle would take longer to go through their relaxation period.  This would, theoretically, be due to the prevention of potassium ions from being allowed to re-polarize the action potential at a normal rate.  After analyzing our data, it is fair to say that the group’s alternate hypothesis is partially supported and that the null hypothesis is not.  While the relaxation times varied significantly between frog legs, they all demonstrated a longer average relaxation period following tetraethylammonium injection.  Additionally, this variance of values between frog legs may be attributed to their different sizes, ages, and other properties.  No two frog legs are the same.  The group’s T-test results indicate that the mean relaxation period following treatment was longer than the relaxation period of the control trials.  However, the T-test does not demonstrate that the data is statistically significant and there is a possibility that this occurred due to chance.  In terms of possible error, there may not have been exact 0.1 mL doses of tetraethylammonium given across the board.  Additionally, it is reasonable to mention that the process in which the group determined a control voltage to administer to each individual frog could have seen some form of human error.  The next logical step in this experiment would be to repeat these steps given another set of frog legs in order to reaffirm the group’s findings.  Another logical step would be to test different quantities of tetraethylammonium and their corresponding effect, along with testing this chemical on the relaxation periods of other muscles in different organisms.  This would open the door for a broader analysis of both tetraethylammonium as a potassium-blocking chemical and on the neuromuscular responses that occur in various organisms.  Overall, the responses of neurons and muscles to chemicals such as tetraethylammonium are very complex and were explored in a highly-specific and isolated setting during this experiment.
