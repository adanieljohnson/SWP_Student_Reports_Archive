Title: The Effect of pH on Photosynthetic Rate in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to determine the effect of pH on photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea because pH has an effect on the speed at which enzymes perform catalytic processes. Photosynthetic rate was measured through absorption rate using a spectrophotometer using light with a wavelength of 600 nm. The absorbance was compared for 3 groups: pH 3 solution, pH 5 solution and a neutral pH controll group, all containing 3 tubes each. The neutral pH group was found to have the highest average percent change at 22.37% so it had the highest rate of photosynthetic activity followed by the pH 5 group (14.80%) and the pH 3 group (58.83%). This supported the hypothesis but the data was found to not be statistically significent because the p_value calculated by the ANOVA test was 0.616.

Introduction:
In this experiment, Spinacia oleracea (spinach) is studied in order to determine
whether or not a more acidic (lower pH) solution would inhibit the rate of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of a plant. In order to do this, absorbance at 600 nm is compared utilizing the use of DCIP for a controll group with neutral pH, a group using pH 3 solution and a group using pH 5 solution. Photosynthesis is a process that plants undergo in order to create energy from light and to omit oxygen into the atmosphere. The equation for the process is 6 CO2 + 12 H2O  C6H12O6 + 6 H2O + 6 O2. During photosynthesis, the light dependent reactions create a proton gradient which in turn allows for ATP synthesis. This group of reactions is commonly split into two different systems. The first system is referred to as Photosystem II where light energy causes electrons to leave chlorophyll and move to plastoquinone, a copper-containing protein. Oxidized chlorophyll causes the cleavage of water molecules to produce oxygen and more electrons, replacing the ones lost due to chlorophyll. Then, lone H+ ions left from water are pumped out across the thylakoid membrane. Electrons are moved from reduced plastoquinone to cytochrome b6f to plastocyanin. While this occurs, cytochrome b6f transports protons across the thylakoid membrane and contributes to the gradient. The second system is photosystem I where energy carried by photons is used to excite electrons on chlorophyll molecules. The excited electrons leave the chlorophyll and travel to NADP+ in order to produce NADPH, the reduced form of NADP+. Finally, the electrons that leave the chlorophyll molecules in Photosystem I are replaced by electrons carried by plastocyanin from Photosystem II. The  photosynthetic rate of the chloroplasts is measured using DCIP, a Hill reaction reagent. DCIP can be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis because when it is exposed to light, it loses its color due to reduction. DCIP acts as a substitute for NADP+, the final electron carrier in photosynthesis in the Hill reaction and as DCIP is reduced, the resulting increase in light transmittance can be measured using a spectrophotometer (Hieke: 1979). At low pHs, the rate of reduction of DCIP is slower compared to a neutral or basic pH (Haraguchi: 1996). This means that photosynthetic rate will be slower in acidic conditions. Therefore, it is hypothesized that as the pH is lowered, the photosynthetic rate will go down as well, as indicated by the most negative percent change in absorbance. 


Materials and Method:
First, obtain a mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker and place 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes in ice. Then, remove the central veins from spinach leaves and then add the leaves to the mortar and pestle. Add 10 Ml of grinding buffer and grind spinach until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaf remaining add an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, then mix with the spinach and pour the resulting solution through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Transfer this into a centrifuge tube and spin for 10 minutes then pour out supernatant into separate centrifuge tube. Spin this for 10 minutes and then pour out that supernatant into tube, leaving the pellet alone. Suspend the pellet with normal grinding buffer and then separate into 3 tubes equally. Next, add 4 Ml of pH 3 buffer to one centrifuge tube, 4 Ml of pH 5 buffer to another centrifuge tube, and 4 Ml more of grinding buffer to the last (controll) centrifuge tube. Spin these for 10 minutes, and resuspend each pellet with 20 Ml grinding buffer after pouring out the supernatant. Transfer 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuge tubes using a micropipette. Separate into three sections of 3 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube empty of chloroplasts to serve as the blank (10 tubes in all). Add 6Ml of H2O to all tubes except for the blank and add 8 Ml to that. Add 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP to all tubes except the blank and add 2Ml of reaction buffer to all tubes. Allow each tube to sit for 10 minutes and measure absorbance. This process should be repeated twice. The statistical test used in this experiment to determine statistical significance is an ANOVA statistical test. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the average percent change in absorbance between 30 minutes and 10 minutes in the 3 tubes (data was not calculated at 0 time) for pH 3 was -58.833 +/- 138.443%. The average percent change for pH 5 was 14.8 +/- 6.242%. Lastly, the average percent change for the controll group with neutral pH was 22.37 +/- 17.216% . An ANOVA test was used to determine whether or not the results were statistically significent. The test determined that the p_value between all the pH values was 0.616. This number is greater than 0.005 so the results of this experiment were statistically insignificent. The error bars of all three pH groups overlap so this also shows that the difference in means for each experimental group is not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
The results from this experiment exemplify several patterns about the effect of pH on photosynthetic rate in spinach. The alternate hypothesis that the rate of photosynthesis would decrease as the pH was lowered was rejected because the p_value calculated determined that the results were not statistically significent. The controll group had the most consistent decline in absorbance and the DCIP became the most colorless so it had the most photosynthetic activity. Nevertheless, the ANOVA test determined that all of the data calculated was not significent. This means that the controll group had the highest percent change and therefore, the most photosynthetic activity followed by pH 5 and lastly, the pH 3 group. The key enzyme used in photosynthesis is RuBisCO and it functions optimally at a pH of 8 (Banas: 2017). When the pH is lowered to suboptimum levels, the enzyme slows down. There are also many other enzymes in the photosynthetic process, most of which slow down due to a change in pH (Banas: 2017). This is compounded by a study which shows that optimum pH levels for spinach chloroplasts are between 7.8 and 8.2 (Huber: 1979). Another study shows that K+ exiting from the stroma is associated with a lowered stromal pH (Wu: 1991). This establishes a correlation between K+ movement across the chloroplast envelope and photosynthetic rate. When pH is more acidic, K+ movement is slowed down and photosynthesis is slowed as well. For all of these reasons, pH is observed to have a direct correlation with photosynthetic rate, confirming the relevancy of this study. However, because the data was insignificent, no results can be drawn from this study. More specifically, tube 1 in pH 3 had a negative 247% change and was a statistical outlier. This could have been due to chloroplast death or human error (using the wrong amounts of pH buffer solution for this tube). In the future, more tubes would be used for each experimental group and there could be a group under basic conditions in order to compare the effects of basicity and acidity on photosynthesis.
