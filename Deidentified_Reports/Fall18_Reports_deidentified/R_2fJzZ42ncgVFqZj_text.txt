Title: Effects of Ecdysone (20E) Hormone inhibition on Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Abstract: Manduca Sexta caterpillars rely on Ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone to regulate their development from a caterpillar into a pupa, and eventually an adult moth. Ecdysone is responsible for causing growth in the larvae, while JH is responsible for preventing the caterpillar from molting at each instar, and instead causing them to gain weight. Aza-guard is a known ecdysone blocker that can be added to the food of Manduca Sexta. If aza-guard is given in large quantities to Manduca Sexta, they will not receive Ecdysone and will only have JH regulating their development. A controll group with 4 caterpillars fed each 10 grams of unaltered food daily, compared to a treatment group with 4 caterpillars each fed 10 grams with 10 drops of aza-guard daily will gain weight very differently. The controll group increased their weight rapidly, while the treatment group gained weight slowly and gained significently less. A two-sample t_test determined the treatment average was statistically less than the controll. The effects of Ecdysone become clear from this experiment, however, the amounts of Ecdysone needed to initiate a molt remain uncertain and can be explored more in depth. 

Introduction:
Introduction: Insects, such as caterpillars, rely heavily on hormones to regulate their internal conditions. Caterpillars develop through multiple instars, and eventually pupate to turn into an adult moth. In order to pupate precise amounts of Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone (20E) must be released. When Ecdysone is released the caterpillar grows in preparation for the molt, but the high levels of JH still being released prevent the caterpillar from molting and only cause it to gain weight. H. Fredrick Nijhout performed an experiment with Manduca Sexta assessing the effects of infusions of B-ecdysone in the presence and in the absence of JH [Nijhout: 1975]. Our experiment tweaks this experiment, by instead testing what happens when you block ecdysone all together. Adding a high dosage of aza-guard will cause our experimental group to gain less weight than our controll group therefore preventing a molt. 

Materials and Method:
Method: 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars were obtained and randoMly placed in either controll or treatment containers. Each caterpillar was weighed and the weight was recorded in grams. Each of the 4 controll group caterpillars were given 10 grams of food. 10 grams of food was weighed for each of the 4 experimental group caterpillars as well, however, 10 drops of aza-guard were also added to each 10 grams of food. Both containers of caterpillars were placed in the incubator and kept at a constant temperature. The weights of each caterpillar was recorded daily over the span of a week. After obtaining our data, we conducted a two-sample t_test in order to determine if the difference in weight between our controll average and experimental average was significent. 


Results:

The time is represented on the x-axis, and the average weight of each group (dependent variable) is represented on the y-axis. Both groups increased in weight from the start of the experiment, however, the controll group showed a significently larger increase than the treatment group.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment indicate that a high dosage of aza-guard caused Manduca Sexta caterpillars to gain a smaller amount of weight than the controll group. The average of the treatment group was statistically less than that of the controll group (t_stat=1.832863, d.f.=22, P=0.040196). Aza-guard prevented the treatment group from receiving ecdysone being released from the PTTH. Ecdysone causes the caterpillars to prepare for a molt which involves increasing in weight in order to prepare for pupation. Without ecdysone, the treatment group was only receiving JH which keeps their weight relatively stable and prevents a molt. The controll group was able to molt and pupate by the end of the experiment because they received a spike in ecdysone levels, which is known to initiate pupation. While they gained a significent amount of weight early on, these levels fell because their bodies released liquid in order to prepare for the molt. The average maximum weight of the controll and the treatment was compared in order to show that overall, the controll group gained more weight than the treatment, despite this loss of liquid. The treatment group was unable to receive the spike due to the high levels of azaguard in their system, and therefore did not pupate. It is evident that ecdysone is crucial in the molting and pupation process of Manduca Sexta, but this experiment does not display how much ecdysone is needed to initiate pupation. A continuation of this study could instead inject different amounts of ecdysone to determine what level of ecdysone is needed to initiate a molt [Nijhout: 1975].
