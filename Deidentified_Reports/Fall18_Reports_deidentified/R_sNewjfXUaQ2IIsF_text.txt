Title: The impact of the injection of calcium on the muscle twitch amplitude of the Rania pipiens

Abstract:
	The Rania pipiens is a frog that uses its strong hind legs to leap for prey, and hop around. The neuromuscular system in its body uses neurons to communicate and produce muscle movement. Calcium is an integral part of the complex system and is needed for the neurons to pass on the electrical message of the action potential to the next neuron. Calcium is also necessary for the muscles to contract. We hypothesized that by injecting the frog leg with calcium, the frog leg muscle twitch amplitude would increase. This hypothesis was made because calcium uptake by the neurons stimulates the release of the neurotransmitters, which in turn signals the muscles to contract. Our findings did not reject the null hypothesis and the calcium injection did not cause a significent difference in the two sets of data giving us a p_value of 0.5902.


Introduction:
The Rania pipiens, otherwise known as the northern leopard frog, is a species that is native to parts of the United States of America and of Canada. When hunting, the northern leopard frog waits patiently and the lunge out with their muscular legs, grabbing the prey in their mouth. These muscles in their legs are controllled by motor neurons sending an action potential down to the muscles in the frog’s leg. Neurons in the muscular system communicate through acetylcholine, which is released by an oncoming action potential. As the action potential comes down the axon, the calcium is stimulated to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium is necessary for the action potential to transmit from the presynaptic axon terminal to the postsynaptic dendrites. When the calcium enters the presynaptic axon terminals, it caused the vesicle sacs filled neurotransmitters to become part of the axon’s membrane and release the neurotransmitters into the synaptic gap. As the neurotransmitters bind to the postsynaptic dendrite, calcium rushes into the dendrite. So, when the calcium is released, the muscle fiber is contracted and is shortened. In previous study, calcium among other molecules necessary to complete a muscle contraction, were either blocked or increased by means of injection. If calcium was blocked by an inhibitor, no action potential would fire and the muscle would not be contracted [Augustine G.J. : 1987]. In another study, a giant squid axon injected with calcium did trigger the release of transmitters [Miledi R. : 1973]. Because the squid axon was triggered to release to release acetylcholine by the injection of the calcium, we hypothesize that if 100 mM of calcium is injected into the frog leg then the muscle twitch amplitude will increase.


Materials and Method:
To begin this experiment, we took three frog legs and separated the inner thigh muscle, the gastrocnemus, and freed the white sciatic nerve and the blood vessels with it.  We then cut the muscle towards the foot, as to have it only attached to the upper part of the leg. We then tied the muscle so it was straight up, perpendicular to the rest of the frog. Then, two metal conductors were inserted into the strung up muscle of the frog leg. We also pinned the rest of the leg down using metal pins; it is very important that the metal pins did not come into contact with the metal voltage conductors. Using the LabScribe toolbar, we set the values on the application to: # of pulses (1), Frequency (1Hz), Width (5ms). Shocking the frog leg with these settings allowed us to find our muscle twitch amplitude for the basis of the experiment. We shocked the leg three times at that threshold amplitude and recorded the voltages for each shock. Then we injected the leg with the calcium and waited for 6 minutes to let the calcium disperse through the leg. We injected the frog leg in multiple locations to help the calcium spread faster and more evenly. We then shocked the same leg three more times and compared those numbers to the numbers that did not have the calcium. We ran this cycle twice more until the three frog legs have been shocked before and after injection of the calcium. We ran a paired t_test on our data with an alpha value of 0.05.


Results:
We recorded the voltage of the shocks in the frog leg before and after the calcium injection. As shown in Figure 1, the difference in voltage between the controll and experimental was never more than 0.1. Frog leg three had the largest difference out of the three that were tested. Our average difference was 0.0176 +/-. We had a degree of freedom of 2. Our t-value was 0.6352 and our p_value was 0.5902.


Discussion:
We were not able to disprove our null hypothesis. Our p_value was above the alpha value and therefore our data was not statistically significent. We believe that this possibly happened because the introduction of more calcium did not lower the threshold, but made more calcium available to be used over a period of time, which would have extended the duration of the twitch, which we were not measuring. Eventually, the effect of more calcium added into the Rania pipiens leg would plateau, and the addition of more calcium would have no impact on the firing of the action potential and the muscle twitch [Miledi R. : 1973]. Inactivation of the presynaptic calcium channels could also be an issue causing our experiment to go awry. Inactivation becomes an issue when depolarization of the cell lasts for several seconds or the amount of calcium is abnormal or the identity of the ion in the channel is also abnormal [Augustine G.J. : 1987]. Understanding that the addition of calcium in the axon does not have an overall impact of the twitch amplitude allows us to make other assumptions. The balance between all the chemicals involved could be what is optimal for the muscle twitch amplitude, or it could be another chemical that is more responsible for the increase of the muscle twitch amplitude. Going forward in testing, we could try to up the concentration of the calcium injected or try to increase another molecule that is critical to the contraction of the muscles.

Figure 1: The effect of injecting calcium into the Rania pipiens leg muscles. Frog legs that did not receive calcium injections (blue bars) and frog legs that were injected with the calcium (orange bars) both were shocked with the same amplitude. There were 3 frog legs that were shocked a total of 6 times each. Average difference was 0.0176 +/-.
