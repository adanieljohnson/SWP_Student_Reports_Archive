Title: The influence of azadirachtin on the pupation of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, we weighed Manduca Sexta larvae for two weeks. They were fed with the hormone azadyrachtin. We analyzed the influence of this hormone on the change of weight and the holometabolous cycle of the Manduca Sexta. Our hypothesis is that Manduca sexta given food mixed with azadirachtin will cause a greater larvae growth than the Manduca Sexta that get normal food. This means the weight of the caterpillars in the experiment group will increase more than those in the controll group. Overall, the caterpillars gained weight in the first week but began losing weight in the second week. Concerning the life cycle of the caterpillars, most of them started pupating in the second week. However, one caterpillar in the controll group pupated after three days and one Manduca Sexta fed with azadirachtin didn’t pupate in the two weeks of our experiment. Nearly every caterpillar was showing signs of commitment pulses during the last days of the experiment. We saw that azadyrachtin made most of the caterpillars pupate quicker, but that their mass decreased over time. We also related this observation to the use of azadirachtin as a pesticide, because azadirachtin repels insects from plants. 

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta is a caterpillar with a holometabolous life cycle. The growth of this insect is regulated by hormones; including Juvenile Hormone (JH). In this experiment, we will use the hormone azadirachtin to study the influence on the last-instar larvae of the Manduca Sexta. Azadirachtin is an insect growth regulator (IGR). This means it affects the physiological regulatory processes of the insect, which are essential for its development. In the Journal of Insect Physiology [Schlüter: 1985], we can find that azadirachtin exerts a dose- dependent weight-gain reduction in fifth-instar larvae. Individuals treated with lower doses entered the wandering stage for the most part while treatment with high doses elicited slipping of the head capsule in order to form an additional larval stage (6th stage) in about half of the cases. Individuals who got the low doses, pupated for the most part but these pupae showed severe deformations in the sheaths of the head appendages, the thoracic extremities and the wings. The sheaths of the latter did not cover those of the leg and the ventral part of the thorax as they normally do. Some could not free themselves from the exuvia and most had defects in organs. A high dosis of the hormone would lead to an uncomplete development, moulting to supernumerary larvae or dying as larvae. Our hypothesis is that Manduca sexta given food mixed with azadirachtin will not be able to pupate and will cause a greater larvae growth than the Manduca Sexta that get normal food, because they will continue growing without pupating. This means the weight of the caterpillars in the experiment group will increase. This would happen because azadirachtin is an ecdysterone (20E) blocker, so it should prevent the spikes in 20E that correspond with molts or the start of pupation. Since JH is still present, they will continue to grow in their larvae phase. 

Materials and Method:
First, we placed each of 8 Manduca Sexta larvae in separate containers: 4 caterpillars (experiment group) will receive 10g of food each, mixed with azadirachtin in the amount of 6 drops per every 10g. The 4 remaining caterpillars (controll group) will receive 10g of food each, but with 6 drops of distilled water instead of azadyrachtin. We weighed each caterpillar every day for two weeks. As the food dried out, we replaced it in the same manner and amount as was originally done. We ran a one-tail two-sample t_test.

Results:

The average change in mass of the controll group, in grams is 1.0175 +/- 1.18719207. In the experiment group, the average mass change in grams is -1.4325 +/- 0.36178953. The one-tail p_value is 0.00084253 and the t-value counts 2.35336343. The degrees of freedom in the one-tail two-sample t_test were 3. As a general trend, we could see that the caterpillars from both groups got heavier throughout the beginning of the experiment, but lost weight in the last days. The weights of the controll group increased quicker than those of the experiment group and wo of the caterpillars fed with azadirachtin lost weight in the first week. In matters of the holometabolous cycle of the Manduca Sexta during our experiment, the first caterpillar to pupate was one in the controll group, after three days. Most of the remaining caterpillars started pupation in the second week, except for one caterpillar in the experiment group who didn’t pupate during the two weeks of our experiment. After one week, every caterpillar was showing signs of commitment pulses, except for one in the controll group.


Discussion:
The stats are significent because the p_value was less than 0.05, so the null hypothesis is rejected. As cited in Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology [Huang:2004], Azadirachtin is used as a botanical insecticide. It affects a wide variety of biological processes, including reduction of feeding, suspension of molting, death of larvae and pupae, and sterility of emerged adults in a dose-dependent manner. However, the caterpillars we fed with azadirachtin were still able to pupate. This means our hypothesis isn’t supported. There was still one caterpillar in the experiment group who didn’t pupate. A reason for that could be that this one caterpillar was the lightest of the experimental group in the beginning of the experiment. This could lead to a slower pupation because there is less body mass, leading to less capacity to grow, maybe because he wasn’t able to eat as much food as the other caterpillars. There is also a possibility that the data wasn’t recorded precisely enough, because we weren’t able to weigh the caterpillars for three days due to weather circumstances. These three days were in the second week of our experiment, the tenth until the thirteenth. Tobacco hornworms are a struggle for tobacco farmers, that’s why azadirachtin can help them, because it has antifeedant effects on insects and other arthropods. The overall trend was a loss in weight of the caterpillars, this is because azadirachtin decreases the protein level in Manduca Sexta [Huang:2004]. Proteins are crucial in the development of organisms to make up body components and support body functions.
