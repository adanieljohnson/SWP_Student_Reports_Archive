Title: Vibration and Agonistic Behaviors in Male Betta splendens

Abstract:
Betta splenden males are known for their aggressive behaviors towards other B. splenden males. Many fish are subject to numerous different sounds due to their environment, and sounds are vibrations. During this experiment, aggressiveness was observed to determine if it would increase with vibration during various scenarios using male B. splendens. An electric toothbrush was used to generate vibration, and the fish were put into their own corridor of the tank.  The hypothesis was not supported, and the fish responded negatively toward vibration. Each of the fish showed signs of significantly less aggression than before the fish was vibrated. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to analyze the ethology of B. splendens, and to understand when they become most aggressive. B. splendens display certain types of agonistic behaviors. The behaviors that they display are categorized as intraspecific, which includes broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are displayed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. Each of these movements increase in aggression being displayed by the B. splenden: 1) pelvic fin flickering, 2) tail beating, 3) and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. Three facing movements that B. splendens display and are also movements of increasing aggressiveness are: 1) the first occurs when the fish faces its opponent with pectoral fins erect, and usually at the same time, 2) the opercula spreads, and 3) the most aggressive facing behavior being when the male B. splenden protrudes it’s branchiostegal membrane under the opercula [Johnson: 2018]. The electric tooth brush was used to simulate vibration because in the B. splenden environment, boats and other sounds and vibrations account for a large part of their environment. “While these reports, and a handful of research studies, have primarily focused on marine mammals, several have raised the issue that sounds that potentially affect marine mammals may also affect other aquatic organisms including fishes and invertebrates [Popper et al. 2004]. If a B. splenden has its water vibrated, then it will respond more aggressively toward the other male fish.

Materials and Methods:
First, four fish and an electric toothbrush were collected. A tank that had three equally spaced corridors with white partition between each living space was also collected, and water along with the fish were added to that tank, and an additional water filled tank was also collected. Then the four fish were separated into two pairs. All fish were males, and they were each numbered. The fish were then left to rest for 5 minutes by themselves, and intraspecific behaviors were recorded. Then the toothbrush was turned on for the vibration effect and placed into one fish from each pair’s water for 2 ½ minutes. Then, the middle white partition was removed, and both males could interact with one another for five minutes, still being in separate compartment, and then had another break of 5 minutes. Both male B. splendens then had their water vibrated, and after 2 ½ minutes, they were to interact for 5 more minutes. A last 5-minute break was given, and then another 2 ½ minute observation was taken after two male fish had been relocated into the one compartment tank.  Each action was recorded either under broadside movements or facing movements. Then, based off of each fish’s action, their behavior was recorded using the classification for broadside or facing movements with 1 being least aggressive, 2 for mid-aggressive, or 3 for most aggressive A paired t-test was used to analyze their behavioral data after vibration was recorded compared to the aggressiveness prior to vibration.

Results:
The average facing and broadside movements that were displayed by the fish was significantly greater before vibration than after (t-stat = 5.53, df = 3, p = 0.012). Figure 1 illustrates that the second fish was most aggressive. This fish showed a higher aggressive index before vibration (4.8 +/- 0.25) than after vibration (1.93 +/- 0.66). Similar results were shown for the other three fish (Fig. 1).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that B. splendens would be more aggressive if their water was vibrated, was not supported. Legardère demonstrated that sand shrimp (Crangon crangon) exposed in a sound proof room to noise that was about 30 dB above ambient for three months demonstrated decreases in both growth rate and reproductive rate [Legardère:1982]. Which could aid in the reason the hypothesis was not supported. Agonistic behaviors were shown more before vibration than after. There are few studies analyzing vibration on fish behavior, and some of these studies are sound based which also aids in understanding that vibration have a large impact on the agonistic behaviors male B. splendens display. Throughout the experiment, the fish showed less aggressiveness in response to swimming in a somewhat vibrated area. It was observed that sometimes the fish displayed less aggressiveness rather than more after being vibrated for two and a half minutes.
