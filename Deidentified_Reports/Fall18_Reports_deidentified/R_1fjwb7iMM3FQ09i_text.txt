Title: Effects of Temperature on Resource Allocation in Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum)

Abstract:
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a common agricultural plant in temperate environments and is essential to many farmers for resetting fields before ach growth season. This experiment was conducted to find out the effects that different temperatures have on two-week old seedlings to see which would be most effective for plant growth. This was measured by controllled growing of seedlings so that we could measure the resource allocation, how plants create stable living environments within based on their current external environment, in the buckwheat. A root:shoot ratio allows this to be measured physically. We took root:shoot ratios from length and weight of the seedlings to show which temperature would be more effective for growth. There was no significent difference found in this ratio for length or width at temperatures of 20°C and 28°C 

Introduction:
We observed the effects of temperature on buckwheat plants (F. esculentum). The temperature range that buckwheat grows optimally at is between 20-26°C [Gładyszewsk:2009]. A temperature of at least 7-8°C is required for germination of buckwheat seeds to begin and the highest temperature for seedling success has been found at a peak of 45°C [Gładyszewsk:2009]. If the environment’s temperature has a significent effect on buckwheat growth, then the manner in which these plants allocate their resources in both a cold temperature environment and a warm temperature environment would change. Resource allocation and energy allocation are the ways in which a plant responds to its environment by directing its resources into different portions of growth to maintain optimal nutrients and an environmental balance. Energy allocation can be measured phenotypically. These phenotypic, or physical changes, are representative of the phenotypic plasticity, the organism’s ability to change its growth pattern over time and can be measured by taking the weight and mass of the roots and shoots of each plant and calculating a root:shoot ratio. Temperature, sunlight, and water are three of the main abiotic, nonliving, factors that influence a plant’s ability to photosynthesize. This therefore influences plant resource allocation. We tested whether temperature has an effect on these plants’ growth over the course of two weeks by measuring this phenotypic change. It is our hypothesis that if the buckwheat is grown in a cold environment, a larger root to shoot ratio will be measured than that for buckwheat grown in a warm temperature. 

Materials and Method:
For the experiment of the effects of temperature in F. esculentum, we first obtained 36 individual buckwheat seeds and set them aside. Then, we collected four black plastic planters to use as pots and enough vermiculate to fill each one approximately three-quarters of the way full. After the vermiculate was obtained we placed it into the pots and used a single finger to poke nine holes into the mixture. Each hole was approximately an inch and a half deep. Once we had created all of the holes in each planter, we placed a single seed into each of the holes and covered them with a small amount of vermiculate and packed it down gently. Once all the seeds were planted we obtained 200 Ml of water and 100 Ml of Miracle Grow for each of the planters. We left these planters to sit for approximately five minutes. At the end of the five minutes we placed two cold treatment planters in one tray, and the two warm planters in another tray. We then set the tray containing the cold treatment seeds into the windowsill of our lab room which is kept at 20°C. We placed the tray containing the warm seeds in a greenhouse with a temperature of 28°C. Starting the following day, and continuing every day for two weeks, we returned to each location and watered each of the planters with 100 Ml of water. After the two weeks had elapsed we brought the trays back into the lab and placed them on our table. Beginning with the treatment group, we washed the vermiculate off the roots of 12 seedlings in the tub of water, careful not to break the roots from the shoots. Each seedling was patted dry and placed onto a paper towel which we labeled with the treatment and a number to indicate which seedling each was. After collecting 12 seedlings we cut each one at the root to shoot junction and placed them onto their original paper towels. We measured the lengths and weights of each root and shoot and recorded them. After all data was collected for the groups we calculated root:shoot ratios for each plant. We only collected 10 seedlings for the warm environment because that was all that survived of our group. The data was analyzed using a two-sample unpaired t_test.

Results:
The average root:shoot ratio for length of the buckwheat grown in cold temperature, 0.472 ± 0.173, was not significently different from the average root:shoot ratio of length of the buckwheat grown in warm temperature, 0.567 ± 0.239 (Fig. 1, t_stat = 1.08, d.f. = 20, P = 0.146). The average root:shoot ratio for weight of buckwheat grown in cold temperature, 0.128 ± 0.031, was not significently different than that of the plants in warm temperature, 0.118 ± 0.044 (Fig. 2, t_stat = 0.63, d.f. = 20, P = 0.268). The plants grown in a warm temperature showed a red coloring on the majority of the length of their shoots. 

Discussion:
The results did not show a significent difference for the root:shoot ratio of length in buckwheat grown in cold temperature and buckwheat grown in warm temperature (Fig. 1). This is possibly due to the temperature difference between the environments of the two groups, 8° C. This temperature difference could also explain why there is no significent difference between the root:shoot ratio for weight between the two groups (Fig. 2). The temperature range that buckwheat grows optimally at is between 20-26°C and the lowest temperature at which it can survive has been estimated at approximately 3°C [Gładyszewsk:2009]. Our experimental temperatures could be varied to a higher extent and yield different results. Another possible explanation for the lack of a significent difference could be that we did not have an equivalent number of seedlings to measure in each group thus giving a misleading average or that our population sizes were too small to get an accurate average of the results. In our procedure different individuals watered the planters each day with 100Ml of water. Because every individual is human there is room for error in the measurement of the amount of water added and this can cause an effect on buckwheat growth as it requires a steady amount of soil moisture to survive. Flooded soil, -5kPa, and soil under drought conditions, -90kPa, lead to a severe deficit in normal plant growth for buckwheat [Yoon:2004]. The results of this study on flooding and drought conditions leading to lesser growth may be consistent with our growth patterns due to an environmental interference in our data which limited our ability to water the seedlings for three days during a hurricane. This could have placed our plants under drought conditions leading to the severe deficit in growth such as was exhibited in Yoon’s experiment. Based on our data our null hypothesis was accepted. This rejects our alternate hypothesis that buckwheat grown in cold temperature will have a greater root:shoot ratio than buckwheat grown in a warm temperature. Our next experiment should be with larger groups of seedlings at temperatures that have at least a 15°C difference to ensure significent data.
