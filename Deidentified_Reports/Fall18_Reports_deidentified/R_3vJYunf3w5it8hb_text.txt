Title: The result of excess juvenile hormone in the diet of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is most commonly found on tobacco farmland and considered a pest in its adult life. We hypothesized that by treating the tobacco hornworms with the juvenile hormone we will be able to control their life cycle by forcing them to remain in the juvenile stage and never transition into adult life. The juvenile hormone, present in Methoprene, will force the hornworm to continue growing but never reach pupation, thus preventing the life of pests. The hornworms were split into two groups; a control that was fed with a diet of food plus water and an experimental group that was fed with a diet of food plus Methoprene, a JH analog. After two weeks the hornworms fed with JH gained significantly more weight than the hornworms fed with water. The hornworms in the experimental group also never reached pupation. A one-tailed t-test gave us a p-value of 6.31 x 10(-5), supporting our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm, is native to American colonies and found in tobacco fields. As an adult, the Manduca sexta is considered a pest because it eats at the tobacco plant and destroys the crop. In order for the hornworm to transition into the adult stage from the larval stage, it must go through pupation. Before pupation, the juvenile hormone is at high levels and ecdysone is at low levels [Kiguchi :1978]. To trigger pupation, the juvenile hormone levels drop the the ecdysone levels rise. This infers that in order to keep the hornworms in their harmless larval stage, the juvenile hormone must remain at high levels. In this experiment, the methoprene hormone was used to work as a JH analog and keep the Manduca sexta juvenile. If the hornworm is exposed to such hormone in the larval stage, it will never pupate and mature into the adult stage. It will simply continue to grow in the larval stage until it ultimately dies. We hypothesize that if the tobacco hornworms are treated with JH hormone they will never reach the pupation stage and thus never become pests and reproduce. 


Materials and Methods:
We separated eight tobacco hornworms into two groups; a control group of four hornworms and a experimental group of four hornworms. The control group was fed 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water each. The experimental group was fed 10 grams of food with 5 drops of Methoprene, the JH analog hormone, each. The hornworms were stored in an incubator. The eight hornworms were weighed daily and continuously refilled on food for 14 days. Their growth and appearance was observed and recorded daily. Once the hornworm began pupation, we stopped recording weight. We used a one-tailed t test with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the significance of our data. 


Results:
At the end of the experimental period, we took the average change in weight of both groups. The average change in weight of the control group was 4.615 grams. The average change in weight of the experimental group was 11.61. The standard deviation of the control group was 0.3395 g +/-. The experimental group had a standard deviation of 1.5689 +/-. The degrees of freedom was 6. The one-tailed p-value was 6.31 x 10(-5). 


Discussion:
We rejected the null hypothesis with a statistically significant result and supported that the addition of JH analog hormone increased and accelerated weight gain and prevented pupation into the adult stage in tobacco hornworms [Kiguchi :1978]. The tobacco hornworms were able to prevent their pupation because the addition of Methoprene in the tobacco hornworms’ system prevented rising levels of ecdysone and increased levels of juvenile hormone. The constant use of the hormone in their diet kept the juvenile hormone level elevated for a long period of time giving us  desired result. However, there was a point where the hornworms body could not support it as it increased in volume and surface area. At this point in the experiment, the hornworms weight gain halted, and some even lost weight. Farmers are able to use results from this study to prevent the population of pests in their fields. If the hornworms are treated with pesticides that utilize the juvenile hormone, they will never transition into their adult stage, thus never becoming pests and furthermore, never having the chance to reproduce.
