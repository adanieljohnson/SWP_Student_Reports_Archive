Title: The Effects of Potassium on Muscle Contraction force of Frog leg

Abstract:
In this study, we tested whether the contraction force of the frog gastrocnemius muscle was affected by the addition of K+ ions.  Muscle contraction involves action potentials arriving at the neuromuscular junction and promoting sarcomere contraction.  Within this muscle contraction, ions play an important role.   To test the role of these ions in muscle contraction, the frog is an ideal candidate due to its convenient leg structure, which consists partly of the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle.  Specifically, the objective of this experiment is to determine the effect of potassium ions on the muscle contraction force.  Our hypothesis was that the contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle would change when potassium ions were added to the muscle.  However, the experienced outcome of the experiment was that there was no significant change seen in the muscle contraction force after injection of potassium ions into the gastrocnemius muscle as compared to before injection.  This could have been due to the ionâ€™s charged nature or the lack of dispersal of the ions throughout the muscle.  From this experiment we concluded that potassium ions do not have a significant effect on the muscle contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle.

Introduction:
Muscle contraction is involved in many life processes, and therefore the understanding of muscles and muscle contraction is very important for the understanding of life.  Because of this, many have studied muscle contraction and its various characteristics.  Like the Manduca sexta for insect endocrinology and the white rat for genetics, the frog is an ideal candidate to study muscle contraction and neurons because of the ease with which one can expose and test the nerves and muscles.  Therefore, the frog is as a biological subject in this experiment.  The leg of a frog contains two key parts, the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle [Johnson: 2018].  The gastrocnemius muscle contains myofibrils, which consist of sarcomeres.  These sarcomeres contain two different filaments, actin and myosin, which slide past each other as dictated in the Sliding Filament Theory, causes the muscle to contract [Squire: 2016].  On these myofibers are neuromuscular junctions, which cause the release of acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft [Johnson: 2018].  
Looking closer into the synaptic cleft, once the acetylcholine binds to its receptor, it causes the opening of sodium channels, which cause an action potential to occur [Johnson: 2018].  This action potential then travels down the length of the axon and stimulates the release of calcium, which then stimulates the contraction of sarcomeres [Johnson: 2018].  
Although this contraction occurs naturally in biological organisms, it can also be manually stimulated in two ways: through the sciatic nerve or the gastrocnemius muscle.  When contraction is stimulated through the sciatic nerve, rather than the gastrocnemius muscle, the contraction force reaches a plateau that is higher than that of the gastrocnemius muscle.  This is due to the fact that the sciatic nerve is able to reach more muscle cells than the probes that are stimulating the gastrocnemius muscle, and therefore more cells are able to contract upon sciatic nerve stimulation.  
	Within muscle contractions, ions play an important role in both the traveling of an action potential down an axon and the contractions of sarcomeres.  Within the neuron, potassium plays an instrumental role in the development of action potentials as well as muscle contraction.  One question that arises from this fact is the potential effects that the addition of extra potassium ions would have on muscle contraction.  The purpose of this experiment is to discover the effect that an excess of potassium ions would have on muscle contraction.  Our hypothesis for this experiment is that if extra potassium ions are injected into the muscle, then the contraction force will change.  This is because the concentration gradient of potassium is important to the neuron, and if that is changed, it will change the contraction force.

Materials and Methods:
First, we skinned three frog legs.  We then separated the gastrocnemius muscle from the bone and tied it to the contraction force measuring device, positioning the frog so the gastrocnemius muscle was at a 90 degree angle to the table.  With two probes inserted into the muscle, stimulated the gastrocnemius muscle directly.  We then measured the contraction force of the muscle  at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 2 volts.  We then injected 0.1 mL of a 20 mM potassium ion solution into the gastrocnemius muscle and waited five minutes for the ions to diffuse throughout the muscle.  With the ions dispersed, we repeated the same measurements of contraction force at 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, and 2 volts.  During this entire procedure, we also made sure to not move the frog leg once the first measurement had been taken, including during injection, to keep the contraction force measurement conditions constant.  After completing the total of 10 measurements on the first frog leg, we repeated them on the next two legs.  With this data, we ran a two-tailed paired t-test on the data of the contraction force at 0.5 volts to determine whether the contraction force with extra potassium ions was significantly different than the contraction force without extra potassium ions.

Results:
For the three trials, Frog 3 had the highest overall average contraction force, whereas Frog 1 had the lowest overall average contraction force, and the contraction force for all three frogs increased as the stimulation voltage increased (Fig 1).  However, the threshold for the different for the 3 separate frog legs, with some legs contracting as soon as 0.3 volts, and others as late as 1.0 volts (Fig 1).  There was no observed trend in contraction force for the legs with K+ or the legs without K+.  We chose to analyze our data collected at 0.5 volts.  For our data of contraction force at 0.5 volts, we calculated a non-significant p-value of of 0.72 (Fig 2).

Discussion:
In this experiment, we determined the effect of potassium ions on the muscle contraction force, with our hypothesis being that the contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle would change when potassium ions were added to the muscle.  However, our results did not support our hypothesis.  When looking at the presented data, there is no observable trend in the data.  We drew this conclusion because some of the with K+ values are higher, and others are lower than their paired without K+ values.  We therefore concluded that the addition of K+ ions to the gastrocnemius muscle does not significantly affect the contraction force (Fig 1).  Additionally, our rejection of the hypothesis is supported by the fact that the contraction force of the leg with extra potassium ions at 0.5 volts was not significantly different than the contraction force of the leg without extra potassium ions at 0.5 volts (Fig 2).  Because our p-value for this data was 0.72, we concluded that the contraction forces for with and without K+ at 0.5 volts were not significantly different (Fig 2).  This is most likely due to the fact that the ions did not have enough time to permeate the actual cells, and therefore the ions could have no real effect on the contraction force because they were all concentrated in one area, only affecting a few cells, which does not produce significant differences in overall contraction force.  Another possibility is that the concentration of the K+ ions was too low, so there were not enough K+ ions present to have an effect.  A source of error could have been the discrepancy of the volume of the K+ solution injected.  Because we used a syringe and not a micropipette, our volumes of solution that we injected into each leg most likely varied significantly from our goal value of 0.1 mL.  
Our results contradict previously published studies which states that both intracellular and extracellular K+ concentrations play a role in muscle contraction, so a change in K+ concentration to potentially toxic levels should have theoretically affected muscle contraction [Lindinger: 1991].  This contradiction between our results and the finding in the paper is most likely due to the fact that in our experiment, we recorded sporadic data with no trend, and this therefore implies that our data may not be reliable.  Our conclusion does not disprove the findings of the paper, however.  It only gives another conclusion drawn from data about muscle contractions.  The observed periodic and sporadic decrease in data of contraction force could have been due to the disruption of the muscle sarcomere structure by the sheer volume injected into the muscle (Fig 1).  In fact, the muscle during injection was observed to swell tremendously.  
Our next step would be to repeat this experiment, but with this time including more accuracy in the injection volume and the location of the injection.  Additionally, we would also give the ions more time to disperse throughout the muscle.  Overall, although this experiment showed that a change in K+ ion concentration did not affect the contraction force of the gastrocnemius muscle, it does offer some interesting areas of further study, including investigating: if not potassium, what ions do affect the contraction force?
