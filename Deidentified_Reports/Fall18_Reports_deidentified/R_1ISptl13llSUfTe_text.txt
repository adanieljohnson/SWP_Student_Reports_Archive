Title: The implementation of azadirachtin in the diet of Manduca sexta does not significantly affect weight gain. 

Abstract:
Hormones are largely responsible for the maturation and development of insects, such as the Manduca sexta, which was studied in this experiment. The results of supplementing azadirachtin, a 20E blocker, into the diet of Manduca sexta larvae was studied in conjunction with weight gain. We predicted the experimental group, whose diet included azadirachtin, would gain more weight than the control group. After feeding and weighing the caterpillar groups for 7 days, the average change in weight was calculated for the two groups. The results showed that the difference in average weight change was not statistically different. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected, however these results led to further research and the conclusion that azadirachtin is linked to feeding inhibition through disrupting the hormonal ratio, specifically decreasing the production of 20E. Therefore, lack of appetite is a possible cause of the difference in average weight gain shown, even though this experiment was not statistically significant. Future experiments that test the effect of differing levels of azadirachtin may be more conclusive regarding the relationship of 20E and feeding inhibition. Further research on the effects of hormone blockers, such as azadirachtin, may lead to an effective pest solution th

Introduction:
Hormones play a crucial role in the development and regulation of metamorphosis in insects, like the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Excess or an absence of certain hormones can disrupt the molting process and the insect’s transition to adulthood. In insects, the ratio of hormones such as Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) is crucial to maturation, specifically growth, molting, and metamorphosis. 20E is a steroid hormone secreted by the prothoracic glands that regulates timing of molting during insect development. An absence of 20E would disrupt the timing of molting and hormonal ratio, possibly resulting in the insect remaining in the juvenile stage [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab, we will test the effects of the presence of azadirachtin, a chemical compound that blocks the production of 20E, on weight gain of larvae. A better understanding of the relationship between 20E inhibitors, such as azadirachtin, could aid in pest controls, by safely interrupting pupation and metamorphosis. The presence of azadirachtin has been linked to molting inhibition in Locusta migratoria [Sieber 1983]. The Locusta migratoria is also in the Insecta class, however it belongs to a different order and family. It does not undergo complete metamorphosis, specifically it does not undergo the pupa stage. Will the same relationship be found when the Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to azadirachtin, and how will it affect its weight gain? Larvae unable to pupate, due to the lack of 20E production, may not be able to undergo metamorphosis but continue to eat, possibly leading to consistent weight gain. Manduca undergo a commitment pulse when there is a small rise in 20E, indicating that the caterpillar is large enough and has enough stored nutrients for pupation [Johnson: 2016]. It is possible that azadirachtin blocking the production of 20E would inhibit a commitment pulse from occurring, while the caterpillar would naturally continue to eat and store nutrients to prepare for pupation, leading to weight gain. In our experiment, the dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars, and the independent variable is the quantity of azadirachtin fed to the caterpillars. If an experimental group of larvae is given food with azadirachtin for 7 days, then they will gain more weight than the control group that is fed the same food with no azadirachtin. 

Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, 8 caterpillar larvae were separated into two groups of 4. The control group and was fed caterpillar food with drops of water, while the experimental group was fed caterpillar food with drops of AzaMax, which contains azadirachtin. The groups were separated, and the caterpillars were placed into two different plastic bins. Each plastic bin contained dividers which isolated the caterpillars to their own space and food. 10g of food per caterpillar was placed into the bins, with 7 drops of water on each control caterpillar’s food and 7 drops of AzaMax on each experimental caterpillar’s food. For 7 days, the weight of each caterpillar was recorded, observations were written down, and living spaces were cleaned daily. The food was replaced as necessary, and it was mixed and softened with a spoon before being placed into the bins. A two-sample T-test was done on the recorded data and the p value threshold used was .05.

Results:
There was an initial increase in weight gain across both groups that eventually led to continuous weight loss. The decrease in weight was sharp for the experimental group while the control group’s weight maintained high for a longer duration and the weight loss was more gradual. Shown in Figure 1, over the seven days, the average weight difference for the experimental group was +1.19g +1.49/-1.19g, while the average weight difference for the control group was +4.15g +/- 2.75g. The two bars in the figure represent the standard deviations. For the control group, the lightest starting caterpillars gained the most weight and the heaviest caterpillars at the beginning gained the least amount of weight. The experimental group displayed a similar trend and the heaviest experimental caterpillar, number 4, was the only caterpillar to have a net loss in weight. On day 4, a black pulsing line along the back of the control caterpillars was observed, indicating they were undergoing the commitment pulse. On day 7, the control 3 caterpillar pupated. A two-sample t-test was done and a p-value of 0.054 was found, a t-value of 1.887 was found, and 6 degrees of freedom were used, signifying that there is not a significant difference in the results. 

Discussion:
Based on our results, the null hypothesis, that there is no statistical difference between the average weight change of the experimental group fed azadirachtin and the control group, cannot be rejected. Although the data did not provide a statistical difference in the average weight gain between the two groups, the control group displayed a larger average weight gain than the experimental group. The smaller average change in weight over the 7 days, exemplified by the experimental group, raises questions regarding the effect of azadirachtin on feeding habits. In Rhodnius prolixus, the presence of azadirachtin has been linked to indirectly cause feeding inhibition through the disruption of the endocrine system. Rhodnius prolixus is in the Insecta class along with the Manduca sexta and also undergoes metamorphosis, however it belongs to a different order and its causation of molting and metamorphosis also differs [de Souza Garcia:1984]. Due to the ability of azadirachtin to block 20E, the ratio of JH to 20E is imbalanced in the juvenile caterpillars [Johnson: 2016]. This imbalance in hormones possibly disrupts the caterpillar’s endocrine system in a similar manner to that shown in Rhodius prolixus, causing them to eat less. Therefore, decreased appetite in the experimental group, caused by azadirachtin blocking the production of 20E, is a possible cause of the decreased average weight over 7 days. Another impact of the effects of azadirachtin on the experimental group was the absence of a commitment pulse or pupation. The blockage of 20E disturbs maturation by disrupting the timing of molting and not allowing pupation [Johnson: 2016]. In the future, another study can be done with multiple experimental groups all receiving different amounts of azadirachtin in their diet, in order to better understand the relationship of its quantity provided to the effects shown. The results would help us further understand the relationship of decreased 20E levels and feeding inhibition. If this experiment was completed, we might expect a statistically significant decrease in weight gain in the experimental groups fed azadirachtin. The sample size should be larger than this lab to increase the chances of showing statistically significant results. Due to the importance of hormones in the development and metamorphosis of insects, understanding the effects of chemicals that block the hormones and manipulate the development of juveniles to pests is extremely useful in agriculture. Mastering the most efficient, safe, and effective way to disrupt the metamorphosis of insects into adult pests, will maximize crop production.
