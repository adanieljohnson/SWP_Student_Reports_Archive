Title: The effects of activation and inhibition of phospholipase C in the chemotaxis of Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a yellow slime mold that we use to test the inhibition and activation of phospholipase C in its cells. This is done through chemotaxis of the Physarum sample. We thought that the activator would have positive growth while the inhibitor would have negative growth with the control not showing any movement growth. As the results were inconclusive it is impossible to say what would have happened other than what we have stated in our hypothesis. The most likely reason for the failure of the slime mold is due to it beginning to form spores.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum spends most of its life as a yellow, flat, gooey that lives within damp decomposing leaves. It can move by using an edge to crawl using actin microfilaments, similar to other cells use of fibroblasts. It engulfs bacteria and other organic debris then transports enzymes into the vacuoles to digest them. Physarum maintains this multicellular form as long as it remains in darkness with high humidity. Small pieces of plasmodium can split off, form new organisms. Otherwise though, it continues moving around looking for food. If food is unavailable or humidity drops, the plasmodium hardens to form a suspended stage called a sclerotium. This is a hibernation state. When additional stresses like light or heat are present along with lack of food, Physarum begins its reproductive cycle. Chemotaxis of a Physarum is one of the ways to analyze its response to an outside stimulus which can be positive or negative growth. It can sense molecules in its environment, then respond by crawling toward or away from their source. We are using the activation and inhibition of phospholipase C in our experiment as it is the enzyme primarily used in the IP3 mediated signaling path which in all controls the base movements of Physarum.(Johnson, AD) The choice to use Physarum comes from the fact that it is a very simple organism that still maintains the same or similar cell signaling that is found in other living organisms, however it typically only has very simple functions such as searching for and acquiring food. We want to find out if the use of these chemicals to inhibit or activate in chemotaxis prevent growth completely or provide positive and negative results. This information can prove to be relevant as the signaling that occurs in the Physarum is the same as in human cells when broken down to the specific pathways. With this in mind if something proves to promote or inhibit a signaling pathway in Physarum it is likely to have effects on other living cells, providing possible new outlets for advancements in medicine. To find this out the understanding must be made of what the IP3 pathway does in a larger setting. With the general idea of what occurs in a chemotaxis I believe that the Physarum will grow toward the activator as it will be seen as a beneficial molecule to absorb, with the sample containing the inhibitor seeing no growth as there is no food anywhere and the Physarum will not want the inhibitor molecule.

Materials and Methods:
To start we took 6, 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water and using a Sharpie, labeled the plates. On the back, we drew three squares labeled as either blank or activator/inhibitor. On 3 plates, we wrote the name of the first test substance, A23187, the activator. On the remaining 3 plates, we wrote Neomycin, the name of the inhibitor of phospholipase C. Next, we sterilized our spatula, let it cool, then cut 3, 1 cm x 1 cm squares into the agar in each of our 6 water agar plates. We removed the block of agar on the left side and middle but left the block on the right side in place. This will be your control. We then returned the spatula to the ethanol. We then had to make our test solution plates. To do this we added 10mL each of our chemicals to two separate agar plates and let them soak for 10 minutes.  We then sterilized the spatula, and cut 3, 1 x 1cm square slabs from the first test solution agar plate. Using sterile forceps, we inserted one slab into each of the corresponding 3 plates, over the correct labeled square. This was then done with the second test solution plate. We resterilized the forceps and spatula. Then proceeded to transfer 6 of our pre-cut blocks of Physarum culture from the stock plate to the center of our 6 prepared test plates. Next, we taped the lid of each plate to hold it in place and wrapped all 6 plates completely in foil, then place the covered plates into the dark drawer overnight (18-24 hours). After the allotted time we removed our 6 plates from the dark and unwrapped the foil. Using a millimeter ruler, we measured the distance that the slime mold migrated from the initial blocks we added to the center of each plate towards the test substance. These measurements can then be changed into rates of growth for each sample.

Results:
What we expected to see from our experiment was that the Physarum would grow towards the activator at a constant rate as it would serve as a positive sign for growth. We then expected the sample containing the inhibitor to have grown away as to avoid a substance that would prevent future movement while it still searched for food. For the expected values we estimated for the graph that the activator sample grew at 0.5 mm per hour with the inhibited sample growing at the same rate simply in the opposite direction, therefore denoting the value as negative. We then assumed that the control would not grow as it would have no need to move. All of these would of course be assumed to show similar results in all replicates of the various samples. 

Discussion:
It has become quite clear that the reason for the failure to gain substantial, or truly any results, stems from something that was out of our control. Before we were aware that the problem came from the Physarum themselves, we believed that it was our experiment that prevented the growth. This was attributed to using water agar plates instead of PDA. However, in the case that the Physarum across the board were failing to grow, there is one possible answer that lies in the natural tendencies of Physarum to begin to make spores. This sporulation is caused by prolonged starvation and exposure to sunlight(Guttes et al.). As it was not every single sample of Physarum it is possible that most ran out of food one day and then when they were about to be given more food were exposed to a large amount of light. This exposure most likely began the process of sporulation and therefore made the samples inactive when exposed to our various experiments. The experiment by Wormington and Weaver also showed how this sporulation doesn’t require the Physarum to be in much of any specific condition, it simply just needs to be exposed to light to begin the process(Wormington and Weaver). This ease of initiation further shows how likely it is that this is the cause of the failure to grow the Physarum in the experiments. As for improvements and future plans for our specific experiment, first a foremost would be to do the again but with PDA so the uncertainty of food source is removed, and the results will simply be if the Physarum interacts with the inhibitors in the scenario they are placed in. Again, these findings could prove useful as it is not the Physarum we are really after, but how its signaling pathways are   affected. This information has a basis in almost all living cells.
