Title: Consuming high level of Azaguard would make Manduca sexta not entering the pupa stage and kill Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
In order to understand how hormone works in Manduca sexta, an insect in the Order Lepidoptera, we put Azaguard, an ecdysterone, in the food for the Manduca sexta. Ecdysterone controlls molting in caterpillars. When ecdysterone is present in the body of Manduca sexta, they would undergo the preparation of molting. Based on the information, we hypothesize that ecdysterone would escalate the life cycle of Manduca sexta by bring the pupa stage earlier. The caterpillars were divided into 2 groups.  Each group of caterpillars received different treatment on their food. Control group had food with water and treatment group had food with ecdysterone. We measured the weight and length every day during the experiment. The result indicated ecdysterone in Manduca sexta’s diet would not speed up Manduca sexta’s life cycle but lead to their death. The length and weight were not showing significently increasing pattern when consuming food with ecdysterone, meaning that the caterpillars in the treatment group did not have an earlier molting stage. Comparing to former study, it was found that ecdysterone would be beneficial to the Manduca sexta only if it is at a certain concentration. Too much ecdysterone may cause the body function failure and the Manduca sexta would shrink in size and die.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also known as tobacco hornworm, is an insect that belong in the Order Lepidoptera. This organism is used for the experiment due to the stable the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. Since that, we could monitor the experiment easily and test our hypothesis. Ecdysterone, a type of hormones in Manduca sexta, regulates the time of its molting. In the research that H. Frederik Nijhout conducted, there are two kinds of ecdysterone in Manduca sexta. [Nijhout: 1976] The first is responsible for the transition from larval stage to pupa stage. The second one induces apolysis and, then, follows the events that would make the Manduca sexta turning into pupation. [Nijhout: 1976] It is clear that ecdysterone plays a very important role in the molting stage.  We should be expecting that the development of the Manduca sexta would be faster for the caterpillars that consume ecdysterone, that they would be heavier and longer than those that do not consume ecdysterone. Therefore, we hypothesized that giving ecdysterone to the Manduca sexta would bring the pupa stage earlier in its life cycle, and, thus, escalating the development of the Manduca sexta.

Materials and Method:
There were eight caterpillars used for subjects in the experiment. They were divided into two groups of 4 caterpillars each, one as controll group and one as treatment group. Azaguard, one type of ecdysterone, was used to mimic the effect of ecdysterone in our experiment. Each caterpillar was put in its own spot so that they would not affect each together. We provided each caterpillar 10g of caterpillar food. For the controll group, 5 drops of water was put in each caterpillar’s food. For the treatment, 5 drops of Azaguard was put in the food. Then, the caterpillars were placed in the incubator and the weight and the length were recorded of each caterpillar for the next two weeks. If the food got low or dry, we would replace the food with the same standard for the same group – 5 drops of water in 10g of food for the controll group and 5 drops of Azaguard in 10g of food for the treatment group. After we collected all the data, we calculated the average weight of the caterpillars from one group. Two two-sample t_tests were used in the experiment to compare the average lengths and the average weights of the controll group and the treatment group. In this experiment, the dependent variable is the days that Manduca sexta entering the pupa stage. The independent variable is different treatment to the caterpillar’s food.

Results:
The caterpillars in the controll group all entered the pupa stage and the caterpillars in the treatment group all died during the experiment (around day 9). The data that we collected shows that the average weight of the caterpillars from both groups first increased the decreased. The average length of the caterpillars wasn’t changing significently in the first 4 days. Then both groups started to decrease in length. From the figure 1 and figure 2, we could see that the average weights of the controll group were larger than the treatment group during the whole experiment. The average lengths of the controll group caterpillars were the close at the first half of the experiment and the average lengths at the second half of the experiment were different. The average lengths of the controll group were smaller than the treatment group. The mean value of weight of the controll group is significently different than the mean value of the treatment group (t_stat= 3.209612, d.f.=16, p_value= 0.005466). The mean value of length of the controll group is not significently different than the mean value of the treatment group (t_stat= 0.64254, d.f.=16, p_value= 0.529623).

Discussion:
The p_value of the t_test for weight is 0.005466, which is smaller than 0.05. This states that the average weight is significently different between the controll group and the treatment group. The p_value of the t_test for height is 0.529623. This shows that the average length is significently different between the treatment group and the controll group. If our hypothesis was true, the length and the weight should both be significently different with each other. Therefore, the results of experiment did not support our hypothesis that ecdysterone would make the caterpillars enter the pupa stage earlier. The group of caterpillars that receive ecdystrone all failed to enter the pupa stage and died. The most possible reason for this circumstance is that the ecdysterone was over the normal concentration. Consuming ecdysterone everyday would increase the ecdysterone level in their body. As time progressed, the ecdysterone would be too much for the caterpillars to handle. At the beginning of the experiment, both weight and length appeared to be close to each other between the controll group and the treatment group (the weight seems different because the weight of the treatment group starts with a smaller number). However, in the latter part of the experiment, the length of the caterpillars in controll group decreased in length more than the treatment group. The reason behind this phenomenon is that the controll group shrunk and entered the pupa stage. The treatment group decreased in length due to the high concentration of ecdysterone in their body, making their body weak, and leading to the failure of entering the pupa stage. We could assume that ecdysterone does play an important role in the molting stage, but it requires the certain amount of hormone to do that. Too much ecdysterone would cause body disfunctions and lead to death. Comparing to the research that was mentioned in the introduction, Nijhout injected 40 to 100 µl of ecdysterone into Manduca sexta. [Nijhout: 1976] The volume was used in this experiment was 5 drops of ecdysterone every 5 days, which is around 150 µl. Comparing the dosage between this experiment and Nijhout’s, our experiment let Manduca sexta consumed more ecdysterone. This might be the reason why we fail to see the result we were looking for. Moreover, the Azaguard was dropped on the surface of the food, leading to Azaguard unevenly distributed in the food. The surface would contain more Azaguard then the core of the food. This could also introduce more ecdysterone in Manduca sexta’s body in a short period of time, leading to the result of death. In short, the concentration of Azaguard was too high comparing to the former study. The most promising conclusion is that only the right amount of ecdysterone injected in Manduca sexta could provide them the chance to molt earlier and not cause body function failure.
