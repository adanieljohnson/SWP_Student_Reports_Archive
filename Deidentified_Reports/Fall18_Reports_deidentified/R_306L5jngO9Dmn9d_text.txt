Title: Effect of AzaGuard on the Growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
	The physiology and behavior of Manduca sexta is impacted through chemical signals that can be induced by juvenile and ecdysterone hormones. If the production of either of these hormones is disrupted or inhibited, the organism may experience development abnormalities. It is hypothesized: if Manduca sexta consumes an ecdysterone inhibitor, AzaGuard, they will develop poorly, as compared to specimens left untreated, and fail to molt. Eight caterpillars were divided into two equal groups. The first half, the controll group, were fed a standard caterpillar diet with water. The remaining subjects, the experimental group, was given the same food as the controll group, but impregnated with 10 drops of AzaGuard (in place of water). A one-tailed, two-sample t_test and graphical analysis displayed limited and slowed growth in the treatment group as compared to the controll group. By the end of the experiment, the treatment group was less than 10% the weight and less than 50% the length of the controll group. This data affirms the initial premise, ecdysterone is critical in the maturation of Maduca sexta.

Introduction:
Hormone secretion regulates insect physiology and development. Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, exhibits a holometabolous life cycle – using hormones to initiate and regulate metamorphosis throughout a times life cycle [Johnson: 2018]. The cycle of the hornworm spans up to 48 days and consists of a series of molts known as instar larva, pupa, and ultimately immolation of an adult moth. This process is induced and controllled by chemical signals, hormones, received and dealt with in the brain. Specifically, Manduca sexta governs metamorphosis through two types of ecdysterioids, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone hormone (20E). Juvenile hormone is present during the larval stage of life, allowing for growth and progression through initial life phases. While juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt, ecdysterone hormone orchestrates the timing of molting. Disruption of these hormones will likely spur abnormalities and elimination of these hormones will likely result in death. The caterpillar is an ideal model organism to study hormone concentrations and their correlation to physiological effectiveness. Prior studies shown a brief absence of juvenile hormone will initiate metamorphosis. Another study used tissue samples from Manduca sexta which were either treated with or deprived of ecdysterone hormone. The tissue with added dosages of ecdysterone hormone underwent normal morphogenetic changes while the tissue deprived of ecdysterone showed halted insect development [Judy: 1971]. Based on published material on Manduca sexta, we hypothesize that if fed an ecdysterone inhibitor, AzaGuard, Manduca sexta will develop poorly, as compared to specimens left untreated, and fail to molt.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta of similar size/age were split into two groups for statistical comparison over 15 days. Four subjects acted as controlls and received 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water while the other four received 10 grams of food with 10 drops of ecdysterone hormone inhibitor, AzaGuard. The two groups were kept in separate habitats which has individual spaces for each caterpillar. The habitats were then stored in the same incubator. If the caterpillar food became dried out, it was replaced. If the containers became too messy, they were cleaned. Over the span of the experiment, the Manduca sexta were weighed, measured (length), and the results documented. A one-tailed, two-sample t_test was run to compare the growth between the two groups and note the importance of ecdysterone hormone and the effects when it is inhibited. 

Results:
Over the duration of the study, the experimental group, fed AzaGuard, showed reduced growth through weight and length. Additionally, the controll group was green and rounds while the experimental group was yellow/brown and shriveled. The mean weight of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 5.42, d.f. = 22, p = 9.5 x 10 -6). After the second day, the average weight of the controll group was always heavier than that of the experimental group and this gap continued to increase as the study progressed (Fig. 1). The mean length of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 6.38, d.f. = 22, p = 1.01 x 10-6). After the second day, the average length of the controll group was always longer than that of the experimental group and this gap continued to increase as the study progresses (Fig. 2). Ultimately, the experimental group’s growth was so stunted they died on the thirteenth day of the study.

Discussion:
As expected, the Manduca sexta which received the ecdysterone hormone inhibitor experienced limited physiological growth as compared to the caterpillars which were provided a normal diet. Based on accepted knowledge, this can be attributed to the crucial role ecdysterone hormone plays in the timing of insect growth [Judy: 1971]. A noticeable difference of growth on a consistent, unwavering basis allowed this same conclusion to be made. Additional research may include 1) removal of the juvenile hormone or 2) removal of the ecdysterone hormone in increments. Manduca sexta are prominent in the environment and are considered pests in the larval stage. Thus, adding ecdysterone hormone into their environment would limit the period they remained pests. Oppositely, if an ecdysterone hormone inhibitor was introduced into their environment, the species would be eliminated entirely.
