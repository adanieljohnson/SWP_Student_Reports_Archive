Title: The effect of juvenile hormone mimickers on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
Some insects can be considered pests in any distinct stage of their life cycle. Modifying the juvenile hormone levels in insects is one way of pest control. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are substances capable of mimicking JH. Subsequently, we conducted an experiment to test the effect of IGRs on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae. We hypothesized that adding IGRs to the Manduca caterpillar’s diet will result in faster growth, but will take a longer period of time to mature into an adult. Eight Manduca caterpillars were split into two groups of four. Both groups were fed 10g of food each day, however, the treatment group's food had 5 drops of IGR added to it. The caterpillars were checked on every other day for two weeks to be fed record their individual weights. After two weeks have passed, we averaged the weight change of each group and found out that the treated caterpillars barely grew faster than the control caterpillars, thus our hypothesis was not supported. Also, the caterpillars did not mature into adults. However, IGR remains to be an efficient method of pest control to be used on other species.

Introduction:
Some insects can be considered pests in any distinct stage of their life cycle. One form of pest control is the alteration of the juvenile hormone, the hormone that regulates several insect functions and their molt type, in the insect’s body system. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are substances that are capable of mimicking the juvenile hormone. IGRs were previously tested on linden bugs, resulting in a relatively low hatch rate and a drastic decrease in the chances of maturing into an adult [Tunaz: 2004]. A specific species of interest is the Manduca sexta, because juvenile hormones play a very important role in its life cycle [Johnson: 2016]. Do synthetic juvenile hormones impact Manduca development? How will they be affected? We carried out an experiment to test IGRs that mimic juvenile hormones on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that adding IGRs to the Manduca caterpillar’s diet will result in faster growth, but will take a longer period of time to mature into an adult.

Materials and Methods:
We collected eight Manduca caterpillars, all in their 3rd instar larva stage, and split them into two groups of four. Each group had a container with four cells for each caterpillar to be placed in. In addition, we punctured holes into each cell to allow air flow for our caterpillars. We weighed and stirred 10g of food to be placed in each cell for each caterpillar. Five drops of IGR were added to four caterpillars’ food using a transfer pipet, whereas the other four (control, in the other container) were given food without IGR. All caterpillars were kept in an incubator and checked on every other day for two weeks to record their individual weights and weight change in grams and clean their containers and replace their food. A two sample t-test was completed to determine if the data was statistically significant.

Results:
The results of the experiment are outlined in the figure above. In Figure 1, the graph displays the average weight change for each group of four caterpillars for the duration of the experiment. The p-value for the two-sample t-test was calculated to be 0.733 for a t-value of 0.346. 

Discussion:
After observing the Manduca sexta caterpillars and collecting data, we concluded that our hypothesis was not supported. The caterpillars that were treated with IGR barely grew faster than the control group. None of the caterpillars matured into adults over the course of the experiment, so we cannot tell if it actually takes a longer period of time for the treatment group to mature into adults than the control group. When the rising average weight change of the control group started to slow down, the average weight change of the treatment group still continued to rise at a constant rate, however, both groups’ values started to decline on the 12th day (Figure 1). The use of IGRs in integrated pest management for stored product insects may be an important factor for the long term. Manifestly, there is a critical need for these agents based on the loss of other chemical methods due to resistance and environmental considerations [Oberlander: 1997].
