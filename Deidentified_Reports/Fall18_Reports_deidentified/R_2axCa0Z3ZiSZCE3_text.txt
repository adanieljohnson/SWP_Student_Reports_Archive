Title: The effect of lanthanum chloride on calcium channel in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Rania pipiens experience neuromuscular systems unique to animals. Motor neurons connect with muscle cells at synaptic junctions. A neurotransmitter is released at the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors that depolarize the muscle cell and generates an action potential. The action potential causes a release of a calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum generating a muscle contraction. We hypothesize that if calcium channel blockers are injected into the gastrocnemus muscle then the threshold of response will increase because the calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that triggers the contractile movement is inhibited. Three Rania pipiens frog legs were used as the controll group then the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with 0.2 milliliters of lanthanum chloride and used as the experimental group. The threshold of the controll and experimental group was tested through iWorx software with a starting stimulus of 0.1V until a threshold of muscle contraction was observed. The first controll exhibited a threshold higher than than the experimental, disproving our hypothesis. However, with the second and third frog leg, the experimental groups threshold was higher than the controll. The anomaly of the first trial could be caused by human error or different neuromuscular effects of l

Introduction:
Neuromuscular systems are unique to animals: the skeletal muscle is the basis for thousands of tiny, cylindrical, fussed aggregated called myofibers. Bound through connective tissue, myofibers form functional groups which thus make up skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscles are activated by motor neurons at points called neuromuscular junctions. When motor neurons and the muscle cell interact through synapse, acetylcholine (ACh) is released. ACh then binds to receptors on muscle fiber that triggers the opening of sodium channels which then release an action potential. The spread of the action potential leads to a release of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.The release of calcium from the action potential activates the contractile mechanism and shortens the muscle causing a quick movement [Mezochow: 2010]. In this experiment, we will observe the mechanism affected with and without calcium channel blockers in frog legs from Rania pipiens. We will track the activity and response through the iWorx software. We will be observing the response of the gastrocnemus muscle. We hypothesize that if calcium channel blockers are injected into the gastrocnemus muscle then the threshold of response will increase because the calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that triggers contractile movement is inhibited. This will cause the muscles to work a lot harder because the muscle will not be triggered by great release of calcium and thus never cause the muscle to shorten. 



Materials and Method:
We used three separate frog legs from Rania pipiens and isolate the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle by separating the sciatic nerve from the muscle tissue. We cut the achilles tendon of the frog leg. The leg hung from a contraption by its achilles tendon with the sciatic nerve laying on the experimental plate with the gastrocnemus muscle extended in air. The iWorx software was connected to a BNC connector in the gastrocnemus muscle record the voltage response of the muscle to various stimuli. Three separate frog legs were used and their response was recorded from stimulus through iWorx software with no injection. The stimuli started at 0.1 V, increase by 0.1 V until the threshold was found in each separate frog leg. This group acted as the controll and the threshold of each was recorded. Then the same three frog legs were injected with 0.2 milliliters of lanthanum chloride into the Gastrocnemius muscle each. The same voltage was applied with an increase in 0.1 V until the threshold was reached. We observed the response of the three frog legs to the same stimulus and recorded the threshold again. A paired t_test was run with an alpha value of 0.5. 


Results:
Each frog leg experienced different results and thresholds. The voltage of the response was recorded through the iWorx software at stimuli of 0.1 V then increased by 0.1 V every application until the threshold was observed. The voltage of the stimuli that first caused a response of the frog leg is the threshold. Frog leg #1 controll threshold was higher than the experimental threshold by about 0.2 V as seen in Figure 1. The threshold for the experimental for frog leg #2 was greater than the controll by 0.2 V. Frog leg #3 experienced a threshold 0.1 V higher in the experimental than in the controll. A paired t_test was run with the raw data from the experiment and the t-value recorded was 0.35 with a degrees of freedom of 2. The average difference in thresholds of the frog legs was 0.053. The p_value was 0.76.  

Discussion:
We failed to reject the null hypothesis with a statistically significent result and rejected that the threshold of the response of the contractile muscle increased as a result of calcium channel blockers. When a presynaptic motor neuron is sensed by the muscle post-synaptic cell, depolarization of the presynaptic cell results in a influx of calcium in the presynaptic cell. The calcium flooding into the motor neuron causes a release of neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is released into the synaptic cleft and binds to specific receptors on the muscle cell. Once these ligand-gated ion channels are activated, sodium is allowed to flow across its concentration gradient into the muscle cell. The depolarization of the cell causes an action potential to be sent. The spread of this action potential releases calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and this release is what causes the quick muscle contraction observed in the controll group of frog legs. If a calcium channel blocker is used then this process will be halted and there will be no release of calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and thus not allowing the muscle to contract. In the first frog leg, the addition of lanthanum chloride seemed to excite the contractile mechanism rather than inhibit it. In Mezochowâ€™s study, the effect of lanthanum chloride as a calcium channel was studied in crawfish to see if it would yield the same results of another study on plants that showed lanthanum chloride as a efficient calcium channel blocker. Their results showed that lanthanum chloride did not inhibit the calcium channel in the crawfish. This discovery may indicate that the lanthanum chloride functions differently in plants or does not have the same effect on invertebrate animals. Lanthanum chloride might also have the ability to affect different neuromuscular pathways differently [Mezochow : 2010]. Due to the different responses of our frog legs, we also may be able to deduce that lanthanum chloride was able to block calcium channels in Rania pipiens and the first frog leg showed different results because of human error. The tension of the string had to be altered between the first and second frog legs which yielded different results. The first trial was compromised by human error of placement. Our hypothesis was rejected and may have been supported if we ran more trials. Use of this experiment with other inhibitors or agonists on the calcium channel would allow these theories to be further explored and further understanding of the calcium channel in Rania pipiens.

Figure 1: Thresholds of Rania pipiens legs from various stimuli. Three frog legs were used and injected with lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker. Each frog leg acted as the controll and then the experimental when the lanthanum chloride was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle. The frog leg was tested by stimuli voltage until the threshold of contractile movement was found. Each bar represents the twitch threshold in volts.
