Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Muscle Contraction in R. pipens’ Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
The interaction of ion channels regulates the contraction of skeletal muscle. In this experiment, we examined how muscle response after the direct injection of caffeine. R. pipen was selected as our study subject because it is easily obtainable and considered as an invasive species. We decided to apply the electrical stimulus of 1V, the number of pulses of 0, and the stimulus duration of 5ms on the sciatic nerve before injection of caffeine and after. A one tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the data to determine whether there is significant difference in muscle contraction between caffeine group and non-caffeine group. We hypothesized that if we artificially inject caffeine directly to the frog leg muscle, there will be greater contraction. The result indicated that there was a significant difference in voltage change in muscle contraction before and after caffeine injection. 

Introduction:
Invertebrates and vertebrates rely on neuromuscular system to respond to internal and external stimulus. We primary focus on skeletal muscle which is consisted of thousands of myofibers and the movement of each myofiber is happened on cellular level. Typically, the somatic neuromuscular system controls skeletal muscle through the interaction of different ion channels. To be more specific, in the muscular system, after acetylcholine (Ach) being released by the presynaptic nerve terminal and binding with postsynaptic receptors on muscle cells, the opening of sodium channels generates action potential, which spreads through muscle fiber to stimulate the release of Ca+2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus causing the muscle to shorten [Johnson: 2018]. Sodium channels are also worth mentioned, because sodium channels are essential in nerves signaling muscle contraction, as they open to allow large amount of sodium ions flush in during depolarization [Hodgkin: 1952]. Referring to the mechanism of muscle contraction, we tend to consider what will happen to the muscle contraction if we artificially inject some chemicals that can influence the normal operation of ion channels in the muscle fiber. From other studies, we knew that certain substances can have direct effect on skeletal muscle, as for example, some evidence shows that caffeine can improve endurance performance and delay fatigue by influencing Ca+2 release from sarcoplasmic reticulum [Rosser: 2009]. Thus, in our experiment, we decide to focus on the effect of caffeine on muscle contraction. Knowing the effect of caffeine is important as nowadays people tend to take in a fair amount of caffeine every day, so it is useful to know how it works in organism’s body and how it influences the normal operation of neuromuscular system.  R. pipen’s leg is selected as our study subject because it has sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle that are easily dissected for the experiment. We hypothesize that if we artificially inject caffeine directly to the frog leg muscle, there will be greater contraction.



Materials and Methods:
Three R. pipien’s legs were obtained, and the sciatic nerve was exposed by separating the inner thigh muscle. Achilles tendon was dissected in order to separate gastrocnemius muscle and peroneus muscle. The end of gastrocnemius muscle was tied on a string and we first determined the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation by attaching electrical probes on the sciatic nerve. After measuring the threshold, the electrical stimulus of 1V, the number of pulses of 0, and the stimulus duration of 5ms were applied on the sciatic nerve. The response of muscle was recorded by the computer program named LabScribe. Then immediately 0.1mL of caffeine was injected directly to the gastrocnemius muscle, and the response of muscle contraction was recorded. The same process was repeated two times for other two legs. A one tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the data to determine whether there is significant difference in muscle contraction between caffeine group and non-caffeine group. 

Results:
The threshold for three frog legs was 0.5V. The mean voltage difference for the muscle contraction before the injection of caffeine was 0.1236V, 0.079V and 0.1518V, while the mean after the injection of caffeine was 0.4788V, 0.534V and 0.5808V (Fig. 1). We used a one tailed pared t-test and found out the mean voltage change of muscle contraction after caffeine injection was significantly different from that of muscle contraction before caffeine injection (t-stat = 13.399, df = 2, p = 0.005524). Additionally, according to the actual observation of the graph recorded by LabScribe, the voltage increased dramatically after the direct injection of caffeine into the leg muscle.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that if we artificially inject caffeine directly to the frog leg muscle, there will be greater contraction is supported by our data. According to one study, we knew that the role of Ca+2 is significant, as calcium-release channels exert complete control over the coupling of chemical and electronical signals at cellular level and the ultimate contraction of muscle fibers [Catterall: 1991]. Considering both the role of calcium and the potential effect of caffeine on calcium-release channels, we tended to interpret our result by pointing out that caffeine can increase muscle contraction by stimulating the calcium channels to release more calcium into the cell. The interpretation makes sense, because according to Rosser [2009], high concentration of caffeine increase calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and it also increase the tension development in tetanic contractions to restore force development to prefatigued levels. Based on our interpretation, we came up with certain ideas about future experiments. We would like to test if low concentration of caffeine could still increase muscle contraction, because it is only clear that a high level of caffeine can dramatically influence muscle performance [Rosser: 2009]. Moreover, we are also interested in whether caffeine would have certain effect on other ion channels involved in the muscular system. For example, we can test the effect of caffeine on sodium channels and potassium channels. Besides, the experiment we have done already can also be further improved, as we can add more sample size and measure the force generated by muscle contraction. Future research on caffeine is important because understanding more of the caffeine helps people to have a basic knowledge of how it works in our body, and hopefully helps people to know the possible side effect it may have. Thus, people can have a better control of the amount and frequency of caffeine that take in through their daily diet.
