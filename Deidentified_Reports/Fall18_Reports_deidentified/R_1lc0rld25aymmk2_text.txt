Title: Caffeine as a cAMP Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor in Slime Mold (physarum polycephalum)

Abstract:
	The effect of caffeine as a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor was studied in this experiment. cAMP is a second messenger in a signalling pathway of slime mold (physarum polycephalum). The second messenger binds to a final effector to cause change in the cell in response to stimuli. Phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP and therefore slows down or ends the signalling pathway. Caffeine was used in the experiment to inhibit phosphodiesterase. It was predicted that slime mold samples treated with caffeine would exhibit significently more growth toward the food stimulus than the controll samples. All samples, controll and experimental, were left for twenty hours after preparation to allow slime mold to grow. When results were collected, and data was organized the the caffeine samples showed considerably more growth toward food while the controll growth was much smaller. This supports the understanding that breaking down a second messenger in a signalling pathway is crucial to mediating the organisms response to stimuli. 


Introduction:
Slime mold (physarum polycephalum) generally lives in damp, dark and composting leaves or other ground debris. It generally moves around within its habitat using actin microfilaments looking for food. One of the specific behavioral responses that slime mold exhibits is chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the response of the organism to molecules within its environment. Slime mold can sense different molecules nearby and will either move toward or away from the stimulus [Mato, Losada, Nanjundiah, and Konijn]. Negative chemotaxis is when the mold grows away from the stimulus and positive chemotaxis is when it grows towards the stimulus.
Slime mold is unique in its response to environmental stimuli as it is not under controll of hormones of a nervous system, but instead each response is mediated by one or more of the organisms intracellular signal transduction pathways. Chemotaxis, for example, is controllled by slime mold’s signalling pathways. [Sakai, 2018] Most signalling pathways usually move through three general steps. First a stimulus activates either a receptor or a protein within the organism. The second is the release of a second messenger by the activated receptor or protein. The second messenger is a molecule or ion within the cell that initiates the actual response pathway. Third and lastly, the second messenger binds to a final effector that causes the cell to change its initial behavior in response to the stimuli [Staroszik and Marwan, 1995]. Each of the three steps differs slightly depending on the pathway, but they all follow the same general outline. 
This experiment focused on the effects of caffeine on the growth rate of slime mold toward food. Caffeine inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase in the cAMP-mediated pathway. In this pathway cAMP is the second messenger which binds to a final effector. Phosphodiesterase breaks down cAMP, which stops the signalling pathway [Sakai, 2018]. Inhibiting phosphodiesterase is similar to enhancing cAMP because it is never broken down. In this experiment we will treat samples of slime mold with concentrated caffeine and measure the distance they grow toward a food source. This will be compared with the growth of slime mold samples treated with no caffeine toward their food source. It was hypothesized that the caffeine samples will present much more growth because cAMP phosphodiesterase has been inhibited by caffeine. A similar study found that when phosphodiesterase was inhibited the response of the pathway studied was magnified [Riedel, Malchow, Gerisch and Nägele, 1972]. The second messenger, cAMP was not broken down so the final effector was constantly activated, causing an over response compared with that of the controll. Similarly, the slime mold treated with caffeine would grow toward its food more than the controll. It was predicted that both the controlls and the caffeine will show some but the experimental samples will be further.

Materials and Method:
Flat tipped forceps, a metal spatula and a 50Ml cup of ethanol were gathered.The metal spatula and forceps were placed in the tub of ethanol to sterilize them. Six 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar were used. Three were labeled on the back as controll and three as caffeine samples. Also drawn on the back were 1cm x 1cm squares near one edge of the plate. The spatula was then removed from the ethanol and used to cut out and remove the squares as drawn on the back of the six plates. After each plate the spatula was cleaned with ethanol and dried with a kimwipe. The slime mold stock plate was then opened and six 1cm x 1cm squares were cut. The squares were cut in such a way that there was significent mold growth on each. Again, after each cut the spatula was cleaned and wiped. One at a time, a square from the slime mold plate was removed and slid into the open squares of both the controll and caffeine sample plates until all six contained 1cm x 1cm slime mold squares. All agar plates were closed when not in use. 
	Three to five oats were then placed in each of the controll samples, on the opposite side of the slime mold square. This was done to maximize potential distance to cover. These three plates were then taped closed, wrapped in tinfoil and labelled. 
	The caffeine solution was made using 1Ml of  20x stock solution caffeine liquid (1Ml caffeine aliquotes) and 19 Ml of deionized water. Then 4Ml of 1x solution was added into each of the three experimental agar plates. The dilute caffeine solution was left on the agar plates to absorb for roughly 20 minutes. Once the solution was absorbed, three to five oates were placed in each of the caffeine samples on the opposite side of the slime mold square in the same fashion as the controlls. The plates were then taped closed covered in tinfoil and labeled. They were all placed in a an incubator at 30 degrees celsius. 
	Twenty hours later, the plates were unwrapped from the foil to make measurements. A millimeter ruler was used to measure how far the slime mold had grown in the direction of the food. The distance was measured from the end of migration back to the nearest edge of the originating slab. Measurements were taken for all six plates and recorded as data. A two-sample t_test was the statistical test used to evaluate the data collected.


Results:
	The average growth of the controll samples was 3.67mm and the average growth of the caffeine samples was 35.67. The caffeine samples grew, on average, 32mm more than the respective controll. The P value from two-sample t_test was 0.00147, which is below 0.05. This provides a confidence interval above 95%. 


Discussion:
This experiment studied the effects of caffeine, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor on the growth of slime mold toward external stimuli. CAMP phosphodiesterase breaks down the second messenger, cAMP, in one of slime molds signalling pathways. The experiment studied the effects of an organism not being able to break down a second messenger. The inability to break this down, leads to constant stimulation of the effector, which causes the cell to change behavior in response to external molecules. [Sakai, 2018]
	Initially, I hypothesized that the caffeine samples of slime mold would exhibit significently more growth than the controll samples. This hypothesis was proven correct by the results collected. The average caffeine growth was 35.72mm while the average controll growth was 3.67mm (Figure 1). This is an incredibly large disparity, considering the samples were only left twenty hours after treatment and before data was collected. This data supports the conclusion that inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase results in constant stimulation of the signalling pathway by the second messenger. In this case, constant stimulation translated into constant growth towards food. These results are supported by the conclusions made in another study. Although this study did not use food as stimulus, it determined that inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase resulted in considerably more growth than when phosphodiesterase was present [Riedel, Malchow, Gerisch and Nägele, 1972]. Our results align with both their predictions and findings. 
	CAMP phosphodiesterase is not only found in slime mold, but in human and other organisms signalling pathways as well. For example, studies have been conducted that research its effects on contraction of smooth vascular muscle in humans [Tanaka, Ishikawa, Hagiwara,  Onoda, Itoh and Hidaka H, 1988]. This study, however, because conducted on humans, requires many more resources, time and testing before it can be performed. Instead, early studies and research can be conducted on slime mold because it too uses cAMP phosphodiesterase to break down a second messenger in a signalling pathway. Although they are not identical, it is a good option for beginning research and further discovery. It also provides important information on the role of a second messenger in signalling pathways.
