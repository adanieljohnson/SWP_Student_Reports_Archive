Title: The Influence of Hunger on Aggressive Behaviors in Male Betta Splendens

Abstract:
The way that animals behave in an enclosed environment can tell a lot about how they may act in the wild. Keeping track of behavioral patterns of all types of animals is important to our understanding of the surrounding world and also for better understanding the animal in question. The fish Betta Splendens which is also known as the Betta fish, is a species that originates from Thailand. They have specific male-to-male interactions characterized by a very territorial, agonistic behavior pattern when together. The focus of this experiment was to determine whether the factor of hunger had any sort of effect on these natural behaviors, or if they would not have any significance during interactions. The results show that there is significance of the data collected, and that the hunger factor does in fact show a change, more specifically that the fish are more aggressive toward each other when they are hungry. 

Introduction:
The Siamese Fighting fish, otherwise known as Betta Splendens or simply the Betta fish, are a  small species native to Thailand that dwell in shallow, slow flowing waters of streams and rice paddie fields [Sturgeon: 2001]. These waters they inhabit are usually low-oxygen content, so this species has adapted a method of extracting oxygen from the waterâ€™s surface by swimming up and gulping and therefore allowing them to tolerate such poor quality waters [Johnson: 2016]. As their name suggests, this species of fish is quite aggressive during their male-to-male interactions, and these agonistic behaviors can be divided into two classifications. The first being the facing movements which encompass facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading the opercula, and lastly protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. The second type is the broadside movement and these movements consist of pelvic flickering, tail flashing, and tail beating [Johnson: 2016]. This purpose of this experiment is to quantify these types of behaviors in a non-emotional way while adding an outside factor to see if it has any further effects on the interaction between the sample fish. The factor that will be added to this experiment is hunger--more specifically how the fish will interact with one another while they are hungry, and then once again after they have been fed in order to see if there is any major difference in behavioral patterns. I hypothesize that the fish will behave more agonistically when they are not fed and that once they are fed they will show less aggressive behaviors toward the fish with which they are paired.

Materials and Methods:
The first thing that needed to be done to even begin the experiment was to pick out seven different male Betta fish to use in our trials. Once these fish were picked, they were kept separate in order to make sure they would not show premature aggression and tire out before their trial. Next we picked out a tank with three sections separated by glass and a rectangular piece of plastic in order to avoid the fish seeing each other. There were two fish, each on opposing sides of the tank, that were kept in the tank for the duration of the experiment to act as controls for the reactions. The middle portion of the tank was used to test the reactions, and is where all of the other fish were cycled through during the trials. The two control fish were used one at a time--one fish would be used in a trial while the other fish was taking a break from the previous trial. Each trial took place over the course of five minutes, so the breaks were around five minutes for each of the control fish. The first set of trial runs were used to test the reactions of the fish before they were fed so that their actions could be recorded while they were hungry. The second round consisted of the same fish using the aforementioned methods, except the fish were fed this time and their actions were recorded to test this variable. Once the experimentation was finished all of the fish that were used were separated once again and the tank was put back in its normal spot.

Results:

After data analysis, the average number of agonistic behaviors while the fish were not fed was 5.4, while after they were fed this number dropped to an average of 2.4. There was a difference, after every trial, of about an average of -3.75 aggressive behaviors shown. All of the sample fish except for one, which did not show any aggressive behavior at all, showed a decrease in aggression after being fed versus when they were hungry and showed a larger number of aggressive behaviors. A paired t-test was conducted and the data showed significance in its results at the p=0.5 level (t=16.77, df=2, p=0.000462).


Discussion:
According to the results, our hypothesis proves to be significant and therefore correct. The fish were more aggressive toward one another when they were hungry, but when they were fed they did not show us many aggressive movements. This proves that the factor of hunger does have an effect on the way that the male fish interact with one another, and that hunger makes them more aggressive toward one another. Not only do male competitors show more aggression when in close proximities in the wild due to territorial issues [Bronstein: 1981], but also that the amount of food present in the environment can have a profound effect on how aggressive the fish are toward one another. There are a couple of different ways that this experiment can be improved in the future. The first thing to do will be correcting any possible mistakes made in this experiment. Those mistakes could be feeding the fish different amounts, behavioral reactions made by the experimental fish before their trial runs that could have tired them out, or even the two control fish that were used the entire time getting too tired and not responding enough to the other fish. More trials could have been run over a larger amount of time as well, and a larger number of fish could have been used in order to provide more diverse results that could have affected the data differently. The key to a better experiment of the same kind in the future is to focus on creating more trials so that the data sets can be larger, and therefore even more significant in the end.

Figure Legends: 
Fish 2 and 3 served as controls for the group and were never fed during the experiment. Fish 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 were all used to test the hunger factor. These fish were tested once while they were not fed, and then again after they had been fed. *************************************************************************
