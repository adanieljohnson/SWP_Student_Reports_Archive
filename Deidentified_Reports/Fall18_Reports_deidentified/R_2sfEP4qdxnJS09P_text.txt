Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone Mimic on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones play a big role in the progression of an organism from a juvenile to an adult with two of these being Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysone, which are two hormones in the Manduca Sexta caterpillar. In our experiment we investigated the roll of Juvenile Hormone mimic on the length of Manduca Sexta caterpillars in a two-week span, and we hypothesized that the Juvenile Hormone mimic would have a significent effect on the caterpillars growth. We separated 8 caterpillars into 2 groups, one who was not given JH and the other who was given JH. We then ran a 2-tailed 2-sample T-test on the percent change on the caterpillar’s length, so that the beginning length wouldn’t be a confounding variable. Based off of this, we got a p_value of greater than 0.05 when we had a confidence level of 95% so therefore we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the two group’s lengths were significently different from one another. We then concluded that more research needs to be done in order to accurately determine JH’s influence on the Manduca Sexta Species’ length.  

Introduction:
Hormones play a big roll in the life of an organism, especially as they progress from a juvenile to an adult.  One of these organisms is the Manduca Sexta, or the Tobacco Hornworm. The relative levels of Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone (E) controll the molting process, which allows the caterpillar to transform into an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. Large levels of JH relative to Ecdysone levels, lead to a larval molt, whereas large Ecdysone levels relative to JH leads to an adult moth being formed [Willis: 1972].  In a larval molt, the organism develops further which could have an impact on the organism’s length, width, etc. In the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, giving them a JH mimic at varying concentrations depending on the specific mimic used caused the larvae to not undergo eclosion [Riddiford: 1991]. Due to this we predict that giving a caterpillar a JH mimic would lead to a change in the caterpillar’s length.


Materials and Method:
Eight Caterpillars were randoMly selected and randoMly assigned to be in two groups, the controll group and experimental group. The Manduca Sexta were measured every day in the afternoon. Each caterpillar was put in a small container with a lid and given food as needed or when the food dried out. The hornworm in the controll group were given 10 g of food with three drops of water, while the caterpillars in the experimental group were given 10 g of food with 3 drops of the JH mimic. Waste was cleaned out of their cage as needed, and data was collected for 15 days. Then, the two groups were compared through a 2-tailed 2-sample T-test using the percent change in length, which accounts for differences in the starting length of the caterpillars. 


Results:
The experimental group had an average percent change of roughly 159.5% with a standard deviation = ± 40.72, while the controll group had an average percent of 111.42% with a standard deviation = ± 34.64. The 2-tailed 2-sample T-test we ran had a null hypothesis that the JH mimic will have no effect on the caterpillar’s length and the alternative hypothesis was that the JH mimic will have an effect on the caterpillar’s length. We used a confidence level = 95% and therefore an alpha = 0.05. The t_test we ran gave the results (d.f.=6,t=1.800652,p=0.1218), so we failed to reject the null hypothesis because the p_value was greater than 0.05. 

Discussion:
	Due to the result of 2-tailed 2-sample t_test leading us to fail to reject the null hypothesis we concluded that 3-drops of the JH mimic doesn’t significently affect a caterpillar’s length. Our results are similar with a previous experiment that found that growth was unaffected in Drosophila melanogaster by increases in JH levels during the first through third instars [Tan: 2005]. Although the previous experiment occurs at a specific stage in the caterpillar’s life cycle, the two experiments lead to the same conclusion. Three drops of the JH mimic did not cause a significent difference could be because we continually added JH so the caterpillar didn’t go through another larval molt or an adult molt and instead just grew. In addition to this, we did not run a long term experiment so it is unclear as to whether their would be a separation in the caterpillar’s/moth’s length as time progressed, which could be investigated in a future experiment. Also, within a larval instar phase, the caterpillar might only be capable of growing up to a certain size without the occurrence of another larval molt, which wouldn’t be disproven by our results and could be investigated in a future experiment. Our experiments importance lies less on what it shows but more on what it doesn’t show, which is that in appears like a caterpillar won’t continue growing when it is not allowed to molt which means that there are internal mechanisms that regulate how much a caterpillar and/or organism is able to grow and that JH/E don’t stop the caterpillar from growing further within its current stage. In a future experiment, we could investigate why a caterpillar doesn’t growth doesn’t change when a JH mimic is added.
