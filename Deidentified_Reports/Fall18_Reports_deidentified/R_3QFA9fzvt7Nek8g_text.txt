Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the development of the Manduca Sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
Hormones play a major role in controllling regulatory and developmental processes, especially in insects. Understanding insect hormones is important in the creation of insecticides that are both efficient and effective. This experiment looks at the effects of adding Procore Methoprene, a Juvenile Hormone, to the diet of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. It was expected that there would be a statistical difference in the weight of the caterpillars who were fed the methoprene, and our data confirmed a statistical difference. We observed the controll group growing faster and all reaching pupation, whereas the experimental group only grew larger but did not reach pupation. The response of the experimental group to the hormone suggests that the hormone directly affects weight gain and developmental processes of the Manduca Sexta.

Introduction:
Insects require multiple hormones to be able to undergo major developmental processes. These processes, such as molting, pupation, and adult development are regulated by different levels of hormones. For many insects, such as the Manduca Sexta caterpillar, altering the hormones artificially can cause serious changes in the stages of growth and development (Hatem, Wang, Nave, Koyama, & Suzuki, 2015). Previous research has been conducted on Manduca Sexta and their hormones, so they are known to be an effective and testable organism to use for this experiment. Methoprene, a type of Juvenile Hormone, will be fed to the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars in this experiment in different amounts to observe the results. If there is an increase in methoprene in the diet of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars, then there will be a statistical difference in average weight. 

Materials and Method:
 Eight Manduca Sexta Caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups of four. Each caterpillar was placed into separate compartments of containers for their growth. Each caterpillar received one of two diets: The controll was consistently fed 10 grams of caterpillar food without any extra hormones in it. The experimental group was consistently fed 10 grams of caterpillar food with 10 drops of Methoprene in it. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator conditions at 25 degrees Celcius in 12 hour dark, 12 hour light cycle. The caterpillars were weighed daily and fed for 14 days and data recorded. The 2-sample T-test was used to determine if the data was significent.

Results:
The average change in weight (in grams) for the controll group caterpillars was 4.1025 (Fig. 1). The average change in weight (in grams) for the experimental group caterpillars was 8.7525 (Fig. 1). The standard deviation for weight change of the controll group was 1 and the standard deviation for weight change of the experimental group was 1. We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our data. Our results gave a t-value= 2.806423, Degrees of freedom=6,one tailed P-value= 0.015451, and two-tailed P-value=0.030901. Both our p_values were &lt;.05, and therefore statistically significent. We also observed  differences in color along with the increase in the growth of the controll group. Overall, all of the controlls pupated, while the experimental group grew large but did not pupate, and their pigmentation became lighter. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that states adding Methoprene to the diet of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars will create a statistical difference in weight was supported. Because our p-level was below .05, we could reject the null hypothesis as there was a significent statistical difference between the amount of Methoprene in the food compared to the average weight gained by the caterpillars. The effects of the Juvenile Hormone Methoprene could have prevented the caterpillars from pupating, thus keeping them in a larval state, and continuing to grow larger. Research has shown that this function of JH could be a survival mechanism to ensure the larva has reached a sufficient size before pupation (Hatem et al., 2015) . This information has also been researched for understanding the most efficient use of Juvenile Hormones on the Manduca Sexta as an insecticide. Because of the destructive effects that Manduca Sexta have on crops, using hormones to controll pest populations of Manduca Sexta is an important issue in the agricultural community. Further understanding of the effects of Insect hormones on the developmental patterns of Manduca Sexta can allow us to understand more about adaptation of insects to their environment and the role that hormones have in contributing to growth and regulatory processes.
