Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Trichloride on Physarum Migration

Abstract:
In this experiment, we used the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, which is a mass of multiple nuceli contained within a single plasma membrane. Physarum moves by extending its leading-edge using actin microfilaments to respond to a signal from the external or internal environment. We hypothesized that, using lanthanum trichloride, blocking Ca2+ from entering the cytoplasm in the IP3- mediated pathway will inhibit the growth of Physarum. We measured the growth of physarum dependent oatmeal as a stimulus. A block of physarum from the stock plate was placed into six water agar plates, three of which were covered with lanthanum trichloride and another three which were used as controlls. The plates were then covered in foil and put in an incubator for 48 hours. Assuming our hypothesis was correct, we would’ve expected to see growth towards the oat flakes in the controll plates and expected to see no movement in the experimental plates. The lack of migration on agar plates is most likely due to the osmotic effects of the sugars with concentrations greater than 100 m-osmol. To increase the growth of the slime mold, some researchers believe that it is necessary to agitate the medium in an attempt to transfer oxygen into the agar. 

Introduction:
Slime mold is a simple organism that consists of an acellular mass of protoplasm containing nuclei, or a mass of amoeboid cells (Johnson: 2016). It communicates intercellularly only by using hormone-like signals [Haastert: 1982]. In this experiment, we used the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, which is a mass of multiple nuceli contained within a single plasma membrane, a multinucleate syncytium. All the nuclei in this slime mold undergo mitosis at the same time, therefore each plasmodium behaves as a single cell. Physarum is a good model organism because it is easier to grow, handle, and observe than human cells, and they have many of the same signal transduction pathways. Physarum moves by extending its leading-edge using actin microfilaments. It engulfs bacteria and other organic debris, then actively transports hydrolytic enzymes into the food vacuoles to digest them [Johnson: 2016]. If food is unavailable or the humidity drops, the Physarum hardens to form a suspended stage called a sclerotium, a hibernation state [Johnson: 2016]. Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to their external and internal environment. 
A signal transduction pathway is a set of chemical reactions in a cell that occur when a molecule, such as a hormone or a second messenger molecule, attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane. In order to detect a signal, the cell must have the right receptor for that signal. When a signaling molecule binds to its receptor, it alters the shape of activity of the receptor, triggering a change inside the cell. Some signaling pathways begin when ions from the external environment diffuse into cell through the plasma membrane. Many cells have Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane that open in response to external stimuli. Calcium that diffuses in from the external environment is not enough to affect Ca2+ dependent enzymes, but it can bind to specialized calcium receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called ryanodine receptors [Johnson: 2016]. By activating these ryanodine receptors, a Ca2+ channel opens which initiates the signal transduction pathway. Lanthanum trichloride is a Ca2+ antagonist. It blocks calcium and targets IP3- activated intracellular Ca2+ channels. In this experiment, we tested whether varying Ca2+ concentrations, particularly blocking calcium from entering the cytoplasm via the Ca2+ channels located on the smooth ER, affect growth of Physarum. Specifically, whether or not the blocking of Ca2+ affected the mobility of Physarum, since it moves using cytoplasmic streaming. We hypothesized that, using lanthanum trichloride, blocking Ca2+ from entering the cytoplasm in the IP3- mediated pathway will inhibit the growth of Physarum. We measured the growth of physarum dependent oatmeal as a stimulus. 


Materials and Method:
First, a 20x stock was diluted to 1x of lanthanum trichloride by adding 1 Ml of lanthanum trichloride to 19 Ml of water. Next the solution was poured onto 3 water-agar plates and left alone to soak for 10 minutes. Three more water-agar plates were used as controlls to make it a total of 6 plates. After 10 minutes, the excess solution was poured off of the experimental plates and a kimwipe was used to blot of excess liquid from the lip of the petri dish. 
	Next, the flat metal spatula and forceps were placed in a tube of ethanol. While those were left to sterilize, back side of the petri dishes were labeled with initials, date, and a line that divided the plates in half. On that line, square of approximately 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm was drawn. Using the spatula, a block following the drawing was cut out and removed. The spatula was placed back in the ethanol to resterilize. Then, a Physarum stock place was obtained and blocks of the same size were cut using the spatula. The spatula was again placed in ethanol. Next, blocks of Physarum were taken out of the stock culture place with forceps and placed into the 6 water-agar plates, the forceps were sterilized in-between each different water agar plate. Then, 5-6 oat flakes were poured out on the surface of the water agar and were kept close together. Next, the lids were taped on the water agar plates and wrapped each in foil making sure to keep the plate face up. The foil was labeled with our names and initials were put on the black bag before going into the incubator. 
	The chemotaxis plates were checked daily for growth. After 48 hours, we returned to obtain our measurements. Using a millimeter ruler, the distance the slime mold migrated was measured from the current edge of migration back to the nearest edge of the originating slab. The distance and direction of the migration was recorded, along with the time in between taking the final measurement and the start of the experiment. A two tailed t_test was to be used for statistical analysis of our data. 


Results:
	Assuming our hypothesis was correct, we would’ve expected to see growth towards the oat flakes in the controll plates and expected to see no movement in the experimental plates (Figure 1). Our incomplete data differed from that of our expectations because we saw no movement in the controll plates instead of movement towards the food. Additionally, in the first of the three experimental plates, we unexpectedly saw about 1 centimeter of movement away from the food. After doing the same exact thing and using Physarum from the same culture plate, we saw 0.2 cm of movement towards the food in experimental plate two. Finally, we saw no movement on the third plate, which is what we would have expected after Physarum interaction with lanthanum trichloride. 

Discussion:
	Based on our hypothesis, the results expected were to see growth towards the oat flakes in the controll plates and expected to see no movement in the experimental plates
Our results differed from these expectations because we saw movement and no movement inconsistently in different plates of the same group in the experiment. Because our results were inconclusive, we could not determine whether or not our hypothesis was supported. Previous studies have found that feeding the physarum with oat flakes and allowing them to migrate on water agar is unsuitable for discovering a direct effect of a substance of migration. In these studies, the lack of migration on agar plates is most likely due to the osmotic effects of the sugars with concentrations greater than 100 m-osmol. The mechanism that suppresses the migration of physarum is still unknown to many researchers (Knowles: 1978). Other studies have found that the growth of Physarum polycephalum is slowed when there is poor circulation of moist air. To increase the growth of the slime mold, some researchers believe that it is necessary to agitate the medium in an attempt to transfer oxygen into the agar. When there is an adequate balance between aeration and agitation, then the slime mold can be grown in mass, but without these ideal conditions it can be increasingly harder to grow the slime mold (Kuraishi: 1963). Additionally, in slime mold, the cytoplasm streams back and forth through channels driven by pressure gradients (Durham: 1976). If the pressure gradients are disturbed due to a variety of environmental factors, like temperature, then the cytoplasmic streaming could be impacted, and growth could be ceased. It has been discovered that an increase in internal pressure can stunt the migration of the physarum (Kuraishi: 1963). Factors in the external environment can cause pressure changes which could cause a disruption of this cytoplasmic streaming which could halt migration. Additionally, warmth and chemical signals indicating food can increase the frequency of the oscillation of the cytoplasm. Previous studies have also found that almost all mechanisms of chemotaxis are practically the same because the signals from the environment are transduced by membranes into changing the frequency of alternation of ion movements (Durham: 1976). Through these previous studies, it can be seen that changes in pressure, temperature, food movement, and light can affect the way the ions move in the plasma membrane and thus how cytoplasmic streaming moves migration. Because the plates moved in and out of the incubator so frequently, the Physarum could have oscillated in and out of its hibernation state, sclerotium, which could have stunted growth of the culture originally and impacted the results of our individual experiment testing the effect of lanthanum trichloride.
