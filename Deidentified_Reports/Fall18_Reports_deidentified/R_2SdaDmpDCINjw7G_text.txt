Title: The effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
An ecosystem and the organisms in it are influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. In an ecosystem, abiotic factors are the nonliving physical conditions such as climate or habitat, whereas biotic factors stand for the living or the once-living organisms in it. Plants coordinate with both factors to survive, and they accomplish this by adjusting their resource allocation. This experiment focused on the effect of herbivory, one of the biotic factors, on the resource allocation of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum). The resource allocation was measured by calculating its root to shoot ratio and the hypothesis was that if the buckwheat is attacked by herbivores, it would allocate more of its internal resources to developing its roots and its root: shoot ratio would increase. The hypothesis was not supported as the results showed. However, past literature was studied and a new hypothesis was formed on the resource allocation of buckwheat, and future study is still needed to further support this hypothesis. 


Introduction:
 In an ecological system, the animals and plants must live and interact with each other for all of them to survive. The animals are the biotic factors of the environment, which is the environmental stimuli originated from other organisms, whereas abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, nutrient condition, etc. [Johnson:2016] Resource limitation is what greatly affects the behaviors of plants within a community in terms of abiotic factors. For example, in an open field with plants, the amount of sunlight that reaches the open field in a specific amount of time is strictly limited.  Plants will then subdivide their limited internal resources, such as light energy trapped through photosynthesis or nutrients absorbed, among different organs of themselves to adapt to their environment. [Staddon:2013]      Plants obtain resources from either above or under the ground, and they allocate their individual energy and resources between roots and shoots to better adapt to their environment. In an experiment, the effect of experimental burial on resource allocation of Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Chrysothamnus nauseosus, and Distichlis spicata was studied. The experimenters discovered that as the severity of burial increased, all species shifted biomass from below-ground to above-ground components. [Brown:1997]      
Not only should plants adapt to the abiotic factors, but also cope with biotic factors in their community. Herbivores attack plants and feed on their leaves which can have significant negative effects on targeted plants. In the experiment carried out by Wilbur, the effect of insect herbivory on the growth and fitness of Verbascum thasus L. was studied and that reducing herbivory had a marked positive effect on the fitness of the plants and concluded that herbivore-induced impacts on individual plant performance are substantial. [Wilbur:2013] In response to herbivory behaviors, plants will also adjust their resource allocation. In the experiment by Caldwell on two semiarid Agropyron bunchgrasses, the experimenters simulated the herbivory by defoliating the plants, and discovered, though different in amount, both the species grew new tillers and the leaf blades of regrowing tillers had higher photosynthesis capacity. [Caldwell:1981]     
In my experiment, I planned to also study the effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of plants. I chose buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) as the subject plant. Buckwheat is a short-season crop, which has a branching root system with a primary taproot that reaches far into the soil. It has triangular seeds and branches freely. [Stone:1906] I hypothesized that if the buckwheat is attacked by herbivores, it would allocate more of its internal resources to developing its roots and its root: shoot ratio would increase.  


Materials and Methods:
    A total of 10 pots were used where 5 served as the control group and the other 5 as the experimental group. Four-fifths of the volume of each pot was filled with soil, and 15-20 seeds of buckwheat were placed in them. All the seeds were covered with soil and sufficiently watered. In the following two weeks, all the pots were placed in greenhouse and watered regularly. Small holes were clipped on the leaves of all the plants in the experimental group daily. After two weeks, the plants were removed from the greenhouse and three plants were picked out of the each pot. Individual roots were separated from each other with soil washed off by water. The length and weight of each root and shoot was measured. There were in total 30 plants, with 15 of them in each group. The root: shoot ratios for length and weight were calculated based on the data. Finally, the control group was compared with the experimental group by running a one-tailed two-sample t-test to analyze the data. 



Results:
    The mean root: shoot ratio for mass was (0.263 +/- 0.171) for the control group and (0.280 +/- 0.059) for the experimental group. (Figure 1) The mean root: shoot ratio for length was (0.969 +/- 0.271) for the control group and (0.833 +/- 0.259) for the experimental group.(Figure 2) The results one-tailed two-sample t-test showed that there is no significant difference between the mean of root: shoot ratio based on the mass of the control group and that of the experimental group. (t-stat = 0.376, df = 30, P = 0.335) Also, there is no significant difference between the mean of root: shoot ratio based on the length of the control group and that of the experimental group. (t-stat = 1.449, df = 30, P = 0.0789) 


Discussion:
As shown in the result, the root: shoot ratios based on both length and weight did not show significant difference between the control and experimental groups. The hypothesis of if the buckwheat is attacked by herbivores, it would allocate more of its internal resources to developing its roots and its root: shoot ratio would increase was thus not supported. It was not supported possibly because in a study [Caldwell:1981], both the species grew new tillers after defoliation and the leaf blades of regrowing tillers had higher photosynthesis capacity, which suggested that plants would allocate more of their internal resources to their shoots rather than the roots after being attacked by the herbivore. Also, in another study [Gadd:2003], it was proposed that plants respond to herbivory through above-ground regrowth. In this study, the simulated herbivory was associated with compensatory regrowth and branches whose leaves were removed grew faster and had more leaves one year later. In his book, Staddon [Staddon:2013] stated that the most critical determinant of resource allocation patterns within the plant would be natural selection acting at individual level to adapt to its environment. It was concluded that due to the fact that the shoots of the plants were attacked by herbivores, the amount, fitness and performance of leaves were selected within each plant. After studying previous literature, a new hypothesis was proposed as: to avert the deficiency in photosynthesis due to the reduced leaves consumed by herbivores, plants tend to allocate their resources on developing leaves of higher function and performance. On the other hand, it was noticed that there were great standard deviations in the root: shoot ratio for length. Experimental errors were concluded to account for the great standard deviations. When measuring the root length, the roots were measured from the transition spot where the color of the stem shifted white, which differs significantly between individual plants. Also, the roots were tightly tangled when they were removed from the soil and before their separation. The roots might have been accidentally damaged since they were fragile. These would both lead to the great standard deviations of the data. To obtain the best result, in the future, actual herbivores such as insects should be utilized for the experiment instead of the scene simulated by clipping the plants. Also, a few other species should be examined to compare and determine the effect of herbivory on different species and the various strategies these species take advantage of to protect themselves.
