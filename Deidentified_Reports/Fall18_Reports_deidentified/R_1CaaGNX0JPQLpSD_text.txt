Title: The Positive Correlation of Ca Ion Concentration and Physarum Growth

Abstract:
	One of the essential signaling pathways of the unicellular organism Physarum, the Ca-activated pathway, was examined in this experiment. The hypothesis is that a high Ca concentration environment promotes Physarum growth, and EDTA+Stronium chloride inhibits or reduces growth. The experiment was carried out by comparing the area of growth of three groups, control, EDTA+Stronium chloride treatment, and high Ca ion concentration treatment, with an ANOVA test followed. The result of the ANOVA test was 0.083&gt;0.05; there was no sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis. However, it was noted that the Physarum growth was abnormal, which made this experimental result inconclusive. Two potential reasons for the abnormal growth were that Physarum only acts positively to certain carbohydrates, which was not provided to the culture in the experiment, and that Physarum growth needs the addition of other elements, such as iron in yeast extract or haematin.

Introduction:
	One of the essential features that allow organisms to survive is being able to respond to environmental changes. For example, when the environmental temperature drops, the metabolic rate of the organism may be increased in order to maintain its internal temperature. Those responses observed are accomplished by cellular signaling, which activates responses at cellular levels. 
	In this experiment, Physarum’s cellular signaling was examined. As Physarum does not use hormone or nervous system to do its signaling, one of its intracellular signal transduction pathway, Ca-activated pathway, was tested. There are mainly two kinds of signal transduction, G-protein coupled pathway, and ion-activated pathway. They work in similar ways; when an external stimulus arrives, a series of reactions happen, and a second messenger is released. The second messenger binds to its effector to trigger the cellular response to the external stimulus. In the case of Ca-activated pathway, Ca ion is the second messenger, while for G-protein coupled pathway, a range of chemicals is.
	As cellular signal transduction is such an important process in the overall cellular response, a small change in the transduction pathway can cause a huge difference. EDTA+Strontium chloride can inhibit surface Ca receptor, which potentially inhibit the whole Ca-activated pathway. Likewise, an increased level to Ca level may over-activate the pathway; movement of Physarum can be increased with the presence of increased free Ca ions [Ridgway: 1976]. Thus, it is hypothesized that the increased concentration of Ca ions results in an increased growth of Physarum, while the presence of EDTA+Stronium chloride decrease the overall growth.

Materials and Methods:
	PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates were used in this experiment to minimize the effect of food source as the confounding variables. 9 PDA plates were used in total; 3 of them were soaked in 5 mL of concentrated Ca solution, 3 of them were soaked in soaked in 5 mL of EDTA+Stronium chloride for 10 minutes. Excess solution on the plate was discarded. The 6 soaked plates along with the 3 control plates were prepared by cutting out a block of 1 cm2 at the center of each plate. The small wells on the 9 plates were filled with a block of Physarum culture, which came from the same Physarum plate [Johnson: 2016]. 
	The 9 plates were kept in dark for 24 hours. A measure of growth in the area was done by ImageJ software, and a one-way ANOVA test was conducted with a confidence level of 0.05.

Results:
	The result of the ANOVA test has a p-value of 0.83&gt;0.05. The Tukey-Kramer test indicates that there is no significant difference between each group. According to Figure 1., the treatment of EDTA+stronium chloride had the greatest growth among the three groups, which was expected to have the least growth. It is noticeable that in each three treatment groups, there was at least one trial had no growth after 24 hours. 

Discussion:
	With the result of the ANOVA test, we can not accept the hypothesis that the change of Ca ions will affect the growth of Physarum. As the experimental results were opposite to what expected, as well as the observation that the growth of Physarum was abnormal, the result of this experiment was inconclusive. 
	One of the possible explanations of this inconsistent result is that the type of carbohydrates provided to the Physarum was wrong. Physarum act positively to glucose, but not as significant to other carbohydrates, such as ribose, fructose, sucrose [Carlile: 1970]. According to the American Diabetes Association, the majority of carbohydrates in potatoes is starch. In other words, although enough nutrients are provided for the Physarum to growth, the preference of glucose made the Physarum unresponsive to the PDA plates. 
	Another possible explanation is that the PDA plates lack some of the essential components for the Physarum to growth. According to Henney, yeast extract and haematin are required for Physarum growth [Henney: 1968]. In the experiment, the PDA plates had water, potatoes, dextrose, and agar, but were not prepared by adding yeast extract or haematin, which can be the reason why there was no growth of Physarum. Both the yeast extract and haematin contain iron, which can be the essential element for Physarum to growth. Ferrous iron is necessary for Physarum, and the lack of iron resulted in the abnormal growth of the Physarum in the experiment. There are other minerals and vitamin in the yeast extract, for example, magnesium can be necessary for Physarum growth. It is possible that one of the critical ways that Physarum examines the environment is the presence of those minerals. The lack of minerals can be a bad environment for Physarum, and thus, instead of growth, Physarum would enter its dormant stage to protect itself, which was observed as the abnormal growth.
