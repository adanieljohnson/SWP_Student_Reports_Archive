Title: An analysis of the affect of pH on Photosynthesis in spinach.

Abstract:
We tested photosynthesis in spinach leaves at multiple pHs 4, 6.5, and 10. Their photosynthetic
efficiency was tested using DCIP a dye which turns from blue to colorless as it becomes reduced
by accepting electrons from photosynthetic enzymes. This absorbance was measured at time 0
and 10 minutes later using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm for our solutions of chloroplasts at
differing pH. The absorbance saw a statistically significant reduction in absorbance for pH 4 and
6.5. However pH 10 saw no significant reduction in absorbance after 10 minutes of reacting.

Introduction:
Plants conduct photosynthesis in order to harness energy from the sun and convert that light energy into chemical energy to be stored in the form of glucose. This process involves multiple enzymes to function properly including RuBisCO [Farazdaghi H 2011]. Enzymes such as these have multiple regulatory molecules and thus function optimally in certain environments [Jin 2004]. The molecular environment we decided to test was pH. Thus we decided to test the efficiency of photosynthesis in spinach leaf chloroplasts at acidic and alkaline pH, by measuring the light absorbance in a spectrophotometer after the reaction had preceded with a product dependent dye . We chose spinach leaves to do their relative abundance and accessibility. We believe that that an the optimal pH will result in with lower absorbance at 600nm as the dye DCIP becomes clear when it is reduced by photosynthesis [Huber S 1979]. 


Materials and Methods:
We required a centrifuge and the ground extract of several spinach leaves in order to acquire purified chloroplasts for our experiment. We also tested with buffers at ph 4, 6.5 and 10. The dye we used was DCIP which becomes reduced during photosynthesis by having a higher affinity for electrons than ferredoxin (the typical electron carrier) and turns colorless.
We  labeled 13 large test tubes placed them in a tube rack. Turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to read at 600nm. The solutions going into the tubes were as follows. Tube 0 is the blank and it gets 8ml of water, and 5ml of the 100mM rxn buffer. Tubes 1-3 get chloroplasts 6ml of water, 2ml of 130mM DCIP, 5ml 6.5 ph rxn buffer. Tubes 4-6 get chloroplasts 6ml of water, 2 ml of 130mM DCIP,2ml of ph 4 rxn buffer. Tubes 7-9 get chloroplasts 6 ml water, 2 ml 130mM DCIP, 2 ml ph 10 rxn buffer. Tubes 10- 12 are our controls and they get no chloroplasts 6ml water, 2 ml 130 mM DCIP, 2 ml 6.5 ph rxn buffer.Next we  prepared 3 replicates of each of the reaction mixes.With only 1 replicate of the blank. We began the assy by adding 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts you prepared in Exercise #1 to the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-12. Followed by  mixing each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts.Next we transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. We then   IMMEDIATELY blank the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 0. Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. These were are Time Zero data points. Then we placed all our samples in the sunlight for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, we blank the spectrophotometer with Sample 0. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm.  Then we Recorded our results and compared them with two tailed t-tests.


Results:
The change in absorbance statistical significance was determined using a two sample T-test, comparing the absorbance at time 0 and time 10. With a null hypothesis that of H0 : U1 = U2  (The absorbance would not change) and an alternate hypothesis of Ha : U1 &gt; U2 (the absorbance after 10 minutes would be lower than at time 0). This was tested with a p value of .01 and the results are as follows. For 4 pH the resulting p value was .006, t=5.2, df= 3.03 this indicates that the  absorbance was significantly lower after 10 minutes for the ph 4 group. For the 6.5 pH group the results were p=.002, t= 5.9, df=3.83 This indicates that the absorbance was significantly
 lower after ten minutes for the ph 6.5 group. 



Discussion:
We determined that the absorbance was significantly lower after 10 minutes for the 6.5 and ph 4 groups. This means that the solution was more clear and thus had more reduced DCIP. This increase in reduced DCIP comes from an increase in electrons produced during photosynthesis. This means that photosynthesis was statistically more efficient at acidic ph of 4 and 6.5 than at the alkaline pH of 10. This is in accordance to our hypothesis that an optimal pH range (acidic) would present with reduced absorbance. This acidic pH range is possible due to the the enzymes becoming denatured at higher pH and thus functioning optimally at slightly acidic pH’s. This may be an evolutionary trait as Magnesium (an element critical for photosynthesis to occur) [ Schwartzkopf C 2017] commonly found in the form of magnesium sulfate MgSO4 reacts to produce slightly acidic conditions when the magnesium ion is released to be used in photosynthesis [Huber S 1979]. Spinach is a leafy green and is typically loaded with magnesium. Thus having enzymes that can not only tolerate but thrive in e slightly acidic conditions would be a massive evolutionary advantage for spinach.Still it is strange that the chloroplasts would appear to operate so well under acidic conditions as RuBisCO in particular has an optimal pH that is alkaline around 8-10. Further tests would likely be able to determine why our results were so counterintuitive. Running the same experiment again but with a different type of plant, perhaps one that is not magnesium rich would be a good start.
