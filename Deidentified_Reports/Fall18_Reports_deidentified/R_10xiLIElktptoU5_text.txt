Title: The Effect of Carbonated Water on Spinacia oleracea Isolated Chloroplasts Mediated by the Hill Reaction

Abstract:
Abstract
Chloroplasts were isolated from Spinacia oleracea leaves to investigate the potential effect of carbonated water on the Hill Reaction. A carbonated environment has been shown to increase the production of photosynthesis, however, the direct effect of carbonated water on isolated chloroplasts could be further investigated. CO2 is a reactant that combines with light and water to form glucose in a multi-step reaction inside chloroplasts and therefore, should increase the production of glucose and photosynthesis. A reaction monitors 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), an alternative electron acceptor, was used to monitor the reaction of photosynthesis by spectrophotometry. A one-tailed T-test with equal variance concluded the percent difference in photosynthesis between distilled water chloroplast solution and carbonated water chloroplast solution was not statistically significent (P-value = 0.17). Possibilities of inconclusive results may be due to the increase or decrease of pH with the addition of carbonated water. 


Introduction:
Introduction:

Photosynthesis is a mechanism by which plants produce and store energy. Sunlight is transformed and stored into multiple types of energies; chemical energy, an oxidative reduction potential, or electric energy.  This process occurs across a lipid bilayer membrane, which processes then stores sugar molecules known as amylopectin and amylose (starch) [Nelson: 2005]. Plants break down starch into glucose, which can be processed by the Krebs Cycle to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy output molecule of oxidative respiration [Nelson: 2005]. Plant photosynthesis to the production of energy can be broken down into multiple different components way beyond the general background above. The light independent reaction uses a byproduct from the light dependent reaction, NADPH, which is reduced by adding electrons to its aromatic ring, shown in Figure 1. Reduced NADPH interacts with an enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and CO2. This holoenzyme complex can now interact with ribulose, a five-carbon sugar, to produce glucose. The overall reaction of photosynthesis is displayed in Figure 2. 
The Hill reaction monitors the magnitude of photosynthesis by using a compound 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), an electron acceptor that changes color from blue to clear upon receiving electrons [Babetter: 1962]. NADPH during the light independent reaction may donate its electrons to DCIP as an alternative pathway from the normal light independent reaction. More electrons being received by DCIP can be correlated with an increase in photosynthesis due to the pathway described above. 
Our experiment was designed to alter the environmental conditions of chloroplasts by testing the effects of carbonated water on photosynthesis. Plant cells have been shown to successfully photosynthesize in carbonated water due to an enriched reactant atmosphere [Moore: 1999], [Jolliffe: 1968].  However, how does adding a CO2 gas affect the chloroplasts ability of photosynthesis?  We hypothesized that photosynthesis would increase because carbon dioxide is a reactant in the mechanism of photosynthesis. 
Gibbs free energy is a measurement of equilibrium due to different conditions imposed on a reaction. When there is an increase in reactants, according to Le’Chateliers principle, Gibbs Free energy will shift to favor equilibrium based on the new conditions. If an increase in carbon dioxide occurs the reaction equilibrium will shift to cause for an increase in the product, glucose. During this process the light independent reaction is stimulated, and the rate is increased; the forward reaction, in Figure 2., is faster than the reverse reaction. This means that NADPH donates its electrons to either the Hill reaction, or to form glucose by RuBisCO faster. This results in greater percentage of DCIP molecules being reduced and a solution changing color from blue to clear [Buelens: 2016]. 


Materials and Method:
Spinach leaves were ground into solution using 20Ml of Grinding Buffer (400mM sucrose and Tricine Buffer, pH 8.0) in order to extract chloroplasts. Centrifugation was utilized twice (once at 200G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C and another time at 2800RPM for 12 minutes at 4 degrees C) in order to lyse plant cells and separate organelles. Protocol of two centrifugation steps were changed to three due to a mistake in execution during the experiment, an extra centrifugation step was applied and thought to be the best solution for the mistake. The mistake occurred when DCIP was added directly to carbonated water resulting in DCIP changing to a purple color. The protocol was designed to measure the wavelength of DCIP at 600nm, however, with a change in color, a new wavelength optimal for the color produced by carbonated DCIP would need to be found. This step was avoided by adding another centrifugation step where chloroplasts were centrifuged in carbonated water or distilled water, then added to DCIP. After spinach leaves were homogenized and centrifuged twice the pellet was resuspended in 10Ml of Grinding Buffer and separated into two vails of equal volume (15Ml). 5Ml of resuspended pellet was added to 10Ml Distilled water in one vail, while Seltzer (Carbonated) Water of equal volume was added to the other 5Ml of resuspended pellet. 100uL of Chloroplast solution of distilled water or carbonated water was then added to 2Ml 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), 2Ml of 100mM phosphate (reaction buffer), and 6Ml of distilled water. Spectrophotometry at 600 nm was used to determine the translucency (concentration) of active chloroplasts in each system. Spectroscopy was blanked with a solution of 8Ml of distilled water and 2Ml of Phosphate Buffer Solution. Absorbance measurements were recorded in triplicate at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. Percent Change was plotted and used to determine the difference between carbonated and of distilled water.  A one tailed unpaired T-test with equal variance and 95% confidence intervals was performed for statistical analysis comparing distilled chloroplast solution to carbonated chloroplast solution. 

Results:
Results: 
T-stat = 1.065, d.f. = 4, P = 0.17. The results indicate no statistical difference between the percent change of DCIP between carbonated chloroplast solution and distilled water chloroplast solution. The mean percent difference and standard deviation for distilled water at 10, 20, and 30 minutes was 16.39%  0.11, 31.44%   0.17, 45.15%    0.23. The mean percent difference and standard deviations for carbonated water at 10, 20, and 30 minutes were 11.53%    0.06, 22.77%    0.05, and 27.95%  0.06.

Discussion:
	Our results demonstrated that there is no difference between carbonated water chloroplast solution and distilled water chloroplast solution, however, a visual trend can be observed in Figure 2.  This trend was apparent at time 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes, with carbonated water always having a lower percent change. This goes against the majority of the literature and our hypothesis which suggests that chloroplasts increase photosynthesis when CO2 (i.e. carbonated water) is present [Jolliffe: 1968], [Cao: 2017], [Makino]. However, prolonged exposure to CO2 has been shown to have drastic effects on growth, reproduction, and energy production in multiple plant types [Haskett: 1997], [Griffin: 1999]. This detrimental effect is unlikely in this experiment due to the low exposure time to CO2. Other explanations that may have produced a lower percent change for carbonated water could be due to a change in pH. Mixed reviews have been published on whether CO2 effects the Hill Reaction. Babette at al. were unable to show an effect of CO2 on the Hill Reaction, however, many other publications have stated otherwise [Babette: 1962], [Fredrick: 1961].  An alternative explanation could be a reaction between Tricine Buffer and carbonated water resulting in a shift in pH. This, however, is unlikely because Tricine Buffer, a common buffer for photosynthesis and chloroplast experiments, was used to minimize pH changes. Carbonated water may have contained additional substances (i.e. contaminants) that we were unaware of and did not determine that could have altered our results. Finally, carbonated water does not have the same translucency as distilled water possibly affecting the results of the spectrophotometer reading. 
This experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of CO2 on Spinacia oleracea prompted by literature displaying an increase effect of CO2 on other plant species. The exact mechanism for the results presented is unknown, however, due to the color change of DCIP to purple when carbonated water was added directly to DCIP, before the protocol change, it is likely a pH shift of the solution is the cause. Statistical analysis determined that carbonated chloroplast solution and distilled water chloroplast solution was not significent, but a trend of carbonated chloroplast solution having a lower percent change of DCIP than distilled water chloroplast solution was observed. Further examination of possible mechanisms for the observation should be investigated in following studies.
