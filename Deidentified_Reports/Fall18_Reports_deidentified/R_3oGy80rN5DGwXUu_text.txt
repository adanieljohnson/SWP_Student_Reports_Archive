Title: Effects of NaCl and MgCl2 on isolated chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
NaCl and MgCl2, sources of Na+ and Mg++ cations respectively, have the capacity to induce structural and conformational changes in the thylakoid membrane of in vitro Spinicia olerocea chloroplasts that can potentially weaken the proton gradient formed by electron movement and, thus, inhibit photosynthetic ATP synthesis. Spinach chloroplasts were isolated and treated with NaCl and MgCl2 and compared to a controll group of chloroplasts in order to observe whether treatment would result in a significently greater decrease in spectrophotometer absorbance. The experiment was designed to test our prediction that NaCl would significently reduce the rate of photosynthesis and result in a greater percent change over the course of 30 minutes. In accordance with a previous study performed on isolated spinach chloroplasts, our mean percent change for the NaCl treatment group was significently greater than the mean percent change for the controll group. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing a one-tailed t_test.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants obtain energy from the sun and store such energy for later use in glycolysis and respiration. C. Foyer and S. Shigeoka discuss the mechanisms that drive photosynthesis in their 2011 research article, describing how this process begins with the absorption of energy from light by the plant’s chloroplasts via chlorophyll molecules. They described how the absorbed energy then excites electrons and allows them to leave their corresponding carrier molecules, followed by subsequent transfer of electrons from molecular complex to complex that relies on multiple coupled redox reactions, resulting in the movement of electrons in a photosynthetic electron transport chain (PET). The movement of electrons releases energy that Foyer and Shigeoka state is then used to power the molecular complexes and allow them to act as proton pumps that can pump protons from the stroma across the thylakoid membrane and into the lumen, generating a proton gradient. This electrochemical gradient favors the movement of protons back into the stroma, however, the H+ ions can only cross the thylakoid membrane by passing through an ATP synthase complex. Foyer and Shigeoka conclude that the movement of protons down their charge and concentration gradients through the ATP synthase complex is what drives the synthesis of ATP molecules by the ATP synthase complex [Foyer: 2011]. In a 1983 study performed by S. Robinson, W. Downton, and J. Millhouse, they found that the addition of 200 µM NaCl to the environment of spinach plants had no significent impact on leaf photosynthetic rates. They postulated that this was due to the morphological adaptation of the spinach leaves under salt-stress to thicken, suggesting that spinach is relatively tolerant of salt under such conditions and, thus, makes osmotic adjustments that result in relatively unchanged leaf photosynthetic rates [Robinson: 1983]. A 1989 study performed by D. Sundari and A. Raghavendra, however, found that the photosynthetic capacity of isolated spinach chloroplasts was rapidly inactivated in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, demonstrating the sensitivity of in vitro chloroplast reactions to osmotic stress [Sundari: 1989]. In addition to being widely grown and easily obtainable, spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts can easily be isolated for testing of photosynthetic properties, making spinach an ideal model organism to use in the testing of the capacity of isolated chloroplasts to perform photosynthesis in conditions of osmotic stress. Specifically, we plan on observing how NaCl, which had little to no effect on the photosynthetic capacities of chloroplasts still in spinach leaves, will affect the photosynthetic capacities of isolated spinach chloroplasts. In doing so, we hope to discern how the independent variable of the presence of NaCl has any effect on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts, measured in the dependent variable of the solution’s spectrophotometer absorbance (abs) over the course of 30 minutes in light conditions. In their 1979 research article, PK Panigrahi and UC Biswal discuss the Hill reaction, describing it as the evolution of O2 from CO2 accompanied by the reduction of an artificial electron acceptor, in this instance DCPIP, in a process separate from carbon fixation. DCPIP effectively acts as the final electron acceptor in place of NADP+ and is reduced in the coupled oxidation of water into O2. As DCPIP accepts electrons, i.e. is reduced, it loses color, the light change of which can be measured via spectrophotometer absorbances [Panigrahi: 1979].  DCPIP will be used as a redox dye, allowing us to effectively measure spec abs. With the addition of NaCl to the isolated chloroplast solution, we expect NaCl to decrease the rate of photosynthesis of the treatment chloroplasts, resulting in a greater percent change of absorbances at the end of 30 minutes.

Materials and Method:
To prepare the spinach chloroplasts, we first removed the central veins of 4 provided spinach leaves. The leaf remnants were grinded in a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). 10 additional Ml of grinding buffer were added in order to allow the mixture to be strained through cheesecloth. The contents were transferred into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4°C. Following centrifugation, the supernatant of “A” was poured into a second 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B” and centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. After this second centrifugation, the supernatant of “B” was then poured into a third 50 Ml tube marked “C”, now containing the source of isolated chloroplasts for the experiment. 10 test tubes were prepared utilizing the following solution mixtures—1 blank consisting of 5 Ml water, 2 Ml reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 3 Ml DCPIP; 3 controlls consisting of 5 Ml water, 3 Ml 120 mM DCPIP (a redox dye), 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 100 µL chloroplasts; 3 NaCl treatments consisting of 3 Ml of 120 mM DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, 5 Ml 100 mM NaCl, and 100 µL chloroplasts; 3 MgCl2 treatments consisting of 3 Ml 120 mM DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, 5 Ml 100 mM MgCl2, and 100 µL chloroplasts. After the addition of chloroplasts, each tube was mixed and transferred to cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was blanked using the blank and the absorbance for each sample was taken at 600 nm. Due to readings, a new blank was prepared with only 5 Ml water and 2 Ml reaction buffer. Samples were placed under light source and let sit for 10 minutes before re-blanking with the new blank and reading the absorbances of each of the samples. After recording each of the absorbances, the samples were returned to the light source for an additional 10 minutes before the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances of the samples were once again read and recorded. Samples were returned to the light source and let sit for a final 10 minutes before blanking the spectrophotometer and measuring absorbances for each of the samples. Since we predicted the percent change of the NaCl treatment samples to be greater than the percent change of the controll samples, we utilized a one-tailed t_test in order to determine if the percent change of the NaCl treatment sample at t30 was significently greater than the percent change of the controll sample at t30.

Results:
It is difficult to see the error bars for both the controll group and the NaCl treatment group due to the scale sizing in comparison to the MgCl2 treatment group and corresponding error bars. The controll group points are in fact hidden behind the NaCl treatment group points, again due to scale sizing. When looking at the overall trends in Figure 1, there does appear to be a slight trend of incline in the average absorbance of the NaCl treatment group over the course of 30 minutes, beginning at -166±23.3% change at t10 and ending with -83±27.8% change at t30. Using a one-tail t_test to measure whether or not the mean percent change of the NaCl treatment group was significently greater than the mean percent change of the controll group over the course of 30 minutes, we found that the NaCl treatment group mean percent change was, in fact, significently greater than the controll group mean percent change (t_stat = 3.00, d.f. = 2, P = 0.048). We know that the NaCl treatment group mean percent change was significently greater than the controll group mean percent change because our t_test resulted in a P-value less than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05). There also appears to be a slight trend of increase for the MgCl2 controll group in Figure 1, beginning at -3684±3016% change at t10 and ending at -3380±2963% change at t30, however, using a one-tail t_test to measure whether or not the mean percent change of the MgCl2 treatment group was significently greater than the mean percent change of the controll group over the course of 30 minutes, we found that the MgCl2 treatment group mean percent change was not significently greater than the controll group mean percent change (t_stat = -1.89, d.f. = 2, P = 0.098). We know that the MgCl2 treatment group mean percent change was not significently greater than the controll group mean percent change because our t_test resulted in a P-value greater than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05).

There appears a very observable increase in mean percent change over the course of 20 minutes for the NaCl treatment group in Figure 2, going from 18.5±3.18% change at t20 to 31.3±5.08% change at t30. This is reflected in the average spec abs. reading for the NaCl treatment group, going from 0.371±0.019 abs at t20 to 0.312±0.024 abs at t30. Using a one-tail t_test to measure whether or not the mean percent change of the NaCl treatment group was significently greater than the mean % change of the controll group over the course of 20 minutes (t10-t30), we found that the NaCl treatment group mean percent change was, in fact, significently greater than the controll group mean percent change (t_stat = 7.07, d.f. = 2, P = 0.009). We know that the NaCl treatment group mean percent change was significently greater than the controll group mean percent change because our t_test resulted in a P-value less than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05). There also appears to be a slightly less drastic increase in mean percent change over the course of 20 minutes for the MgCl2 treatment group in Figure 2, going from 5.28±2.44% change at t20 to 8.03±3.82% change at t30. This is reflected in the average spec abs. reading for the MgCl2 treatment group, going from 0.311±0.007 abs at t20 to 0.302±0.012 abs at t30. Nonetheless, using a one-tail t_test to measure whether or not the mean percent change of the MgCl2 treatment group was significently greater than the mean percent change of the controll group over the course of 20 minutes (t10-t30), we found that the MgCl2 treatment group mean percent change was not significently greater than the controll group mean percent change (t_stat = -1.15, d.f. = 2, P = 0.184). We know that the MgCl2 treatment group mean percent change was not significently greater than the controll group mean percent change because our t_test resulted in a P-value greater than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05). The actual mean absorbance reading of the MgCl2 treatment group at t30, 0.302±0.012 abs, however, was found to be significently less than the mean absorbance of the controll group, 0.457±0.061, with a P-value of 0.0009 using a one-tail t_test (t_stat = -22.4, d.f. = 2, P = 0.0009).

Discussion:
The results of our data support our initial hypothesis and confirm that the presence of NaCl does, in fact, reduce the photosynthetic rate of isolated spinach chloroplasts. A 1978 study performed by N. Baker suggests that an increase in cation concentration—in this case, Na+—essentially changes the thylakoid functions of isolated chloroplasts by increasing the number of hydrophobic interactions taking place within the thylakoid. Baker postulates that such an increase can change the structure and conformation of the thylakoid membrane and produce a decrease in secondary photochemical capacity [Baker: 1978]. This experiment testing in vitro spinach chloroplasts coincides with the Robinson study that tested photosynthetic capacities of in vivo spinach chloroplasts, which suggested that it was the leaf adaptability to salt stress that resulted in unchanged photosynthesis rate of chloroplasts [Robinson: 1983]. The Sundari study posits that presence of magnesium suppresses the reductive ability of complexes within Photosystem II, suggesting that osmotic stress on the isolated spinach chloroplasts rapidly impairs the electron transport from water to Photosystem I via Photosystem II [Sundari: 1989]. This decline in electron transport would subsequently lead to a weaker proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and, thus, a decrease in phosphorylation and ATP synthesis within the chloroplast. There were some procedural errors during this experiment, however, that can definitely be addressed in repeat experiments in order to yield more concise results. During our true t0, we realized that having DCPIP in our blank would make the results hard to interpret due to the fact that the spectrophotometer measured in absorbance and, if we were expecting a decrease in absorbance, we would have to work with negative numbers in our results. Instead, then, we created a new blank at t5 consisting only of water and reaction buffer, however, when taking the new readings, it was realized later on that we had forgotten to press the abs. 0 button in order to blank before recording absorbances, meaning that the recorded “t0” readings in Figure 1 were taken using a different blank than the rest of the data samples at t10, t20, and t30. For this reason, we decided to utilize t10 as our start time in the calculations for Figure 2 as all the readings from t10 onward were actually blanked with the same blank. We initially introduced the MgCl2 treatment as a group in which we could observe what true inhibition of photosynthetic capacities of chloroplasts looks like, since it was proven in prior studies, however, the mean percent change of the MgCl2 treatment group was not found to be statistically greater than the mean percent change of the controll group. This can be attributed to the fact that our starting absorbance reading was essentially taken at t10, meaning that any photosynthetic inhibition by MgCl2 that occurred within the first 10 minutes would not have been accounted for. Additionally, because DCPIP is a redox dye that loses color as it is reduced via accepting of electrons that would otherwise have gone to oxygen in the electron transport chain, the decreased absorbances we measured were coupled with a lightening of the samples. Once added to DCPIP, however, MgCl2 began to lighten the DCPIP to a shade of purple even before chloroplasts were added, indicating that a reductive reaction occurred even before chloroplasts with photosynthetic capacities were introduced. This could be a confounding factor in the percent change data, as the actual absorbance reading for the MgCl2 treatment group was found to be significently lower than the controll group. In addition to stricter procedural adherence, therefore, a different means of measuring photosynthesis other than DCPIP will be necessary in a repeat experiment should MgCl2 be utilized again. Overall, though, our experiment concluded that the photosynthetic capacity of isolated spinach chloroplasts in solution with NaCl had a significently greater percent change and, thus, more inhibited photosynthetic rate than just isolated spinach chloroplasts.
