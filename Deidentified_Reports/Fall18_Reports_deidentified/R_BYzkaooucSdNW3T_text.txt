Title: Inhibition of contractions in the presence of tubocurarine in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine to its receptor on the post-synaptic muscle fiber is essential in producing muscle contraction. Many poisons and other toxic substances often include chemical inhibitors that cause muscle paralysis. In this experiment, we look at the inhibition of contractions in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens in response to the introduction of tubocurarine. We hypothesized that the tubocurarine would decrease the amplitude of twitch threshold in the muscle in response to sciatic nerve stimulus due to its selective blocking of the acetylcholine receptor. Thresholds were recorded at increasing levels of stimulus for three legs of the Rana pipiens prior to and after injection of tubocurarine. After applying statistical analysis, our data demonstrated a significant difference between the amplitude of the thresholds before and after the acetylcholine antagonist was present in the muscle, and our hypothesis was supported.

Introduction:
The topic of interest of this experiment is the effects of a neurotransmitter inhibitor in muscle contraction. Neurotransmitters are crucial in the innervation of motor neurons, and they play important roles in the production of a muscle movement. The northern leopard frog, or Rana pipiens, is the model organism in this experiment because it is a species with an accessible and isolatable gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a key neurotransmitter in the neuromuscular system, and it is present in the presynaptic terminal. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction to release ACh into the synapse between the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells [Johnson: 2018]. ACh binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChr) on ligand-gated channels that allow sodium ions to depolarize the postsynaptic cell [Wenningmann: 2001]. This depolarization event releases calcium ions, which activates the shortening of muscle fibers and results in muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. Tubocurarine is a muscle paralytic agent found in the toxic secretions from poison dart frogs and curare plants [Bernard: 1856]. Historically, tubocurarine has been used to poison arrows, but it was also used as an anesthetic in the 1940s [Griffith: 1942]. Tubocurarine was later replaced by safer alternative substances in medicine. Tubocurarine is an inhibitor of the nAChr by acting as an ACh antagonist [Wenningmann: 2001]. Its inhibitory actions prevent the depolarization of the postsynaptic cell [Gibb: 1984]. Therefore, tubocurarine is expected to prevent muscle contractions and cause paralysis. We hypothesized that if tubocurarine is applied to the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of the Rana pipiens, it will reduce the amplitude of muscle contractions and inhibit movement in the gastrocnemius muscle.

Materials and Methods:
Three legs of Rana pipiens were selected to test our hypothesis with the same three subjects belonging in both the control and experimental groups. The experiment requires the isolation of the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve in each leg. The specimen was prepared through degloving of the skin and exposure of the sciatic nerve from the leg. The gastrocnemius muscle was partially detached and suspended from a force transducer, and the sciatic nerve was placed directly in contact with a stimulator electrode for nerve stimulation and measurement of muscle response (Fig. 1). The electrode was connected to an amplifier controlled by the iWorks software, which was used to apply and record stimulation of muscle contractions (Fig. 1). The sciatic nerves of the three frog legs were directly stimulated with increasing voltages, and the threshold amplitudes for muscle response were recorded prior to the introduction of tubocurarine. After allowing the three legs to rest for three to five minutes, 0.1 mL of 1mM tubocurarine was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of each frog leg, and a single drop was placed on the sciatic nerve. The three legs were rested again for another three to five minutes after the injection, and the amplitudes were measured at the same voltages applied prior to the injection. A paired t-test was used to determine differences in threshold between the control group and the experimental group.

Results:
We used the paired t-test to statistically analyze our data. The average threshold of the control group was 0.826 mV with a standard deviation of 0.145, and the average weight of the experimental group was 0.159 mV with a standard deviation of 0.155 (Fig. 2). The averages of the thresholds of the control group and experimental group were significantly different (t-stat = 7.291464, df= 10, P= 2.63E-5). The average maximum threshold of the control group was 1.089 mV with a standard deviation of 0.111, and the average maximum threshold of the experimental group was 0.149 mV with a standard deviation of 0.103 (Fig. 3). The maximum thresholds of the control group and experimental group were significantly different (t-stat = 18.627256, df= 2, P= 0.00287). When observing the muscle contractions during the experiment, we noticed visible and distinct muscle contractions in our control group, while the experimental group demonstrated minor movements in response to stimulus.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that the introduction of tubocurarine would inhibit muscle contractions was supported. Based on the statistical tests applied to our data, we calculated a significant difference between the threshold responses of the control and experimental groups. Measurements of amplitude in the control and experimental groups showed that the experimental group had a significantly lower threshold in comparison to the control group. Our observations demonstrate that the acetylcholine antagonist, tubocurarine, prevents muscle contraction because our control group was exhibiting pronounced muscle movement in response to stimulus, while the movements of our experimental group either diminished significantly or did not appear to occur. The paralysis demonstrated after injection of tubocurarine supports results demonstrated in past experiments [Gibb: 1984]. Our observations and results were statistically significant, indicating that application of tubocurarine inhibits muscle contraction and causes paralysis. Our findings suggest that tubocurarine acts as a competitor to acetylcholine, reducing the likelihood of acetylcholine binding to its receptor in the post-synaptic cell [Wenningmann: 2001]. If we were to repeat the experiment, we would increase the number of subjects and modify our methodology by increasing resting time prior to and after the injection in order to ensure that the muscle and sciatic nerve were fully bathed in the tubocurarine. Understanding how acetylcholine receptor inhibitors influence muscle contraction could further our understanding of muscle paralytics and their effects organisms.
