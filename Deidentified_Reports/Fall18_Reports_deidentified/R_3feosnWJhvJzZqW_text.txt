Title: The Effect of Sodium Chloride on the Photosynthetic Activity in Brassica oleracae

Abstract:
Salinity has the potential to affect the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts by altering the photosystems. In order to observe the supposed effects, one leaf of Brassica oleracae, or kale, was grinded into a thick paste and centrifuged until obtaining the desired 50 Ml sample of grinding buffer and chloroplast pellet. The chloroplasts were then exposed to varying concentrations of salinity: 1M, 0.5M, and 0.1M. Absorbance were recording initially and after 10, 20, and 30 minutes of incubation. Although in close competition with chloroplasts of the 1M solution, those exposed to the 0.5M solution experienced the greatest inhibited of photosynthetic activity from time 0 to time 30 (p=0.0003). Detachment of an important protein is the cause of the inhibition of activity for chloroplasts under high salt-stress along with dehydration. 


Introduction:
Autotrophs use the process of photosynthesis in order to harvest and store solar energy. Later this energy is released during glycolysis and cellular respiration. All three of these processes combined form three metabolic process essential to the growth and development of the organism. Although these processes have similarities such as oxidation and reduction reaction and proton pumps, there are specific features of photosynthesis specifically that make it an intriguing area of study. In general, this process involves distinct stages: light dependent reactions and light independent reactions. Focusing on the light dependent reactions, photosystem I and photosystem II, chloroplasts absorb solar energy, which then excites electrons that cleave water and generates a proton gradient [Johnson:2016]. This gradient is specifically important because the pumping of protons across the inner membrane of the cell allows for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase in the electron transport chain. NADPH reduces each carrier- cytochrome a, cytochrome b, cytochrome c1, and oxygen as the final electron acceptor in complex IV [Erwin, Gesick: 2017]. The reduction of electron acceptors and ATP production can be measured by the Hill reaction, or the electron transfer in the presence of light [Botanical Name Kale: 2018]. In this experiment, the electron acceptor is DCIP, a dark pigment that absorbs light at 600 nm. There are many different factors that can affect photosynthetic activity. This report will specifically focus on the result of NaCl on the photosynthetic activity of Brassica oleracae, or kale leaves. Kale is a large leafed member of the cabbage family that grows primarily in the fall. Although little is known about the effect of specific salt ions on kale chloroplasts, past studies have shown that the result of salinity is organism independent. This means that ion concentration can either increase the rate of photosynthesis, as a seen through spinach leaves, or slow it, as seen through pea plants. However, the effects are predicted to be osmotic [Nieman: 1962]. It is important to study salinity’s effect so that the community can act accordingly to preserve vegetation given the results. Specifically, the presence of NaCl is hypothesized to slow the rate of photosynthetic activity by both dehydrating molecules and stripping proteins from the electron transport chain. 


Materials and Method:
Part 1 of the experiment: 

The materials used in this experiment were 3 different concentrations of NaCl, cheese cloth, 1 kale leaf, a centrifuge, and a spectrometer. To begin, a mortar and pestle along with a medium sized beaker and 3 centrifuge tubes were chilled on ice. Meanwhile, the veins from 1 kale leaf were removed. The mortar and pestle were then wiped dry and crushed up kale leaf was grinded into a paste. Ten Ml of grinding buffer was added to the paste and grinding again. This process was repeated 2 more times. Once no more chunked remained, the mixture was strained through a piece of cheesecloth into a beaker. Two hundred microliters of the filtrate was placed into a microtubule labeled “sample of a.” The remains of the liquid in the beaker was transferred into a  chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A.” This sample, along with a balance, was spin at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant of tube A was poured into another chilled centrifuge tube labeled “B,” being extra careful not to transfer the pellet at the bottom of the tube. A two hundred microliter sample was taken from “B” and placed into a microtube labeled “sample of B” and stored on ice. Tube “B” was spun at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 40 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was poured into a tube labeled “C”, being careful not to disturb the pellet at the bottom of the tube. Twenty Ml of grinding puffer was added to the pellet and suspended. A 200-microliter sample was transferred to a microtube labeled “sample of B pellet.”

Part 2: Addition of NaCl 

Sixteen test tubes were obtained and labeled blank and then 1-15. One hundred microliters of “sample of B pellet” was added to each test tube except for 13-15. Eight Ml of water was added to the blank. Two Ml of 130 M DCIP was added to the tubes 1-15 along with 6 Ml of the respective salt concentration. Tubes 1-3 received a 1M concentration. Tubes 4-6 received a 0.5 M concentration. Tubes 7-9 received a 0.1M concentration. Tubes 10-12 were positive controll and received a 0M concentration of NaCl, meaning just water. Tubes 13-15 did not contain chloroplasts or a salt concentration. Two Ml of reaction buffer was added to every tube. The components of each tube were mixed. The mixtures were transferred to cuvettes. The blank was used to set the spectrometer at 600 nm. Absorbance for each tube were recorded at time zero and then placed into the light. The absorbance was recorded again after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The statistical test used is a two sample t_test. 



Results:
As observed in figure 1, the photosynthetic activity decreases with time in all samples except for the negative controll. Within each respective time, there is competition between whether the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts treated with either 1M or 0.5M NaCl were most inhibited. However, by time 30, the 0.5 M groups’ photosynthetic activity was most inhibited ( p = 0.0003). The “C” above the two bars means that these two are of the same concentration and are not related to the other concentrations. The “***” means that the p value is &lt;.001. On another note, the negative controll was least inhibited by the end of the 30 minutes. However, it was effectively inhibited from time zero to ten minutes which is represented by the “****” signifying a p value less than 0.0001. The positive controll is evidence that our experiment is working, and that there actually was an decrease in activity from time 0-10. The “****” above the bar represents that from time 0 to time 10 means the p value between these two times was &lt;0.0001. This means that the results were most definitely statistically significent. A strange trend in the data is that the photosynthetic activity begins to increase again at 30 minutes after. However, the activity is still significently lower than the initial photosynthetic activity at time zero. The positive controll showed the largest, most dramatic decrease in activity as seen in figure 1 (p=.02). The “B” on the figure means that these two are correlated and the * means that there is a p value less than or equal &lt;0.05. The chloroplasts that received the 0.1M solution of NaCl experienced the least inhibition on the photosynthetic activity. 

As previously observed in figure 1, the negative controll tubes resulted in lowest percent change, meaning that the activity of the electrons was least inhibited. A statement that holds true for all groups is that the percent change increased from time 0 to time 10. Additionally, by the end of the 30 minutes, the percent change decreased systematically meaning that the photosynthetic activity increased across the board. Of the treatment groups specifically, the chloroplasts exposed to the 0.5 M solution of NaCl resulted in the largest percent change as directly seen in figure 2. 



Discussion:
The absorbance is a measurement of photosynthetic activity. If the absorbance is low, it is a result of the inhibition of photosynthetic activity. Specifically, the photosynthetic activity is described as how well the organism is able to produce ATP. In terms of the Hill reaction, the activity is how well the carrier NADP+ of the chloroplasts can transfer its electrons to an acceptor, DCIP, in the presence of light. In the experiment, the negative controlls’ photosynthetic activity was least effected due to the absence of chloroplasts. Without chloroplasts, photosynthesis cannot take place. As for the NaCl, the accumulation of the sodium and the chloride ions does hinder photosynthetic activity in the cytoplasm. The effects of NaCl are partially observed during photosystem 1, which regulates the non-cyclic portion of the electron transport chain. However, the effects of sodium and chloride ions can be predominately be observed through photosystem 2 because of the detachment of 23 kDa, an important protein, from the polypeptide chain previously bound to photosystem 2. This act, reduces oxygen activity as well, which is important to the electron transport chain because it serves as the final electron acceptor before the cleavage of water. [Sudhir, Murthy: 2004]. The intial deteachment of the protein kDa, caused by salt, results in a chain reaction that prevents the production of ATP. It is logical that the chloroplasts exposed to the higher salt concentrations, both 1M and 0.5M, experienced a larger decrease in photosynthetic activity than the chloroplasts of the lower molarity solution. It is important to understand the effects of salinity on organisms so that one can prolong their growth and development. The results of the experiment advise that kale plants grow in an environment with low salinity. However, the effects of NaCl are independent of the organism. Previous studies have shown that salinity stimulates cellular respiration and stimulates photosystem 1 activity in cyanobacteria living in a salt-stressed environment. Cyanobacteria has a salinity tolerance mechanism that allows it to produce co-solutes such as sucrose and proline to counteract the effects of NaCl [Sudhir, Murthy: 2004]. If this experiment were to be conducted again, we would aim to be more precise in the addition of the reactants. Moreover, an idea for further study could be to add sucrose to the chloroplasts of kale to imitate the salinity tolerance mechanism present in cyanobacteria.
