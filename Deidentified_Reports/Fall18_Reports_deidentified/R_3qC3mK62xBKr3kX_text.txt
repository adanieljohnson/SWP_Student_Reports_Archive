Title: How Color Impacts the Intraspecific Behavior of Betta Fish

Abstract:
Betta fish (Betta splendins) are an aggressive type of fish native to Thailand. The male counterpart of this species exhibits extreme amounts of intraspecies behaviors; often reacting violently with another male invading the territory. Their aggression originates from color as wild betta fish are usually dull but flash vibrant colors when agitated. Based on previous unrecorded, experiments, it was hypothesized that the bettas would have a stronger reaction towards the red cutout as red fish seemed to be more aggressive. In order to test the impact color has on these fish, an experiment was conducted comparing red and blue pigments to see which would illicit a stronger aggressive response. This experiment utilized two red males and two blue males, along with two fake intruders, one red and one blue. These fake intruders were cut out with foam to mimic the fish shape and were roughly the same size. The behavior exhibited from the fish towards a false intruder was quantified on a scale of 0-3, with increasing aggressive display. A two-tailed, two-sample t_test was conducted to determine the statistical significance of the reaction of betta fish to red and blue. The statistical test valued the data as insignificent, meaning that the hypothesis was rejected. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendins or betta fish, are highly territorial aquatic creatures prone to aggressive display [Figler: 1972]. The direction of aggression is intraspecific, with male Betta fish responding the most aggressively towards male competition [Johnson: 1973]. This type of behavior is critical in establishing territorial boundaries when competing with other members of its species as the more aggressive a male betta is, the more likely it is to secure territory [Johnson: 1973]. While this marine species generally vary in dull colors such as browns or greys in the wild, they flare vibrant colors when agitated. [Figler: 1972] Other aggressive cues include both broadside movements and facing movements; where the fish directly engages the competitor [Figler: 1972]. Broadside movements occur when a fish turns its side towards the opponent such as tail beating or pelvic fin flickering [Simpson: 1968]. Facing movements include spreading its gill covers, setting up a more confrontational environment [Simpson: 1968]. The most aggressive display is a facing movement when the fish protrudes the branchiostegal membranes beneath the operculum, producing a “red mane” [Simpson: 1968]. However, this agnostic behavior is extremely costly to the host, so only certain cues should trigger this aggressive behavior. Betta fish that recognize an intruder should be looking for certain cues that ensure how much energy should be allocated towards this agnostic display. [Figler: 1972] If the competitor is also displaying aggressive behavior, then the subject would allocate more resources to fuel an equal if not stronger response. Through patient observation, the experiment will compare whether color impacts male betta fish aggression. Since laboratory betta fish are traditionally red and blue, those colors should signal aggressive behavior. Blue can often mimic the color of water, with red being a more stark contrast [Simpson: 1968]. Betta fish respond more actively against more vibrant colors as movements are more visible [Simpson: 1968]. The hypothesis is that if a male betta fish is presented with a competing male, then a red male should trigger a more aggressive reaction than a blue male.

Materials and Method:
In a small aquarium, two fake foam betta fish (one blue and one red) were used as the main variable in the experiment. With regular male betta fish, two blues and two reds, the interactions were observed in five-minute intervals. Each fish was individually matched with a blue then a red. For each of the male betta fishes, there was a five-minute observation and rest period. The aggressive actions and the amount of times they were performed were recorded as individual data sets. The levels of aggression were labeled on a scale of 0-3, with three being the most agitated form of aggressive behavior. Each behavior was then added up to have a final sum. Broadside movements were valued at one because they were the least aggressive movement. Facing movements, excluding the “red mane” were valued as two, as they were confrontational. The most aggressive display, the “red mane” was valued the highest at three. A sum of zero meant no interaction. Afterwards, a two-sample, two-tailed t_test was applied to evaluate the results.

Results:
The overall average aggressiveness was more substantial towards the red foam fish rather than the blue foam fish. I did not use units as the numbers were for viewing the level of aggression, a unitless variable. The raw data indicated that the overall aggressive quantities for the red decoy was 35 and for the blue decoy, it was 29. For the red decoy, the average was 8.75 +/- 5.64 for aggressive behaviors from the fish. For the blue decoy, the overall average was 7.25 +/- 2.65. (Figure 1). The difference of colors viewed by the subject fish, was not statistically significent. (t_stat = 0.479361, d.f. = 6, P = 0.648653.)

Discussion:
The hypothesis is ultimately rejected. The t_test conducted deemed the difference not statistically significent. There were too many loose variables in the experiment that flawed the overall results. The foam fish may not have been realistic enough to trigger a response from the test subjects and thus, insufficient data was collected. The tank itself also had reflective surfaces so aggressive responses could also have come from the subjects own reflection rather than the foam intruder. Other variables could have been simply a decreased level of aggression in general due to possible previous experiments conducted on the fish. Habitation from repeated exposure to other males could have impacted how these fish reacted to an intruder. [Harman: 1970] If the intruder did not pose an actual threat, the subject would have no reason to engage needlessly and waste precious energy. This ability to conserve energy and allocate it to certain actions is how species are able to survive. [Castro: 2006]. If the fish were to engage in agnostic behavior, they would have to commit to the engagement. By eliciting an aggressive response, they are knowingly using resources that could be otherwise directed towards direct survivability. [Bronstein: 1981] For the experiment conducted, the value to engaging a likely harMless intruder, may not have been worth the cost.  Generally, the fish did not react immediately to the false intruder, indicating they may not have registered the fake fish as another competitor. In order to conserve resources for the costly expression of antagnostic behavior, they chose not to waste resources. If this experiment were to be repeated, it would be more ideal to remove any variables not pertaining to the experiment. These would include placing the fish in a mirror-less tank and finding either more realistic fake fish or real fish instead. The experiment could also be improved with non-habituated betta fish to illicit a fresh reaction rather than a desensitized subject.
