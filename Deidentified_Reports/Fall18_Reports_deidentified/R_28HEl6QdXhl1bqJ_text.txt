Title: Dependence of Concentration of Lanthanum Trichloride for the Inhibition of Contractile Movement of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The main purpose of this experiment is to see the effects of contractile movement in   Physarum polycephalum with the inhibitor lanthanum trichloride. The IP3 cellular pathway regulates the release of calcium using its secondary messengers to allow for contractile movement. To test the effect of the inhibitor, a chemotaxis and a phototaxis experiment is produced. Chemotaxis allows to test to see the effects of chemical on organism with the experiment adding a positive stimulus of food. Phototaxis places an organism in the environmental condition of as the stimulus to observe the movement. The hypothesis for the chemotaxis is that the treatment group will migrate less towards the positive stimulus, while the controll group moves towards the positive stimulus. The hypothesis for chemotaxis is that the treatment group will have positive phototaxis, while the controll group will have negative phototaxis. The experiment is tested by placing a controll and treatment group of Physarum for 24 hours to record the measurements. The results of chemotaxis and phototaxis was no statistically significance in the lanthanum trichloride’s inhibition of contractile movement which was unexpected. However, studies shows the dependence of inhibitor concentration which suggests error in the experiment. 

Introduction:
Cellular signal pathways are an important communication mechanism in organisms that allows a regulated response to an external or internal stimulus. However, a malfunction in the cellular signal pathway can result in negative consequences in the organism. A breakdown of cellular signal pathway is recognized in Huntington disease. Huntington disease is a genetically disease that progressively decreases cognitive thought, emotion, and movement caused by the long repetition of a trinucleotide in the Huntington disease gene [Raymond: 2017]. This gene produces associated huntingtin disease proteins that alters the calcium regulation in the body by sensitizing the receptor of secondary messenger IP3. This allows for an increase influx of calcium released which causes abnormal involuntary movement [Tang: 2003]. This shows that the activation of calcium resulted in a negative impact. This leads to the main purpose of this experiment which is to add an inhibiting factor to the IP3 cellular pathway to see the impacts of contractile movement. The IP3 cellular pathway is a G-protein receptor that regulates the intracellular channels of calcium on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum through two secondary messengers: IP3 and diacylglycerol. This experiment is going to test the effects of Lanthanum Trichloride, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium channels in the IP3, towards contractile movement. The model organism that will be used in the experiment is Physarum polycephalum, since it is cost effective and it exhibits similar signal pathways as humans such as the IP3 signal pathway. In the experiment, a chemotaxis and a phototaxis will be performed to act as different stimulus for movement of Physarum. Chemotaxis consists of testing chemical substances to see the effects on the model organism with different stimulus and in experiment, a positive stimulus of food is added. Phototaxis is the procedure of placing the organism in an environmental condition of light as the stimulus for movement. Physarum tends to favor darker conditions for growth rather than with light. For the chemotaxis experiment, the hypothesis is that the treatment group will migrate less towards the positive stimulus due to the Lanthanum trichloride inhibition of contractions, while the controll group moves towards the positive stimulus. For the phototaxis experiment, the hypothesis is that the treatment group will have positive phototaxis since the organism will not be able to migrate away from the light, while the controll group will have negative phototaxis [Johnson: 2018].

Materials and Method:
The experiment was designed to compare the contractile movement of Physarum between a controll group and a treatment group that contained the inhibitor lanthanum trichloride in two separate experiments. Each treatment group of Physarum needed to interact with lanthanum trichloride with a diluted concentration of 50 µM in its growing environment. Therefore, 60 Ml of distilled water was added to 3 Ml of stock solution of lanthanum trichloride. Then 5 Ml of the diluted solution was pipetted into all the physarum treatment petri dishes needed for chemotaxis and phototaxis for 10 minutes, before removing any excess material [Johnson: 2018]. 
For the setup of the chemotaxis experiment, six petri dishes of 2% agar were used to provide three replicates for the controll group and three replicates for the treatment group. In addition, obtained a stock plate of Physarum that would be tested in this experiment. Each controll and treatment petri dish had a well of 1 cm by 1 cm of the agar cut and removed from the center by using a spatula cleaned with ethanol. During the process, the spatula was cleaned with ethanol after every use to reduce the chance of contamination of the petri dishes. From the Physarum stock plate, 1 cm by 1 cm blocks were cut to be placed into the wells of the controll and treatment groups, again was alert to keep spatula cleaned with ethanol. Then five oats were placed along the same side of each controll and treatment group before lids closed and secured with tape. Then the controll and treatment groups were placed in black bag to allow no light to enter and was placed in an incubator for 24 hours. Then the bag was removed to allow for the measurement, observation, and the recording of results of the movement of Physarum. To test to see if there was statistical significance between the controll and the treated Physarum, a two-tailed sample t test was utilized with an alpha value of 0.05 [Johnson: 2018].
For the setup of the phototaxis environment, six potato dextrose agar plates were used to provide three replicates for the controll group and three replicates for the treatment group. In addition, obtained a stock plate of Physarum that would be tested in this experiment. Each controll and treatment petri dish had a well of 1 cm by 1 cm of the agar cut and removed from the center by using a spatula cleaned with ethanol. During the preparation of the petri dishes, the spatula was cleaned after every use to reduce the chance of contamination of the petri dishes. From the physarum stock plate, 1 cm by 1 cm blocks were cut to be placed into the wells of the controll and treatment group. Then the controll and treatment groups were closed with tape and wrapped in tin foil. Then a small opening was created in the tin foil to allow small amount of light to test if the directionality of light as well as the distance of migration. The petri dishes were then placed in a light box for 24 hours. The petri dishes were then removed to all for the measurement, observation and recording of the results of the movement of Physarum. To test to see if there was statistical significance between the controll and the treated Physarum, a two-tailed sample t test was used with an alpha value of 0.05 [Johnson: 2018].


Results:
In Figure 1, the results of the chemotaxis experiment present that the Physarum of the controll group had traveled 22.3 mm while the treatment group had traveled only 18.3 mm. To test if the result was statistically significent, a two tailed sample t_test is used with an alpha value of 0.05. The p_value is calculated at 0.65, concluding the results are not statistically significent. In Figure 2, the results of the phototaxis experiment presents the controll group had traveled about 4.67 mm while the treatment group had only traveled 2.33 mm. In addition, the general direction was observed for both the controll and treatment group. In the controll group, each replicate heads towards the light while the treatment replicates had mix results of going towards and away light. To test if the result is statistically significent, a two tailed sample t_test is used at an alpha value of 0.05. The p_value is calculated to be 0.24 concluding that the results are not statistically significent.

Discussion:
Based on the results of the chemotaxis experiment, the hypothesis of the treatment group would migrate less towards the positive stimulus due to the inhibitor Lanthanum trichloride was not supported because the results were not statistically significent. These results were surprising due to the multiple studies that suggest that the inhibitor lanthanum trichloride should have inhibited the contractile movement. According to a study completed by N.B. Matveeva, when studying the effect of 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl Borate, a membrane permeable inhibitor for calcium ion channels, they noticed how the inhibitor would stop movement at various times between the concentrations of the inhibitor at 20µM- 50µM. They concluded that the likelihood of a fast stop of movement was two times greater at high concentration amount of 50µM than of lower concentration of 20µM [Matveeva: 2009]. Another study conducted an experiment on the effects of lanthanum on contraction of frog muscle fibres. The results of the study explained that between the range of 0.05-0.3 mM produce a isometric twitch that was concentration dependent [Andersson: 1974]. With evidence that supports the experiments hypothesis, it seems that the data of the experiment differed due to experiential error in the experiment. A study reveals that any inorganic salts, like lanthanum trichloride, has a specific concentration threshold to meet before the inhibition can be active [UEDA: 1975]. Perhaps the concentration of the lanthanum trichloride was too diluted in concentration which cause no inhibition, or the dilution delayed the inhibition of the muscle contraction since the results was only gathered for a day instead of observing the movement over time. 
Based on the results of the phototaxis experiment, the hypothesis that the controll group would have negative phototaxis treatment group will have positive phototaxis due to the migration was not statistically significent. The reason for the surprising results from the distance of migration is how the concentration of the inhibitor dictates the ability to stop growth suddenly or gradually stop as previously mention, but it does not explain the surprising results of the directionality in phototaxis. However, according to the study, the directionality of the physarum in phototaxis depends on the calcium levels. If there is an influx between the calcium level can inhibit the photo-orientation of the organism. This could explain why the controll groups did not achieve negative phototaxis since there could have been calcium influxes in the Physarum. In addition, when there is a calcium blocker, like the inhibitor lanthanum trichloride, the study showed that there was an inhibition of negative phototaxis suggesting that there could be a gated channel for calcium to create the opposite effect that is expected [Hader: 1985]. While the concentration of the inhibitor could not stop the contractile movement, it could have possible interfere with the photo-orientation of the Physarum. For this experiment, adjustments with having more replicates and testing various concentrations would allow the errors experience in this experiment to be resolved. However, this experiment showed the complexity of cellular pathway signals by the various interactions of components, and an error that is found in a pathway can create a negative consequence to an organism.
