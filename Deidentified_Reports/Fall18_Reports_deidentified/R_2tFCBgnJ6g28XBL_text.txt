Title: Difference in aggression levels of male Betta splendens when competing for food and competing for females

Abstract:
the purpose of this experiment was to investigate any difference in levels of aggression shown when Betta Splendens are competing for food and competing for females. This experiment was conducted by running several trials in which two males were placed together in the presence of a female and other trials were they were in the presence of a female. The aggressive behaviors that the fish regularly exhibit were ranked and each male B. splendid was given points every time they exhibited one of these behaviors. In the end, it was concluded that there was not a statistically significant difference in the average value of aggressive behaviors shown when the males were competing for food and competing for females. 

Introduction:
Interspecific behavior is competition between members of the same species. This type of competition is especially present among the species Betta splendens. When faced with another male of the species, B. splenden will present a series of agonistic or aggressive behaviors. These behaviors include broadside movements such as pelvic fin flicking, tail flashing, and tail beating. Facing movements such as erecting the pectoral fins, spreading the gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegel membranes are other agonistic behaviors the fish exhibit. For this experiment, it was investigated wether or not the B. splendens would exhibit more aggressive behavior when competing for a female or competing for food. These fish tend to be aggressive and territorial when faced with other males [Bronstein: 1981]. Therefore, It was hypothesized that the two males would act more aggressively when faced with competition to obtain food. 

Materials and Methods:
First, to gather a control, the behavior of two males without a stimuli were observed. The glass partitions were removed and obersevations were recorded for a five minute period. in order to quantify the data, a ranking system of the aggressive behaviors  was set in place as follows
Broadside movements
1 point - pelvic fin flicking
2 points - tail beating
3 points - tail flashing
facing movements
1 point - erect pectoral fins
2 points - spread gill covers
3 points - protrude branchiostegel membranes
the numbers were recorded each time the fish exhibited one of the behaviors
A five minute period of rest was taken and then the behavior of the two males in the presence of the female was recorded using the same ranking system, for a five minute period. 
Another five minute period of rest was taken before the behavior of the males of the presence of food was recorded for a five minute period
All of these trials were then done with another set of fish. 

Results:
An anova test was run to compare the aggressive behaviors exhibited between the two stimuli and it yelled statistically non-significant results (Fs= 0.749, df= 2, p=0.560).   

Discussion:
After completing the experiment, it was concluded that there was not a signifiant difference among the number of aggressive behaviors shown between the B. splendens when competing for food and competing for females. These results may have been affected by some kind of confounding variable, such as how many times the fish were used in the experiments before this, which may have tired them out. Although this variable set did not affect the interspecific interactions among the fish, there are likely other variables that will that are able to researched in the future.
