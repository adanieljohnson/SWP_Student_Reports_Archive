Title: Signaling Effects of Sodium Chloride on Physarum

Abstract:
Some organisms utilize actin filaments to move around their environment. One such organism is physarum, which is a flat organism that thrives in dark and damp environments. As long as physarum remains in this environment, it remains in a reproductive state and continues to look for food. In this experiment, we tested the effects of sodium chloride on physarum migration. We predicted that the sodium chloride would increase the movements of physarum migration. To test our hypothesis, we placed the physarum on frozen potato agar plates and hung them vertically. After 24 hours, we measured the physarum movement and observed that the physarum moved slightly down, but to did not move a significant amount. We performed a two-tailed t-test for significance. A p-value of 0.36 was calculated, which indicated our data was not statistically significant. As a result, we rejected our hypothesis.


Introduction:
In cells, there are three types of filaments: actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. Actin acts as a filament in the cytoskeleton. Also, they act as thin filaments, which are the mechanisms for muscle contractions in sarcomeres. Some organisms utilize actin for movement. One such organism is Physarum, which uses actin filaments to extend its leading edge and move about. Physarum spends most of its life in the plasmodial stage, and it is yellow and flat. Growing up to a 30cm diameter, Physarum thrives in dark, damp environments like the bottoms of rotting leaves. In order to eat, Physarum utilizes its actin filaments to move organic debris to food vacuoles for digestion. In the laboratory, potato dextrose sugar (PDA) is used to feed Physarum. Also, oatmeal flakes can be used as a food source. Both of these provide starch and sugar for the Physarum. However, in PDA, the nutrients are distributed more evenly than the oatmeal. Additionally, all of the nuclei are diploid, which means they have homogeneous pairs of chromosomes during this stage. As long as Physarum remains in a dark, damp environment with plenty of food, it remains a multicellular organism. However, Physarum can split off, making new organism that are a clone of the parent. [Lott : 1985] If food is absent or the conditions are stressed, then the plasmodium hardens and Physarum goes into a hibernating state. Additionally, when stressors like light or heat are applied to Physarum, it restricts the reproductive cycle. The reproductive cycle occurs as follows: the plasmodium fragments into sporangia that form spore capsules. Cells then form spores, which are moved to new locations by wind and rain. These spores then form swarm cells of the same mating type. This way, the swarm cells cannot mate with each other, and they must move to a new, more distant location to find swarm cells of the opposite mating type. When two swarm cells of opposite mating types meet, a zygote is formed. [Stew : 2010]If we test the migration patterns of Physarum with gravitaxis and added sodium chloride, then we expect for an extended length of migration and for it to travel with gravity because the sodium chloride heightens the pathways and causes it to move with gravity. 


Materials and Methods:
In exercise 1, we handled the Physarum cultures. A flat spatula and forceps was placed in ethanol for sterilization. 3 potato agar plates and a 1cm block was cut from water agar. Physarum was then moved to the empty blocks. 3 more potato agar plates were taken and another 1cm block was cut from the water agar plate and filled with sodium chloride. The Physarum was then moved to the empty blocks. [Adams : 2013] 6 plates were then wrapped in foil and left 24 hours vertically. After 24 hours, the amount of Physarum movement was measured and recorded. A two-tailed T test was then preformed to test our results for statistical significance. [Takamatsu : 2004]


Results:

The physarum group with no added Sodium Chloride moved 2mm. The physarum group with added Sodium Chloride moved 3mm. Our negative control moved 10mm. A two tailed T-test produced a p-value of P-Value: 0.362329, which showed that pour data was not statistically significant. Our negative control moved much more than both the group that was given sodium chloride and the group without any added sodium chloride. Likewise, both the group that was not goien sodium chloride moved slightly less than the group that was given sodium chloride.


Discussion:
After our two-tailed T-test gave us a 0.36 p-value, our hypothesis—which stated that the sodium chloride would positively influence the migration of physarum—was rejected. In our results, we determined that the Physarum mostly moved down and slightly to the side. Since the Physarum was given a food source of potato agar plates, our controls were given the energy to move. Furthermore, the Physarum samples given sodium chloride for food also moved, as well as our negative control. One reason the Physarum moved in a downward direction is because the force of gravity encouraged the Physarum to move downward, as the distribution of nutrients in the potato agar plates were evenly distributed. This even distribution prevented the Physarum from favoring one direction over another in terms of searching for food. In other words, the physarum failed to migrate on its own. Since the PDA plates were frozen, the physarum was exposed to an extremely cold temperature. As a result, the migration of physarum was either drastically slowed or completely halted.
