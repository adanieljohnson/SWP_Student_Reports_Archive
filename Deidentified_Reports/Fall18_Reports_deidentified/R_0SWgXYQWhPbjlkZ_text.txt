Title: Nitrogen's Effect on Resource Allocation in the Roots and Shoots of Pisum sativun

Abstract:
	Pisum sativun (field peas), a plant known for its resource allocation abilities, was studied to find the effects of nitrogen on the allocation of resources to the roots and shoots of the plant. The importance of this experiment is to see how nitrogen from runoff may affect plant growth. Our hypothesis was that field peas with extra nitrogen in their soil, would allocate less resources to their roots compared to a controll group of field peas. We grew Field peas in a nitrogen rich environment and in a controll environment and then compared the root-shoot ratios from each. After running the experiment, we found that there is support that nitrogen effects root and shoot length in field peas.


Introduction:
	In an ecological community, plants and animals interact with and adapt to one another as biotic factors that produce stimuli in their shared environment. Another type of stimuli, abiotic factors, must also be adapted to. These include stimuli of non-biological origin, such as sunlight, wind, and temperature. These resources are finite and plants and animals must compete for them. This resources limitation affects what species are present in a community. Organisms can only extract a finite amount of resources from their environment because, any species capable to out compete all others in every environment would need more resources than the planet can offer, and because an organism needs to spend resources to get resources.
	Leaves are the primary photosynthetic plant organ. Increased resource allocation to the leaves, meaning that resources were spent to make leaves larger, would lead to higher growth rates when light and soil nutrients are in high quantity. Stems also help in the accumulation of light because they allow the plant to grow above other plants preventing the shade from other leaves from blocking out the sun. Roots anchor the plant in the soil and allow for nutrient and water absorption. This sort of resource allocation is seen in field peas in situations of root avoidance where roots sense, using chemical markers, that they are growing towards an obstacle so the plants use less resources by not growing roots in that direction [Falik: 2005]. 
	Nitrogen is important in plant growth. It assists in chlorophyll creation, which is the driving force of photosynthesis. Plants need to absorb nitrogen through their roots. In an experiment with Bromus molius, plants in high nitrogen environments could allocate more resources to photosynthetic shoots to uptake more energy through photosynthesis [Larigauderie: 1988]. Our hypothesis was that field peas with extra nitrogen in their soil, will allocate less resources to their roots compared to a controll group of field peas. This is because the field peas in nitrogen rich soil will need less root mass to get nitrogen because it is readily available. This would mean that root-shoot ratios will be less for nitrogen rich field peas because by avoiding the allocation of resources to their roots, the plants can put more resources into stem and leaf growth for photosynthesis.


Materials and Method:
	We grew multiple field peas under two separate conditions for a week, one in a controll setting and the other in nitrogen rich soil. The controll setting received only water once a day, while the experimental setting received a nitrogen solution once a day. We then measured the mass and lengths of the roots and shoots of 12 field peas of each group and calculated their average root-shoot ratios. We then ran a 2-tailed test on the results.


Results:
	It was found that the average root-shoot ratios were higher in the controll group, both for mass and length variables, compared to the experimental group which received the nitrogen solution, shown in Figure 1.The field peas in the nitrogen solution had shorter roots and longer stems compared to the controll group. The variations in mass between the two groups was not significent (t_stat = 0.97, d.f. = 22, 2-tailed P = 0.34). However, the variation in length between the two groups was significent (t_stat = 4.49, d.f. = 22, 2-tailed P = 0.00018).


Discussion:
	This data, shown in Figure 1, confirms the results from Falik’s [2005] field pea study. It shows that field peas, as  Bromus molius [Larigaurderie: 1988] in a high nitrogen environment allocate less resources to root growth than field peas grown in a lower nitrogen environment, shown by the low root-shoot ratio of plants in this environment. This supports our hypothesis. This is because plants in less nitrogen rich soil must grow longer roots to gather up more nitrogen compared to those in environments where nitrogen is readily available. Nitrogen rich plants placed more of a focus on shoot growth.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Average mass ratio and length ratio of experimental and controll field peas. The controll group’s root-shoot ratios are higher than the experimental group that received the nitrogen solution. The standard deviations, represented by whiskers, for the controll group are roughly the same for average mass and length ratios. The standard deviation for the average mass ratio in the nitrogen rich environment was very large while much smaller in the average length ratio.
