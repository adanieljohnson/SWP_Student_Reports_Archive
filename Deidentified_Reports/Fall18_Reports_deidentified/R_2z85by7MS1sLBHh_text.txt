Title: Effects of Calcium on muscle contraction in Rania Pipien frog legs

Abstract:
Just like hormones, muscles and nerves allow an organism to sense and respond to different forms of stimuli. This includes amphibians like the Rania Pipien, which have thousands of individual myofibers that are bound together by their connective tissue. The release of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction allow these muscle filaments to contract, depending upon the strength of their action potentials. In our study observed the different levels of muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle from electrical stimuli. Calcium was added to the treatment group in order to test if their force of muscle contraction compared to the controll group. Considering that calcium plays an important role of muscle contraction, we hypothesized that once we injected the frog leg with calcium, then the force of the muscle contraction will increase. Our experiment consisted of 4 Rania Pipien frog legs, divided into 2 groups. The different forces of muscle contraction in our controll was tested using different voltage amplitudes with electrodes. The same was done with our treatment group, but with the addition of the calcium injection. The results did not support our hypothesis. The treatment of calcium had a negative effect on the force of muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates consist of cylindrical, multi-nuclear cells call myofibers [AD Johnson: 2018]. These myofibers are bound by connective tissue which allow them to be functional in the body of the organism. These skeletal muscles are controllled essentially by motor neurons, which are axons that branch out to innervate groups of individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. In Rania Pipiens, these motor motor neurons are triggered by action potentials, which are triggered by internal or external stimuli. Action potentials are the driving force that allow the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. The release of ACh is the final step that sends signals to the muscles to contract according to the strength of the action potential. Calcium is the element that fuels muscle contraction. It is pulled from the blood in order to go into muscle cells. Having too much or too little calcium has a direct effect on an organism’s action potentials and muscle contraction. According to an article found in Developmental Biology, Nicholas Cross states in one of his calcium experiments that “activation potentials were elicited by Ca2+ injection into either region, but the initial depolarization of the activation potential was strikingly slower when Ca2’ was injected” [Cross: 1981] … This excerpt shows how Cross’s injection of calcium had a direct effect on the speed of the action potentials in Rania pipiens. We hypothesized that once we injected the frog leg with calcium, then the force of the muscle contraction will increase.

Materials and Method:
The study began by placing 4 frog different frog legs onto a lab tray, 2 for the controll group and 2 for the treatment group. Next the frog legs were deskinned so that both the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve were exposed. Then, thin sewing thread was tied around each of the frog legs so that they could be suspended over the lab tray. This made it easier to insert the electrode probe over the sciatic nerve. The group of controll frog muscles were stimulated with a variety of amplitude voltages. Once the data was recorded, the same was done afterwards with the treatment legs, with the addition of 0.1 Ml of 50 millimoles calcium injected into each treatment leg. For each amplitude voltage, the level of contractions were closely observed, while also making sure that the legs were adequately moist with the ringer solution. For the results a two tailed paired t_test was used for the p_value, along with a mean for the average difference between the frog legs without the calcium and the frog legs with calcium. 

Results:
After collecting our average forces of contractions, it was shown that our treatment group had a lower mean than our controll group (Fig. 1). Our dependent variable was the force of the muscle contractions in volts, and our independent variable was the amplitude voltage that we used for each round of stimulation. We calculated a mean of -0.099 for overall difference between the averages in both groups and found a found a p_value of 0.001222. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was a significent difference in our data, but our hypothesis was not supported. In our results it was shown that the injection of calcium into the gastrocnemus muscles had a negative effect of the forces of contraction for our treatment group. As for the frog legs in our controll group, they displayed a very noticeable difference in force during their contractions. According to our p_value our treatment process definitely had a significent effect on our data. This means that our results were not simply due to chance and that they were a direct effect of our treatment. Referring back to Cross, he documents some of his results in saying, “Several min (7+/-1) elapsed between addition of the ionophore and detection of the positive shift; the delay is probably the time required for A23187 to pass through the egg’s extracellular layers” [Cross: 1981]. This excerpt by Cross shows another possibility of a future experiment. By electrically stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle so soon after the calcium injection, it was very much possible that the calcium ions did not have enough time to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A good thought for a future experiment could be to wait a longer period of time in order for the calcium to take full effect inside the membrane of the muscle. Relating to a real-world example, for a person who exercises their muscles at the gym. They may decide to drink a solution with an added boost of calcium to enhance muscle performance. Even though that person may exercise soon after taking the boost of calcium. They may not experience the full effects until hours later when more calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
