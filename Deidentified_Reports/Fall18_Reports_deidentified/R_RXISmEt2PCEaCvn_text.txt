Title: Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contractions in Frog Legs

Abstract:
Lanthanum chloride is a voltage gated calcium channel blocker that had been shown to block voltage gated calcium channels in many test subjects, including species of plants. Given that many experiments had already been performed to test and see if lanthanum chloride truly blocked voltage gated calcium channels, we wanted to see the impact that this blocker would have on frog legs that still had active muscles and were able to contract normally. The experiment required before and after aspects, with the before part of the experiment consisting of providing the frog leg with normal stimulations without an injection of lanthanum chloride to see if the muscles contracted normally, and with the after part consisting of injecting the legs with lanthanum chloride, waiting eight minutes for the injection to take place, and providing the legs with normal stimulation to see if they contracted or not under the influence of lanthanum chloride. Our findings were conclusive with our hypothesis being supported and showing that lanthanum chloride blocked voltage gated calcium channels and prevented normal muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
 In the contraction of muscles, many chemicals and neurotransmitters play a role in making the muscles contract, including calcium. Lanthanum chloride is a chemical that is supposed to block voltage gated calcium channels, which should overall prevent a muscle from contracting. Certain experiments can be completed with lanthanum chloride and probes attached to body parts of a specimen that still contain active muscles and the results are projected on to a myogram on a laptop in order to see if lanthanum chloride will actually play a role in whether or not muscle contractions will occur if injected with lanthanum chloride. Other experiments have been performed on plants, such as the Antirrhinum majus L, where lanthanum chloride was injected into the plant (also known as the snapdragon) and lanthanum chloride blocked the voltage gated calcium channels within the snapdragon, thus inhibiting the snapdragon from going through its phase of normal gravitropism that it normally goes through, which is a process that can be compared to that of human or animal muscle contractions [Friedman: 1998]. We wanted to test the effects of lanthanum chloride on voltage gated calcium channels to see if it would actually block the voltage gated calcium channels and prevent muscle contractions in something other than plants, thus leading us to choose frog legs as our specimen of choice. The reason that we chose to conduct this experiment is because lanthanum chloride is a chemical that could be useful in various aspects of life if our hypothesis is supported and lanthanum chloride indeed does block voltage gated calcium channels. For instance, lanthanum chloride could be useful in surgeries when blocking muscle contractions or if there is a somebody with muscle spasms or seizures, this chemical could help block the voltage gated calcium channels and allow for the doctors or person in mention to assist with the situation. We expected a result similar to that of the plant experiment performed, ultimately expecting the frog leg to contract normally when provided with a stimulus and not injected with the lanthanum chloride and expecting it to not contract normally when provided with a stimulus after being injected with the lanthanum chloride. 
Hypothesis: If given lanthanum chloride, it will block the voltage gated calcium channels and prevent the frog leg from contracting. 


Materials and Method:
We had 3 frog legs; we performed a “before” experiment with the frog legs where we used a normal stimulation and the frog leg is was injected with 1 mM Lanthanum chloride. The normal stimulation was meant to show that the legs responded to stimulation and were not damaged and we inserted numbers into a computer system to where the stimulus went up in voltage strength. After injecting the frog legs with lanthanum chloride, we inserted the same numbers into our computer system in order to compare the before situation with the normal stimulation and then after situation with the injection to see if there was indeed a difference. We first had to prepare the frog legs by degloving the legs, exposing the sciatic nerves, and detaching the gastrocnemus and tying a string to them in order to suspend the gastrocnemus from the force transductor while also attaching the appropriate probes that allowed us to record our myogram. We took the myogram given from this and compared it to injecting the frog leg with 0.2 Ml of 1 mM Lanthanum chloride and then recorded the data on the computer. We then compared the two myograms while also taking observations on the visible movement when the legs contract. We also repeated the experiment with the other two frog legs as well, especially since we needed to have more than one specimen in order to be able to see if the lanthanum chloride affect just one leg or all of them. In this experiment, our independent variable is whether or not the frog leg is injected with 0.2 mM of Lanthanum chloride and the dependent variable is whether or not the muscle of the frog leg will contract. We used a paired t test in order to tell whether or not there is a significent difference in this experiment.

Results:
Observations for Frog #1/Its Control Data: little muscle contraction at first and then as we raised the stimulus levels, the muscle increased in contraction, showing normal function over muscle contractions
Observations for Frog #2/Its Control Data: muscle contraction increased with stimulus increase
Observations for Frog #3/Its Control Data: muscle twitches on its own for a little bit, but then had little muscle contraction that increased as the stimulus increased.
Frog #1 Observations/Experimental Data: The contractions started off increasing, but then around 1 V for our stimulus, it remained a consistent contraction, no longer increasing. 
Frog #2 Observations/Experimental Data: At first there was no muscle contraction at all and eventually, the myogram showed that there was a tiny response around 1 V and the response was consistent up to 5 V, though the muscle contraction was not visible to the human eye while looking at the frog leg itself. 
Frog #3 Observations/Experimental Data: this frog leg twitched a little bit and the injection didn’t seem to have much of an effect on it compared to the other legs.
We used a paired t test for our experiment in order to determine whether or not there was a significent difference between the frog legs when injected with 1 mM Lanthanum chloride or not in regards to whether or not the calcium channels were blocked and prevented a muscle contraction. Our p value was 0.002, indicating that there was a significent difference and the 1 mM Lanthanum chloride did indeed block the calcium channels and prevented muscle contractions. For the before part of the experiment where the legs were not injected with 1 mM Lanthanum chloride, the muscles contracting normally, increasing as the stimulus increased, whereas for the after part of our experiment where the frog legs were injected with 1 mM Lanthanum chloride, the muscle contractions decreased and were not visible to the human eye, despite the stimulus increase in our experiment. In the controll group, we observed normal contractions as we expected, while with the experimental group, we observed varying results, with frog leg 1 contracting more than expected with the Lanthanum chloride, frog leg 2 failing to contract as expected, and frog leg 3 not contracting much.

Discussion:
We had originally believed that injecting .2 Ml of 1 mM Lanthanum chloride would block voltage gated calcium channels and prevent muscles from contracting, and after our experiment was completed, we came to the conclusion that our hypothesis was supported, given that the muscles did quit contracting after the injections, and our paired t test was significent and supported our data and findings. The frog legs were shown to contract normally without the injection of lanthanum chloride and then were shown to contract significently less or not at all when injected with the lanthanum chloride, most likely due to the effect of the lanthanum chloride blocking the voltage gated calcium channels. In other similar experiments performed on the plant Antirrhinum majus L, similar results had occured, with the snapdragon being unable to properly bend after the injection of lanthanum chloride influencing and blocking its voltage gated calcium channels [Friedman: 1998]. This similar experiment is what had inspired us to look into the impact of lanthanum chloride on subjects other than plants, given that the finding of lanthanum chloride being able to block muscle contractions could have an influence in many aspects of life. However, there may have been a few flaws in our experiment, given that for the first frog leg, the muscle did contract a little bit, which may indicate that we had not waited a proper amount of time before providing the frog leg with stimulations after the injection. We had needed to wait 8 minutes before the simulations so that the injection had time to take effect, and we were slightly early. However, with the other legs, our hypothesis was supported. Other errors that may have occurred in our experiment would be not setting up the probes properly, giving the improper amount of 1 mM Lanthanum chloride, or not properly typing in information to the myogram. In conclusion, our group believes that 1 mM Lanthanum chloride does block voltage gated calcium channels and prevents muscle contractions. Some future studies that may be performed to further test this hypothesis would be to restructure the experiment slightly and change the dosages for the injections to see if the amount given to the frog legs would have the same results as this experiment did. These findings could be beneficial due to the fact that if 1 mM Lanthanum chloride does block voltage gated calcium channels and prevents muscle contractions, this could be helpful in other fields of life, such as in the medical field where they may need to prevent muscle contractions in certain surgeries.
