Title: Effects of Tetraethylammonium Chloride on Muscle Contraction of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Potassium is an essential ion in overall muscle contraction of an organism's skeletal muscles. It allows for an action potential to be carried along the axon of a motor neuron, and relay a message to contract to surrounding muscle fibers. Tetraethylammonium chloride is a chemical known to inhibit the proper functioning of potassium in muscle contraction. If potassium is blocked when an action potential is being carried along an axon, the muscle will not contract properly and the overall threshold value of the amount of stimulus required to activate that muscle will increase. In our experiment, we injected three frog legs from the species Rana pipiens with 0.1mL of tetraethylammonium chloride and connected the to an electrical impulse apparatus to shock them at different volts in order to determine the threshold values of each leg before and after injection. In the end, through a one-tailed p-value, we found that our results were not significant and we failed to reject the null hypothesis. This accurately represents our data, as there was a very small difference in average threshold values between control and experimental groups. Differences were only about .01 volts which is barely anything. Yet, the average threshold value of the control group was larger than the threshold value

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles of both vertebrates and invertebrates are composed of fused cell aggregates called myofibers. These myofibers are bound by connective tissues to create the actual skeletal muscle. These muscles are then filled with motor neurons, with cell bodies located in gray matter of the spinal cord. Axons of the motor neurons extend from the spinal cord to surrounding muscle tissue, where they branch out and control when and how each muscle operates and contracts. 
Potassium is one of many key minerals that is essential to muscle contraction. Without potassium, one would not be able to perform even the most medial of tasks he/she often wouldn’t give a second thought, such as picking up his/her cell phone. As an electrical impulse travels along the axon of a motor neuron, positively charged sodium ions flood into the inside of the cell. In order to counteract the input of sodium and maintain a proper action potential, sodium-potassium pumps actively pump out two potassium ions for each three sodium ions pushed into the cell. This process is what allows an action potential to release an axon terminal and relay the message to begin contraction to the surrounding skeletal muscles. 
For this particular experiment, we isolated the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of three Rana pipiens legs, in order to determine the effects of tetraethylammonium chloride (a chemical that inhibits the function of potassium) on each muscles threshold value (lowest pulse amplitude value in which contraction was still visible). 
As tetraethylammonium chloride inhibits the proper function of potassium ions, it would then, in theory, inhibit a muscle's ability to send an action potential down the axon of a motor neuron, interfering with the overall contraction of the muscle. 
As discovered in a previous study investigating the effects of tetraethylammonium chloride on muscle contraction, the chemical inhibited the output of potassium and caused overall thresholds to increase [Imaizumi: 1981]. Thus we can conclude that 0.1mL of tetraethylammonium chloride the potassium in three different Rana pipiens legs will be blocked, increasing the threshold for muscle contraction. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to being our experiment, three frog legs of the Rana pipiens species were acquired and placed in a dissecting pan so the outer layer of skin could be removed. After the skin was removed, each leg was moistened with frog Ringer’s solution. Then, with a dissecting probe, the muscles of the inner thigh were separated allowing us to find the sciatic nerve and acquainted blood vessels. From there, we separated the sciatic nerve from its connective tissues using a dissecting needle. The leg was then connected to an electrical impulse apparatus with the sciatic nerve placed over the electrical probes. Starting with a pulse amplitude of 0.4V, and then decreasing by 0.1V for each subsequent shock, each of the three Rana pipiens legs were shocked in order to determine the control threshold value. After the control threshold value was found for each leg, we injected the first leg with 0.1mL of tetraethylammonium chloride. Five minutes after injection, the leg was reconnected to the electrical impulse apparatus and shocked at the control threshold pulse amplitude. From there, the pulse amplitude was decreased by 0.1V in order to determine the experimental threshold value. This process was then repeated for the other two legs, and data was recorded. When comparing the control and experimental threshold values for each of the three legs, we found the degrees of freedom, t-value, and one tailed p-value to determine if our results were significant or not. 


Results:
Observations: 
	Through the conduction of our experiment, we were able to conclude that on average, the control threshold pulse amplitude was higher than the experimental threshold pulse amplitude for each Rana pipiens leg, as seen in the figure below.  For results of our statistical test, there were 2 degrees of freedom, the t-value was 2.5, and the one-tailed p-value was 0.13, or greater than .01.


Discussion:
Since the one tailed p-value calculated was greater .01, we can failed to reject the null hypothesis and state that our results were not significant. This somewhat represents our data accurately, as there was a very small difference between average control threshold value and the experimental threshold value. However, this was not what we hypothesised, as we expected threshold values to increase after the injection of tetraethylammonium chloride. The potassium should have blocked the entry of potassium into the axon of the motor neuron, inhibiting a proper action potential to be carried down the axon and into the myofibers of the cell. This in turn should have increased the threshold of the Rana pipiens muscles, as a higher electric impulse should have been required to actually stimulate a contraction in the muscle. These results can be attributed to faults in our Rana pipiens muscles. Two of three of our muscles were inexplicably twitching even when not electrical shock had been administered. They essentially decided to contract on their own, which altered our the actual value of our thresholds. These random twitches made it so that the difference in thresholds from the control group to the experimental were very small, and they decreased instead of increased as we had anticipated. 
Our results are still relatively even when compared to outside sources and previously conducted experiments. As found by Imaizumi and Watanabe in their 1981 experiment, muscles manipulated by tetraethylammonium chloride experienced an increase in the overall threshold value that resulted in contraction. They stated the increase was largely due to the occurrence of spike potentials or higher electrical values. [Imaizumi: 1981]. Due to these findings, we should have seen an overall increase on threshold values. The twitching in our muscles is most likely the reason as to why we saw a decrease.
