Title: Azaguard has a negative effect on the pupation of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The presence of hormones is vital for the development of insects from larva into adults. Both ecdysone and juvenile hormone controll the timing and extent of pupation prior to metamorphosis into adulthood. In this experiment we specifically observed what happens when ecdysone is inhibited as juvenile hormone levels fall during the fifth instar phase of Manduca sexta. We expected to see a negative effect on the development of the Manduca sexta into adults. We fed four caterpillars a diet treated with azaguard, an ecdysone inhibitor, and four caterpillars with controll food and then observed for two weeks. Our data showed a statistically significent difference between the controll group and the group treated with an ecdysone inhibitor. This difference suggests that Manduca sexta must have ecdysone in order to properly pupate and survive.

Introduction:
This experiment examines the role of ecdysone on the pupation of Manduca sexta. Particularly, it tests the effect of ecdysone inhibition by azaguard, an ecdysone (20E) inhibitor. Similar to other animal and insects, the development of the Manduca sexta from a larva into an adult in largely controllled by hormones. Particularly, the hormones ecdysone and juvenile hormone play large roles in regulating the timing and maintenance of metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]. Up until the 4th larval instar, juvenile hormone (JH) levels are elevated and 20E levels are low. However, during the 5th larval instar, if Manduca sexta reach a minimum weight, the corpus allatum secretes prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which in turn signals the release of more ecdysone resulting  in a commitment pulse, thereby triggering pupation [Nijhout: 1974]. The role of ecdysone, therefore, is to signal the metamorphosis into an adult, which is necessary for survival. In order to trigger this response, 20E levels must rise above a certain concentration and be present for a minimum amount of time [Nijhout: 1976]. The necessity of 20E for metamorphosis then brought about questions regarding what would happen if ecdysone was inhibited or JH levels never fell. This experiment gives Manduca sexta caterpillars Azaguard, a 20E inhibitor, and observes their physiological reactions. We predicted that decreased levels of ecdysone introduced during the fifth instar of the Manduca sexta will alter the ability of the caterpillars to have a successful commitment pulse and subsequent pupation. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars around 11-12 days old were divided into two groups of four. Each was placed into a separate container with two holes punctured into the walls to allow for respiration. One group of four was designated the controll and the other was the recipient of the azaguard treatment. Within each group the caterpillars were labeled from one to four to distinguish each one from the others. Within the controll group, each caterpillar was fed 10g of caterpillar food with three drops of water added with a transfer pipet. Within the treatment group, each caterpillar was fed 10g of caterpillar food with three drops of azaguard added with a transfer pipet. For both groups, the food was then mixed into a ball and placed in the corner of each caterpillar’s container. The caterpillars were then placed in an incubator at 28 degrees Celsius for two weeks. Their length (mm) and weight (g) were measured every day and food was replaced as needed. A two-sample t_test was used to evaluate the average difference between the weights and the lengths of the controll and azaguard treatment groups.

Results:
The mean weight for the controll group was 6.6225 ± 1.746 g (d.f. = 22, P = 4.30E-6), which is significently greater than the mean weight for the experimental group (t_stat = 3.919 ± 1.746 g, d.f. = 22, P = 4.30E-6). Similarly, the mean length for the controll group was 61.354 ± 7.9049 mm (d.f. = 22, P = 0.009479) while the mean length for the experimental group was 53.333 ± 7.9049 mm (d.f. = 22, P = 0.009479). As the experiment progressed, the controll group grew and eventually metamorphosed into their cocoons. Once metamorphosed, their length and weight decreased (Fig. 1 and 2). On the other hand, the treatment group gained weight for a few days and then slowly began losing it. Several became limp, lost coloration, and moved little in comparison with the controll group. Only one metamorphosed, though it did not appear to be entirely successful. Eventually, all four died.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the inhibition of ecdysone during the fifth instar would negatively impact the development of the Manduca sexta, was supported. Both P-values calculated by the t_test (P = 4.30E-6, P = 0.009479) are low enough to signify a statistically significent difference in both length and weight between the controll and treatment groups. This suggests that the presence of ecdysone is mandatory for the successful pupation of Manduca sexta since the caterpillars fed the inhibitor had a significent difference in development when contrasted to the controll group. Therefore, repression of ecdysone restricts the ability of the caterpillars to molt. Past experiments have discovered that the small spike in ecdysone levels, the commitment pulse, in the fifth larval instar is what changes cellular commitment to pupal maturation, which is necessary for the development into the adult phase [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Without the presence of 20E, the commitment pulse cannot occur, thereby restricting the rise in ecdysone levels and the subsequent molt. Therefore, the insect fails to develop into adulthood and mortality rates are increased, as seen by the death of all Manduca sexta in our treatment group. Comprehending the importance of ecdysone on the life cycle of Manduca sexta could potentially aid the controll of their population size, especially with regards to crops. Moreover, since ecdysone in vital in the development of many other insects, understanding its role in the body of a Manduca sexta allows us to further understand its effect on general insect populations.  For future experiments, we could increase the number of caterpillars tested to gather a larger sample size. In addition, we could test varying degrees of azaguard in the food of the caterpillars in order to discover the threshold level of ecdysone needed for the Manduca sexta to have a successful development.
