Title: The observation of Agonistic Behavior in Betta Fish when exposed to Different Circumstances

Abstract:
Observation of animal behavior is imperative in that it allows humans to understand the ways in which animals utilize cost and benefit analysis in order to make decisions. For the Betta Splenden or Betta fish, fighting is a characteristic that has been bred into their population very aggressively. Thus, in order to better understand the conditions in which they deem in necessary to fight we created an experiment that hosts different trials and conditions for the fish to react to. Although it seems that betta fish would be particularly aggressive on both fronts, our hypothesis was that the male fish would exhibit higher levels of aggressive behavior over a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food. Then an ANOVA test will be utilized to analyze the statistical differences of the different trials of each of the fish. 


Introduction:
Ethology is the practice of utilizing observational skills in order to learn and assess different animal behaviors and the ways in which they were shaped by evolution and natural selection. The use of ethology is an important way for research and experiments to be seen objectively rather than the way in which humans believe the information should be interpreted. This becomes especially vital when observing agonistic behavior within a species because there can be presumptions about emotions that humans are not at the liberty to decide. When observing Betta Splendens, or Betta fish, agonistic behaviors are most present when the organisms is threatened.The operant approach to agonistic behavior in Bettas has conceptualized these fish as "fighting fish" which "are both lured and driven to fight" [Hogan & Roper :1978].  Throughout years of evolution and natural selection, Betta fish have been rewarded for their aggressive behavior, thus escalating the extent to which they portray these behaviors. For males specifically, this behavior is rewarded by being able to mate with females over other males as well as winning in combat over food in order to survive. Therefore these agonistic behaviors are necessary for Betta fish to survive and reproduce. Heightened risks of injury from predators and conspecifics seem to be tolerated primarily when important resources and reproductive advantage are conferred by, say, fighting; [Dawkins:1976]. In order to adequately measure these behaviors, they needed to be observed via the qualification of aggressive behavior patterns shown by fish placed in these specific situations. These qualifications include identifying each other, portraying aggressive behavior and contact.  Although it seems that betta fish would be particularly aggressive on both fronts, our hypothesis was that the male fish would exhibit higher levels of aggressive behavior over a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food. 



Materials and Methods:
For this experiment three sets of two male betta fish will be used in order to better understand agonistic behaviors. First the two males will be put into a tank together in order to observe their baseline aggression towards each other which will be followed by a five minute rest period. The fish will be broken up if/when they make contact with each other, but within the timespan the times will be recorded of when they identify each other as well as show aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior implies red maning (the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane) as well as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. These behaviors will be observed within a 5 minute time span or until the fish make contact for every condition they are placed in. The next condition requires food to be added to the tank in which the two male fish are. The same qualifications will be observed and then they will be given a five minute rest. Lastly, the same male betta fish will be placed in the presence of a female while keeping all other consistent with the initial treatment. After the first trial of fish is over, the same conditions will be imposed upon two more sets of male betta fish with new females as well. After this, an ANOVA will be utilized in order to compare the means of the independent groups. In the event the data does have a significant difference, a Tukey- Kramer method will be utilized in order to further assess the statistical difference. 


Results:
KEY:
1-Male fish alone
2-male fish with food
3-male fish with female
\*As seen in Figure one, all ANOVA tests were deemed statistically insignificant and thus do not require further testing such as the Tukey- Kramer method. 


Discussion:
 Within this experiment the initial hypothesis that the males would exhibit more aggressive behaviors within a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food was not supported by the data collected. What was noticed from the data was that when the food was present the males were much more aggressive than when there was a female present. This could have been for several reasons but it seemed there were many limitations that could have hindered a direct correlation between these conditions. One possible limitation was that there were still left over food particles within the tank when the two males one female condition was being observed. This excess food created a distraction within the tank allowing the fish to evaluate their costs and benefits of the situation and choose food over the female. In order to further the study, each condition will have a different tank so that the food is not cross contaminating the other trials. Additionally, another limitation of the study was that because each trial was held in a large sample tank, the male’s had the option to ignore each other and not engage in combat because they did not feel a present threat. This hindered the potential for the fish to exhibit agonistic behaviors because they were able to way the costs and benefits of engaging in a fight. Lastly, the sample size was so small that there trials could in no way be accurately representative of the whole population. The fish used had also been used in several labs and thus may have undergone habituation in that they were much more comfortable and less alert in their surroundings than a wild fish would have been. Using the ANOVA test to look at all of the data within the between the three trials displayed no significant difference statistically so no further testing was required in order to more precisely understand the agonistic behavior of the fish. Within this experiment going forward it is imperative to take into account the fact the fish are constantly undergoing a cost and benefits analysis as to whether they should risk engaging in a fight or remain docile in each others presence.
