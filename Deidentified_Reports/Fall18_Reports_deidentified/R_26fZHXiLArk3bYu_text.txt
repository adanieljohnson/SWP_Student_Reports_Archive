Title: No significant difference between the photosynthetic activity of C3 plant Spinacia olerecea and C4 plant chrysanthemum

Abstract:
In this experiment, our hypothesis was that the C4 plant chrysanthemum would have a greater photosynthetic activity than that of the C3 plant Spinacia olerecea. We extracted chloroplasts from the spinach and the chrysanthemum leaves in order to measure the their absorbance when the samples are put in light and dark environments. The p-value between light and dark sample was 0.578 and the p-value between the two plants was 0.613. We determined that the results were insignificant and the hypothesis was not supported.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process of transforming light energy from the sun into chemical energy that is stored in the form of glucose. Light is captured and used as an energy source to convert water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, with oxygen as a waste product. There are three types of plants based on their photosynthetic pathways: C3, C4, and CAM plants. C3 plants, the most common photosynthetic type, were named because the first product of their photosynthetic pathway is a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglycerate [Ehlringer 2002]. Rubisco, the enzyme that catalyses this carbon fixation reaction, leads to the creation of phosphoglycerate with CO2 as a substrate and another reaction with O2 as a substrate. When O2 is the substrate, there is less net carbon fixation, and in or make up for this loss, photorespiration is enacted, leading to the production of CO2. Photorespiration is the opposite process of photosynthesis, where O2 is fixed and CO2 is released in the process of producing more 3 carbon molecules. The effectiveness of C4 plants is due to the suppression of photorespiration through the development of another step in their photosynthetic processes [Peterhansel 2010]. C4 plants actively elevate the CO2 concentration of the site for carbon fixation with the use of a biochemical CO2 pump. Carbon fixation occurs in two steps in which the the first is to form the four-carbon dicarboxylic acid oxaloacetate [Furbank 1995]. A study done in 2012 compared the metabolic networks of Arabidopsis, a C3 plant, and maize, a C4 plant. The study suggested that the photosynthetic process of maize is more complex exhibits a faster and more efficient use of light and CO2 than that of Arabidopsis. It was found that the photosynthetic mechanism of maize is more capable of managing gene mutation and environmental changes [Wang 2012]. 
In this experiment, our goal was to determine the difference in photosynthetic activity in C3 and C4 plants. Our C3 plant was Spinacia oleracea and our C4 plant was a chrysanthemum. Spinacia oleracea is a common annual cultivated plant and is known for its sources of vitamin A, D, E, K, and fiber. Chrysanthemum is a perennial flowering plant native to subtropical and temperate climates. Due to the more efficient and complex photosynthetic process of C4 plants, our hypothesis was that there would be more photosynthetic activity in C4 plants than C3 plants over time. In order to test this hypothesis, we will measure the absorption of chloroplasts in the C3 and C4 samples.


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we crushed the de-veined spinach and chrysanthemum, mixing them respectively with grinding buffer. We extracted the chloroplasts through two rounds of spinning in a RT-7 centrifuge, one at 200 times the force of gravity, and the second at 1,000 times the force of gravity. The resulting two pellets of chloroplasts were diluted with grinding buffer. We then added water, DCIP, 100mM of phosphate at pH of 6.5, and chloroplasts according to the reagent table above, adding the chloroplasts last. After the addition of chloroplasts, we placed the tubes into their respective light and dark environments. After 30 minutes, we measured the absorbance of each sample to determine photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts.

62.5 mL of water	
12 mL of 130  mM DCIP		
14.4 mL of 130 mM DCIP	
16 mL of Reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5)		
19.2 mL of Reaction buffer (100 mM Phosphate, pH 6.5)	
6 - 50 mL centrifuge tubes			
mortar and pestle			
a medium-sized beaker			
40 mL of cold grinding buffer		
48 mL of cold grinding buffer	
4 medium-sized spinach leaves			
Chrysanthemum leaves	


Results:
In our experiment, there was not a significant difference in the average percent change of absorption between the C3 and C4 plants. In addition, the absorption percent changes were not consistent between trials. In some trials the absorption would increase, and in others of the same sample, the absorption would decrease. The p-value between the light and dark samples was 0.587 and the p-value between the C3 and C4 samples was 0.613. Because both p-values are higher than 0.5, both values are insignificant.


Discussion:
In this experiment, our goal was to support our hypothesis, which stated that the chrysanthemum would have a higher photosynthetic activity. We measured the photosynthetic activity of each sample by determining the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence of DCIP. The lighter the sample, the more photosynthetic activity in the extracted chloroplasts. This hypothesis was not supported because our p-values were insignificant. The insignificance of the light and dark chloroplasts absorbances may be due to the lack of immediate placement into light and dark environments. It took more time than originally planned to transfer the samples into the absorbance cuvettes, so the chloroplasts most likely had a significant amount of time to enact photosynthesis while we transferred the samples.  
	Our results in this experiment negate our hypothesis and contrast the results of many other studies comparing photosynthesis in C3 and C4 plants. In a study comparing the characteristics of the C3 L. esculentum and C4 F. trinervia, the presence of excess oxygen affected the photosynthetic activity of L. esculentum, but did not affect that of F. trinervia. It was concluded that this is the result of a more complex photosynthetic pathway that provides the ability to adapt to less than optimal environments so that the process is not negatively affected [Ku 1983]. A possible experiment for the future would be a follow up to this experiment between L. esculentum and F. trinervia. Because the difference between C3 and C4 plants lies in the absence of photorespiration due to adaptation in the presence of oxygen, a future experiment could involve testing the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence and absence of oxygen. In this experiment, a chrysanthemum would be hypothesized to have greater photosynthetic activity due to its ability to adapt to changing environments.
