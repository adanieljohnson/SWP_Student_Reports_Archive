Title: Physarum polycephalum Growth is Directly Inhibited by Caffeine

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum, despite lacking a nervous system, is capable of movement via a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway. This experiment was designed to test how cAMP, which regulates growth and movement in the organism through extension of actin microfilaments that move the organism towards or away from a stimulus, would be affected by caffeine. Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase, the molecule that breaks down cAMP. The experiment was performed using three groups of varying caffeine concentration environments to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between Physarum growth in the presence of caffeine vs. not in caffeine. The results were not yielded properly, but according to what is known in the field, caffeine should’ve promoted growth since the cAMP that regulates movement was not broken down by the phosphodiesterase. The results are important in understanding ways of controllling mold growth in a commercial setting, but also how caffeine affects the same cAMP pathway more complex systems, which can include overregulation of cell processes to produce cancer and DNA mutations. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that spends a majority of its lifetime in the plasmodium stage [Johnson: 2018]. In response to particular stimuli, the physarum extends its leading edge towards or away from the aforementioned stimuli via the actin microfilaments that form ‘legs.’ This slime mold is a model organism because, despite lacking a nervous system, responds very sensitively to its environment via cyclic-AMP (cAMP)-mediated and IP3 signaling pathways [Johnson: 2018]. In the cAMP-mediated pathway, adenylyl cyclase is activated on the G-protein and converts ATP to cAMP, which can be converted to AMP by a phosphodiesterase or can be used to target transcription factors or metabolic enzymes. Growth and movement is controllled by the activation of cAMP; when cAMP is broken down by a phosphodiesterase enzyme, growth and movement slow down or stop completely. However, it is also known that caffeine will inhibit a phosphodiesterase, which increases cAMP concentration in an organism, which would also increase the concentration of Protein Kinase A (PKA) [van Staveren: 2001]. Protein Kinase A phosphorylates many other enzymes which can inhibit or activate other cellular processes, including growth or movement. In this lab, nine samples of physarum were plated in 3 agar-based dishes, each with varying concentrations of caffeine in them to determine if there is a statistically significent difference between caffeine concentration availability to a culture and culture growth, with the hypothesis being that as the caffeine concentration in an organism increases, the growth of the culture will also increase.



Materials and Method:
A stock plate of Physarum polycephalum was prepared, along with 9 potato-dextrose agar (PDA) plates. PDA was chosen as an appropriate agar because the nutrients would be spread evenly across the plate. 3 PDA plates were prepared without any caffeine; the other six plates were divided into two groups and soaked with ~4 Ml of caffeine, with one group receiving a 1x concentration of caffeine and the other receiving a 2x concentration of caffeine.  A 1 cm x 1 cm cube was cut from the center of each PDA plate and replaced with another 1 cm x 1 cm of the stock physarum and then were kept in the dark, without any other stimuli. The 9 plates were then observed 24 hours later, and the total area of physarum on each plate was calculated using ImageJ analysis software (units of pixels, which can be compared without being normalized since the petri dishes were the same size), and then compared in triplicate with a one-way ANOVA test (a= 0.05) to determine whether or not the differences between each concentration of caffeine would be statistically significent.

Results:
Due to what was believed to be an incorrect preparation of the PDA medium, there was no recorded growth in either of the experimental plates. Thus, the results shown below are what the results may have looked like if all parts of the experiment had worked properly.

Overall, the results of the experiment were statistically significent (d.f.=8, p= 0.00107, a= 0.05). In general, the increase in concentration of caffeine in the agar medium led to an increase in physarum growth on the plates. Figure 1 highlights the important results from the experiment, including that the standard deviations for each of the environments remained extremely small and well outside of the ranges of any other environment, supporting the small p_value from the results. 

Discussion:
Given that there were no true results, there cannot be a calculation or discussion of what the experiment has proven. However, there is no reason to accept the experimental results of this experiment as being true. Caffeine is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. Phosphodiesterase works to break down cAMP, which controlls movement in growth [Johnson: 2018]. In the specific case of the Physarum polycephalum, cAMP controlls extension and retraction of actin filaments that actively work to extend the leading edges of the slime mold towards a positive stimulus [Trevithick: 1977]. Given that the PDA plate evenly distributed nutrients across the petri dish evening, it is fair to assume that the extension of the leading edges would be in random directions from the center cube in which the stock was cultured towards the rest of the dish. It is possible that the PDA plate was not given sufficient time to absorb the caffeine concentrations which would’ve been needed. The experimental results are actually congruent to other studies performed previously in which the agar medium was soaked in phosphodiesterase, leading to consistently less culture growth in plates as the concentrations of phosphodiesterase increased [Murray: 1971]. Regardless, the facts that remain unchanged by the experiment are still important in understanding signaling pathways in living systems. Physarum polycephalum are unique in that they do not have a nervous system but are still impacted heavily based on their signaling pathways; in direct contrast, caffeine seems to work on these same signaling pathways in the nervous systems of those that contain it. Caffeine still influences cAMP in living systems such as humans, but cAMP takes on roles more complex than actin microfilament lengthening, including targeting specific sequences in DNA, assisting in synaptic transmission in neural activity, and activating calcium channels involved in muscle movement [Bode: 2006]. If phosphodiesterase is inhibited by caffeine intake, it can also overregulate all of these processes, which can be just as damaging as it would be if cAMP were completely absent. Of all of these, cancer is certainly an inherent risk as it is thought that cAMP can phosphorylate specific proteins or sequences during DNA transcription that are not necessary and cause mutations that can form cancers [Bode: 2006]. This is important in monitoring—and perhaps changing—how society views caffeine and how health information should be conveyed to patients about its prolonged effects in the body. However, in the case of Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold, the facts of its signaling pathway would suggest that caffeine or other caffeinated molecules should not be used in mold treatment of this particular mold, and can be used to research more effective chemicals in mold elimination treatment. Overall, although the original results of the experiment could not be used to draw a conclusion, they still assisted in better understanding how caffeine directly inhibits a cAMP-mediated signaling pathway that is important to most living things.
