Title: The effect of pH on electron transport in chloroplasts

Abstract:
The effects of various pH buffers on electron transport activity in spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea) were tested to investigate if there was a correlation between various pH buffers and electron transport activity during photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses high energy electrons to create an electrochemical gradient which drives the production of ATP.   We measured the rate at which DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) became reduced in different pH buffers (pH 5, 7, and 10) during photosynthesis since DCIP accepts these high energy electrons and turns from blue to colorless.  A higher rate of electron transport would be indicated by a decrease of absorbance.  To measure the rate at which DCIP becomes reduced, chloroplasts from spinach leaves were enriched in different pH buffers.  These chloroplasts had DCIP added to them and their absorbances were measured by a spectrophotometer for a duration of 30 minutes.  At the end of the study it was found that there was a significent difference between the pH 5 and pH 7 groups (p &lt; 0.05) while there was not a significent difference between the pH 10 and pH 7 group (p &gt; 0.05).  Further testing is needed to conclude if there is a correlation between pH and the rate of electron transport during photosynthesis.

Introduction:
The ability to acquire energy is universal throughout all living organisms.  For heterotrophs, they accomplish this by acquiring energy from other organisms.  Autotrophs on the other hand produces their own energy from the raw materials that surround them and for plants, this process is called photosynthesis.  Photosynthetic plants use light energy from the sun and the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to produce glucose (C6H12O6) [Foyer: 2018].  The first part of photosynthesis, the light dependent reactions, relies on various oxidation and reduction reactions (commonly called redox reactions).  Chloroplasts absorb photons in chlorophyll molecules and this reduces NADP+ (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) an electron carrier into NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) [Johnson: 2016].  The NADPH molecules then donate these high energy electrons to the electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast.  These high energy electrons are then passed through various photosystems, which creates an electrochemical gradient.  This gradient then drives ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) production through the use of the ATP synthase [Johnson: 2016].  The products of the light dependent reactions are then used in the light independent reactions to synthesize glucose.
	The rate of the transfer of electrons throughout the electron transport chain is variable due to external and varying environmental conditions.  For example, the acidification of the thylakoid lumen leads to a slower rate of oxidation of certain cytochrome complexes within the chloroplasts’ electron transport chain [Kramer: 1999].  To determine the rate of electron transport DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) can be used.  DCIP captures electrons from the electron transport chain and becomes reduced.  When it accepts electrons, DCIP changes color from blue to colorless [Johnson: 2016].  By measuring the change of color, or absorbance at 600nm, it is possible to determine the rate of electron transport within chloroplasts during the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis.  Within this experiment, chloroplast from the leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was extracted and then subjected to different pH levels to determine the effect of pH on the rate of electron transport and we hypothesize a greater rate of electron transport activity within the pH 7 groups.


Materials and Method:
Before isolating the chloroplasts, the mortal and pestle, medium sized beaker and centrifuge tubes were placed into ice to cool.  To isolate the chloroplasts, large central veins of 4 medium sized spinach leaves were removed and the remaining leaf pieces were rinsed with tap water.  The spinach leaves were then added to the cooled mortar and pestle.  10Ml of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the mortar and pestle.  The spinach was grinded until it was a thick paste.  An additional 10Ml of grinding buffer was added and then mixed with the original paste.  This was then strained through a three-layer cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.  
	200µL of the filtered liquid in the chilled beaker was transferred into a microtubule labeled “Sample A” and it was stored on ice.  The remaining liquid was then placed into a 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A” and centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1200rpm at 4°C.  The supernatant was then poured out of the tube labeled “A” into another chilled 50Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B”.  200µL of the liquid from “B” was transferred into a microtube labeled “Sample B”.  The centrifuge labeled “B” was then centrifuged at 2800rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.
	The liquid from the centrifuged “B” was aliquoted into 3, 5Ml volumes into 3 chilled conical tubes.  One conical tube received 5Ml of pH 5 buffer.  The second conical tube received 5Ml of a pH 7 buffer and the last conical tube received 5Ml of a pH 10 buffer.  All three of these chilled conical were then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C.  The pellets were resuspended in 3Ml grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). 
	After isolating the chloroplasts, the assay to detect absorbance was started.  First, the blank test tube was made.  This included 8Ml of water, no DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5).  Then the experimental test tubes with the various pH buffers were made.  6Ml of water and 2Ml of 120mM DCIP was added to the 3 pH 5 buffer test tubes.  This process was repeated for the pH 7 and pH 10 buffers.  The assay was started by adding 100µL of isolated chloroplasts into every test tube except the blank test tube.  All the test tubes were mixed after adding the chloroplast and transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes.  The spectrophotometer was then blanked at 600nm by using the blank test tube.  All of the cuvettes were then placed into the spectrophotometer to measure their absorbances for a time 0 reading.  The cuvettes were then placed underneath a lamp for 10 minutes.  After the 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbances for all the cuvettes were recorded again.  This process was then repeated after another 10 minutes.  The total amount of time that passed was 30 minutes.
	The percent change of the absorbance was then calculated by using this formula: % change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%.  The percent change in absorbance was then plotted on an XY scatter plot against time.  A two tailed two sample t_test was used to obtain p_values.
	


Results:
All of the test groups including the controll group had a negative percent change.  The pH 5 test group had the greatest percent change, while the pH 10 group had the least amount of change.  The average percent change of absorbance at 30 minutes was -4.2 ± 1.6 % for pH 5, -1.7 ± 0.67% for pH 7 and -1.5 ± 0.64% for pH 10. There was a significent difference (p = 0.01) for pH 5 and not a significent difference for pH 10 (p = 0.38).   Figure 1 shows this relationship, with the pH 5 group having the greatest decrease in % change of absorbance, while pH5 and pH 7 had a similar trajectory.

Discussion:
This experiment looked at the effects of pH buffers on electron transport activity by using DCIP as an electron acceptor.  When DCIP accepts electrons, it changes from a blue color to colorless.  By using the absorbances of DCIP, it is possible to determine the rate of electron transport activity.  The results of this experiment showed that there was no electron transport activity, since all the pH buffer groups saw an increase in absorbance.  From the results of the paired two sample t_test, it was determined that there was a significent difference between pH 5 and pH 7 (p = 0.01) but not a significent difference between pH 7 and pH 10 (p = 0.38).  Even though there was a significent difference in one experimental group, there is inconsistency within the data.  For example, both of the experimental groups and also the controll saw an increase of absorbance.  More specifically the pH 5 group had the greatest increase of absorbance.  This would indicate that the solution that was placed into the spectrophotometer was becoming darker blue, which is the opposite of what was expected.  DCIP becomes clear once it becomes reduced, which would signal a lower absorbance.  Since all three groups saw an increase of absorbance it can be stated that the DCIP did not become reduced so there was little to no electron transport activity.  Also, according to Figure 1, the pH 5 and pH 7 groups had a very similar trajectory because their absorbances had a very similar increase of absorbance.  The pH 7 group behaved in the opposite of what was expected.  Under a neutral pH, it was believed that there would have been a great decrease of absorbance or a greater rate of electron transport.  
	There is strong evidence that shows that a variable pH has an affect on chloroplast activity.  For example, the pH of the lumen of the chloroplast is set at a homeostatic checkpoint.  It was found that lumen pH is regulated so that it stays within the range of 5.8 to 6.5 [Kramer: 199].  In another experiment, leaves from spinach were also taken, and their chloroplasts were isolated, and the rate of electron transport was determined by using DCIP as well [Gould: 1973].  This experiment came to the conclusion that electron transport and phosphorylation had the same pH optimum at pH 8.0-8.5 [Chain: 1973].  There was also a decrease of electron transport activity at around pH 6 [Chain: 1973].
	These past experiments show that there is an inconsistency with the data that was collected, because there was no significent difference between one pH buffer and a significent difference between another.  In addition to this, our controll group did not produce data that was expected.  Since, the controll group was exposed to a neutral pH, it was expected was that under these normal conditions, there would be electron transport activity.  According to the data that was collected, there was no electron transport activity.  The controll was supposed to reduce DCIP and become clear, but during the study it became darker blue.
	For future studies, I would suggest repeating the stated procedure to see if this method produces reproducible data.  If it does indeed lead to the same conclusions, a lack of electron transport activity, I would suggest a modification of the method.  Perhaps, the addition of the pH buffers should be included after the chloroplasts were isolated and in suspension, unlike in our method where we created the chloroplast solutions with the pH buffers.  I would also suggest using another electron acceptor other than DCIP.  There is a possibility that DCIP is incompatible with the stated method and the various pH buffers.  Overall, there needs to be more work on this study to prove or disapprove the hypothesis that pH affects electron transport activity within the chloroplasts of spinach leaves.  If there is indeed a correlation, that is valuable knowledge.  This would further prove how devastating the effects pollution would have on the Earth.  Many pollutants get into the atmosphere and into the environments of many ecosystems and these pollutants have a potential to change pH levels.  By changing these pH levels, photosynthetic organisms could see a reduction in their photosynthetic capabilities.  This would not only harm the plants but also every living organism since photosynthesis is a necessary process that keeps ecosystems in balance.
