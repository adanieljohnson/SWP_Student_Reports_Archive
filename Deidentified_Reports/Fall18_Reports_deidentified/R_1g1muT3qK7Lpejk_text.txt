Title: The Effect of Temperature on Photosynthesis Rate in Kale

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment was to discover the effect that temperature had on the photosynthetic rate in kale. By placing samples into different temperature conditions (Cold: ice bucket at 0 degrees Celsius; Room Temp at 20 degrees Celsius: test tube rack; Hot: hot water bath at 95 degrees Celsius) we used a spectrometer to compare the samples absorbance at 600nm. Since enzymes are optimal near room temperature and photosynthesis involves enzymatic processes, we believed that at room temperature the photosynthetic rate would occur most rapidly. We found that at room temperature photosynthesis did occur at the most optimal rate in comparison to hot and cold conditions.

Introduction:
This experiment was designed to understand how temperature effects the rate of photosynthesis in kale. Specifically, we tried to discover the differences in photosynthetic rate at a hot temperature, a room temperature, and a chilled temperature. Kale is especially beneficial to use in this experiment because it has a high concentration of chloroplasts. All plants use the energy absorbed from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. Plants are capable of this because of chlorophyll, which captures the suns energy and uses carbon dioxide and water to ultimately create glucose. There are several factors in which are required in order for photosynthesis to successfully occur such as light, chlorophyll, Mn2+ ions, electron transport complexes, and an intact phospholipid bilayer that can produce a proton gradient. Mostly all the energy produced from photosynthesis is used for glucose synthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in three stages in which involve both light dependent and light independent reactions. The first two stages use absorbed photons to form NADPH. They also create a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The light independent reaction is known as the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle undergoes a process in which RUBISCO (enzyme complex) combines ATP and NADPH with CO2 and ribulose phosphate molecules to create glucose. Temperature affects the light independent reaction of photosynthesis since the enzyme RUBISCO is affected by temperature.  In an experiment conducted by G.F. Blanchard, J. M. Guarini, and P. Richard, plants photosynthetic capacities were compared between two different seasons (September and December), testing to see the effect of temperature. They found that photosynthetic rates were “twice as high in September than in December” (G.F. Blanchard, J. M. Guarini, P. Richard: 1996). This study leads us to believe that cold temperature causes for photosynthetic rates to be slower. We hypothesize that photosynthesis will be optimal in kale at room temperature, because that is the temperature in which RUBISCO is optimal.


Materials and Methods:
Attaining a mortar and pestle, four medium sized kale leaves, a medium sized beaker, and three, 50mL centrifuge tubes in a bin of crushed ice from the TA we started by removing the large central veins from the kale leaves. Then grinded the kale with 10mL of grinding buffer with a mortar and pestle and strained the paste into a chilled beaker. Next, we transferred liquid to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200 x G for three minutes at 4ºC (include balance tube in centrifuge). Then we poured supernatant out of tube “A” into a 50mL centrifuge tube marked “B” (do not transfer debris at bottom). After, we centrifuged the 50mL tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G for ten minutes at 4ºC. Then, we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. After, we labeled 13 large test tubes. We added 8 mL of water to tube #0, 6 mL to tubes #1-9, and 5 mL to tubes #10-12. Next, we added 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP to tubes #1-12. After that, we added 2 mL of reaction buffer to all tubes. When we were ready to begin the assay, we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts you prepared to tube #4-12. We mixed the tube immediately after adding chloroplasts and then transfered mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Then, blanked the spectrometer at 600nm using tube 0. After, we measured absorbance’s of all samples at 600nm. After this we placed tubes in their assigned conditions (Cold: ice bucket at 0 degrees Celsius; Room Temp at 20 degrees Celsius: test tube rack; Hot: hot water bath at 95 degrees Celsius). After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer with tube #0. Then, recorded the absorbance’s of each sample at 600nm. We repeated this cycle until the sample experienced 30 minutes total in the desired conditions. Every time after 10 minutes we recorded the absorbance’s (blanking it with tube #0 each time). Finally, we used a 2-sample t-test to compare the percent changes in the hot conditions/cold conditions with the room temperature conditions.


Results:
Our results were found to be statistically significant for both the cold and the hot temperatures. Because the p-value for the cold conditions compared with room temperature is 0.0036, which is less than 0.05, this data is deemed statistically significant. The p-value for the hot compared with the room temperature is 0.0056, which is also less than 0.05, making it significantly significant. Both tests had 4 degrees of freedom. The t-value for the cold conditions comparison was 6.129 and the t-value for the hot conditions comparison was 5.423. General trends also show that the room temperature had the largest percent change in absorbance’s. The data for cold and hot conditions were similar with smaller percent changes between recording absorbance’s. The hot sample slightly had the smallest percent change in absorbance. At 30 minutes, we noticed that instead of decreasing in absorbance from 20 minutes all the absorbance’s instead increased. 

Discussion:
Since our p-values were 0.0036 and 0.0056, which is less than 0.05, our data was statistically significant. This means that our data statistically accepts our hypothesis that room temperature is optimal for photosynthesis in kale. General trends show that there was a larger percent change in absorbance which supports our hypothesis that photosynthetic rate would be optimal at room temperature. This would make sense because enzyme function would also be optimal at room temperature. In an experiment performed by PL Keeling and R. Banisadr’s, they tested to see the effect of temperature on enzymes in the pathway of starch. They found that “temperatures above 25ºC adversely affect flux, and therefore, limit yield” (Keeling, Banisadr: 1994). Equally, they found that low temperature poorly affects enzyme capabilities. Since it was seen that enzymes at hot and cold temperatures were disrupted, then photosynthesis would also be affected. The Calvin cycle would be affected because it uses the enzyme RUBISCO. In another study performed by P. Haldimann, he studied photosynthetic performance of Z. Mays leaves at optimal temperatures. He found that “in spite of having a low photosynthetic capacity, Z. mays leaves grown at sub optimal temperature possess efficient mechanisms of energy dissipation which enable them to cope better with photo inhibition” (Haldimann: 1996). This temperature was 20ºC, the same temperature used for our room temperature sample. Optimal temperature helps enzymes in photosynthesis function properly and efficiently, which in turn expedites photosynthesis. It is possible errors may have occurred when recording the absorbance’s with the spectrophotometer during our last test. Our data during that trial in particular was interesting since the absorbance’s increased rather than decreased. One possible explanation is that we did not properly blank our initial sample. Moving forward, we should double check that we correctly used the spectrometer.
