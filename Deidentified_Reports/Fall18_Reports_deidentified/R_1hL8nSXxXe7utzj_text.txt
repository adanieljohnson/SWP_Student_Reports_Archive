Title: Effects of different spectrums of light on rate of photosynthesis 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we investigated how different spectrums of light affect the rate of light-dependent reaction in the chloroplasts in spinach leaves. It was hypothesized that the rate of light-dependent reaction would decrease along treated by blue, red and green light based on some similar findings. But the data indicated that there was no significant difference between the change of rates in the group treated with red light and the group with blue light, although the blue light groups did show a larger absolute value. This should be explained by the difference between experimental settings and lack of replicas for the investigation. 

Introduction:
Plant growth and developments are strongly influenced by the light received by plants. During the process of photosynthesis, light energy is captured by the pigments in chloroplasts to split water and generate high energy electrons that will be used in the following steps of photosynthesis. According to a study, different pigments absorb certain regions in the light spectrum. In this lab, we are going to investigate how light of different spectrums affect the rate of photosynthesis reaction, especially for the light-dependent reaction. As the study showed, blue lights is absorbed the most, and red light the second[Govindjee: 1974]. What’s more, although green light is known be reflected, there is a study showing that once the green light is absorbed by the leaves, it drives the photosynthesis efficiently[Tershima et al. 2009]. So it is hypothesized that the green light along will also cause photosynthesis happen but in a lower rate than the red and blue light conditions, and blue light will result in the largest photosynthesis rate and red the second. 

Materials and Methods:
Extraction of Enriched Chloroplast Sample

We added 6 medium-sized spinach leaves without their veins into the mortars and pestles; later we added 10mL of chilled grinding buffer into the leaves and grinded it. After there were no large pieces left, we added another 10mL of grinding buffer and filtered the spinach slurry with folded cheesecloth. The filtered spinach liquid was transferred into a 50 mL chilled conical tube labeled “Tube A” and it was centrifuged for 3 minutes of 1200rpm and of 4 oC. When the centrifuge was completed, the supernatant was then poured into the second chilled 50mL conical tube labelled as “Tube B” and centrifuged 10 minutes under 2800 rpm, 4 oC. After completion, the supernatant was poured out and 20mL of grinding buffer was added into the tube with pellet and the pellet was gently suspended using a pipette. 

Doing the Experiment 

In total, 16 tubes were obtained; they were labelled  respectively as blank and tube #1-3 No chloroplasts, #4-6 White Light, #7-9 Red Light, #10-12 Blue Light, and #13-15 Green Light. In each tube, we added, 2mL of reaction buffer, which Is 100mM phosphate at pH 6.5. For the blank tube, we added 8mL of water. For the rest of the tubes, 6mL of water and 2mL of 130mMDCIP, used as the indicator of the reaction, were added. After these, we used pipette to transfer 100uL of enriched chloroplasts we prepared into each of the tube except for tubes #1-3. After the solutions were well mixed, we measured the absorbances of these solutions. And we placed the tubes blank, #1-6 under white light lamp, #7-9 under right light lamp, #10-12 under blue light lamp and #13-15 under green light lamp. Incubated for 15 minutes and measured the absorbances again. The percentage of changes in absorbance was calculated and the data were compared using a two-sampled t-test, with the significant value of 0.05. 


Results:
We can observe the percentage change of absorbance after treated by red light is the biggest, the change under blue light the second, and the change under green light the least. After doing the two-sampled t-test. The groups treated with green, red and blue lights have significant higher changes compared to negative control, meaning that the lights of three spectrums do affect the photosynthesis rates. What's more, the change of absorbance when treated with red light is significant higher than the one treated with green light. 

Discussion:
As our data shows, the groups treated with green, red and blue lights all have significant change in the absorbance values when compared to the negative control group, the group had no chloroplasts. This can be explained by that when the photons are received by the pigments, the pigments enter an exited state immediately, and the exited pigments transfer the energy to a reaction center, which is consisted of a single deployed molecule that transfers the energy into coupled-redox reactions[Govindjee: 1974]. In our circumstance, where DCIP was used to indicate the transfer of the electrons, the more electrons being transferred, the lighter the DCIP became, so the larger changes in the absorbance values. However the data we obtained showed that there was no significant difference between our red light group and blue group. This might be caused by the limited number of replicants the we had in our experimental groups. But more likely, as a study indicates, as the plant tissues that contain chloroplasts and thus light-absorptive pigments are diffusive, the pigment would be relocated when exposed to certain light spectrum. For example, when exposed to blue light, the pigment would relocate to have the highest possible level of absorbances[Hogewoning et al. : 2010]. But in our experiment, there are no relocations, every pigment was presumably given the same amount of light. So there was no significant difference between the blue and red groups.
