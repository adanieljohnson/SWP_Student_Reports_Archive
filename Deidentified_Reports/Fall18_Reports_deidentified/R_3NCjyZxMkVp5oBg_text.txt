Title: The Effect Of Hormones On Manducas

Abstract:
My group hypothesized that tobacco hornworms (manduca sexta), would have a greater increase in size if given hormones. To test this, eight manducas were divided into two groups. One group was the control, with the latter given juvenile hormones in their food. The manducas were weighed daily, while the two groups were simultaneously compared. After two weeks, it appeared that the manducas who received hormones were of greater size than the control group. We concluded that juvenile hormones aid manducas in a greater increase of size.

Introduction:
Hormones affect the growth of insects. For example, one of the earliest studies of IGR demonstrated that linden bugs failed to thatch into adults. However, our experiment involves the effect of juvenile hormones on caterpillars. We speculate that the hormones will increase their weight, in contrast to a control group. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight caterpillars were divided into two groups of four. One group was the control, given no hormones, while the other was. Each day, we measured the weight of each caterpillar, simultaneously comparing the two groups. while they were given the same amount of food individually, the second group had added hormones. 

Results:
For the first three days, both groups maintained a relative constant in size. Towards the middle of the week, both groups began to grow. By the end of the first week, the control group had a greater average weight than the hormone group. However, by the tenth day, the hormonal group and the control group were both at approximately 10 ounces. In the following days, the hormone group overtook the control group in greater average. Both groups then experienced a decline in weight beginning the twelfth day, which continued until the end of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, the control group weighed an average of approximately 10 ounces, while the hormone group weighed approximately 13.8 ounces. 

Discussion:
Examining the results, the hormones initially did not appear to create a noticeable difference between the two groups. By the seventh day, the hormones even seemed to be a deterrent, as the control group was outpacing the experimental group in growth. However, this trend reversed, as the experimental group surpassed the control group after the tenth day and held the lead in average weight for the remainder of the experiment. This could be due in part to an excess of hormones supplied to the control group at the beginning, or just a slow reaction time. The hormones ultimately proved to assist the manducas in growing faster than normal, similar to previous studies conducted. 

Literature Cited:
To me, it seems that there is no literature that helped us in the performance of this experiment that is able to be cited.
