Title: A Lack of Photosynthetic Change When Concentration of Sodium Bicarbonate Increases

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is used by plants, some protists and some bacteria with the help of light energy (Johnson). Carbon dioxide plays an integral role in the chemical reaction of photosynthesis which yields oxygen and glucose to allow organisms to grow and survive. Its outputs are imperative to the function of organisms such as producing glucose to start glycolysis. We hypothesized that the higher the concentration of sodium bicarbonate present, the higher the photosynthetic activity. To assess the effects of excess bicarbonate effects photosynthesis, we tested how 0.5M and 1M concentration of bicarbonate compare to none at all. It was found that there is no significance due to a 0.233 p-Value, causing an acceptance of the null hypothesis which states that there is no significance of increasing the concentration of sodium bicarbonate as it does not increase the photosynthetic rate. These results could be due to the high concentration of sodium bicarbonate, as supported by another study using 231 g/L of sodium bicarbonate and algae producing a higher photosynthetic rate (Zhou et al.). Understanding the effects of carbon dioxides presence in the reaction of photosynthesis is important to the successful growth and production of glucose and oxygen by organisms and should be further studied

Introduction:
	Plants, some protists, and some bacteria capture and store light energy through photosynthesis [Johnson:2018]. Photosynthesis involves redox reactions where electrons go through an electron transport chain where protons pump across the lipid bilayers due to the transference of high energy electrons. The input of carbon dioxide, water, and light into a photosynthetic organism, produces an output of glucose and oxygen, this essential to the growth and survival of organisms (Johnson). Carbon dioxide, water, and light are integral parts of the rate of reaction, and any alteration of these components can change the rate of photosynthesis. The presence carbon dioxide is a catalyst in reactions of photosynthesis. It has been seen that short exposure to increased amounts of carbon dioxide cause an increase of photosynthetic activity but prolonged exposure causes varying results of activity in a plethora of species (Tomimatsu and Tang). We hypothesize that the higher the concentration of sodium bicarbonate present, the higher the photosynthetic activity.
	In order to assess the effect of carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis, we will compare the effects of the concentrations of 0M, 0.5M, and 1M sodium bicarbonate being added with enriched chloroplasts present from the organism spinach, DCPIP, and reaction buffer. The effect of sodium bicarbonate concentration on the rate of photosynthesis can be assessed with a spectrophotometer. As photosynthesis occurs, electrons will be released causing a decrease in absorbance of light due to the presence of DCPIP to facilitate the color change. Other studies have indicated that there is an increase of photosynthetic activity when sodium bicarbonate is present, such as assessing activity in leaf photosynthesis a definite increase is present (Price et al.). 


Materials and Method:
In exercise 1, we took the veins out of four large spinach leaves, rinsed them in cold water, patted them dry and place the leaves in a mortar and pestle. Second, we added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer and grind until there was a thick paste. Third, we added another 10 Ml of grinding buffer to create a slurry of spinach. Then we strained the slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into a beaker, making sure to squeeze the excess liquid. Then we centrifuged the product, drained the supernatant (being precautious to not drain the pellet), and centrifuged the supernatant once more. Upon the second centrifuge, the supernatant was drained, and the second pellet was resuspended using 20 Ml of grinding buffer. We lastly added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to resuspend the pellet from “B” and stirred it gently with a transfer pipet. 
	In exercise 2, we turned on the spectrophotometer and then set it to measure at 600 nm. We labeled ten medium test tubes and prepared 18 Ml of 0.5M Sodium Bicarbonate and 1M of sodium bicarbonate. We then put 8Ml of DI water and 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP into the blank tube. Tubes 1-3 contained 6 Ml of DI water, tubes 4-6 each contained 6 Ml of 0.5M of sodium bicarbonate, and tubes 7-9 each contained 6Ml of 1M of sodium bicarbonate. The following nine tubes also contained 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP per tube. 
Next, we added 100 μL of the resuspended pellet from exercise one, into all of the tubes and mixed them immediately. We transferred the liquid into cuvettes immediately. Then, blanked the spectrophotometer, using the blank test tube and take the first set of absorbances. Lastly, measure the absorbances every ten minutes for thirty minutes, leaving the cuvettes in the windowsill during the allotted ten-minute wait time. 
	To collect statistical data, we calculated the mean, standard deviation, using the statistical one-way ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05 which included a calculated p_value, and lastly determined which sets of data are significent using the Tukey-Kramer statistical test.


Results:
There was no variance in the absorbance between the different concentrations as recorded at each ten-minute interval. The tubes containing 0.5M demonstrated the most percent change and standard deviation. Conversely, the 1M demonstrated the least percent change and standard deviation. The data proved to be insignificent per the one-way ANOVA testing (d.f. = 2, Fs = 1.979, p_value = 0.233), as seen in Table 1. The Tukey Kramer test compared the percent change over the thirty minutes and concluded that none of the datasets​ are significent to one another as seen in Table 2. 

Discussion:
As seen in Tables 1 and 2, there is no statistical evidence in support of the hypothesis. The p-Value is noted to be 0.233 making the data sets insignificent, resulting in the acceptance of the null hypothesis that states that there is no effect of excess sodium bicarbonate on photosynthetic rate. As seen in Figure 1, the percent change did not vary over time for the high concentrations whereas the 0M had an increase of percent change per time interval. It was clear that in the presence of light, the cuvettes containing 0.5M and 1M of sodium bicarbonate, were bubbling expressing the release of oxygen indicating photosynthesis occurring with no presence of bubbles in the cuvettes with 0M. These juxtaposing observations could come from too high of a concentration of sodium bicarbonate or the use of spinach as an organism. This can be supported by assessing another experiment where 231 g/L of sodium bicarbonate was used to assess its photosynthetic rate on algae (Zhou et al.).  Although this experiment produced, undesired results, it is still very relevant. 
	It is imperative to note that without photosynthesis, the world would be devoid of oxygen, causing death to most organisms. Although, in a world where carbon dioxide rates are rising it is imperative to understand how it will affect photosynthetic rates as we survive on photosynthetic thriving organisms as fuel and to keep a clean ecosystem. The presence of carbon dioxide in the process of photosynthesis, not only provides a source of oxygen but of glucose as well which supports the energy output used to fuel other processes such as ATP production. Determining a way to have optimal and increased photosynthetic activity would prove to be very useful in optimizing energy and oxygen in the environment. In another study it was seen that increased amounts of bicarbonate caused the growth and photosynthetic activity of  Broussonetia papyrifera, a flowering plant (Zhao and Wu). In another study, bicarbonate was found to increase leaf photosynthesis by 15% (Price et al.). It is seen that although there may have been error, this is still an imperative aspect to life and biological study.
