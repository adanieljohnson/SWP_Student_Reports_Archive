Title: Effect of Tank Size on Aggression Levels in Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their agnostic (or aggressive) behavior in response to other Betta fish. By observing the behavior of Betta splendins males put together in varying tank sizes, much can be learned about how (1) the space in between fish affects their aggression level toward each other and (2) whether having a larger tank space lowers aggressive behavior simply because the fish are able to coexist in the same tank without noticing each other. Two pairs of male bettas were used for observation in a large tank and a small tank and their total aggressive behavior was calculated (TAB). Results of the study were significent and the initial hypothesis that Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when together in the small tank was supported.


Introduction:
Betta splendins, or Siamese fighting fish, are well known for their agnostic (or aggressive) behavior in response to other Betta fish. These intraspecific responses vary in the level of aggression. There are two main classes of agnostic behavior, facing and broadside, with several behaviors increasing in aggression in each class [Johnson:2018]. Environmental factors may play a role in which behaviors a Betta displays. A study on the aggressive behavior in fish found that B. splendins actively explore new environments, and when they see stimuli (either another fish or an inanimate object), they act out in aggressive ways [Johnson: 1973]. The level of aggression, however, can vary depending on whether the fish saw the stimuli immediately, or whether the fish coexisted with the stimuli unknowingly for a period of time prior to noticing it.   By observing the behavior of male Betta splendins put together in varying tank sizes, much can be learned about how (1) the space in between fish affects their aggression level toward each other and (2) whether having a larger tank space lowers aggressive behavior simply because the fish are able to coexist in the same tank without noticing each other. Two tank sizes will be used (one small and one large), and it was hypothesized that male Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when put together in the small tank than the large tank and that when in the large tank together, the fish will not notice each other right away. 


Materials and Method:
Each observation period lasted for 5 minutes and was followed by a 5-minute rest period. For the first experiment, two male Betta fish were placed into a small tank at opposite ends using a net. There were no barriers in the tank. The fish were observed for 5 minutes and a tally chart was kept to track the number of times each fish displayed one of the six aggressive behaviors. After 5 minutes, barriers were placed in between the fish to separate them and the rest period began. This same experiment was repeated with another set of two new male Bettas.   After the rest period finished, each of the two sets of male fish completed the same exercise in the larger tank. Fish were placed in the tank at opposite ends again using nets and the same tally chart was kept for these next two runs. After 5 minutes of observation in the tank, fish were removed from the large tank and placed into small tanks with barriers to rest. Each behavior was assigned a rating based on level of aggression of the behavior, and the frequencies that the behaviors were repeated were multiplied by the rating (1, 2 or 3). A number of 1 indicates the lowest level of aggressive behavior, while a number of 3 indicates the highest level of aggressive behavior. Next, the sum of all of the numbers for a particular fish was calculated and this was called the total aggressive behavior (TAB). TAB values for each of the 4 fish were used in an unpaired t_test comparing small to large tank size.


Results:
Results showed that average TAB was higher for fish in the small tank (See Figure 1) than for fish in the large tank (t_stat=2.878, d.f.=3, P=0.0318). Fish in the small tank had a higher average TAB value of 42.75 +/- 23.31 compared to fish in the larger tank with a lower average TAB of 22.25 +/- 11.53. 


Discussion:
Results of the study showed a significent difference between aggression levels in B. splendins in a small tank versus a large tank, and the initial hypothesis that Bettas will show more aggressive behavior when together in the small tank was supported. While completing the experiment, it was not possible to determine whether Bettas noticed each other immediately or not. In comparison to the 1973 study on aggression in B. splendins, Bettas most likely did not notice each other immediately when in the large tank since it took a few minutes for aggressive behavior to begin. Had the two fish noticed each other right away, aggressive behavior would have likely begun to be expressed immediately [Johnson: 1973]. Results of this study prove that the amount of space in between two male Bettas affects how they interact with each other. In the future, this study may be improved by testing several tank sizes, rather than just two in order to generate a curve to see at what tank size aggressive behavior decreases.
