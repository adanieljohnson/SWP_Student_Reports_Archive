Title: The observation of Agonistic Behavior in Betta Fish when exposed to Different Circumstances

Abstract:
Observation of animal behavior is imperative in that it allows humans to understand the ways in which animals utilize cost and benefit analysis in order to make decisions. For the Betta Splenden or Betta fish, fighting is a characteristic bred into their population aggressively. This behavior has many rewards when pertaining to survival because it allows the fish to fight for both food and mating preference. For a betta fish, it is within their nature to do a cost-benefit analysis in order to decide whether it is worth engaging in aggressive behavior with another fish. To better understand the conditions deemed necessary to fight we created an experiment that hosts different trials and conditions for the fish to react to. Although it seems that betta fish would be particularly aggressive on both fronts, our hypothesis was that the male fish would exhibit higher levels of aggressive behavior over a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food. An ANOVA test was utilized to analyze the statistical differences of the different trials in which there was no statistical difference based on the critical value .05 so no further statistical testing was necessary. The study can be used in the future to understand cost-benefit analysis as a whole. 

Introduction:
Due to natural selection, there are many ways in which different organisms play to their strengths and accumulate attributes in order to increase the survival of the species. Organisms often inherit the traits that allowed their ancestors to survive and reproduce effectively. For Betta fish in particular, a trait that has been accumulated from generation to generation is aggression.  When observing Betta Splendens, or Betta fish, agonistic behaviors are most present when the organisms is threatened. The operant approach to agonistic behavior in Bettas has conceptualized these fish as fighting fish which are both lured and driven to fight [Hogan & Roper :1978].  Throughout years of evolution and natural selection, Betta fish have been rewarded for their aggressive behavior, thus escalating the extent to which they portray these behaviors. For males specifically, this behavior is rewarded by being able to mate with females over other males as well as winning in combat over food in order to survive. Therefore these agonistic behaviors are necessary for Betta fish to survive and reproduce. Heightened risks of injury from predators and conspecifics seem to be tolerated primarily when important resources and reproductive advantage are conferred by fighting; [Dawkins:1976]. By introducing food and females into the experiment there is a heightened sense of urgency between the two males because now there is a component that instigates  aggression. When the males have something to fight over it can be more clearly understood the ways in which they approach each other when their livelihood is threated. By observing the male betta fish in these varying conditions it can be understood what the betta fish qualify as utilizing combat as well as the methods in which they utilize combat.  In order to adequately measure these behaviors, they needed to be observed via the qualification of aggressive behavior patterns shown by fish placed in these specific situations. These qualifications include identifying each other, portraying aggressive behavior and contact.  Although it seems that betta fish would be particularly aggressive on both fronts, our hypothesis was that the male fish would exhibit higher levels of aggressive behavior over a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, three sets of two male betta fish will be used in order to better understand agonistic behaviors. First, the two males will be put into a tank together in order to observe their baseline aggression towards each other which will be followed by a five minute rest period. The fish will be broken up if/when they make contact with each other, but within the timespan, the times will be recorded of when they identify each other as well as show aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior implies red maning (the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane) as well as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. These behaviors will be observed within a 5 minute time span or until the fish make contact for every condition they are placed in. The next condition requires food to be added to the tank in which the two male fish are. The same qualifications will be observed and then they will be given a five minute rest. Lastly, the same male betta fish will be placed in the presence of a female while keeping all other consistent with the initial treatment. After the first trial of fish is over, the same conditions will be imposed upon two more sets of male betta fish with new females as well. After this, an ANOVA  will be utilized in order to compare the means of the independent groups with an alpha value of 0.05. In the event the data does have a significant difference, a Tukey- Kramer method will be utilized in order to further assess the statistical difference.



Results:
 The mean values for each of the trials different when looking at different conditions. For trial one, the averages were 6 seconds to identify, 8 seconds to display aggressive behavior and 212 seconds to make contact. For trial two the averages were eight seconds to identify, 42 seconds to display aggression ad 148 seconds to make contact. Lastly, trial three took 46 seconds to identify, 73 seconds to display aggression and 163 seconds to make contact. 
Trial one had a standard deviation of 6.03 seconds, trial two 8.62 seconds and trial three 151.84 seconds. 


Discussion:
 Within this experiment, the initial hypothesis that the males would exhibit more aggressive behaviors within a shorter amount of time in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food was not supported by the data collected. What was noticed from the data was that when the food was present the males were much more aggressive than when there was a female present. This could have been for tied directly to the costs and benefit analysis of the betta fish but it seemed there were many limitations that could have hindered a direct correlation between these conditions. One possible limitation was that there were still leftover food particles within the tank when the two males one female condition was being observed. This excess food created a distraction within the tank allowing the fish to evaluate their costs and benefits of the situation and choose food over the female. In order to further the study, each condition will have a different tank so that the food is not cross-contaminating the other trials. Additionally, the sample size was so small that the trials could in no way be accurately representative of the whole population. Much of the aggression to be seen in nature can thus be regarded as merely a consequence of proximity between two individuals [Hinde, 1960]. But, the fish had also been used in several labs and thus may have undergone habituation in that they were much more comfortable and less alert in their surroundings than a wild fish would have been. Two fish left together may fight intermittently and not continuously, the fighting could be called spontaneous: each is continuously exposed to stimulation from the other but responds only some of the time [Lorenz,1966]. The tendency to fight thus fluctuates with time. Because it is a commonplace that temporary isolation, for a period of minutes or hours, may lead to a lowering of the threshold for aggression [Simpson, 1968]. Then, using the ANOVA test to look at all of the data within the between the three trials displayed no significant difference statistically so no further testing was required in order to more precisely understand the agonistic behavior of the fish. Within this experiment going forward, it is imperative to take into account the fact the fish are constantly undergoing a cost and benefits analysis as to whether they should risk engaging in a fight or remain docile in each others presence.

Trial one is the two males in the tank alone, trial two is the two males exposed to food and trial three is the two males exposed to a female. The ANOVA test with an alpha value of 0.05 for trial one (f=3.63,df=6,p=0.09), trial two (f=1.71,df=6,p=0.28), and trial three (f=0.16,df=6,p=0.86) all showed no statistical significant difference so no further testing was necessary. *************************************************************************
