Title: Hormonal imbalance and growth development changes in Manduca Sexta.

Abstract:
In this experiment, we are identifying the influence that hormones have on the development of insects. Pupation of these caterpillars are affected by two different hormones: Juvenile Hormone, which is responsible for the type of molt during development, and Ecdysterone(20E), which regulates the timing of molting during insect development. Giving caterpillars the IGR should result in a change of their growth. If a group of caterpillars is given the IGR, then the length of the caterpillars will change. The two groups was allocated four Manduca sexta. Each individual caterpillar was placed within, along with the same number of breathing holes in each container, and overall same living conditions. The only difference within the groups was what was put inside of the food, contributing to the hormonal imbalance. For the controll group, the mean difference of length from day one to the last day was 0.275 cm, and the experimental was 2.525. We were unable to accept the data . Understanding how the manipulation of hormones in the Manduca sexta caterpillars can explore the capabilities of influencing various chemicals and signals in other organisms and seeing how that can result in growth development changes.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we are identifying the influence that hormones have on the development of insects. More specifically, we are examining the relationship between hormones in the Manduca sexta caterpillar and its effects on development. The normal life process of the caterpillar includes 5 instar stages of development, followed by pupation(the metamorphosis into adulthood). In a normal scenario, pupation of these caterpillars are affected by two different hormones: Juvenile Hormone, which is responsible for the type of molt during development, and Ecdysterone(20E), which regulates the timing of molting during insect development [Johnson: 2018]. Both of these hormones are needed within one another to progress into adulthood. The normal regulation of these hormones proves normal lifestyles. However, the usefulness of these hormones gets put into question once we start wondering what happens if we alter the number of hormones in the caterpillars and if that relates to the development of the insect. Previous studies have tested this same exact question, most commonly with using an IGR, which acts as a juvenile hormone mimic [Tunaz: 2014]. So if a group of caterpillars is given the IGR, then the length of the caterpillars will change.

Materials and Method:
This experiment was broken down into two groups, an experimental group, and a controll group. Each group was allocated four Manduca sexta. Each individual caterpillar was placed within, along with the same number of breathing holes in each container, and overall same living conditions. The only difference within the groups was what was put inside of the food, contributing to the hormonal imbalance. Each group was given ten grams of food. The controll’s food had three drops of water put into the food. The experimental group’s food had three drops of juvenile hormone mimic. Following the setup of the experiment, we measured the lengths of the caterpillars and put them in an incubator. From there, we measured the lengths of the caterpillar daily. Any additional physical differences, such as color change and pupation was noted. A two-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine the differences In the average growth of the caterpillars between the group with no hormonal imbalance and the group given juvenile hormone mimic. 

Results:
For the controll group, the mean difference of length from day one to the last day was 0.275 cm. For the experimental group, the mean difference of length from day one to the last day was 2.525. The standard deviation of the controll group is 1.04835, and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 1.623524972. All of this is shown in Figure 1. The significance value of p for our statistical analysis was 0.05, and our results for the experiment with a two-tailed two-sample test was P = 0.0609. This data was not significent. Alongside the statistics of the experiment, we also took note of any other notable changes, such as when pupation started in all of the Manduca sexta. In the controll group, the first caterpillar never fully reached pupation, but the other caterpillars have: caterpillar two and three pupated on the seventh day, and the fourth caterpillar was seen in pupation on the 13th day. None of the Manduca sexta in the experimental group showed any signs of pupation during the duration of the experiment. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, which states that if a group of Manduca sexta caterpillars is given an IGR, then the lengths of the caterpillars will be changed, cannot be accepted because our data was not significent. However, there were clear trends within the data in terms of growth and development. The controll group had a steady trend of growth until approximately 5 days into the experiment, where the 5th instar larva started to pupate, shrinking several centimeters. The group which was given the IGR, however, only had steady growth throughout the experiment, but they never reached pupation. Although we are not able to prove anything, the mimic still shows signs of having an influence on the development of the insect. Previous experiments have been able to accept our hypothesis or a similar hypothesis under similar conditions [Reynolds: 1986]. Understanding how the manipulation of hormones in the Manduca sexta caterpillars can explore the capabilities of influencing various chemicals and signals in other organisms and seeing how that can result in growth development changes.
