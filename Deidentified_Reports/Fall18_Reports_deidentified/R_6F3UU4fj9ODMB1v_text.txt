Title: Resource allocation in fagopyrum esculentum in red light 

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to determine if there were varying root to shoot ratios in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants that grew in red or natural light. It was hypothesized that red plants would have a lower root to shoot ratio but in the end there was no statistically significent difference between the means in the root to shoot ratios between the controll and experimental groups.

Introduction:
Plants may allocate their resources differently depending on their environmental conditions they are placed in. Things such as nutrient level, rainfall, or amount of light can all have an affect on resource allocation. Our group specifically looked at how red light would affect the root to shoot ratio in buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum). It was hypothesized that the plants placed to grow under the red light would have a lower root to shoot ratio because they would likely grow better and therefore have little need to allocate their resources unevenly between roots and shoots.

Materials and Method:
The buckwheat seeds were first soaked for thirty minutes prior to planting. Next, 2 pots were labeled treatment and 2 were labeled controll. All of the pots were then filled with vermiculite, water, and miracle grow. for each pot, indentations were made and seeds were planted in each spot, then covered in vermiculite. all four pots were then placed in the greenhouse. the controll plants were left in the natural sunlight and a red bag was placed over the treatment group. The plants were then watered everyday for two weeks. to harvest and measure the plants, we cut the roots and shoots at the root shoot junction, making sure it was about the same level on each plants. We then weighed and measured the roots and shoots for both the experimental and controll groups. A two tailed t test was used to test if there was a statistically significent different in the mean proportions of the root to shoot ratios of the experimental and controll groups. 

Results:
After a two tailed t test was run, it was concluded that there was not any statistically significent evidence to prove there was a difference between the mean proportions of the root to shoot ratios of wight and length of the controll and experimental groups. 

Discussion:
After running a two tailed t_test, it was determined that there was not a statistically significent difference between the mean proportions of length root to shoot ratio and the weight root to shoot ratio (Weight: t=0.7131, d.f. = 22, p=0.4833) (Length: t=0.0469, d.f.=22, p=.9630). This means that there was not statistically significent data to prove that the resource allocation was different between the red light and natural light plants. This disproves our hypothesis that red plants would have a lower root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. Based on this data, the null hypothesis was supported that there was no difference between the root to shoot ratios. Further search may conclude that different variables can have an effect on resource allocation in plants, but this specific variable does not necessarily prove any significent differences.
