Title: Effects of 20-Hydroxyecdysone on Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Over exposure of a 20E inhibitor hormone in high doses has an adverse effect on the health of Manduca sexta larvae.  20E is a naturally occurring chemical component in insects that’s responsible for growth.  In our experiment, we want to observe the effects of a 20E inhibitor on Manduca sexta larvae and to achieve this we have designed an experiment involving eight caterpillar larvae in which we split into two groups.  We altered the diet of the experimental group to contain high doses of the desired hormone and observed the effects on their length, weight, overall wellbeing over a period of two weeks.    

Introduction:
Hormones are chemical components that elicit some change in their target cell or tissue and are important in the development of all multicellular organisms. Hormones are responsible for an organism’s growth and transition into adulthood and in insects, 20E or 20-Hydroxyecdysone is a steroidal hormone which in tandem with the Juvenile hormone is directly responsible for the molting and metamorphosis process.  In the case of Manduca sexta, there are two phases of ecdysone and prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) secretion [Nijhout: 1972] which must occur before pupation. Also, Manduca sexta is a popular species of insect for this type of research due to the ease of hormone manipulation as well as the extensive research that has been done on their life cycle. Finally, our purpose in carrying out this experiment is to observe the effects of a 20E inhibitor on the growth of the caterpillars by introducing the hormone blocker into their diets and I believe that the introduction of the 20E inhibitor will prevent pupation and therefore give us larger larvae.

Materials and Method:
We have 2 groups of 4 caterpillars each. Each group of caterpillars will get 10g of food. The controll group (1) will receive 10 drops of water per 10 grams of food.  The experimental groups (2) will receive 10 drops of 20E inhibitor per 10 grams of food. After food has been distributed and the initial weight in grams measured the caterpillars will be placed in an incubator and observed periodically over the next two weeks.  For our statistical analyses we will calculate two-tailed t_test to assess the statistical significance in the difference of length and weight between the experimental and controll group.

Results:
From both of our tables and graphs we observed a general upward trend in both the length and weight of the controll group however, counter to our hypothesis the experimental group stayed roughly the same and eventually lost weight and shrank; also, after using a two-sample t_test we were able to determine that the data we gathered was statistically significent.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that exposure to increased levels of the 20E inhibitor (AzaGuard) would prevent pupation thus giving us larger larvae was not supported.  We observed that the 20E inhibitor at the dosage of 10 drops per 10 grams of food proved detrimental to the overall health of the experimental larvae; with 50% of the experimental group dying by the ninth day of observations.  In smaller doses the 20E inhibitor may have had the desired effect as expressed in my hypothesis.
