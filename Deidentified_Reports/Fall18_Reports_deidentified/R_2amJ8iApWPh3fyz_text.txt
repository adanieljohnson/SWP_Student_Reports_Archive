Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Resource Allocation on Field Peas, Pisum sativum

Abstract:
Plants respond to changes in their environment by allocating their resources in varying ways. In this experiment, root and shoot growth patterns of Pisum sativum were observed when exposed to different levels of sunlight. It was expected that the plants grown in shade would have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than plants grown in full sunlight because they would allocate resources to the leaves that were collecting their most limited resource. The root to shoot ratio was significantly higher for plants grown in full sunlight than plants grown in shade. This finding suggests that plants allocate resources that promote growth towards structures that harvest their more limited resources, in order to most efficiently collect those resources.

Introduction:
Abiotic resources, stimuli coming from non-living sources such as sunlight, are limited for all living things. Resource limitation affects what species of plants are present in any given environment based on what resources the environment provides. In order to best use their limited resources, plants will allocate them to certain structures or stages of life over others [Johnson: 2018]. The tested subject for this experiment was field peas (Pisum sativum). These are a good test subject because seedlings grow rapidly [Pavek: 2012]. Field pea growth can be seen in the roots of the plant as well as above-ground structures grouped as the shoot. Resource allocation can be measured using a root-to-shoot ratio.  This experiment tests the response of the field peas to different levels of sunlight in terms of resource allocation measured by root-to-shoot ratio. The independent is the amount of sunlight peas are exposed to (100% vs shade). The dependent variable is the root-to-shoot ratio for the lengths and masses of the field peas. . Plants often allocate resources to the structures that take in the most limited resources [Sims: 2012]. Since in plants exposed to less sunlight, the photosynthetic structures (leaves/shoots)take in the most limited resources, the plant will likely allocate resources to them. Our hypothesis states that if the field peas grow in the shade, the root to shoot ratio will be less than if grown in full natural sunlight. 

Materials and Methods:
Six pots were gathered, three for the 100% sunlight control group, and three for the shaded treatment group. 16 seeds were planted in each pot. Each pot was treated with 100 mL Miracle-Gro and watered with 100 mL of water. The control group was placed in the greenhouse under full sunlight, and the treatment group was placed under a covering that limited the amount of sunlight that reached the plants. Each plant was watered daily with 100 mL of water for two weeks. After two weeks, the pots were removed from the greenhouse. To measure root-to-shoot ratio, 10 plants were removed from each group and rinsed in water. The roots and shoots were separated by cutting each plant at the point where the color changes at the end of the shoot. Both roots and shoots of each plant were measured with respect to length in cm and mass in g. The mean values were used for analysis. A two-sample unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis.

Results:
The mean root-to-shoot ratio for weight was significantly higher for plants grown in the sun than for plants grown in the shade (t= 2.75, df= 22, p= 0.012), (Figure 1).  The mean root-to-shoot ratio for length was significantly higher for plants grown in the sun than for plants grown in the shade (t= 3.83, df= 22, p= 0.00092), (Figure 2). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by the data. Field peas grown in the shade differed in their root to shoot ratio than the field peas grown in the sunny area. The plants grown in the sunlight had a higher root-to-shoot ratio. The plants grown in the shade were more resource limited for sunlight, so they allocated more resources to the growth of the leaves and shoot in order to collect as much sunlight as possible that they needed for photosynthesis. During the experiment, the plants were not watered for 3 days in a row, which may have disrupted the growth of the plants or caused plants to allocate resources differently because we limited another resource (water). Resources may have been allocated to the roots in order to increase water intake into the plants, which would increase the root-to-shoot ratio. A possible reason the sunny plants have a higher ratio is because they were exposed to more sunlight and became more dry over the “drought” period. A previous study explored the effect of limiting different resources, including sunlight, on wild rice plants. It found, similarly to our study, that plants grown in sunlight had a higher root-to-shoot ratio than those grown in shade. [Sims: 2012]. Wild rice and field peas are very different plants, yet both have the basic need for sunlight and allocate their resources to accommodate that in similar ways. In line with allocation theory (Bloom 1985) (Tilman 1988), plants allocate a larger proportion of resources to tissues used to take in the most limiting resource because it is harder to take in the amount of that resource the plant needs to sustain itself, therefore more structures are needed for intake. It would be interesting to monitor the plants until they reached maturity in order to look at whether the allocation patterns were limited only in initial growth stages or if it affected their size at maturity/past seedling stages. Understanding how plants allocate resources is important to further our understanding of plasticity in plants, especially as many plant environments are undergoing major changes that could potentially disrupt the landscape that currently exists in certain environments if the plants are not able to survive under new conditions.
