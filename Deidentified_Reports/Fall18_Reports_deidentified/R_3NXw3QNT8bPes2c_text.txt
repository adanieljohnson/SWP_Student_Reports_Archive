Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Development and Growth of Larva Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of G-regulator, a Juvenile Hormone mimic, on Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In this experiment, five drops of G-regulator were added every other day to the half of the larvae’s standard diets to test the effect it on their weight over a fifteen-day period in comparison to a control group. The caterpillars were fed and weighed each day in order to obtain suitable results. Overall, this experiment was successful because it reflected the hypothesis which stated that mixing 5 drops of G-regulator into 10g of the caterpillars diet every other day would have a positive effect on the caterpillar’s weight. At the end of the fifteen-day period, the experimental group had gained an average of 12.05g which is significantly higher than the 9.27g the experimental group had gained on average. A two-tailed T-test was used to compare this data. It was determined the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.32, df = 22, P = 0.750). Therefore, we had to reject the part of the hypothesis that stated the hormone would make experimental group weigh more than the control group. The experimental group did not pupate as hypothesizes so that part was accepted. 

Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta moth, also known as the sphinx moth or tobacco hornworm, is an organism that goes through four completely different life phases that are controlled by multiple hormones. The Manduca Sexta begins its life as an egg before growing into a worm-like larva. In its last larval stage, it pupates to forms a cocoon to grow and develop wings before it emerges as an adult with winds and reproductive organs. The insect hormones are what signals its body to continue to the next phases. These hormones affect the insect’s development such as molting, formation of pupa, and the emergence of adult. They are known as Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. These hormones signal the rest of the body to either activate a function or have an organizational effect like changing the arrangement of the body. The two hormones insects cannot live without are Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysterone. They work together specifically to control growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca Larva into their adult stage [Johnson: 2018]. The Ecdysterone hormones are molting hormones, with periodic surges causing the events involved in molting, whereas Juvenile Hormone hormones are status-quo hormones that maintain the insect in its current form as the insect is responding to the molting surge of Ecdysterone [Truman: 2002]. They are relatively high in insects during their larva stage but when Juvenile Hormone finally disappears during the last larval instar the commitment pulse is signaled, meaning the insect begins to undergo metamorphosis pupating to become an adult [Truman: 2002]. Manduca Sexta are the ideal model organism to run hormone test on because they are pests in nature, there has been lots of experiments conducted on them in the past with which we can compare, they have a pretty fast life span for which we can see the effects of hormone on relatively fast, and they are cheap and easy to get. 
This lab deals with altering how long Juvenile Hormones is present in Manduca Sexta larva relative to normal hormone production and increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in the diet of larva. More specifically this lab involves adding five drops of G-regulator, a Juvenile Hormone mimic, every other day to the diet of four larva. This experiment will give us insight to compare weight, growth, and relative time of pupating compared to untreated larva under normal conditions. Only by examining the effects of hormone regulation and the effect on the insect will the scientific community know how to apply it in real life. The information obtained that can be used in real life cases. For example, using hormone in place of insecticide would mean farmers and gardeners would use a non-toxic compound instead of hazardous material that could affect the rest of the ecosystem. 
G-regulator is the Juvenile Hormone mimic used in this experiment that is being fed to Manduca Sexta in their larval stage. The amount of Juvenile Hormone given to the larva is the independent variable. The four larva that do not get any Juvenile Hormone are the control group. This experiment is being conducted to test whether the hormone in higher than normal amounts will affect the timing of pupation and commitment stage and to test if the juvenile hormone will make the larva grow heavier in weight than the control group which is being fed the same diet without G-regulator. The weight of the larva and whether or not the insect pupated are the dependent variables in this experiment. It is hypothesized that feeding the experimental group five drops of Juvenile Hormone mimic every other day will cause them to grow bigger in size than the control group who will not be exposed to the hormone mimic. Along with growing bigger in size the experimental larva will not pupate because the presence of Juvenile Hormone will not let them reach the commitment pulse and pupate. 


Materials and Methods:
First, the eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars that were provided by the lab instructor were separated into two groups: a control group and an experimental group. They were placed into two plastic containers with lids that both had four sections with perforations to let air in, so the larva or caterpillars could be visible and clearly labeled 1 through 4 for each group. The first day of the experiment each caterpillar was weighed and photographed. The treatment group received five drops of G-regulator, Juvenile Hormone mimic, in their 10 grams of food. The control group was just given 10 grams of normal food without the hormone mimic. Every day after that the treatment group was fed hormone mimic every odd day and normal food every even day in a 15-day period. They were all weighed, fed, and their containers were cleared of any waste daily. They were placed in an incubator that mimicked the ideal temperatures for natural caterpillar environment. Data for days 10-12 also could not be collected due to hurricane Florence. On day 13 the experimental group was not fed hormone food like initially intended, but just ate regular food without hormone because the procedure could not be carried out also due to hurricane Florence. A two-tailed T-test was used to compare the data between the control group and the experimental group. Overall, the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.32, df = 22, P = 0.750).

Results:
For most of the experiment the control group weighed more than the experimental group. For the first three days, the difference in weight between the experimental and control group barely varied. For days 4 to 8, the control group weighed significantly more than the experimental as can be seen in Figure 1. On day 9 and 13 the difference lowered between the two groups. Day 14 and 15, show a very significant increase in the weight of the treatment group. This is the first time the treatment group weighs more than the control. Also, starting at day 13 the average weight of the control group started to slowly decrease by day by day to day 15. 
At the beginning of the experiment, both of the groups looked identical. By the end of the experiment the treatment group had become more inflated and their color had gotten shades lighter than the control group. Also, the control group had caterpillars turning a yellow color and one of them had turned fully brown and had stopped moving. The caterpillar that pupated had started turning yellow two days before it pupated. 


Discussion:
The trends of the data can be explained by biological phenomenon. The caterpillars used in the experiment were all in their second or third instar at the beginning of the experiment. According to their life cycle, this meant that within around 15-13 days the larva would reach the commitment pulse turning into pupa. The commitment pulse happens when the insect has had enough food to eat to survive metamorphosis. It is triggered by the rapid decline of Juvenile Hormone production and an increase in Ecdysterone. [Truman: 2002]. Leading up to the commitment pulse the larva or caterpillars’ job is to eat as much as they can to be nutritionally sustained when they cannot eat as pupa. This is like hibernation. These trends can be seen on the graph with the gradual increase of weight of the caterpillars every day. The reason then for the decline of the control group and not the experimental group around days 13 through 15 is due to the fact that one of the caterpillars in the control group had pupated. This caterpillar’s weight was going down because it was depleting its food storage in order to go through metamorphosis. The other caterpillars in the control group were turning yellow meaning they would begin to pupate in less than three days because that was the trend seen with the first caterpillar. JH is a key player in the evolution of metamorphosis because it can act on organisms to suppress morphogenesis and cause premature differentiation [Truman: 2002]. This is why only the control group was pupating and not the experimental group. The caterpillars in the experimental group were growing heavier in size a significant amount during days 13-15 because they were still being fed juvenile hormone preventing them from reaching the commitment pulse. 
The statistical data is not as clear and significant as we would have liked. Overall, the mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group.  This could have been due to the experimental group not getting fed Juvenile Hormone on day 13. Although the data for days 13-15 shows a significant difference between the two groups it is not very well supported around days 4-8 because the control group dominated in weight for most of the experiment. This could have been caused by the natural regulation of hormones signaling the caterpillars to eat more since the body knew it was getting ready to reach commitment pulse. Error also could have occurred from not having data for days 10-12. This could have led to a change in mean and thus skewed the statistical data. 
For future experimentation, a longer time to record data would be very beneficial to the findings of the effect of Juvenile Hormone on this species. All the larva in the control group in this experiment did not pupate but at the end they were turning yellow meaning they were about to which lets us know the trend for their decline in weight would have continued and the statistical data would have been more significant. The data observed supports the initial hypothesis, but the statistical data collected disputes it because the p value is above 0.5 meaning the results could have just happened by chance. Therefore, part of the hypothesis is rejected. The part of the hypothesis that mentioned that the experimental group wouldn’t pupate still stands and is accepted.
