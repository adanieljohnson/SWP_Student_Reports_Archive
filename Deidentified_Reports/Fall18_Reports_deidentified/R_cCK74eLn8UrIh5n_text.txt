Title: The Effects of Temperature on the Aggression of Betta splendins 

Abstract:
Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are fish that are notorious for exhibiting aggressive behavior when exposed to another Betta. They are ectothermic vertebrates, which means they are dependent on external sources for body heat. I hypothesized that when a pair of Betta fish is placed into cold water, they will take longer to exhibit aggressive behavior than when placed into room temperature water. To test this hypothesis, I obtained six Betta fish and placed them into three pairs. All three of these pairs were exposed to both the room temperature condition and cold-water condition. To evaluate the collected data, I used a one-tailed paired t_test. I observed that the Bettas placed in colder water took a longer amount of time to exhibit agnostic behavior. This was because in cold water, the fish needed to conserve their energy and heat. Although I observed that cold water affected the agnostic behavior of a Betta fish, there was no significent difference between agnostic behavior of Betta fish in cold and hot water.

Introduction:
Betta Splendins, are among the most beautiful and fascinating of all aquarium fish. They are very territorial and the people of their native country of Thailand traditionally place males together and wager bets as to who will be the winner [Harlioglu: 2008]. These territorial and aggressive behaviors are also called agnostic behaviors. In Betta fish, agnostic behaviors include broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a Betta turns on its side toward an opponent [Johnson: 2018]. The facing movements include erecting the pectoral fin, spreading the gill coverings, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes, creating a red mane [Johnson 2018]. Bettas respond to other’s agnostic behaviors in many ways. They can ignore it, match it, flee, submit, or escalate [Johnson 2018]. 

These behaviors can be explained by a Betta’s physiology.  Betta Splendins are considered to be ectotherms. This means their internal temperatures are usually very close to that of the external environment [Bhuria: 2017] In ectotherms, variation in environmental temperature can cause parallel changes in skeletal muscle temperature, potentially leading to significent alterations in skeletal muscle performance [James: 2013]. Alternations in skeletal muscle temperature can affect contractile strength in ectotherms, changing the rates of force generation [James: 2013]. Since temperature has a profound effect on ectothermic animals, they regulate their internal temperature by relying on external heat sources [Forsatkar: 2016]. Therefore, I hypothesized that Betta fish exposed to cold water will take longer to exhibit aggressive behavior. 


Materials and Method:
To test my hypothesis, I first obtained six male Betta Splendins and grouped them into three pairs. Each pair of fish was tested under two conditions: room temperature water (18°C) and cold water (15°C). During each trial, the pair of fish was placed into a tank without a divider. Then, I measured the amount of time it took for the fish to exhibit agnostic behavior. After the fish touched, they were placed in separate, visually isolated tanks to rest for five minutes. Then, I repeated this exact procedure for the next experimental condition after the rest period. In order to confirm that the cold water did not affect the behavior of the Bettas in room temperature, I preformed the room temperature test first. Lastly, to evaluate the data, I used a one-tailed paired t_test because I placed the same pair of fish in the room temperature water and the cold water. This will test if there is a significent difference in the amount of time it takes for a Betta fish to exhibit agnostic behavior in cold and room temperature water.  



Results:
I observed that the mean amount of time it took for a pair of Betta fish to touch in cold water (143 ± 28.02) was higher than the mean amount of time it took for a pair of Betta fish to touch in room temperature water (122 ± 24.76 seconds, figure 1).  I found that the mean amount of time for a pair of fish to touch in cold water was not statistically significently greater than that of the mean in room temperature water (t-value = 1.29, d.f. = 2, p_value = 0.325). Although I observed that there was a difference in agnostic behavior in cold and room temperature water, the results were not statistically significent.


Discussion:
I was unable to support my hypothesis because the Betta fish in cold water did not take a significently longer time to exhibit aggressive behavior. But, I did observe that there was a difference in aggression time in cold and hot water, and that fish exposed to cold water took longer to exhibit aggressive behavior. The delay in behavior in cold water can be attributed to the fact that the Bettas need to conserve energy and heat when in a cold environment. In a similar study, Betta fish were exposed to room temperature water and warm water. The researchers concluded that in warmer water, the Betta splendins were more active, and that behavior reflected an increase in aggression [Forsatkar: 2016]. In another study, temperatures of 28°C led to consistently more responses of Bettas than if a temperature of 22°C was used. Thus, aggressive behavior in fish has a correlation with some environmental factors [Bambang: 2006].   Unfortunately, there was not a significent enough difference between the amount of time it took for the pairs of fish to touch each other in each treatment group. I conducted this experiment with three pairs of fish because that was all I had access to due to resource limitations. Next time, I would repeat the experiment with more than three pairs of fish, to determine if the results will be statistically significent with more repetitions. I would also add treatments of different temperatures. If I were to create a temperature gradient with temperatures of 18°C, 15°C, 13°C and 10°C then I will be able to better determine if cold water has a significent difference in the aggressive behavior of Betta splendins.
