Title: Is Sodium Bicarbonate Supplement Good to Plants?

Abstract:
Photosynthesis, an essential process of plants to harvest energy, can be affected by temperature, the presence of mineral, and so on. This experiment examined the effect of sodium bicarbonate on the photosynthesis rate. Sodium bicarbonate is a common component in commercial plant supplement products, which are claimed to improve plants’ performance. The hypothesis is that an increase in sodium bicarbonate added should result in an increase in photosynthesis rate. The result of a one-way ANOVA test with a p-value of 0.161&gt;0.05 suggests there is no significant difference. One possible explanation is that sodium and bicarbonate have the opposite effect of photosynthesis rate, which can explain the insignificant results of this experiment.

Introduction:
	Photosynthesis is one of the most important ways for the plants to harvest energy. The chloroplast is the main site where photosynthesis takes place. The process can be simplified as the conversion of carbon dioxide and water to sugar and oxygen under light. This reaction scheme indicates that several variables can influence the rate of photosynthesis, for example, the concentration of water, the intensity and the wavelength of the light input, and not limited to these. 
	In the case of carbon dioxide, because all of the carbons in the organic product, sugar, from photosynthesis come from carbon dioxide, the concentration of carbon dioxide should affect the rate of photosynthesis. For soybeans, an elevated level of carbon dioxide results in an increase in photosynthesis rate, biomass, and yield of seeds [Allen: 1987]. It is reasonable to say that an increase in carbon dioxide concentration should result in a larger rate of photosynthesis for most plants.
	Sodium bicarbonate is a compound that slowly releases carbon dioxide, so the addition of sodium bicarbonate to plant should increase the photosynthesis rate, as adding sodium bicarbonate is essentially adding carbon dioxide. In this experiment, spinach leaves were treated with sodium bicarbonate to examine the effect of sodium bicarbonate on plants. The hypothesis is that an increase in sodium bicarbonate addition should result in an increase in photosynthesis rate. 
	The rate of photosynthesis can be quantified in several ways, for example, the consumption of carbon dioxide or the production of sugar. However, these measures can be hard to obtain and can be disrupted. In the case of sugar production, while producing sugar as the product of photosynthesis, the plant itself is breaking down sugar to produce energy. In other words, the measure of sugar production may not give a precise result. Instead, in this experiment, the rate of photosynthesis was determined by measuring Hill reaction. Hill reaction essentially describes the process of that electron transport chain pass electrons to carriers. In the case photosynthesis, the electron transport chain can pass electrons to DCPIP, an alternative electron receptor other than NADP+ [Johnson: 2016]. 
	DCPIP solution has a blue color with an absorbance of 600 nm. After DCPIP receives electrons and gets reduced, it turns colorless. Thus, the absorbance change at 600 nm over time indicates the rate of photosynthesis. The absorbance can be measured by a photo-spectrometer. In this way, photosynthesis was quantified.

Materials and Methods:
	Chloroplast sample was prepared with spinach leaves. The central veins of the leaves were removed, and the other parts of the leaves were washed with water. The remain parts of the leaves were then grinded to in a cold mortar & pestle with the addition of 10 mL of grinder buffer, which is made of 400 nM sucrose in Tricine buffer. The leaves were grinded to pestle; after another 10 mL of grinder buffer was added, the spinach slurry was filtrated through a piece of cheesecloth. The strain was dumped, and the filtrate was collected in a cold 50 mL centrifuge tube.
	The sample in the tube was centrifuged at 200G for 3 minutes. The liquid in the tube after the centrifuge was transferred to another centrifuge tube, which was then centrifuged at 1000G for 10 minutes. The pellet at the bottom of the tube was collected and resuspended by 20 mL of grinding buffer. Chloroplast sample was prepared.
	10 test tubes in total was prepared; 1 of them was blank, 3 of them were chloroplast with 0M sodium bicarbonate, 3 of them were chloroplast with 0.5M sodium bicarbonate, and 3 of them were chloroplast with 1M sodium bicarbonate. Each of the 10 test tubes had 100 uL of chloroplast sample. The blank tube only contained 8 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer, which is 100 mM phosphate solution. Chloroplast with 0 M sodium bicarbonate was prepared as 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. Chloroplast with 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate was prepared as 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, 2 mL of 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate solution, which was made from reaction buffer and sodium bicarbonate solid. Chloroplast with 1.0 M sodium bicarbonate was prepared as 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP, 2 mL of 1.0 M sodium bicarbonate solution. 
	Immediately after all of the 10 test tubes were prepared and mixed well, the absorbance of each sample was measured by pouring some of the solutions to a cuvette, which was put into the photo-spectrometer set at 600 nm. After this first measurement, the 10 cuvettes with samples inside were put under sunlight. Measurements of absorbance were taken after 10, 20 and 30 minutes.
	With the data collected, a one-way ANOVA test was conducted based on the significance level of 0.05.

Results:
The result of an ANOVA test on the % change of absorbance of the three treatments after 30 minutes suggests there is no significant difference among them, with a p-value of 0.161&gt;0.05, a variance component (%) of 33.39 among groups and 66.51 within groups.
	According to Figure #1, the % change of 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate was the largest among the three treatments. Although the treatment of 1 M sodium bicarbonate increases the % change of absorbance, the difference was not as large as the 0.5 M treatment.

Discussion:
	The large p-value of this experimental result does not give sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that an increase in sodium bicarbonate concentration does not result in an increase in photosynthesis rate, while the alternative hypothesis cannot be accepted. 
	When sodium bicarbonate is dissolved, there will be two ions formed in water, sodium ion and bicarbonate ion. The two ions have a different effect on plants. In the case of sodium ion, the elevated level of it can be toxic to plants, and thus decrease the rate of photosynthesis [Bie: 2004]. Sodium is not a necessary element for most of the plants, including spinach. The presence of excessive sodium ions can add stress to plant. As a response, abscisic acid will be released so that stomata will close. Stomata is an essential structure located on the leaves of the plants; stomata closure limits the entrance of carbon dioxide into the plants as the starting material of photosynthesis. Thus, photosynthesis rate can be decreased. On the other hand, the bicarbonate supplement can increase photosynthesis rate [White: 2013]. Bicarbonate supplements work in such a way that it affects the pigments in chlorophylls, the subunits of chloroplasts. The bicarbonate supplement can increase the number and the activity of the pigment, which will result in an increase in photosynthesis rate. It seems like sodium ions and bicarbonate ions have the opposite effects on plants in the case of the rate of photosynthesis. In other words, the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the chloroplast is not a simple addition of carbon dioxide, of which the concentration can increase the rate of photosynthesis. 
	Based on the result that the addition of sodium bicarbonate can not significantly increase photosynthesis rate, it can be concluded that either the sodium bicarbonate component in the plant supplement affects plants in ways other than photosynthesis rate, or the sodium bicarbonate is not the most effective component in the supplement.
	The opposite effect of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions can be one of the reasons that the result of this experiment is not significant, while there can be other errors involved. For example, the solution in the test tube was mixed, but not perfectly well. 
As the effect of sodium bicarbonate to plant photosynthesis is more complicated than assumed, further experiments and studies are suggested. For example, a comparison experiment between sodium bicarbonate and sodium sulfate can be conducted to examine the effect of bicarbonate ions to the plants.
