Title: The impact of adding additional juvenile hormones to the food of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is found commonly in the American continents. It is considered a pest as an adult. We hypothesized that by giving the hornworms more juvenile it would prevent them from pupating and becoming adults while causing them to gain weight faster than those without the juvenile hormone. We used eight tobacco hornworms in total, and split them into two groups; one group received a juvenile hormone in their food, the other did not. The hornworms given the additional JH gained more weight than those that did not receive the JH. Those hornworms also did not pupate, giving us a p_value of 0.037 and supporting our hypothesis.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta hornworms, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, are a species that thrive off of mainly tobacco farMland. As an adult, the Manduca sexta is a pest that can be very dangerous to the growth of the tobacco plant as it will eat the leaves of the plant, leaving not much product left for the farmer. In order for the tobacco hornworm to mature into a moth, they must go through pupation, which requires juvenile hormone (JH) levels to drop low. JH is the hormone responsible for signaling the brain to not pupate, but wait in order to grow and prepare for pupation. The JH levels typically drop during the last larval instar, and this drop in JH causes a rise ecdysteroids [Vince : 1977]. In nature, the hornwormâ€™s JH levels drop normally, and they begin to molt and pupate. We hypothesize that if their food is injected with the JH, then the tobacco hornworm will not pupate and will weigh more as a larva than the hornworms not fed the JH injected food.


Materials and Method:

	We separated eight tobacco hornworms into two groups of four and kept them seperate throughout the experiment. Each hornworm was given 10 grams of food as needed. For the experimental group, we added five drops of the JH into the food of each hornworm, so 5 drops for every 10 grams of food. For the controll group, they were given 5 drops of water in their food, per 10 grams. The hornworms were stored in an incubator. We weighed the hornworms daily and stopped recording data on the individual as soon as the hornworm had undergone pupation. We used a two-tailed t test with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the significance of our data.


Results:
We took the average change in weights of each hornworm before they started pupating and used that as our database. Our controll group had an average weight increase of 3.0875 grams and our experimental group had an average weight increase of 8.425 grams. The controll hornworm number 3 was an anomaly compared to the others in its group. The standard deviation for the controll group was 3.71g +/- and was 1.538g +/- for the experimental. Our p_value came out to 0.037.

Discussion:
We were able to reject the null hypothesis with a statistically significent result and support that the addition of the JH increased weight gain and prevented pupation from the tobacco hornworms. The addition of the JH caused the tobacco hornworms to not start their pupation because the JH prevents rising levels of ecdysone, which cause molting and pupation [Vince : 1977]. There were some anomalies in our data; one of the controll hornworms grew as big as the experimental hornworms, and this could be because it accidently was given the JH or had some genetic predisposition that caused it to grow as it did. Also, the hornworms began to lose weight as they began to die, causing their weight before death to be lower than it had been previously. This could be countered by taking the highest weight of the hornworms and using that in the averages. This study is important because farmers can use pesticides that include the juvenile hormone in order to prevent the hornworms from ever becoming adults, effectively limiting the population of the pests. In further studies the specific amount of JH that is most effective is something that could be heavily focused on.
