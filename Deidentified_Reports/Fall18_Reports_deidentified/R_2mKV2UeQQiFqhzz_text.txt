Title: Amplitude of the Contraction of the Gastrocnemius in Rania pipien when Injected with Sodium at 200 mM

Abstract:
Muscles are able to move through the connection of a neuromuscular junction which receives its input from an action potential. The two main ions involved this process is sodium and calcium. Sodium is used to send the action potential down the neuron, while calcium causes the muscle to be able to perform a power stroke. By increasing the amount of sodium ions available a neuron should be able to depolarize much more rapidly and send an action potential. The species that we used in this study was Rania pipien frogs. The hypothesis was that when there is an increase in the amount of sodium ions then there will be an increase in the amplitude of the gastrocnemus contraction. There was no significent difference between the amplitude of the gastrocnemus which had been injected with sodium ions. One possible reason for this is that we inject the sodium into the muscle instead of the nerve.

Introduction:
While both hormones and neurons allow for communication through an entire organism, neurons are uniquely found within animals and are much faster, requiring only milliseconds to work compared to hormones which can take seconds to days to work. Skeletal muscles allow for voluntary movement and are innervated with motor neurons which branch out to form neuromuscular junctions. A neuron will stimulate a muscle contraction through an excitatory process that starts with an action potential. The action potential depolarizes the cell which causes a release of acetylcholine (ACh) at the presynaptic nerve terminal. The ACh then binds to a receptor on the muscular fiber which allows for the sodium channels to open up. This action potential is regulated by the intracellular and extracellular concentration of sodium and potassium ions [Juel: 1986].The action potential created by these sodium channels allows for calcium to enter the cell which activates the contractile mechanism of a muscle fiber. In return the myosin heads move which causes the myofiber to shorten. Through the use of the reuptake of calcium the muscle is able to relax once again. It is difficult to measure these microscopic processes, however we can still monitor motor muscles tension at a cellular level through the use of a myogram which uses a muscle force transducer to measure the amount of force generated over time. The force transducer transfers the muscle tension in an electrical signal which is amplified through the use of a computer and a myogram. On a single myogram there are three stages which include: the latent period, the contraction period, and the relaxation period. The latent period is an extremely short period of time between the stimulus and contraction usually only lasting ten milliseconds. The contraction period is when the muscles shorten because of chemical changes within the individual fibers. The relaxation period occurs after the maximum contraction point has been reached and the muscle returns to its normal relaxed length. It takes hundreds of motor units that make up neurons and muscles to create a muscle contraction. A motor unit itself is a single motor axon combined with all the myofibers at the neuromuscular junction. Dantrolene sodium ions have been shown to influence these muscle twitches in skeletal muscles which are used for movement [Ellis: 1972]. When an action potential is sent through the motor axon all the myofibers contract the muscle together. The force that the myofibers generate tend to vary so in order to increase the tension of the contraction there must be an increased number of motor units which can be stimulated through summation. There are two forms of summation. Temporal summation is when an axon is stimulated several times within a few milliseconds of one another while spatial summation is when there is an increased number of axons. These summations lead to the twitches combining which allows for the muscle to produce maximum force which is known as tetanus. A motor unit can not last forever and will eventually stop because of a lack of ATP. This lack of ATP is known as fatigue in which the motor unit returns to a relaxed state at the resting position and will be unable to fire for a while. Our hypothesis is that when there is an increase in the amount of sodium ions then there will be an increase in the amplitude of the gastrocnemus contraction. 


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipien legs were selected and dissected. We prepared the Rania pipiens legs by pulling back the skin and gently separating the inner thigh muscles away from the nerve, while also trying not to damage the nerve in the dissection pan. Next we tied a string from the portion of the Achilles tendon to the force transducer while pinning the Rania pipiens leg down and making sure that the string was taught. Then we inserted the electrode probe into the muscle of the Rania pipiens leg. Throughout the experiment we kept all three of the Rania pipien legs moist with Amphibian Ringer’s solution. In LabScribe we set the stimulus parameters in the stimulator controll panel to: (Pulus: 1, F (Hz): 50, W (ms): 5). Next we applied different voltages of electricity to the Rania pipiens leg starting at 0.0 volts in order to determine the threshold voltage of the leg and then making our way up to 5.0 volts. After each voltage was sent to the leg we measured the amplitude of the leg in millivolts.We applied the different voltage of ecotory to the leg one whole time to serve as a controll group then we used a sharp to inject the leg with 0.1 Ml of sodium at a contraction of 200 mM and waited one minute and repeated the same voltages with the leg now with sodium. The statistical test that we used was a paired t test which was used in order to determine if an injection of sodium into the muscle would cause the Rania pipiens legs to produce a stronger amplitude.

Results:
The standard deviation for the amplitude of the controll group at 5.0 volts was 0.018 and the mean amplitude of the controll group at 5.0 volts was 1.526 millivolts. The standard deviation for the amplitude of the experimental group at 5.0 volts was 0.03 and the mean amplitude of the experimental group at 5.0 volts was 1.416 millivolts. We used a paired t test to analyze our results. The amplitudes of the controll group at 5.0 volts was statistically different from the amplitudes of the experimental group at 5.0 volts (t-sat: 4.928942, d.f.: 2, P: 0.038783). It is important to note that this significent difference was not observed until we reached 5.0 volts. All other volts at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 did not show a significent difference (Figure 1). The amplitudes of the controll group at 4.0 volts was not statistically different from the amplitudes of the experimental group at 4.0 volts (t-sat: 3.71994, d.f.: 2, P: 0.06527). Based on this paired t_test across several voltages there is an overall no significent difference between the amplitudes of the controll group and the amplitudes of the experimental group.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that when there is an increase in the amount of sodium ions then there will be an increase in the amplitude of the gastrocnemus contraction was not supported. We did not observe a significent difference, suggesting that sodium does not cause there to be an increase in the amplitude of a muscle. A biological reason for this is that the sodium was injected into the muscle which does not need sodium to work, but instead calcium. Sodium transmits the signal down the neuron and to the neuromuscular junction which in turn causes the t-tubules to open which allow for calcium to enter the cell and cause a conformational change in the myofibers. It is important to note that the axonal sodium ion channel kinetics are important for the lower activation threshold of an action potential, but are not entirely dependent on the sodium ion channel subtype [Katz: 2018]. Another biological reason for this is that we could have injected the sodium into the inside portion of the cell. This would cause the inside of the cell to become more hyperpolarized which in turn would have it harder for the cell to depolarize and an action potential to be sent. The sodium voltage gated channels allow for the regulation of sodium inside the cell by being either open, closed, or inactivated which can be regulated by drugs, but in this case possible by inserting sodium into the cell [Lenaeus]. A future study could be related to the addition of calcium which could would connect back to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the power stroke of the muscle. The addition of calcium could increase the amplitude of the gastrocnemus contraction.
