Title: The Characterization of Root : Shoot Ratio of Vigna radiata in Differing Light Conditions

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to compare root to shoot ratios in shady conditions versus full sunlight conditions of Vigna radiata. R:S is a useful number in determining energy allocation within plants. The more energy allocated to a specific part of a plant, the larger it will be. After watering Vigna radiata for two weeks in the varying conditions of shade and direct sunlight, the root : shoot ratios were determined for both height and weight of root/shoots. The average R:S of sunlight and shade were compared. It was hypothesized that plants in direct sunlight would have a larger root : shoot (R:S) ratio than the plants in the shady condition. It was concluded that the R:S ratios of Vigna radiata in direct sunlight are larger than R:S ratios in shade. This is due to the fact that change in lighting conditions affects photosynthesis which plays a large role in energy allocation within a plant.

Introduction:
Plants adapt according to biotic and abiotic factors. Adaptation occurs due to resource limitations acting as a directionally selective force. Plant leaves and stems (shoots) are the location that source carbon compounds derived from photosynthesis [Kannan: 1980], while the roots, below ground, take up water and other essential nutrients including Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Calcium, among others [Mengel: 1978]. The biochemical systems responsible for root : shoot ratio are photosynthetic and nitrogen rates within the plant [Agren: 1987]. In this experiment, mung beans (Vigna radiata) were used. The independent variables are the amount of water and soil conditions, while the dependent variable is the amount of sunlight the plant receives based off its location: shady or sunny. More sunlight will mean less need for large leaves above ground for photosynthesis, since they will not need as large of a surface area due to the direct, high, intensity of sunlight. In turn, more resources for these plants will be allocated to the roots, as soil will dry faster, creating larger roots to dig deeper for the water and soil nutrients. Therefore, it was expected that the plants in the sun will have a larger root : shoot ratio, than the plants in the shade. This would mean the plants in the sun will have larger roots and smaller shoots.

Materials and Methods:
A large amount of mung bean (Vigna radiata) were soaked in water for twenty-four hours. Four pots about 6”x6” were obtained. The pots were filled to the top with vermiculite. They were pre-watered, and six holes were poked into the soil of each pot. Two mung bean seeds were put into each hole. Next, 50 mL of miracle grow was poured into each pot. The pots were taken to the greenhouse and two pots were put in a direct sunlight treatment, while the other two pots were put in the shaded webbed cage treatment. For the next two weeks, each pot was watered with 100mL of water daily. After the two weeks were over, the plants were brought back into the laboratory, rinsed off from soil and six plants from each pot were taken out. They were cut at the point where the stem went from red to green and the weight (grams) and length of each segment was measured and recorded. The R:S values were calculated, and a two-sample unpaired t-value test was used to determine significance and compare data. Overall, the R:S average values of weight and length in the shady setting were compared to the R:S average values of weight and length in the sunny setting.

Results:
Overall, the R:S ratios matched the observations that the plants in the sunny conditions appeared to have smaller leaf/stem structures and larger root structure than the plants in the shady conditions. There was no alteration in color between the two groupings. The R:S ratios matched this observation. Figure 1 illustrates that the average R:S ratio of weight for plants in the sun was 0.931+/-0.162, while the average R:S ratio of weight for plants in the shade was 0.744+/-0.141. The mean R:S ratio of weight was statistically significant (t stat = 3.028, df = 22, P = 0.006174). The average R:S ratio of height for plants in the sun was 1.33+/-0.386 while the average R:S ratio of height for plants in the shade was 0.856+/-0.232. The mean R:S ratio of length was statistically significant (t stat = 3.61, df = 22, P = 0.00156).

Discussion:
The results of this lab support the hypothesis. The summarized data in Figure 1. shows that the R : S ratio is larger in sunny conditions in terms of both height and weight. This means that roots are larger, and shoots are smaller on average in sunny conditions than in shady conditions. A possible explanation of this result is that more energy is being allocated to root production in sunlight because it is easier to get sunlight for photosynthesis in direct sunlight [Walter: 20006]. Since it is easier to get sunlight due to the higher intensity, less surface area of leaves and stems are necessary creating smaller shoots. Meanwhile, it is harder to get water from the soil in sunlight as it dries quickly, meaning roots must extend deeper into the soil. This is further supported by previous studies of R:S ratio. The R:S ratio has been found to be a linear regression depending on nitrogen concentration which is dependent on photosynthetic rates [Agren: 1987]. Additionally, the p-values for both weight and length are accepted. Overall, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternate hypothesis is supported.
