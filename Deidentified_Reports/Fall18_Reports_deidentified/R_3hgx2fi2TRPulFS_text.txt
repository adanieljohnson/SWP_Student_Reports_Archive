Title: The Effects of Azaguard on the Life Cycle of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Ecdysone is already an impactful and important hormone in the lifecycle of the Manduca sexta, and given this, we wanted to test the impact it could have on the Manduca sexta and its life cycle if given in a separate dosage in Azaguard. We produced an experiment with 8 Manduca sexta: 4 in a controll group that were given caterpillar food with 5 drops of water and 4 in an experimental group that were given caterpillar food with 5 drops of Azaguard in it. These groups were necessary for a comparison between an unaffected lifecycle and one impacted by Azaguard. This was important due to the fact that this experiment would show whether or not giving Azaguard to the Manduca sexta would speed up its life cycle or not, which could be beneficial in other experiments that have a time limit on its research and could benefit from the sped up lifecycle. Our findings were inconclusive, given that the four caterpillars in the experimental group died, but we did notice a significent difference in the weight gain and loss between our controll and experimental groups, and no significent difference with the lengths. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta was the caterpillar that we utilized in our study, which was supposed to go through a life cycle that will transform it into a moth. This life cycle occurs in a cycle of phases where the Manduca sexta goes through various molting phases due to the hormones that are pulsing through its body as it develops. We wanted test to see if ecdysone would impact that life cycle when given through food to the Manduca sexta. Azaguard was a hormone used in our experiment containing ecdysone and was supposed to speed up the molting and pupate stage of the Manduca sexta. We expected it to speed up the molting and pupate stage of the Manduca sexta due to the fact that ecdysone assists in molting in general, so if given in a bigger amount, we believed it would help them go through molting faster. However, other hormones containing ecdysone had been shown to not have an impact on the molting or development of other insects, which was what made this a beneficial experiment to test out to see if the hormone had varying impacts based on insects it was used on [Carlisle: 1968]. It approximately takes 5 days from their 5th instar larvae to reach the molting and pupate stage without the extra help of a hormone, so in this experiment, we attempted to see if the extra hormone help impacted its lifecycle. We had reason to believe that with the combination of the juvenile hormone that naturally appears in its life cycle that the Azaguard would successfully speed up the first few stages of its life cycle to help reach that final stage where the juvenile hormone spikes and causes that final transition into the adult stage for the Manduca sexta. 
Hypothesis: If given Azaguard, the Manduca sextas will begin molting and will reach the pupate stage faster than without Azaguard. 

Materials and Method:
We had 8 caterpillars. 4 belonged to our controll group, which were given 10 g each of caterpillar food with 5 drops of water in the food. 4 belonged to our experimental group, and were given 10 g of caterpillar food with 5 drops of Azaguard in the food each. 
The dependent variable of our experiment was how long it took to go through the cycle and the independent variable was the food given with water or with the hormone. 
The caterpillars were all in boxes with holes for breathing, containing the same living conditions for both the controll group and treatment group. They were kept in an incubator at 28 degrees Celsius. We measured the lengths and weights of the caterpillar everyday possible and replaced the food when it was either out or dry. We also made observations of which caterpillar is in what phase daily and other observations such as color, size change, amount of movement, and amount of waste produced. The type of test we used for our experiment  to determine its significance was a paired t test. 


Results:
Our paired t test was used to see if there was a difference between our two populations: our controll and experimental groups, in regards to whether or not the hormone impacted their life cycle. There was a significent difference in the weight between the controll and experimental groups and no significent difference in the lengths between the controll and experimental groups, meaning that the hormone indeed had an impact on some factors of the caterpillars life cycle, though it was inconclusive as to whether it had a direct impact with the length of the life cycle.  Our controll group gained weight and length as they were supposed to due to the fact that they were on a normal diet and had no outside factors to interfere with their normal life cycle. Our experimental group lost weight and length during the experiment due to the fact that the Azaguard had the opposite effect that we expected it to have and caused the Manduca sexta to die faster without making it through their whole life cycle. Our p value for our weights was 0.0027 and the standard deviation was 0.970. Our  p value for our lengths was 0.265 and the standard deviation was 0.737. 


Discussion:
We had originally believed that Azaguard would impact the life cycle by speeding it up due to the fact that ecdysone assists in the molting phases of the Manduca sexta, but the complete opposite happened with our experimental group. Our hypothesis was not supported and was inconclusive because the experimental group did not make it through its life cycle at all, dying before the pupate phase, and we were unable to prove that they would have molted any faster with the Azaguard than without it. In other findings, scientists used a different hormone called Braken, that also contained ecdysone, and they tested the use of Braken on the desert locust to see how it would impact its molting. Quite like with our experiment, they saw no change in the speed of the molting and development of the desert locust [Carlisle: 1968]. In conclusion, our group determined that Azaguard impacts the caterpillar in a way that slowly kills them when given in high dosages. They began just as our controll group did and also ate the same amount of food as our controll group at first, but eventually, they quit eating, quit moving, and died off, thus disproving our hypothesis of Azaguard speeding up their life cycle. Some possible errors in our experiment may include incorrect measurements being taken, food not properly being distributed to the caterpillars, and improper care of the caterpillars. Some future studies that may be performed to further test this hypothesis would be to restructure this experiment and give the Azaguard in different dosages to caterpillars and have a better structured schedule to check up on the caterpillars, thus getting better data and results to see if certain amounts of Azaguard makes a difference in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. As for our final results, the fact that there was a difference in the lengths and weights between our experimental and controll group leads us to believe that Azaguard does have an impact on them. This finding could be beneficial due to the fact that the Manduca sexta is an invasive species and if the species ever gets out of controll in regards to its population, Azaguard and similar substances with ecdysone in it could assist in population controll of the Manduca sexta.
