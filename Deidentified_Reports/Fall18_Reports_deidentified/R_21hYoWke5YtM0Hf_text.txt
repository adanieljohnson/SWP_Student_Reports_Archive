Title: The effect of dibutyl-cAMP and curcumin on the Physarum polycephalum reaction to the light source

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a micro-organism that able to change the number of chromosome and DNA. Though it doesn’t have a complete nervous system, it exhibits intelligent behaviors similar to those seem in eusocial insects like bees and ants. Because of its directed movement which enables the efficient express desired data through a certain routine, Physarum polycephalum has huge potential in the computer science domain to create a faster rate of signal transmitting. In this experiment, two chemicals, dibutyl-cAMP and curcumin that may influence the signal transmitting cAMP pathway are added to the environment to see how the Physarum polycephalum would differ its reaction to light. From the data got from the experiment, the experiment groups which are chemicals added doesn’t have a significent directional movement towards or away from the light, and the paired t_test also shows that there is no significent difference between the controll groups and the experiment group. It rejects the initial hypothesis that the curcumin and dibutyl-Camp would prevent and activate the reaction of Physarum polycephalum towards or away from the light. However, this may also cause by the difference of movement direction to the light between a large colony of Physarum and a small one.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a micro-organism that belongs to multinucleate syncytium organism division, it has been shown to contain nuclei of varying chromosome number and DNA. [Adler 1974] The interesting fact attracts lots of scientists keep learning and discovering on Physarum polycephalum is that though it doesn’t have a complete nervous system, it exhibits intelligent behaviors similar to those seen in eusocial insects like bees and ants. [Johnson, 2018] Physarum polycephalum searches the food then retracts from everywhere in the maze, expect the shortest route connecting the two food resources. It could be widely used in the computational domain, because it moves in a directed way what could efficiently express desired data through a certain routine, thus form rules-based logical gates. [Johnson, 2018] One question could be raised that how does the Physarum polycephalum move, and how the signals path through the cells? Three major movement ways are the G-protein coupled receptors, the cAMP-mediated path, and the IP3-mediated pathway. [Knowles, 1978] Protein Kinase A is an important enzyme that involved in the cAMP pathway. It helps activate or silence the other enzymes that are essential for signal transport in Physarum polycephalum. So, we started with the question that how would the addition of dibutyl-cAMP, which is an activator of protein-kinase-A influence the movement of the Physarum polycephalum towards the light. As a comparison, the deactivator of protein kinase A: curcumin was added to show the change in the movement of the organism towards or against the light. The hypothesis of this experiment is that dibutyl-cAMP increases the amount of movement of Physarum polycephalum towards the light, while the curcumin prevents the movement towards the light. 

Materials and Method:
Took nine potato-water agar plates, and cut one square in the middle of the plate while drew a line separates the plate into two on the bottom side of the plate. Diluted the dibutyl-cAMP and curcumin solution from 20x into 1x by adding 19 Ml of water into 1Ml of the solution. Gently poured 5 Ml of the diluted dibutyl solution on the surface of plate 4-7, diluted curcumin solution on the surface of plate 8-10. No solution was poured onto the controll group plates. Waited for 10 minutes until the solutions were fully absorbed by the plate. Used the spatula to cut one square in the middle of the plate. Put in the exact same square of Physarum polycephalum into the cut square. Used the foil paper to cover the whole plate, and cut a little hole to let the light pass through. Placed all the plated into the light incubator, and waited for 24 hours. After 24 hours, took the plates out and record their directional movement towards or against the light, and the distance they traveled.

Results:
The Control group has an average migration direction opposite to the light and has an average distance of 4mm, while for the cAMP group, it moves towards the light, and move averagely 5mm. For the curcumin group, it averagely moves away from the light for about 3.33 mm. 

Three paired t_tests are used between each of the two groups in the experiment. The t_test between the cAMP group and curcumin group has a result of p_value equals to 0.687, while the p_value for comparing the cAMP and the controll group is 0.8152, and the p_value by comparing the curcumin and controll group is 0.839. All of the three p_values are larger than 0.05, which means that all of the three t_tests suggest that there are no significent differences between these three groups. 


Discussion:
In the controll group, the direction of the Physarum polycephalum movement is away from the light source, and the distance traveled is 4mm. When cAMP was added to the system, the migration was towards the direction of light. It moves 5mm in average towards the light. For the curcumin group of the experiment, Physarum Polycephalum moved against the light, and on average, it moved 3.33 mm away from the light source. However, when viewing the error bar of the experiment, which is ± 1 standard deviation, the three error bars overlap with each other. The overlapping indicates that there is no significent difference between the two experimental groups and the controll group. Since both of the t_tests show a p_value larger than 0.05, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no significent difference between the experimental group and controll group. So, both of the groups have the result of no significent correlation between the light direction and the movement direction. This doesn’t fit our hypothesis that cAMP would activate the signaling system, while the curcumin would prevent the signaling system. We expected that the dibutyl-cAMP group should display an obvious increment in the movement towards the light, while the curcumin group should show an obvious movement of the colony less towards to the light. But the result from the actual experiment didn’t show the expected result. This may because of the individual difference between groups of microorganisms, since a larger group of Physarum polycephalum reacts differently to light compared to a smaller group, and it’s hard to distinguish whether the amount of Physarum Polycephalum considers as large or small group. As a result, the direction movement even if without chemicals influencing may differ from one to another in the experimental groups. This may lead to the uncertainty of the movement direction of the Physarum Polycephalum in the experiment. The further experiment could be done on the effect of these chemicals on their movement towards food sources, and other chemicals that influence other signaling pathways as well.
