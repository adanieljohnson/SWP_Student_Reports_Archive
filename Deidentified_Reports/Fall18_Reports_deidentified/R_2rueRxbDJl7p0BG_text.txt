Title: The phenotypic change of oilseed radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) in presence of herbivore. 

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an essential strategy that plants evolved to adapt to the different environmental condition. The adaptation shown as the phenotypic variation in plants. This experiment was mainly focused on the root to shoot ratio of oilseed radish (Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) plant treated with and without herbivore. I hypothesized that the plants treated with herbivore would have a lower R:S ratio. The one-tailed two-sample t-test was adapted to test the significant difference between the two group. The data showed no significant difference in both length and weight of R:S ratio, suggesting that herbivory has no effect on plants’ resource allocation strategy. This is probably due to the insufficient growing period of the plants. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of herbivore on plant’s resource allocation. Herbivory is a form of consumption in which an organism principally eats autotrophs such as plants, algae and photosynthesising bacteria [Abraham: 2006]. Herbivory can have substantial impacts on habitat health, structure, the productivity of plants. Low-level herbivory may remove ageing roots and leaves, initiating new growth of young roots and shoots, therefore, increase the nutrient uptake and production by plants [Bonkowski: 2004]. Resource allocation is the ability of a plant to adjust its growth in the different environment, which can be shown as the root to shoot ratio. The plants grow in the arid area will tend to develop longer root than the plants grow in the tropical forest, therefore a larger root: shoot ratio. A more extended root system allows plants to grow in arid area absorb nutrient from the deeper soil. Thus plants will allocate more resource on root development. Plants change its root: shoot ratio through two hormones: Auxin and cytokinin. The pioneering work has shown that a high auxin/cytokinin ratio induces root regeneration, whereas a low ratio promotes shoot induction [Miller: 1957]. This experiment evaluates the influence of herbivore on the resource allocation of the plant. This experiment treats one group of oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) with herbivore and one without. Oilseed radish is chosen due to its relative short seedling time. Under favourable conditions, oilseed radish seedlings can emerge as soon as three days after planting, and provide full canopy cover to shade out weeds in 3-4 weeks [Weil: 2006]. It was hypothesised that the plant treated with herbivore would have smaller R:S ratio than those not treated with herbivores. Since plants treated with herbivore will have less leaf area, therefore, less photosynthesis occur to provide a sufficient amount of energy allocate for growth in the root system.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment had chosen oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) as the experimental subject. There were two groups in the experiment, one controlled group and one treated with herbivore. For each group, there were 4 replicates and 5 seeds were planted in one pod separately. In total, 40 plants were measured. The seeds were soaked 30 minutes before planting, then filled the pots to top with vermiculite. Water and mir gro(50ml) were added to each pot after planting. The plant were watered daily until at least 3 branched leaves appeared, then the leaves were cut 1/3 by nail clipper to simulate the effect of herbivore. The plants were grown for another three days to allow the change in root to shoot ratio in the response of presence of herbivore. Then, plants were harvested, washed and dried off. The roots were separated from the shoot at the conjunction part. Both length and weight were recorded. The one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to determine the significant difference in the average length and weight of plants’ R:S ratio. 

Results:
The mean root: shoot ratio for the mass of control plants was 0.44 and the mean root: shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.4375 (Fig.1). The mean root: shoot ratio for length in the control plants was 0.72 and the mean root: shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.7525 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for mass in the control plants was 0.0447, and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.0286 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for length in control plants was 0.0908, and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.1264 (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the length control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the length experimental group (t-stat = 0.3617, df = 26, P = 0.7299). The mean of the weight control group was also not statistically significantly different than that of the weight experimental group (t-stat = 0.8119, df= 6, P = 0.4479). When observing the plants on the final day, there was not much visible difference. They appeared to be around the same height. Also, the leaves of both the experimental and the control plants had the same luminosity and green colour. As a result of this experiment, both the control and experimental plants had around the same length and weight (Fig.1). Overall, the control and the experimental plants had the same pattern of growth.




Discussion:
The hypothesis that the plants treated with herbivores would have smaller R:S ratio than those not treated with herbivores was not supported. Based on the data, there are no relations between herbivory and plants’ resource allocation pattern. However, the past experiment suggests that there is a “significant negative relationship between herbivory and carbon allocated to root” [Holland: 1996] It is possible that there are huge systematic and random errors. First, the plants might need a longer time to have the response to the leave lost. Instead of record the data 3 days after we clipped the leaves, we should allow a longer period for the plant to have the response. Also, we didn’t distinguish the size of leaves and applied a unified standard on the number of leaves been cut. This could explain that the plant still has enough amount of photosynthetic rate to provide enough chemical energy. The amount of energy lost is not significant enough for plants to change its resource allocation. Therefore, the R:S ratio didn’t have a significant difference. Besides, new shoots were observed after we cut the leaves. It is possible that the plant could regulate the shoot development to compensate for the leave lost. Instead of measure the R:S ratio to represent the energy allocation of the plant, using C-14 carbon dioxide to trace the carbon allocation of plants is a more direct way to show the relations. Isotope-labeling is a technique to track radioactive isotopes in the metabolism pathway [Matthew: 2011]. As plant take in C-14 CO2 to carry out photosynthesis, the glucose synthesised will also carry traceable C-14 isotopes. By using the mass spectroscopy, we could examine the percentage abundance of C-14 in particular area of the plant.
