Title: The Effects of pH on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a cellular process that involves the harnessing of excitatory energy from light to power the production of glucose, water, and oxygen crucial to the sustenance of all lifeforms on Earth. In this experiment, attempting to discover how different pH environments affect the rate of photosynthesis via interactions with the proton gradient in the electron transport chain of chloroplasts, we hypothesized that the highest rate of photosynthesis would occur at a pH of 6.5. The procedure for this experiment involved the creation of a suspension enriched with chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea leaves, splitting the enriched chloroplast suspension into 3 different treatment groups that each received a different pH buffer (either pH 4, 6.5, or 10), and quantifying the different photosynthetic rates via spectrophotometric analysis of the reduction of DCIP in all samples (Hill’s reaction). The results of the experiment showed the greatest, statistically-significant decrease in spectrophotometric absorption over time in the pH 6.5 group samples, confirming our initial hypothesis. Our results also shed light onto the web of relationships between pH, redox reactions, electron carriers, the electrochemical proton gradient, and the rate of photosynthesis.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a cellular process fundamental to the survival of all living organisms. In photosynthesis, plants and certain organisms utilize solar radiation to synthesize crucial nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. The photosynthetic reaction equation is 6CO2 + 12H20 -&gt; C6H12O6 + 6O2. In the photosynthetic model, light is absorbed by antenna pigments and the excitation energy received from light photons is transferred to the reaction centers of the two photosystems located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. This drives photochemical reactions that spur photosynthetic energy conversion [Krause: 1991]. Via multiple oxidation-reduction reactions, high energy electrons flow through an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to the next, powering individual complexes to pump protons (H+ ions) across the thylakoid membrane and create a proton gradient between the thylakoid space and the stroma. Protons are taken up from the outside during the reduction of plastoquinone (an electron acceptor) in Photosystem II, and upon oxidation of plasto-hydroquinone, inside protons are released [Trebst: 1974]. The subsequent movement of protons down this concentration gradient is the driving force for ATP Synthase, an enzyme that produces the energy storage molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The production of ATP later facilitates carbohydrate (a necessary nutrient) synthesis in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of the chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membrane. It is imperative to understand environmental factors that have the capability of altering the rate or extent of photosynthesis, as it sustains life on Earth. With an experimental objective of achieving an understanding of how photosynthesis is affected by varying pH environments (varying H+ ion concentrations), we specifically focused on pH’s either inhibitory or promoting effects on the function of the proton gradient in the electron transport chain. Our model organism was the Spinacia oleracea (spinach) leaf - cheap, readily available, and known to contain high numbers of chloroplasts. We hypothesized that the greatest statistically significant difference in the rate of photosynthesis (as seen through the greatest reduction of spectrophotometric absorbance) in spinach leaves will occur in a pH 6.5 buffer, in comparison to those in pH 4 and pH 10 buffers.


Materials and Methods:
The general plan of the experiment was to use enriched chloroplast suspensions, obtained from differential centrifugation, in three parallel experimental series (one with pH 4 buffer, one with pH 6.5 buffer, and one with pH 10 buffer) for spectrophotometric photolysis (Hill reaction) analysis. Preparing the Chloroplasts: For this part of the experiment we used Spinacia oleracea leaves, a container of crushed ice, a mortar and pestle, 150-250mL beakers, 50 mL centrifuge tubes, 400 mM Sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8.0 (this will be referred to as “grinding buffer”), cheesecloth, and a RT-7 centrifuge.  We began the procedure by packing a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes into the crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves. We threw away the veins and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water (also blotting off any excess moisture from the leaves). When the mortar and pestle were chilled, the leaves were added. 10 ml of the cold grinding buffer was then added, and the mixture was ground into a thick paste without any visible chunks. Another 10ml of grinding buffer was added. The entire volume of the solution was then strained through a triple-folded piece of cheesecloth into a 50-ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun at 200 G’s (200 times the force of gravity) and 1200 rmp in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4°C. Balance tubes were placed into the centrifuge before every centrifugation throughout the experiment. Post centrifugation, the supernatant of “A” was transferred into another chilled 50-ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. The pellet was left at the bottom of “A”. The chloroplast suspension “B” was then centrifuged at 1000 G’s, 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 mins at 4°C. The supernatant of “B” was poured into a 50ml tube “C”. With the pellet remaining, “B” was placed on ice. 15 ml of grinding buffer was added to “B” and the pellet was suspended with a transfer pipet. Increments of 5ml of the suspended “B” pellet were poured into test tubes labeled pH 4, 6.5, and 10. Then 5 ml of the corresponding pH buffers were added into each tube and 10 mins were allowed before centrifugation. All three supernatants were disposed of, and another 5ml of grinding buffer was added to each tube. Obtaining Absorbance Data: For this part of the experiment we used the enriched chloroplast suspension from the aforementioned experimental procedure, 13 large test tubes, distilled water, 130 mM 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol or “DCIP” (an alternative electron acceptor), 100 mM phosphate at pH 6.5 (this will be referred to as “reaction buffer”), the same “grinding buffer” from before, spectrophotometer cuvettes, and a spectrophotometer set to 600nm, the optimal setting for DCIP light absorbance. We began by labeling 13 large test tubes - 1 blank tube, 3 tubes with chloroplasts at pH 6.5, 3 with chloroplasts at pH 4, 3 with chloroplasts at pH 10, and 3 with no chloroplasts. 8 ml of distilled water was added to the blank, all other tubes receiving 6ml. 2 ml of 130 mM DCIP was added to all tubes, except for the blank. Finally, 2ml of the reaction buffer was added to all 13 tubes. When we were ready to begin the actual assay, 100 μl of the enriched chloroplast suspension was added to the tubes 1 – 9 and the blank. We removed the 3 tubes from the centrifuge, disposed of the supernatants, and added 5 ml of grinding buffer to each tube. 100 µl of the pH 6.5 chloroplast mixture was added to the first three tubes, tubes 4-6 received 100 µl of the pH 4 mixture, and tubes 7-10 received 100 µl of the pH 10 mixture. Each tube was immediately mixed and all contents were transferred to spectrophotometric cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was blanked at 600nm using Tube 0. All absorbances were then measured as fast as possible to obtain the “Time 0mins” absorbance data, then placed onto a sunny windowsill for 10 mins and measured again (Tube 0 once again used to blank the spectrophotometer) for “Time 10 mins” data. The absorbance values of every cuvette were recorded.  Statistical Testing   The statistical significance of our results was measured via a two-tailed t-test, comparing the absorbance means of all “Time 0” groups (pH4, pH 6.5, and pH10) to their respective “Time 10” group means. We chose the two-tailed t-test because it would allow us to determine whether a group's observed reduction in average spectrophotometric absorbance was statistically significant.


Results:
In order to find out what specific pH environments negatively or positively affected photosynthesis, we compared average spectrophotometric absorbances of each experimental group after allowing the Hill reaction to take place in enriched chloroplast suspensions containing three different pH buffers. In comparison to pH 4, pH 10, and the samples without any chloroplasts whatsoever, the pH 6.5 samples demonstrated the most extreme reduction in average absorbance from Time 0 to Time 10 (see Figure 1). The average absorbance for the pH 6.5 samples, the mean of the absorption differences of 3 replicates decreased by 0.189 (p – 0.004, t – 5.292, df – 4, Fig. 1). The pH 4 samples showed the next largest difference in absorbance with an average difference of 0.052 between Time 0 and Time 10 (p – 0.006, t – 5.202, df – 4, Fig. 1). Of all the samples tested (including those without chloroplasts), those at pH 10 showed the least difference in absorbance, a change of only 0.001 between its samples' means at Time 0 and Time 10 (p – 0.819, t – 0.24, df – 4, Fig. 1). The difference of 0.024 between average absorbances at Time 0 and Time 10 for the samples without chloroplasts also proved to be statistically significant (p – 0.016, t – 3.95, df – 4, Fig. 1). Figure 1 shows a line graph quantifying the changes observed in photosynthetic rates of all experimental groups as a function of absorbance at 600nm vs. time passed in minutes. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis included the pH 6.5 samples undergoing photosynthesis at a much faster rate than all other samples. We initially arrived at this hypothesis based on the thought that a pH of 6.5 was the closest one to a neutral pH of 7 and that photosynthetic plants do not tend to grow in highly acidic or highly basic environments. Our results supported our hypothesis by demonstrating that the greatest drop in spectrophotometric absorbance after 10 mins of running the photosynthetic Hill reaction did in fact occur in the samples with a buffer of pH of 6.5, proving to be statistically significant via two-tailed t-test application, and allowing us to reject the null hypothesis for this experiment. The pH environment of 6.5 was indeed the most optimal out of the three (4, 6.5, and 10) and facilitated the fastest rate of photosynthesis.   An observed inconsistency in our results was the greater decrease in average absorption in samples without chloroplasts than the decrease in samples in the pH 10 buffer. This can mean that either some substance in the “no chloroplast” tubes entirely unrelated to chloroplasts still created a statistically significant reducing effect on DCIP or that the high pH of 10 possibly caused the denaturation of enzymatic machinery crucial to photosynthesis, like ATP Synthase or Rubisco, for example.  A major factor in achieving our experimental findings was the fact that DCIP can be effectively reduced by the photosynthetic electron transport chain in chloroplasts, specifically by the reducing agents produced by the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. Instead of reducing NADP+ (the final electron acceptor in photosynthesis), DCIP can become reduced and produce an observable change in color from its oxidized state of blue towards a more translucent, clear. This change in color facilitates an increased level of light transmittance (or as we saw in our data – a decreased level of light absorbance) which we quantified via spectrophotometer. The greatest drop in absorbance seen at pH 6.5, hence equates to the greatest reduction of DCIP. The greatest extent of reduction of DCIP would imply that more high energy electrons make it through the transport chain, which positively correlates with the rate of the pumping of free protons from water across the thylakoid membrane and the creation of the proton gradient. In a study of the electron transport chain in Helicobacter pylori bacteria, the “proton motive force” is defined as the electrochemical gradient for protons across the plasma membrane and is calculated as follows: PMF = -61ΔpH + PD, where PD stands for the transmembrane potential difference. This equation underlines the importance of pH as a variable in the establishment of an electrochemical gradient and that ATP synthesis crucial to the completion of photosynthesis fails to occur without a large enough PMF [Meyer- Rosberg: 1996].   If further study were possible, conducting a similar experiment (still utilizing the Hill reaction) with a focus on the role of enzymatic activity would be of interest; particularly the effects of total inhibition of individual enzymes on the rate of photosynthesis.
