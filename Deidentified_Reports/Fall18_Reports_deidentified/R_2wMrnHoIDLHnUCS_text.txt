Title: The Compared Effects of DCMU and Vinegar on the Inhibition of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
In this experiment, we examined the process of photosynthesis in plant cells and how it can be affected by photosynthetic inhibitors. We used knowledge of the Hill Reaction to examine plant chloroplasts in the presence of herbicides. The plant we chose to study was spinach, or Spinacia oleracea. The two herbicides used were a well-known photosynthetic inhibitor DCMU which has been found to be light-dependent, and vinegar which has an acetic acid concentration high enough that it can be used as an herbicide. Our team hypothesized that both herbicides will function as photosynthetic inhibitors, however the DCMU will display a higher photosynthetic controll. The results attained through this experiment were found to be inconclusive in regards to the study’s main objective. The photosynthesis did show significent inhibition in the presence of DCMU and showed some but less inhibition in the presence of vinegar. However, the experimental group that had vinegar added to it also underwent an unexpected redox reaction with the DCPIP, causing unexpected effects on the results. 

Introduction:
Plants attain most of their energy from the process of photosynthesis. This energy is stored and later released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm of the cell. Respiration can then occur in the mitochondria. [Makino: 2009.] Mechanistically, photosynthesis works as electrons pass through an electron transport chain and the excitement of electrons causes the cleavage of water molecules, thus generating a proton gradient that allows for the synthesis of ATP. [Makino: 2009.] This electron transfer in the chloroplast can be affected by certain inhibitors, or chemicals, that inhibit the process of photosynthesis. [Ridley: 1977] A well-known example of such an inhibitor is DCMU. Studies have shown how chlorophyll has been found to be destroyed in various plant chloroplasts if placed under light while in the presence of DCMU [Ridley: 1977] According to studies such as that of Dan Hess from the Affymax Research Institute, photosynthesis is inhibited when the plant is in the presence because some chemicals such as DCMU act as light-dependent herbicides that only inhibit the flow of electrons in the cell when they are in the presence of light. [Hess: 2000] Due to the observations that studies such as these have made, this group decided to test how effectively other herbicides inhibit photosynthesis in plants. For this reason, we decided to use household vinegar, a common herbicide due to its high content of acetic acid, as a variable to compare to DCMU in regards to inhibition on a plant’s photosynthesis. Past research has shown to support the Hill Reaction of chloroplasts, a finding that suggested that if chloroplasts from plants are isolated and placed under light they will still be able to release oxygen. [Park: 1965]  For example, a study conducted by Sauer and Park in 1965 used spinach leaves as the plant to be tested in an assay of the Hill Reaction of chloroplasts and found it to show effective results. [Park: 1965] Due to our findings from past research, this group decided to compare the effect that two light-dependent herbicides will have on the hill reaction of chloroplasts from spinach leaves. We hypothesize that if we compare the effects on the photosynthetic rate of the plants, the vinegar will function as a photosynthesis inhibitor, however it will not be as effective as the known inhibitor, DCMU.

Materials and Method:
  In this experiment, we performed several assays on the chloroplasts of spinach leaves in the presence of light and either DCMU or 5% acetic acid vinegar. In order to perform this experiment, we used four grinded spinach leaves that had been strained through a cheesecloth and had 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer with pH 8.0. added, placing the ground spinach leaves into three 50 Ml centrifugation tubes. This mixture was then centrifuged for three minutes at 1200 rpm at 4oC in order to separate the enriched chloroplasts. 100 microliters of the resulting supernatant was prepared with water, the analyte DCPIP, and buffer fluid and placed into nine test tubes. The nine test tubes were separated into three groups and for each group three tubes had either no inhibitor, DCMU, or vinegar added. The controll group was the group with no inhibitor added. Then all of the test tubes were placed under a lamp’s light at 100% light. After 10 minutes, the absorbance of each of the nine test tubes was taken by a spectrophotometer at 600 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorbance of DCPIP. The absorbance was additionally taken again after 20 minutes and 30 minutes. We compared our final results using a one-tailed T-test with a 0.05 alpha value.

Results:
 As reflected in Figure 1, the results of the absorbance readings showed a change in absorbance over time for all three of the groups. The final average percent change after thirty minutes for the controll group, represented by the blue bar in Figure 1, and for the vinegar experimental group, represented by the red bar in Figure 1, showed positive percent increases. The DCMU experimental group, represented by the yellow bar in Figure 1, showed a negative average percentage. The figure below shows a comparison the of the collected data from this experiment. A one-tailed T-test was conducted from the results for the DCMU compared to the controll, the vinegar compared to the controll, and the DCMU compared to the vinegar. A T-test was conducted, revealing that all three of the comparisons showed a p_value less than 0.5. The N value was 6. A t_test was conducted and it showed a p_value of 0.00012 for the DCMU experimental group against the controll group, a p_value of 0.03602 for the vinegar experimental group against the controll, and a p_value of 0.00407 for the DCMU experiment group against the vinegar experimental group. Therefore, the results displayed in Figure 1 show that there was statistical significance in the collected results. An unexpected result of the experiment was that the group to which vinegar was added turned to a pink coloration during the process of the experiment. 

Discussion:
 Through thorough analysis of our data, our results appeared to be mostly inconclusive. The final average percent change after thirty minutes for the controll group was the largest percentage increase. The final average percent change for the vinegar experimental group showed the second largest increase. The DCMU experimental group showed a negative percentage, the smallest of the three. The no inhibitor controll group showed the most photosynthetic activity. The DCMU group showed the least photosynthetic activity. The vinegar group was found to be an intermediate between the two. Due to this result, it can be concluded that the group with DCMU inhibited the photosynthesis the most. A lower absorbance rate suggested more photosynthetic controll. The DCMU group displayed the lowest absorbance rate, while the controll group displayed the highest absorbance rate. The results did somewhat support our hypothesis since DCMU was the strongest inhibitor, followed by vinegar. The results regarding the effect of vinegar are inconclusive, however, because of the pink coloration it contained. This possibly suggests that it reacted with the DCPIP color indicator in a redox reaction. It is unknown how exactly this could have affected the experiment. Nonetheless, the results for the DCMU group did support the previously found research in suggesting that DCMU inhibits photosynthesis in plants by acting as a herbicide. [Ridley: 1977] The vinegar did also inhibit the photosynthesis to some extent, supporting the findings that suggest the acetic acid it contains allows it to act as a herbicide. [Bellinder: 2009] If this experiment were to be performed again, the redox reaction between DCPIP and vinegar would have to be taken into account. While the Hill reaction and its analysis with spectrophotometry has been shown to be an effective way of determining the effect of photosynthetic inhibitors on plants, the results we attained from the vinegar assays suggest that other reactions can occur in such experiments that will skew the results.
