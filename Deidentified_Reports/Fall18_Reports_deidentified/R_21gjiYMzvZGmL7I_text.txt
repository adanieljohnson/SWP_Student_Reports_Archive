Title: The Effect of leaf color and thickness of the rate of Photosynthesis 

Abstract:
The rate of photosynthesis is affected by the thickness and color of leafy green plants’ leaves. In this experiment, the leaves of Brassica oleracea and Spinacia oleracea differ in regard to both of these variables, so they are excellent models to test, and B. oleracea should have a faster rate of photosynthesis as its leaves contain more chloroplasts, the part of the leaf where photosynthesis is carried out. The rate of photosynthesis in these organisms’ respective leaves will be determined by measuring the change in absorbance of DCIP, an electron acceptor, over the course of thirty minutes. The results showed no clear trend about which leaves carry out photosynthesis fastest, although it was determined that not having chloroplasts present, yields a slow rate of photosynthesis. The results did not support the hypothesis, as P= 0.814, and the spinach leaf showed the fastest rate of photosynthesis. Further testing should focus on agriculture applications of the most efficient photosynthesizing leaves of food crops like these.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the chemical process by which autotrophs harvest light energy and turn it into ATP, the major energy-carrying molecule in biological organisms. This process takes place in mesophyll cells of plants, which contain chloroplasts, the organelle responsible for photosynthesis. During this process, an electron transport chain is utilized in the system that is part of the conversion of light energy into its final chemical form. One way to measure the rate at which photosynthesis occurs is to measure the how fast electrons are passed through the chain. In this experiment the molecule DCIP will be used and is an electron acceptor that when reduced changes color from blue to colorless. By measuring the absorbance of DCIP at different time intervals, the rate of photosynthesis for a given leaf can be measured. The rate of photosynthesis is also affected by factors such as the shade of green and thickness of leaves. This experiment will compare the rates of photosynthesis between Brassica oleracea, kale, and Spinacia oleracea, spinach. These two plants have leaves with varying characteristics and will therefore be model organisms to compare these factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis. It has been shown that leaves of darker shades of green are more efficient at absorbing light of the same wavelengths, and therefore can perform photosynthesis at a faster rate than plants with leaves of lighter shades of green [Terashima: 2009]. It has also been proven that the thicker the leaves of plants with similar leaf morphologies, the faster the thicker leaves are able to carry out photosynthesis [Boardman: 1977]. In this experiment, it is predicted that B. oleracea will have a higher rate of photosynthesis compared to S. oleracea because kale is both a thicker leaf and darker shade of green compared to spinach. This means that B. oleracea contains more chloroplasts, and therefore a greater amount of light can be absorbed and converted into ATP. As a result, more electron transport chains will be present in the B. oleracea solution, making the rate at which DCIP is reduced faster compared to S. oleracea, which has fewer total places where electrons can be transferred to the test molecule. 

Materials and Method:
Obtain a package of kale and spinach from a local produce store and select four leaves of about equal size of each plant. While cooling two mortar and pestles, two medium sized beakers, and six 50 Ml centrifuge tubes in ice, remove the large central vein from the leaves. Once cooled, grind the leaves in separate mortar and pestles and add 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) into pestles. Make sure to keep the spinach and kale mixtures separate throughout the entire experiment; the same procedure applies to both samples. When no large leaf chunks are left add and mix 10 more Ml of the grinding buffer, and then strain into the beakers through three layers of cheesecloth. Transfer 200 μl of the filtered liquid from the beaker into a microtube labeled “Sample of A (plant)” and store it on ice. Pour the remaining liquid to the centrifuge tubes and label “A (plant)” and spin it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. Next, pour only the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Now remove 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 Ml tube marked “B ”and place it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B (plant)”, and store on ice. Centrifuge the 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B ”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. Then, pour the supernatant into a clean 50 Ml tube marked “C (plant)”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet. Add 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Transfer 200 μl of this resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet (plant)”, and store on ice. Finally, remove 200 μl from tube “C,” and place it into a microtube labeled “Sample of C (plant)” and store it on ice. Part one of the experiment has now been completed.
For part two, label 17 large test tubes and place them in a tube rack, and turn on a spectrophotometer set it to 600 nm. Next prepare 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes from table 1. Note that you only need to make 1 replicate of the blank. Add 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts to blank 1 and tubes #6-11, and add 100 uL of kale chloroplasts to blank 2 and tubes #12-17. Make sure to mix each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts, and then transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Immediately blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 1 (spinach blank), record all absorbances for spinach tubes (#6-11), then blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 2 (kale blank), and record all absorbances for kale tubes (#12-17). Place tubes #1-8 and #12-14 in lamp light and tubes #9-11 and #15-17 in darkness. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with spinach blank (tube #1) and record absorbance for spinach samples (6-11), and blank the spectrophotometer with kale blank (#2) and record the absorbances for kale samples (12-17). Next, wait 10 more minutes (20 min total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer again with each sample and record absorbances a second time (repeat steps 9 and 10). Finally, after 10 more minutes (30 min total) in light or darkness, blank the spectrophotometer again with each sample and record the absorbances for a third time (repeat steps 9 and 10).


Results:
Each group saw their absorbance value decrease over the course of the experiment, except for the two that started with negative absorbance values. These two groups, however, showed decreasing values between the intervals of 10 to 30 minutes. The two samples containing no chloroplasts both finished with the highest absorbance values of .378 and .313. There was no trend to the data with regards to the different groups tested. The chloroplasts in light of spinach ended with the lowest absorbance value, followed by chloroplasts in dark of kale, then chloroplasts in light of kale, spinach in darkness, and lastly the two groups with no chloroplasts. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.246, d.f.= 6, P= 0.814).

Discussion:
The results reject the hypothesis, P=.814. It was predicted that kale should have a higher rate of photosynthesis, which would have meant that the sample containing kale chloroplasts in light should finish with the lowest absorbance in the shortest amount of time. Figure 1 shows, however, that the spinach chloroplasts in light finished with the lowest absorbance value, followed by kale in dark conditions and then kale in light. The data was also proven to be statistically insignificent between the experiment and controll group. This was most likely a result of having a small sample size. Only three samples of each leaf were used in each group, which is not enough sets of data to accurately draw a confident conclusion. The results also did not show much variation between chloroplasts in light and dark conditions, even though it has previously been shown that chloroplasts of leafy greens function better in light [Boardman: 1977]. Another error that could have led these results is the spectrophotometer used. Two different machines were used in the lab, as the original one produced faulty absorbance values that did not adhere to the blank value.  The second machine saved the blank, and was used for the spinach absorbance values, which follow more closely the predicted overall trend the data should have produced. Studies have shown that leaves of darker shades of green carry out photosynthesis at a faster rate, however, it was observed that there was not much variation in leaf color between the two plants, so this became a non-factor for this experiment [Ferguson: 1972]. Further, when grinding the leaves, the kale did not fully grind into a mostly-liquid mixture but instead still contained many large chunks. This might have also resulted in the faulty absorbance values for the kale samples. Finding which plants have a faster rate of photosynthesis could have many applications in the agriculture industry. Understanding how plants respond to different light conditions, and how they most effectively harness energy from the sun is vital to the regions in which certain crops will grow best, and also which plants will be best for human consumption.
