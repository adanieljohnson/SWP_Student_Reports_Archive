Title: Provided shelters affect aggressive behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
This experiment observed the behaviors exhibited by Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) when given shelters as forms of territory. Past research has shown that Beta fish show aggressive behavior when attempting to protect their territory and display complex forms of aggression through physical characteristics when in the general presence of another fighting fish. I hypothesized that Beta fish would portray more aggressive behavior due to their history of portraying aggression when attempting to guard their territory (the provided shelter). Through this experiment, I observed the resulting animal behaviors in Beta fish (Betta splendens) when presented with shelters by observational behavior exhibited by the Beta fish. The resulting data showed that there was more aggressive behavior exhibited by fish when provided with a shelter, supporting my hypothesis. This allows researchers to understand that territory is a major factor impacting animal behaviors.

Introduction:
This experiment observed the behaviors exhibited by Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) when given shelters as forms of territory. Past research has shown that Beta fish show aggressive behavior when attempting to protect their territory and display complex forms of aggression through physical characteristics when in the general presence of another fighting fish [Balley: 2009]. These physical aggression traits can be characterized by broadside movements when one fish turns its side to the other and facing movements when a fish looks directly at another fish in an effort to intimidate it. While using these as supporting data, this experiment focuses on the most aggressive type of facing behavior: protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane, which resembles a “red mane” [Agrawal: 1999]. The ability to observe these characteristics, along with the ease of containing these animals in a fixated environment, makes them an ideal organism for observing animal behaviors. The aggressive behaviors exhibited by Siamese fighting fish is high in energy cost, causing individuals to wonder as to how the benefits of such behaviors outweigh the energy costs they require [Doutrelant: 2001]. One proposed explanation is that these behaviors greatly enhance the probability that the nests that hold their offspring are better protected, bettering their fitness [Bronstein: 1981]. This provided the basis for my hypothesis: Beta fish will display more signs of aggression in the presence of another fighting fish when a shelter or simulated nest is provided.

Materials and Methods:
I performed three trials in studying the behavior of Beta fish. Each trial held two fish, resulting in six fish in total being studied. Each trial performed ran for five minutes. In each trial, two fish were studied when placed together in a tank. The fish were allowed to interact to observe quantitative behavioral traits while given the option of using a provided shelter. To test the behaviors of the Beta fish, I observed and quantified the actions of each. This allowed me to test the observed behaviors of the fish in a controlled environment. Tail flashings, duration of “red manes” displayed, and physical touches were measured. I compared the data from both fish in each trial through a one-tailed paired t-test and averaged the resulting data to determine a conclusion.

Results:
The resulting data showed that the fish showed more aggression-associated behaviors when a shelter was provided. Fish with access to shelter displayed a “red mane” for 19.775 seconds longer than those that did not have a shelter in the tank. The data comparing the two groups were statistically significant.

Discussion:
The resulting data from the experiment supported my hypothesis. The Bea fish observed depicted more aggression-related behaviors when given a shelter to protect. The amount of time that “red manes” were shown provided a large difference between those with a shelter and those without a shelter, therefore, constituting a significant difference between the two groups. This study focused primarily on male-male interactions, allowing for further research to incorporate trials that include a variety in sexes. This is crucial to the understanding of the behaviors of fish, which can be extrapolated to the understanding of a myriad of species in a variety of other ecosystems. Territory-influenced behaviors can be understood to makeup many of the exhibited actions animals display, supporting the idea that humans hold behaviors based on territory as well, allowing researchers to expand the understanding of human sociological tendencies and the innate physiological observations we portray.  Further directions for this experiment could be the application of pharmacological manipulation to the Siamese fighting fish and measuring any difference in aggressive behaviors while providing shelters [Clotfelter: 2007]. Stimulants, such as caffeine and cocaine, could result in more aggressive behaviors or a higher frequency of aggressive behaviors being observed.
