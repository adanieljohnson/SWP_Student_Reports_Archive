Title: The Minimal Effects of pH on the Root-to-Shoot Ratio in Buckwheat

Abstract:
Climate change, pollution, pH, and various other conditions greatly alter the average conditions in which plants grow; phenotypic plasticity allows plants to allocate resources accordingly in order to increase fitness. The purpose was to determine if the acidity of the soil has an effect on the phenotypic plasticity in plants by measuring the root-to-shoot ratio. We hypothesized that a soil of a lower pH, around 3.0, would produce a buckwheat plant with a lower root to shoot ratio than buckwheat in soil of a neutral acidity. There were two groups of buckwheat plants, 36 seedlings watered with water and 36 with a solution having a pH. After two weeks of growth and daily watering, the root-to-shoot ratio of weight and length were measured using nine samples from each group. The two-paired t-test did not produce a significant difference, meaning the results did not support the hypothesis. After calculating the ratio for weight and length, it was determined that there was no significant difference between the neutral soil and acidic soil in terms of phenotypic plasticity. Thus, knowing the extent to which pH affects the ability of plants to access and use the nutrients they need will greatly benefit the agricultural field.

Introduction:
Phenotypic plasticity refers to the way in which plants change how they allocate their resources based on their environmental conditions, such as soil nutrients and pH, and the availability of sunlight and water. For example, during a dry season, a plant must put more resources into the roots than during the wet season, resulting in a larger root to shoot ratio. During a rainy season, water is readily available for the roots to absorb, meanwhile during the dry season the plant will put more work into growing the roots to increase the surface area through which it can absorb as much water as possible [Foy, D: 1964]. Phenotypic plasticity is important to plants as it allows them to adjust to changes in the environment, rather than dying if they were unable to adapt. 
Over the past 30 years, research has shown the effect of acid rain on our environment whether it be the quality of crops or the degradation of lakes, streams, and wildlife populations. Acid rain destroys nutrients in the soil and microbial processes which impact plants and animals [Killham, K: 1983]. Fagopyrum esculentum, known as buckwheat, was the plant chosen for the experiment as it has the ability to adjust its phenotypic plasticity more than other cereal grain plants. It will produce a crop in locations where not many others can grow (drained marshland, newly cleared land, etc.). Buckwheat helps to increase the amount of plant-friendly phosphorous in the soil, aid in weed control, and can also deter bugs and other crop pests. Additionally, buckwheat has a high tolerance to acidic soil. Although there are many benefits to using buckwheat, it also has its drawbacks; it has fine roots which require aerated, easily penetrable soil for successful growth. Buckwheat is a crop that can be used to restore nutrients to the soil. 
We hypothesize that a soil of a lower pH, around 3.0, would produce a buckwheat plant with a lower root to shoot ratio than buckwheat in soil in neutral acidity.

Materials and Methods:
Buckwheat plants were chosen as the model organism and twelve seeds were planted in six containers. Initially, the seeds were watered with 50mL of miracle grow and then set in the greenhouse. Each day the seedlings were watered; the control with water and the second group with an acidic solution having a pH of around 3.5. At the end of the two-week growth period, the plants were harvested by removal of plant and soil from tray. Then the vermiculite was broken apart, to separate the roots, the roots were washed with water and then patted dry using a paper towel. Three samples from each plant were weighed as a whole, and then the roots and shoots of each plant were weighed separately. The longest length of root and shoot were measured and recorded. The raw data was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the length ratio and the weight ratio; then used to calculate the t-value and p-value using a two-tail t-test with a critical value of 0.05. 

Results:
The two-sample t-test showed the control (0.5700 +/- 0.1929) and the acidic group (0.5132 +/- 0.1065) varied the root-to-shoot length ratio of the two groups (p-value: 0.6985, t-value: 0.4163, 0.10). There was no significant difference between the two groups in length or weight.

Discussion:
Our results showed no significant difference in the root-to-shoot length ratio of the two groups (0.6985,0.4163,0.10). Thus our hypothesis was not supported. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the root-to-shoot weight ratios. Buckwheat has a high tolerance for acidic soil which is evident in our data, as there was no significance between the weight or length ratio. Thus, there was no need for the plants in acidic soils to allocate their resources differently than they would in the neutral ground due to their greater phenotypic plasticity. Therefore, buckwheat plants can continue to produce the same amount of nutrients in all soil regardless of the pH; making them a good cover crop to rotate in all lands as they replenish the nutrients to the soil; the nutrients that the acid rain destroys, allowing them to grow, die and decompose [Killham, K: 1983]. 
One of the most significant limitations of the experimental design was the number of experimental groups. By using a larger number of samples and a wider range of soil pH, then a more precise conclusion could’ve been drawn. Also, choosing a plant that thrives at a neutral pH would’ve been a better choice than buckwheat regarding drawing conclusions that could be applied to plants in general. The ability of plants to use soil nutrients is closely linked to the pH of soil; the ability to absorb and utilize phosphorous in the presence of aluminum is imperative to nutrient utilization [Foy: 1964]. Thus, knowing extent to which pH affects the ability of plants to access and use the nutrient they need would also make the data gathered more applicable on a general basis. In future experiments, increasing the number of samples and a larger range of pH watering solutions would provide more accurate data. A larger amount of data would allow us to draw more general conclusions about phenotypic plasticity and allocation of resources in the presence of a range of soil pH in buckwheat crops.
