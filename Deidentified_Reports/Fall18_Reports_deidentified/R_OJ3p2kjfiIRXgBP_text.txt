Title: The Effect of Artificial Herbivory on Radish Resource Allocation

Abstract:
Herbivory is a biological factor that constantly threatens both plant in life natural habitats and common farms. Insects and animals eating crops subjects threatens yield for even the smallest farmers which ends up affecting the food industry entirely. The large role herbivory plays in the food industry has resulted in many experimental treatments to plants that can increase their resistance to herbivory. We will be taking a look at how artificial herbivory affects radish plants in terms of growth in two sections of the plant, the roots and the shoots. Discovering additional effects of herbivory on plant growth will let the agricultural community create crops more resistant to detrimental herbivores.

Introduction:
Throughout this lab we will analyze the effects of artificial herbivory on resource allocation in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum). Herbivory refers to the eating of plants by other organisms while the plant is still alive, usually by insects and larger herbivores. Although natural herbivory will affect plant development different than artificial herbivory, we will assume the effects are similar. Deer and other herbivorous mammals tend to eat entire leaves when consuming a plant; however, smaller insects tend to dissect only part of the leaf when consuming parts of plants. In addition, herbivory on the actual stem of the plants will have more drastic effects on resource allocation than herbivory on the leaves because more vital processes occur in the plant stems [McNaughton:1986]. Since the radishes being grown do not have a large amount of leaves, the artificial herbivory being imposed on the plants will mimic insect herbivory instead of larger animal consumption. Due to the loss of plant area to herbivory, plants will naturally allocate more resources towards the roots. For that reason, I predict that plants affected by herbivory will have decreased root to shoot ratios for both length and weight.

Materials and Methods:
To simulate artificial herbivory on plant resource allocation, our group grew radishes in eight sections, four of which were left alone as a control and four of which went through artificial herbivory. Each section had approximately 15 radish seeds in the soil at the beginning of the experiment. To simulate herbivory, one week into the experiment, small parts of the leaves were cut out similar to the size a caterpillar would cut out in natural settings. Water, sunlight, and soil conditions were all kept constant for both groups. The procedure lasted two weeks until we removed the plants from their soil, washed the plants of remaining soil, and measured their root to shoot ratio for both mass and length, measured in g and cm respectively. We measured three plants in each of the four sections of both control plants and plants that underwent artificial herbivory to use as data. To compare the results of the experiment, two sample, one-tailed t-tests were used to synthesize the difference in plant resource allocation in terms of both weight and length.

Results:
The average R:S length ratio for plants under artificial herbivory is 2.66 cm/cm (fig 1.), which is lower than the average R:S length ratio for the control group, 3.39 cm/cm (fig 1.). There was a similar pattern for R:S weight ratios. The average R:S weight ratio for plants under artificial herbivory is 0.37 g/g (fig 2.), which is lower than the average R:S Weight for the control, 0.46 g/g (fig 2.). For both length and weight, the plants in the control group allocated more resources to the development of roots instead of shoots, which yielded a larger R:S ratio for the control group for both length and weight. Two-sample, one-tailed t-tests were used to analyze the data for both of the variables. For R:S length, the difference in mean ratio between the control group and the test group was statistically significant (t-stat=2.47, df=22, p-value=0.011). However, for R:S weight, the difference in mean ratio between the control group and the test group was not statistically significant (t-stat=1.66, df=6, p-value=0.074). Both of the t-tests were analyzed with an alpha level of 0.05.

Discussion:
The data collected supports our original hypothesis that artificial herbivory results in a lower R:S ratio for both length and weight, although the data was not statistically significant for R:S Weight. The plants that underwent artificial herbivory probably allocated more resources to their shoots to compensate for the loss of potential energy from photosynthesis reactions occurring in the leaves. A study focusing on plant reaction to herbivory in tropical climates found that plants would increase weight in shoots but concluded that the main purpose was to increase leaf length [Coley:1996]. Although leaf area was not measured in our experiment, results can be expected to be similar as leaf area expanded as a compensatory mechanism. In a contrast study, researchers found that below ground herbivory resulted in a decrease in shoot weight [Nötzold:1997]. These results suggest that it could be possible that plants naturally allocate to overcompensate for whatever are of the plant was affected first.  The timing of when the herbivory occurs in the plant’s life also impacts how resource allocation will react in the long run [Boege: 2005]. However, plants in early stages of development tend to allocate sugars quickly to their roots as a defense to herbivory in early stages of life [Schwachtje 2006]. If our experiment was extended for another 1-2 weeks, we predict side-effects of early herbivory would be reduced, and that the data would be statistically significant for R:S weight ratio, fully supporting our initial hypothesis.
