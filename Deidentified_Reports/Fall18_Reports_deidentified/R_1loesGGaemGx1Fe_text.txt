Title: Lanthanum trichloride cannot be confirmed as the cause of slight physarum inhibition in chemotaxis and phototaxis

Abstract:
Signal transduction pathways allow organisms to respond to environmental stimuli by way of receptors and effectors. While studying signaling with regard to plant cell biology, the effect of lanthanum trichloride was examined with Physarum polycephalum by way of chemotaxis and phototaxis. Chemotaxis and phototaxis plates were prepared with three controll and three lanthanum trichloride plates each. Physarum was placed in the center of each plate. The migrated distance of physarum was measured after twenty-four hours. There was no statistically significent difference between the controll and lanthanum trichloride environments, indicating no significent difference in the migration distances. Since lanthanum trichloride is well-researched as an inhibitor, our results contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding how effective varying concentrations of lanthanum trichloride may be useful for various research and medical fields. 

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways allow organisms to respond to environmental stimuli. Most generally, a stimulus is converted to a motor response by way of receptors and effectors that communicate the signal through an organism. Without these signaling pathways, organisms would be unable to quickly react to other organisms and occurrences in their environment [Johnson: 2018]. 
The IP3-mediated pathway is a common signal transduction pathway. IP3, a second messenger molecule, binds to its receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, causing calcium channels in the sER to open, allowing calcium ions to bind to their respective proteins [Johnson: 2018]. Such interactions facilitate the binding of troponin and myosin within actin filaments, allowing organisms to be able to contract and relax their muscles, furthermore allowing movement [Szent-Györgyi: 1975]. 
Since motor responses are a basic organismal function, it is an interest of scientists to know of ways to inhibit signaling pathways [Johnson: 2018]. Lanthanum trichloride, an inorganic compound noted as an inhibitor of calcium channels, is known to prevent movement in organisms as calcium is unable to bind to the necessary receptors [Katzung: 1973].
With regard to single-celled organisms, Physarum polycephalum, a species of slime mold, has been used for cell biology research relating to organismal stimulus and response [Schaap: 2016]. One way to experiment with physarum’s ability to respond to varying environmental situations is by seeing what happens when lanthanum trichloride is applied to physarum. The Journal of Plant and Cell Physiology conducted a phototaxis study in which lanthanum trichloride was found to prevent physarum’s movement away from light sources [Häder: 1985]. Similarly, a study performed by Duke University noted that lanthanum trichloride prevented a chemotactic response in human white blood cells when in the presence of a serum expected to activate movement within the cell [Boucek: 1976]. 
Given what is known about lanthanum trichloride’s effect on signaling pathways, if its presence prevents physarum from moving in response to chemotaxis and phototaxis conditions, then it can be considered a successful calcium channel inhibitor. 


Materials and Method:
Three milliliters of lanthanum trichloride was diluted with twenty milliliters of distilled water, creating a diluted lanthanum trichloride solution. 

Chemotaxis
Six water agar plates were labeled as three controll and three experimental plates. The three experimental plates were covered in five milliliters of diluted lanthanum trichloride solution and left to soak for ten minutes. After ten minutes, the excess solution that was not absorbed was lightly dabbed off. Five oatmeal flakes were placed together against the edge of each plate. A square with an area of one cm2 was cut from the center of the plate with a spatula cleaned with ethanol and replaced with an agar square of equal area with physarum on top. The plates and lids were taped together and placed in an opaque black bag in an incubator for twenty-four hours at 24℃. 

Twenty-four hours later, the plates were removed from the incubator. The distance between the physarum’s starting position and final position was measured in millimeters. A two-sample t_test was run with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the statistical significance of the data. 

Phototaxis
Six PDA (potato dextrose agar) plates were labeled as three controll and three experimental plates. The three experimental plates were covered in five milliliters of diluted lanthanum trichloride solution and left to soak for ten minutes. After ten minutes, the excess solution that was not absorbed was lightly dabbed off. A square with an area of one cm2 was cut from the center of the plate with a spatula cleaned with ethanol and replaced with an agar square of equal area with physarum on top. The plates and lids were taped together and wrapped completely in tin foil to block out all light. A square with an area of one cm2 was made in the tin foil covering the lid of the plate to make a window letting light in. The plates were placed in a light box for twenty-four hours. 

Twenty-four hours later, the plates were removed from the lightbox. The distance between the physarum’s starting position to final position was measured in millimeters. A two-sample t_test was run with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the statistical significance of the data. 


Results:
The average migrated distances of controll physarum were higher than those of physarum exposed to lanthanum trichloride (Figure 1 and 2). The standard deviations of controll and lanthanum trichloride treatments were high and overlapping in both the chemotaxis and phototaxis (Figure 1 and 2). All The chemotaxis and phototaxis data were ultimately not statistically significent with p_values of 0.65 and 0.24, t_stat of 0.48 and 1.37, and four degrees of freedom, respectively. 

Discussion:
The average migration distances of physarum in the controll environments were higher than those of physarum in the lanthanum trichloride environments. However, our results were not statistically significent and cannot confirm that the observed differences in migration distance were due to the effects of lanthanum trichloride.  
A study performed by the University of Rostock noted that increasing the concentration of lanthanum trichloride consequently resulted in an increasing loss of activity in rat cortical actin networks, further impairing movement. Because of the accumulation of lanthanum ions, motor impairment was found as a result of long-term lanthanum exposure without a source of reversibility [Gramowski: 2010]. Additionally, a study by the Federal University of Rio de Janiero noted that in high concentrations, lanthanum ions are able to bind irreversibly to calcium binding sites. However, without a high enough concentration of lanthanum trichloride, this effect may not be observed to such a degree as to fully impair movement [Pavia: 2009].
Our lanthanum trichloride solution was rather dilute with a ratio of three milliliters of lanthanum trichloride to twenty milliliters of distilled water. A reasonable follow-up experiment would be to repeat both the chemotaxis and phototaxis procedures but with a less dilute lanthanum trichloride solution to see if the full effects of lanthanum trichloride could be observed. 
Our results, although not statistically significent, are supported by the findings of these studies. Furthermore, our results are able to contribute to scientific knowledge that lanthanum trichloride may be able to serve a range of purposes depending on the concentration of the solution. Varying concentrations of lanthanum trichloride may be well suited for certain degrees of immobilization of organisms for research or medical purposes.
