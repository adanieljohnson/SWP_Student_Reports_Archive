Title: No evidence for different pattern of resource allocation in response to herbivory in plants

Abstract:
Obtaining limited abiotic resources is a major challenge of plants in an ecosystem. Plants must develop certain pattern of resource allocation to maximize the utility of the resources they gained. Environment stimuli would influence their trade-off pattern. The objective of this study is to discover the effect of herbivory on resource allocation of plants. Buck wheat was used as the model organism in the study and herbivory was simulated by artificially cutting holes on the leaves. The resource allocation pattern was indicated by root: shoot ratio. The hypothesis was that the buck wheat treated with herbivory would have a lower root: shoot ratio than the buck wheat that was not. We found that there was no statistically significant difference between the experiment and control group, suggesting that herbivory tend not to change the resource allocation in plants. We inferred that plants might use its resource to fight against herbivory instead of changing resource allocation in growing structure. Further study would be carried concerning the new assumption and amend the flaws in experiment design that might have caused the result to be not significant. 

Introduction:
In any ecological community, biotic factors and abiotic factors influence plants and animals on every aspect, from energy capture to fitness [Johnson: 2016]. Abiotic factors refer to the non-living sources in the environment that affect the ecosystem and the organisms in it. Many intraspecific and interspecific plant interactions revolve around obtaining abiotic resources since those resources are normally limited in the ecosystem on earth. As a result, plants must develop certain pattern to allocate the resources they gained as they attempt to maximize their fitness [Seabloom: 2018]. The trade-off process is called resource allocation. Typical resource allocation example includes expending more energy to grow a particular structure while reducing the energy input on another, such as growing more roots and less leaves during drought time. Normally, leaves are the principal photosynthetic organ of the plant; roots are the primary absorptive organ and anchor the plant to the soil [Johnson: 2016]. Because the relative allocation of biomass and length can indicate the resource devoted in the structure in a given environment, we are using the root: shoot ratio to examine the resource allocation condition. In real environment, herbivores exert a major impact on plants. It increases plants’ mortality and removes the resources that could be allocated to reproduction or growth [Coley: 1985]. Plants typically utilize a broad defensive trait against herbivories [Agrawal: 2006]. For the reason that the plants are losing leaf area, we expected that the plants would allocate more resources to shoot rather than root. Our hypothesis is that the experiment group with herbivory would have a lower root: shoot ratio than the control group. In this case the presence of herbivory would be the independent variable while the root: shoot ratio being the dependent variable. 

Materials and Methods:
For the setup of our study, we picked buck wheat as our experimental subject. Four pots with soil were prepared for both experiment group and control group. A handful of seeds were scattered into each pot. Then all the pots were thoroughly watered to ensure that enough amount of seeds would sprout. All pots were kept together in a green house. We watered the plants every day for twelve days to observe the result. After the plants sprouted, we selected four plants from each pot of experiment group. Because of the restriction of study condition, we cut a small hole on each leaf every day to stimulate herbivory. 
After twelve days, we harvested four plants from each pot. The pots were carefully poured into a container with water. We then gently wash the adherent medium down the roots and separated the roots. The selected plants were patted dry with paper towels to avoid the influence of water on weight. The shoot was separated from root at the point of color changing. Next, we weighed and measured the length of each individual plant’s root and shoot separately and recorded the result. Our hypothesis was tested by comparing the mean value of root: shoot (mass) and root: shoot (length) for experiment and control group. 
We used one-tailed two-sample t-test as statistical test to see if our results were significant. The reason was that root: shoot (mass) and root: shoot (length) were both measurement variables while the groups they belonged to were categorical variables and had only two values, experimental and control. We also expected a directional trend for the experiment group. 

Results:
The mean root: shoot (mass) of experiment plants was 0.28 and that of control plants was 0.26 (Fig.1). The standard deviation for mass in the experiment plants was 0.17 and that of control plants was 0.06 (Fig.1). The mean root: shoot (length) of experiment plants was 0.83 and that of control plants was 0.97 (Fig.2). The standard deviation for length in the experiment plants was 0.26 and that of control plants was 0.27 (Fig.2). The mean of the mass experiment group was not statistically significantly different than that of the mass control group (t-stat=0.38, df=30, P=0.35). The mean of the length experiment group was also not statistically significantly different than that of the length control group (t-stat=1.45, df=30, P=0.08). When observing the plants on the final day, the experiment group generally looked slightly larger than the control group although they had holes on their leaves. There was no distinguishable difference in the color of the plants. As a result of this experiment, both the experiment and control group plants had around the same length and weight. 

Discussion:
Overall, there was no difference in the resource allocation strategy in the experiment and control group. Our hypothesis that the experiment group with herbivory would have a lower root: shoot ratio than the control group was rejected. The presence of herbivory didn’t appear to influence the resource allocation of plants. We think there might be several reasons contributing to this result. First, herbivory would reduce the biomass, height, survivorship, and reproduction of plants [Carson: 2000]. Since the damage is relatively high to the plants, the plants that develop antiherbivore defenses would be favored in selection [Coley: 1985]. Thus, resources distributed to growth would generally be reduced, including resources allocated to roots and shoots. Since roots and shoots are decreasing at the same time, the root: shoot ratio will keep at the same level. Second, the plant may be growing more root to absorb energy, compensating the lost resources in leaf, which provides one explanation to the higher root: shoot mass in experiment group. Third, the experiment method determined that the measured shoot mass was lower than the actual mass the plants grown using the resources due to the holes on the leaves. It might be another reason for the root: shoot mass in experiment group to be higher. Fourth, we might not give the plants enough time to develop a different resource allocation strategy since we only did the study for twelve days. For future study, we could elongate the study time period to observe morphological change and root: shoot ratio of plants with herbivory and plants without. We could also introduce actual herbivory insects instead of stimulating the behavior to make the study assemble natural environment more. Another study direction would be the influence of herbivory on the overall plant growth and fitness level instead of resource allocation.
