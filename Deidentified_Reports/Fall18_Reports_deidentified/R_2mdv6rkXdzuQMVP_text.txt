Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Growth and Development of Larval Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
There is emerging research regarding the use of substances that impact the growth and development of insects. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) block the insect’s ability to pupate into adulthood by regulating metamorphosis and dramatically increases juvenile mortality. In this experiment Manduca sexta is treated with Martin’s IGR, a substance that blocks the processes regulated by juvenile hormones to compare their growth with a controll group. We hypothesize that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR will weigh (g) less than the caterpillars in the controll group. Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars with starting weights ranging from 0.65 g-1.11 g were selected for observation. The controll group was fed food mixed with five drops deionized water, while the experimental group was fed food mixed with 5 drops Martin’s IGR. After fourteen days, we recorded the final mass of each caterpillar. A Two-Sample T-Test determined the corresponding p_value of 0.47. The mean of the controll group was not significently different than that of the experimental group. In the future, it would be useful to compare data from this trial to one that is run for one week to determine if length of study affects caterpillar weight gain. 

Introduction:
There is emerging research regarding the use of substances that impact the growth and development of insects. The growth and development of insects are dependent on certain hormones that are either produced in the brain, such as the prothoracic hormone (PTTH) or in the corpora allata, the juvenile hormone (JH) [Tanaz: 2004]. With this knowledge, it is evident that controllling these hormones will impact the timing and success of molting. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) block the insect’s ability to pupate into an adult by regulating metamorphosis, so the likelihood of survival for these insects drops dramatically. Also, these insects will not be able to reproduce as they will never reach the developmental stage appropriate for reproduction. In order for the juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs) process to be successful, it is crucial that the insects are injected at the beginning of their lives; Tanaz and Uygun argue that the timing of injection is especially important for tobacco hornworm larvae, Manduca Sexta [Tanaz: 2004]. This knowledge aids my argument in this experiment that when fed food injected with insect growth regulators, the larval insect will not grow or develop at the same rate as caterpillars not tested with the substance. This research is integral in increasing the sustainability and safety of other organisms and humans. IGRs are different than traditional insecticides as they are not toxic to the insect or other organisms that could potentially come in contact with the substance. 

In this experiment, Martin’s IGR, a substance that blocks the processes regulated by juvenile hormones, is used on Manduca Sexta caterpillars to compare their growth with caterpillars not given the hormone, known as the controll group. We hypothesize that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR in their food will weigh less, in grams, than the caterpillars in the controll group after two weeks of observation. 


Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars with weights ranging from 0.65 g-1.11 g were selected for observation. Each caterpillar was placed in its own rearing container, which the food was placed into with two holes cut into each cubicle, so the caterpillars would have oxygen. All eight caterpillars were fed ten grams of food no matter their placement in either the experimental or controll group. The controll group’s food had five drops of deionized water mixed in the food while the experimental group had five drops of Martin’s IGR mixed into their food. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator placed at a controllled temperature range. After fourteen days, we recorded the final mass of each caterpillar after weighing them ten times over the duration of two weeks. 

To assess the data collected, we performed a Two-Sample T-Test using the means of differences for each group to predict a p_value which determined that our data was not statistically significent. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows the differences of mass for each caterpillar, which is the final result of taking the difference in weight gain for each day the caterpillars were weighed. These data show the net total weight gain for each caterpillar. For example, caterpillar one in the experimental group gained 0.153 grams over the course of two weeks. This gain differs drastically from that of caterpillar four in the controll group, who gained a total of 2.30 grams over the duration of the experiment. Finally, the mean difference from each group was taken, so each difference was added then divided by four to account for each caterpillar. 

As is evident in Figure 1, the experimental group’s mean difference of mass was significently lower than that of the controll group. The raw data of the differences of means between the four caterpillars of each group shows a slight discrepancy, especially in the experimental group. Caterpillars 1 and 4 had a much smaller difference than the other two in this group. In addition, the caterpillars in the controll group also had a collective difference of mass that was widespread. Also, Figure 1 displays the scale of how the means of the respective groups differ from each other. 

A Two-Sample T-Test was completed for the data collected, and it determined that the t- p_value is 0.47. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. 


Discussion:
We fail to reject the null hypothesis as the data are not statistically significent meaning that there is no difference in means for the groups, although our hypothesis was that there would be a clear difference since one group of caterpillars was given a growth regulator. This result could be due to the fact that we observed and weighed our caterpillars for two weeks, giving many of them sufficient time to pupate. The process of pupation for Manduca Sexta caterpillars causes them to terminate their eating in order to prepare for adulthood. This process caused many of the larval caterpillars to lose weight during our experiment, and this forced the mean difference to shift in both groups. For future experiments, it would be useful to compare the data from this trial to one that is only run for one week to determine if the length of study affects the weight gain of caterpillars, thus creating a smaller p_value. 

Two of the caterpillars in the experimental group had difficulty growing throughout the experiment, which was the expected outcome. I hypothesized that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR would weigh less at the end of the experiment than the caterpillars in the controll group. The two caterpillars who followed the expectation of the hypothesis were observed trying to molt or begin metamorphosis, but it was apparent that part of their molting was stuck and did not proceed to completion. To support this, Herbert Oberlander and Donald L. Silhacek argue that injecting a pupae with juvenile hormone will cause them to pupate into a second pupae rather than becoming adults [Oberlander: 2000]. Although this was true for two of the experimental caterpillars, the other two caterpillars in this group did not follow the same pattern as they grew at the same rate as many of the caterpillars in the controll group. We treated the experimental caterpillars at the beginning of their life cycle as recommended by Tanaz and Uygun [2004]. It is a possibility that, because the two caterpillars in the experimental group that defied the expectations of the experiment, were not given the IGR earlier enough in their life cycle. On the first day of the experiment, experimental caterpillars two and three already weighed more than the other two. 
Overall, the goal of insect growth regulators is the limit the growth and development of insects, which has been tested to be a much safer method for multiple species, including the insect, than traditional pesticides. IGRs are effective because they overload the levels of juvenile hormone in the insect, so it is no longer able to perform metamorphosis, forcing it to remain in the larval stage.
