Title: Effect of carbonated water on photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts as measured by reduction of DCIP

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a biological process that uses an electron transport chain to produce ATP and glucose from CO2. We centrifuged chloroplasts in both carbonated seltzer water and distilled water and then recorded absorbance at 600 nm in the presence of DCIP for three 10-minute intervals to determine photosynthetic activity. Carbonated water was not shown to statistically significently alter percent change in absorbance. The results contrast with other literature and with our hypothesis. Studies of the effect of CO2 are increasingly important due to human-caused increases in atmospheric CO2 levels.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis allows organisms to capture solar energy and store it for later use during other cellular functions through glycolysis and respiration, according to the formula 6CO2 + 12H2O --&gt; C6H12O6 + 6H2O. Glucose serves as the storage molecule of that energy. To complete this process, the organism requires sunlight, chlorophyll and Mn2+ ions in addition to water and carbon dioxide. This process uses a series of electron transport complexes and the phospholipid bilayer to form a proton gradient. Photosynthesis begins by chlorophyll inside chloroplasts absorbing solar radiation, which excites electrons cleave water and create the proton gradient. The electrons are then stored as NADPH and the proton gradient powers ATP production. The NADPH electrons and ATP react to form glucose from CO2. The light dependent reactions in photosynthesis generate NADPH to give the cell reducing power and generate ATP, and then use the enzyme RUBISCO to generate glucose from CO2 and ribulose phosphate. We hypothesized that by using carbonated seltzer water we would increase photosynthetic activity. We speculated that the increase in available CO2 would push the equilibrium toward the products and therefore increase photosynthetic activity. CO2 has previously been shown to increase photosynthetic activity in tomato plants [Lanoue: 2018]. 
	To observe photosynthetic activity, we introduced an alternative electron acceptor than NADP+, DCIP, a blue compound. As DCIP is reduced, it becomes colorless. Thus, we can measure ATP production via the electron transport complex with this reaction as DCIP is reduced.


Materials and Method:
We chilled a mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes in crushed ice. While the mortar and pestle chilled, we removed the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. The veins were thrown out as waste. We rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water and then blotted them dry with clean paper towel. When the mortar and pestle are chilled, wipe them dry and then add the spinach leaves. After adding 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer, we ground the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. We then added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed with the spinach slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We then transferred the resulting green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and spun it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for three minutes at 4oC. After, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”, without transferring the debris at the bottom of tube “A.” Then we centrifuged the 50 Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for ten minutes at 4oC. We poured the supernatant into a new 50 Ml tube marked “C,” carefully so as not to disturb the pellet in tube B. We placed tube “B” on ice and then added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We then divided the resuspended pellet into two 10 Ml samples. One of the samples was combined with 10 Ml of distilled water and the other with 10 Ml of seltzer water. Both samples were recentrifuged at 2800 rpm for ten minutes. The supernatants of the two samples were poured off. The pellets were then each resuspended with 10 Ml each of grinding buffer.
Next, we labeled eight large test tubes as shown in the table, and placed them in a tube rack. We prepared the spectrophotometer by setting it to 600 nm. We made three replicates of each of the following reaction mixes, with the exception of the blank of which there were two.
We began the assay by adding 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts with seltzer water to the first blank tube (tube 0), and to Tubes #2-4 and mixing each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. The second blank (tube 1) and Tubes #5-7 were prepared with the enriched chloroplasts with distilled water. Then we transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. We immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 0. Then immediately after we took the absorbance of all the samples with chloroplasts exposed to seltzer water. The process was then completed using the blank and samples with chloroplasts exposed to distilled water.  After 10 minutes, we repeated this process. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) the absorbances were taken again using the same procedure. We blanked the spectrophotometer again and repeated the previous process for a final time after another 10 minutes (30 minutes total). These results were then compared using a one-tailed independent t_test to determine if there was statistically significent difference in photosynthetic activity between the chloroplasts treated with carbonated water versus the chloroplasts treated with distilled water. We assumed equal variance because we had equal sample sizes.

Results:
The mean percent change at 10 minutes for distilled water chloroplasts was 16.39, SD = 0.11; at 20 minutes, was 31.44, SD = 0.17; and at 30 minutes was 45.15, SD = 0.22. At 10 minutes, the mean percent change for seltzer water chloroplasts was 11.53, SD = 0.05; at 20 was 22.77, SD = 0.05; and at 30 minutes was 27.95, SD = 0.06.  Carbonated water was not shown to significently affect the percent change in absorbance at 600 nm (t = 1.065, d.f. = 4, p = 0.17).  However, the percent change in absorbance for chloroplasts exposed to carbonated water was always observed to be lower than the percent change in absorbance for chloroplasts exposed to distilled water.

Discussion:
As seen in Figure 1, our hypothesis was not supported. We speculated that the increase in CO2 would increase photosynthetic activity, but this was not observed during the experiment. Instead, the carbonated water decreased absorbance at 600 nm, indicating decreased photosynthetic activity from decreased electron transfer. However, this decrease was not shown to be statistically significent compared to the percent change in absorbance of chloroplasts exposed to distilled water. This is in contrast with reported literature. For example, a study of phytoplankton found increased CO2 to increase photosynthetic activity by between 38 and 39% [Huang: 2018]. Studies of the effects of CO2 on photosynthetic activity are increasingly important as CO2 levels in the atmosphere rise due to human activity. This could have significent effects on photosynthetic rates in nature.
