Title: The Effect of Ecdysterone Blocker Introduction on Development in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, Manduca sexta caterpillars were observed and tested to look at their life cycle and how certain hormones contribute to their development, either to inhibit or promote growth. Insect growth regulators are substances that can impact these developmental hormones, and an ecdysterone (20E) blocker was incorporated in this particular instance. Eight caterpillars were separated into two groups of four, with one group serving as a controll group receiving no insect growth regulator, while the other group did receive the hormone blocker. Following two weeks of observation of their weight, we found that the controll group surprisingly had a heavier average weight than the treatment group, which went against our hypothesis that introducing an insect growth regulator that blocks the hormone responsible for pupation would cause an increase in weight of Manduca sexta larvae. Our rationale for these results was that caterpillars receiving the hormone blocker were already much bigger and further in their life cycle than the controll group, so while the controll group was continually gaining weight, the treatment group was already passing through their commitment pulse within the first couple days of testing.

Introduction:
Tobacco hornworms, given the scientific name Manduca sexta, is a larva (or caterpillar) that has a unique life cycle including multiple phases to allow it to become a full-grown moth [Johnson: 2018]. An important factor regarding the life cycle of animals includes the regulation and of its endocrine system, which secretes hormones throughout the body to initiate growth and development processes [Cloyd: 2013]. Two important hormones regarding Manduca sexta are juvenile hormone and ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. JH and 20E work together at different concentrations during the life of the larvae, regulating the pace of development until they are ready to form into an adult [Johnson: 2018]. JH prevents the larvae from continuing in its life cycle to allow it to obtain enough nutrients to become an adult, while ecdysterone furthers the caterpillars’ development into an adult [Cloyd: 2013]. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are substances that can impact the development of an organism by altering the hormones that help or prevent an organism from growing normally [Cloyd: 2013]. In this experiment, the introduction of an IGR, specifically an ecdysterone blocker, will act as an independent variable and will be compared to a controll group to observe its effects on the weight of Manduca sexta. Our hypothesis is that introduction of an ecdysterone blocker will increase the weight (we will be looking at changes in weight) of Manduca sexta and prevent some of the caterpillars from reaching their commitment pulse following their fourth instar phase. The importance of this experiment is to further understand how the importance of both hormones contributes to the overall life cycle of Manduca sexta and whether IGR introduction promotes or inhibits the development of these caterpillars.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, eight larvae of relatively the same size (length and weight) were split into two groups of four, and they were around the same point in their life cycle close to their fourth instar phase. Two containers were split into four sections with holes for breathing and each larva received approximately ten grams of food. One group was the controll group, receiving only five drops of water in their diet, while the experimental group received five drops of the ecdysterone blocker in their diet. Each caterpillar in the controll group was labeled (1C-4C) and the experimental group (1T-4T). Every other day, for two weeks, the caterpillars were weighed using a balance and their weights were recorded in grams. The caterpillars were given a fresh batch of ten grams of their food with the addition of five drops of water or the ecdysterone blocker. Pictures were taken to depict the progress of the caterpillars. They were housed in the same environmental conditions in an incubator for consistent lifestyle conditions. A Two-Sample t_test was conducted to compare the controll and experimental groups, testing the null hypothesis that introduction of an ecdysterone blocker will not impact the development of Manduca sexta.

Results:
The controll group displayed a mean weight of 7.69g and a standard deviation of 3.16g for the four larvae (Table 1). When considering the percent of change in weight, the controll group had a weight change average of 71.01% (Table 2). As for the treatment group receiving 20E blocker, the mean weight for the larvae was 5.80g with a standard deviation of 1.65g (Table 1). The percent change in weight for the larvae was 14.81% (Table 1). Using the two-sample t_test, we calculated a t-value of 2.5899 and a two-tail p_value of 0.0128 (Table 1). This p_value, if given an alpha level of 0.05, represents this data as statistically significent. Over two weeks, the controll group gained more weight than the treatment group, but there was more variation in the controll group.

Discussion:
When considering the results, it appears that the 20E blocker did not cause the caterpillars to continue to increase weight during a delay of the commitment pulse, meaning that it goes against our alternative hypothesis. We thought that since 20E helps the larvae continue molting into later instars as JH levels decrease, then blocking the 20E hormone would prevent development. When referring to Table 2, it is important to understand the percent change in weight for the controll group was much higher than the treatment group, as the treatment group began to lose weight following its commitment pulse. One factor that our group thought hindered the results of our experiment was that the four larvae used in the treatment group were much heavier than the controll group, which we believe means that the treatment group was already further into their development and closer to reaching the commitment pulse than the controll group. This may also explain the reason for the controll group’s standard deviation being much bigger as the weights throughout the days continued to increase, while the treatment group gained weight but then began to lose weight, remaining closer to the overall average weight throughout the entire experiment.
For future experiments, it will be important that people use caterpillars of approximately the same weight and size for both groups, as this will allow a more accurate comparison of how IGR’s affect the developmental cycle of Manduca sexta. If it were possible, using an increased number of caterpillars would be preferable, and it may also be important to consider using larvae at an earlier stage in their life cycle and track its progress over a longer period of time. Studies regarding IGR’s show that use of these substances are more active when used at earlier parts of the life cycle [Cloyd: 2013]. This suggests that if we tested IGR’s on a younger group of caterpillars, it would possibly lead to a different result.
