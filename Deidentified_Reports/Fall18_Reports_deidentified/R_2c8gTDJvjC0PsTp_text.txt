Title: The Effect of Sivin on Sciatic Nerve Response

Abstract:
Acetylcholine is a chemical that is released in order to activate muscles. The lab provided data that would determine whether an ACH blocker would limit contractions.The experiment was done with a control group and an experimental group that was given the same preparation as the control except it was injected with sivin.  The results showed that there was a p-value of 0.058. This means that between the two groups the group without sivin responded more on average than the group that was treated with sivin. One group responding more means that our hypothesis was supported as the group that was treated with sivin responded less as the JH imitator slowed the growth of the caterpillars. The hypothesis at the start of the lab was that the group that was treated with sivin would respond as much due to the ACH blocker.

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to see how Acetylcholine affects muscle contractions. ACH is a compound in the nervous system that functions as a neurotransmitter. ACH is used as a chemical that is released by motor neurons to activate muscles. The acetylcholine also plays a role in relaxing most muscles like the arterial smooth muscle for example [Furchgott:1980]. Acetylcholine is a very versatile compound and is seen in many parts of the body. Acetylcholine even plays a role in causing constriction of arteries[Ludmer:1986]. A study of ACH can allow more information to be learned about the process of muscle contractions and what can inhibit or facilitate contractions. As a result, the lab group will be able to analyze the ACH’s effect on muscle contractions by utilizing an ACH blocker. The hypothesis before the lab is that a group of frog leg’s treated by an ACH blocker (sivin) will limit contractions while the group that isn’t treated with sivin will be able to contract more.


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used each being tested first as a control and then after being treated with sivin they were tested again. The frog legs were obtained and cleaned. Then, each leg was made wet with frog Ringer’s solution. Using a dissecting probe the lab group separated the thigh muscles. Next, sciatic nerve was dissected from the frog by skinning the leg with forceps. The nerve and muscle were  separated   from the connective tissue using a needle and forceps. Electrical pulses were used to observe nerve stimulation. The effects of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude was then analyzed. The twitch response was recorded with every amplitude that was tested. Then, a paired t-test was used to analyze the data to determine whether or not there is a significant difference. 



Results:
The data was initially a large variety of responses of each leg for each stimulation, but to summarize this data an average of each response’s voltage at each magnitude of stimulation was used. These averages were then represented in a bar graph with the response being on the Y access and the amount of stimulation represented on the x-axis. For each stimulation value there  is one bar for the control sciatic response and one for the experimental sciatic response. All of the values in this graph are measured in volts. These responses were used to represent the overall trend in changing responses for these caterpillars. After all of the data was collected a paired t-test was used with a p-value of 0.058.


Discussion:
The first two legs had experimental values that were very much so supportive of the hypothesis with the experimental values being significantly lower than the control values at every amplitude. However, with the third leg the sciatic response reliability varied which could explain the high p-value. This could have been caused by fatigue or red leg’s disease which are both common things for a frog to experience and would both cause the leg to respond poorly [Charles:1905]. This is likely an outlier however as both other legs showed good data and that the experimental group responded less than the control. To further improve this experiment we could have used more samples and also recorded more responses in order to gain a wider scope when analyzing the frog legs. However, the paired-t-test proves that the hypothesis was supported as it showed a significant difference between the two groups.
