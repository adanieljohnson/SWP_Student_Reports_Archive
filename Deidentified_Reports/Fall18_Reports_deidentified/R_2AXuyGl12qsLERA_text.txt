Title: Effects of Lidocaine on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens 

Abstract:
The nervous system helps to regulate homeostasis and coordinate movement and respond to stimulus. One way that the nervous system works is to controll the Na gates and action potentials that work to coordinate the movement of muscles. One way that muscle movement can be tracked is through muscle twitch. In this experiment, the effects of lidocaine on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle in Rania pipiens was conducted to determine if Na gate blockers would decrease the twitch reaction in Rania pipiens. We used the gastrocnemus muscle of three separate frogs and tested them at their thresholds with and without lidocaine injections. After testing we conducted 3 separate paired t_tests on each leg and found values of 0.0077, 1.71 x 10-5 and 7.79 x 10-5 for legs 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Based on these results we were able to reject our null hypothesis. WE can use this information to make hypotheses on the effect of Na gate enhancers and to further understand the relationship between muscle movement and Na gates.

Introduction:
Organisms have two main systems that regulate, coordinate homeostasis and respond to external stimuli: the endocrine (hormonal) system and the nervous system. The endocrine system is slow compared to the nervous system, because it uses neurotransmitters that have to reach a specific point in order to signal a change happening. The nervous system on the other hand, can respond to stimuli in milliseconds because it depends on electric signals to send action potentials down through the body of the organism. Sodium is an extremely important ion in the expression and movement of action potentials. When an external stimulus goes across the membrane, opening Na+ gates and flooding the membrane with Na+, causing depolarization, and once it reaches threshold, an action potential moves through the membrane, prompting movement or some sort of change in the organism. As the action potential moves through the membrane, K+ gates open, repolarizing the membrane and bringing it back to its resting potential. Na+ plays a huge role in the movement of action potentials, because without it depolarization would not occur and the action potential would be unable to move down the membrane.  Scientist Charles Strichartz conducted an experiment that tested the effects of lidocaine (a Na+ gate blocker) had on the sciatic nerve of a frog leg. The use of lidocaine on the nerve caused a much slower and reduced reaction in the movement in the leg. The researchers hypothesized that there were two possible places where the lidocaine was inhibiting the Na from going through the channel, one directly on and in the channel, and the other on the axon membrane. In the first hypothesis, the external stimulus would not change the channels affinity for lidocaine, meaning that lidocaine binding would occur whether there was a stimulus present or not. In the second hypothesis, where the binding site is on the axon membrane, would require a change in the membrane potential for lidocaine to bind to the receptor [Strichartz: 1973]. Both are very interesting hypothesis, but this experiment only tests for the reaction in the nerve, it did not show how lidocaine effects the muscle. Muscle twitching is when the leg muscles move due to an external stimulus and are measured using voltages. The muscle itself does not create voltages, but the system that can be used to measure the muscle twitch converts the data into volts to better display the incoming information. In this experiment, we will be testing how lidocaine injections effect muscular movement in the gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens. We hypothesize that the twitch threshold for muscles with lidocaine injections will be much smaller  than those without because of the closed Na gates.

Materials and Method:
To prepare the frogs for testing, the skin was peeled off the leg and the sciatic nerve was found and isolated in the thigh muscle. Ringer solution was applied as needed to prevent the muscles from drying out. Once the muscle was exposed, the gastrocnemus muscle was cut from the rest of the leg, right and the far end of the achilles tendon. A string was tied around the base of the achilles tendon and was attached to the iWorx electrophysical recorder and the software was set up to record the twitch voltage of the muscle. Once the software was set up, the threshold of the frog muscle was determined by moving from 0.5 volts to 2.0 volts in 0.5 increments in order to be accurate. After the threshold was found (1.0 V for leg 1, 1.5 V for leg 2, and 1.0 V for leg 3), the voltage measurement of the leg twitch was recorded four times at the threshold voltage. After the first leg controll testing was complete, 0.1 Ml of 0.25 mmol of Lidocaine was injected into the frog muscle: half in the top of the muscle and half in the bottom of the muscle. The lidocaine was  Then the muscle was tested at the original voltages four times. This process was completed for the other two legs.  Once all of the trials were recorded, paired t_tests were conducted for each leg and graphs were made to visualize the comparison between the two tests.

Results:
Paired t_tests. We used raw data from each trial for each leg to conduct separate paired t_tests. For the first leg, a p_value of 0.00077 was found, for the second leg a p_value of 1.71 x 10-5 and for the third leg a p_value of 7.79 x 10-5. The paired t_test for the combined data is 1.25 x 10-5. 
During the experiment, it was observed that the muscles with the lidocaine injection reacted at a much smaller rate than the muscles without lidocaine. In Figure 1, we can see this huge gap between the twitches of the two different treatment groups. It was observed that the smaller leg reacted to the lidocaine at a much higher intensity than the other, larger legs. 


Discussion:
Based on the paired t_test results, the null hypothesis can be rejected; Na+ gate inhibitors in the form of Lidocaine do have an effect on the twitch voltage of the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania piniens. From Figure 1, we can see the large difference between the average muscle twitches without lidocaine injections and the average muscle twitches with lidocaine injections. This occurs because the muscle does not have has much access to Na+, which slows down the reaction of the action potential and causes a smaller reaction in the muscle. During testing, it was observed that the differences in twitch voltage was greatest between legs 1 and 2, but the difference between leg 3 was not as large. This could be due to the fact that the gastrocnemus muscle for leg 3 was significently smaller than the other two muscles. It was also observed that as testing continued in each leg, the visible twitch decreased, and the numerical recording also showed a slight decrease in voltage. This is due to fatigue in the muscle as testing continued, especially during the second round of testing with the lidocaine injections.   This experiment is useful because it reveals the importance of Na+ in action potentials and in the nervous system in general, but it also shows that while Na+ is important, it is not the only chemical in the body that the nervous system uses to cause movement, because even though the reaction was significently smaller, there was still a reaction present. In the experiment conducted by Strichartz, they hypothesized that lidocaine primarily worked through two different ideas of binding sites; one where the membrane potential does not need to change and one where it has to be changed in order bind. The first hypothesis would possibly not allow any Na into the cell, but the possibility of Na entering the cell in the second hypothesis is higher. Relating this experiment to the experiment described and discussed in this paper, we see that there is a big relationship between Na gates and movement, but it also raises the question of what would happen if the sensitivity of Na gates were enhanced or raised. If an experiment were conducted that used Na+ gate enhancers instead of inhibitors, we would hypothesize an opposite reaction to the one seen in this experiment; the twitch reaction of would increase with a smaller/subdued external stimulus due to hypersensitivity in the Na+ gates.  This experiment was successfully able to reject the null hypothesis and confirm a relationship between Na gates and movement in muscles.
