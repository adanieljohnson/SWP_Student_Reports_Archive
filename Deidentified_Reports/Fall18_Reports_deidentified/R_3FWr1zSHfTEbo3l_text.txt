Title: IP3 Mediated Signal Transduction Pathway and Rate of Migration in Physarum Polycephalum 

Abstract:
Physarum Polycephalum, commonly known as slime mold, is a multinucleate organism that is found in wet and dark environments and has similar intracellular signaling pathways as humans. An important IP3 protein pathway allows for activation of phospholipase C which is involved in cell movement. In this experiment, the IP3 mediated signaling pathway in Physarum polycephalum was studied. The purpose was to observe the effects of both an activator and an inhibitor of phospholipase C on physarum growth. A23187 and neomycin were used as test substances. A23187 activates phospholipase C and neomycin inhibits the production of phospholipase C. It was hypothesized that because phospholipase C inhibits neomycin,  the physarum would not be able to move toward the food when it is presented with the neomycin. The results of this experiment were inconclusive because the physarum inhibited by neomycin did not grow at all and the physarum activated by A23187 had little growth. 


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold mass of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane. It behaves as a unit due to signaling pathways. Physarum will crawl towards food by using actin microfilaments. In a study done, it was found that the cell motility of the plasmodium is generated by oscillation phenomena observed in the partial bodies, which interact through the tubular structures. This happens through signal transduction pathways. [Takamatsu: 2009]. A key signal transduction pathway in the cells of physarum is an IP3 mediated path. The path involves ion gated channels and the flow of calcium to stimulate or inhibit protein activity. The effector enzyme of this pathway is phospholipase C (PLC) which cleaves a membrane phospholipid. This allows for the activation of protein kinase which controlls proteins. This pathway allows for the movement of physarum [Cell Biology laboratory Manual]. 
The biological question explores the significance of phospholipase C on chemotaxis behavior within the biological signaling pathway of Physarum Polycephalum. It is predicted that the physarum will grow toward phospholipase C activator A23187 and grow away from phospholipase C inhibitor Neomycin. This is because Phospholipase C and IP3 are significent second messengers in the amplification of external stimuli and activation of calcium channels in cell signaling [Cell Biology laboratory Manual]. A two sample two test will be used to test for significance. This question could have particular significance because in a research study done, it was found that neomycin acted against resistant bacteria [Waksman et al, 1949]. If neomycin limits the growth of physarum polycephalum it could also limit the growth of hazardous organisms which would be beneficial for researchers. Furthermore, signaling transduction pathways are important to study because they can be gateways to information on how to cure diseases. For example, in a study done on schizophrenia it was observed that an alteration in kinases led to the development of schizophrenia [McGuire et al: 2017]. Studies on these pathways can help researchers develop medication to cure symptoms of illnesses caused by issues within a signal transduction pathway.  


Materials and Method:
We obtained 8 water-agar petri dishes. Then we prepared the chemical plates. We made a 1X concentration of each chemical by placing 0.5Ml of A23187 and 9.5Ml of water in a centrifuge tube to dilute. This was poured over a water agar plate and let to sit for 10 mins. After, we poured the remaining solution out and cut out 1cm by 1cm squares.  We repeated the same dilution using neomycin. Next, we placed a flat metal spatula and forceps in a tube of ethanol to sterilize and then wiped clean with a kimwipe. Then we cut out 3 1cm by 1cm squares in 6 of the agar plates. We removed 2 of the squares from each plate. The one that remained was the blank. We resterilized the spatula. Next, we opened the physarum stock plate and used the spatula to cut a 1cm by 1cm square. We placed a physarum square in each of the 6 petri dishes in the center well just made. We resterilized the spatula. Next we opened the A23187 chemical plate and cut out 1cm by 1cm squares and placed in the well of 3 petri dishes. After, we opened the neomycin chemical plate and cut out 1cm by 1cm squares and placed one in each of the remaining 3 plates. We replaced the cover on the water agar plates and taped the lid down. We then wrapped the plates in aluminum foil and placed in a drawer. We observed them 24 hours later.


Results:
The results were inconclusive, and therefore statistically insignificent. Out of 6 plates only one showed growth. The plates containing neomycin showed no growth at all and only one plate containing A23187 had growth. Therefore, no statistical tests were run and no results were gained. The graph shows what might have been expected if the physarum had grown. The rate of growth when the signal pathway was activated would have been greater than that of the inhibitor, neomycin. The neomycin would have had negative growth and the A23187 plates would have grown in the positive direction toward the A23187 solution. 



Discussion:
The results were inconclusive because only one of the water agar plates containing A23187 had any growth. The plate containing neomycin had no growth at all so nothing can be concluded. We expected results that indicated that neomycin inhibits the growth of physarum. This would have given insight into the significance of the role of the IP3 mediated pathway in physarum growth. Additionally, we hoped that the A23187 facilitated growth of the physarum because it allows for the production of phospholipase C. The lack of growth that we observed in the neomycin plates may have been due to the fact that neomycin inhibited phospholipase C which would lead to the physarum not being able to send appropriate signals to move toward food.  In a study done, physarum showed positive chemotaxis to solutions of glucose, maltose, mannose, and galactose but did not respond to sucrose, fructose or ribose [Carlile: 1971]. This shows how the physarum is resistant to grow toward many substances. Another study found that plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum are indifferent to sucrose when it comes to chemotaxis [Coman: 1940]. So it is possible the physarum was also indifferent to the test substances used in this experiment. In addition, if humidity drops or food becomes unavailable, the plasmodium enters a stage called a sclerotium, its hibernation state, where it hardens and does not grow [Johnson, 2016]. Water agar plates were not a source of food which indicates that because there was a lack of food for physarum, growth could have been inhibited. Furthermore, the stock plates were found in a warmer temperature condition than favorable, which can attribute to Physarum transitioning into the resting phase where movement is not observed. The resting phase is a major part of the developmental cycle of Physarum and movement ceases in response to unfavorable environmental conditions such as direct light and heat [Dove and Rusch 2017]. The room in which the experiment was carried out is much colder than the incubator where the stock were kept, and also the tin foil used in the experiment made the plate much darker than the organism had experienced prior to experimentation. This change in temperature and change of light most likely led to the transition of Physarum into its resting phase, causing our results to be inconclusive. Also, a study done showed that plasmodial development may be encouraged by adding 5 Ml of sterile, glass distilled water to the surface of an agar petri dish [Carlile: 1971]. So in future experiments, this technique could be beneficial and help produce results. The study should be completely redone to confirm the status of the initial hypothesis. This experiment was deemed inconclusive due to experimental error and faulty stock plates.
