Title: Effect of availability of shelter on aggressiveness in Betta splendins

Abstract:
	Aggressive behavior with respect to availability of shelter was studied in betta fish (Betta splendins).  Three sets of fish were placed in tanks with opaque barriers between them; aggressive behavior, here characterized as protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes, was measured with and without shelter.  Availability of shelter was shown to be associated with increased aggression.  This may be associated with reproductive success and survival, related to the need to defend the mucus-bubble nests.


Introduction:
The Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) is known for its agnostic behaviors.  When they see each other, males of this species will perform elaborate displays of aggression.  There are two types of aggressive behaviors in bettas: broadside movements, which are performed when one fish turns its side to the other, and facing movements, which are performed when one fish faces another.   This experiment focuses on the most aggressive kind of facing behavior: the protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes, which look like a red mane.  The ease of observing aggressive behaviors in bettas, as well as the reliability of these behaviors as an indicator of male motivation and condition, makes them an ideal model organism for this experiment [Doutrelant: 2001].
	Bettas’ aggressive behaviors consume significent amounts of energy [Haller: 1995]; why invest this energy in something not directly connected to reproduction or acquiring food?  In order for a behavior to be evolutionarily advantageous, there must be some kind of benefit to offset the cost [Haller: 1995]; one such explanation may involve protecting the mucus-bubble nests that males build [Clotfelter: 2007].  Aggression in bettas is dependent upon the distance between the male’s nest and the opponent [Bronstein: 1981]; this makes sense considering the need to protect eggs.  If bettas are known to be territorial as regards their nests, it is important to know whether they will defend shelter as well, as that is hard to come by in their natural habitat of sluggish and muddy water.
	As bettas are known to be highly aggressive when defending their nests, it was predicted that availability of shelter would lead to increased aggressiveness.  This was expected to manifest itself in increased protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes.



Materials and Method:
Three sets of male Betta splendins fish, six in total, were procured and placed in two tanks.  Between each two fish, an opaque barrier was placed, in order to prevent unintentional initiation of aggressive behavior.  From each set of two fish, one was chosen to be observed.  The fish were first observed without a shelter in their tank, as a controll.  The barrier was removed, and the interactions were observed for five minutes.  Duration of the red mane behavior was recorded.  This was repeated for all three fish.
	Following this, a shelter was placed in the side of the tank occupied by the fish previously observed.  The fish were given five minutes to get accustomed to having the shelter and to rest, as aggressive behavior is energetically expensive.  Again, the barrier was removed, and the fish observed for five minutes.  The duration of the red mane behavior was recorded.  The data were compared using a paired t_test.


Results:
The fish were observed to be more aggressive when they had access to a shelter (Figure 1).  On average, fish with access to shelter showed red mane behavior for 19.775 seconds longer than when they did not have a shelter in the tank.  The data were shown to be statistically significent, with a p_value of 0.04.


Discussion:
The hypothesis was confirmed; bettas are more aggressive when they have access to a shelter.  The average difference between controll and test was more than a quarter of a minute, a not insignificent amount of time.  This does not come as a surprise, as bettas are known to be extremely territorial and aggressive when defending their nests [Bronstein: 1981].  Territorial behavior and aggressiveness are probably related to increased reproductive success and survival [Bronstein: 1981].
	One interesting follow-up to this experiment may involve pharmacological manipulation of behavior.  It is known that serotonin decreases aggressiveness in bettas [Clotfelter: 2007]; further research may look at other psychoactive substances and their effects on territoriality and aggression.  Stimulants, such as caffeine, may result in increased aggression, but research on this subject has not been done.
It is important to note that audience matters when it comes to aggressive behaviors in bettas [Doutrelant: 2001].  This experiment only focused on male-male interaction with no other audience.  An alternative experiment could be done in which males interact with each other in the presence of a female or another (third) male.  The interactions may be different due to the evolutionarily programmed need to protect the bubble-nests. 
The aggressive behaviors of betta fish give insight into the evolution of behavior and the role of behavior in determining fitness.  This experiment showed that shelter may play an important role in aggressive behavior, in a similar way to how nest building and protection necessitates agonism.
