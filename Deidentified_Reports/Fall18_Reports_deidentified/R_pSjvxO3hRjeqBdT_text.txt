Title: The effect of detergents on the photosynthetic rate of Spinacia Oleracea 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a significent natural process that produces Oxygen as a waste product which is a fundamental nutrient for life for many organisms on Earth. In this experiment, we focused on the various effects that a single detergent (Charlie’s Soap) had on the rate of photosynthetic activity of Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Our experiment aimed to determine whether or not Charlie’s Soap detergent would reduce, significently, the photosynthetic activity of the spinach, given that detergents are found to pollute the environment. Spinach was chosen as the model organism for this experiment as it is usually available throughout the year and is relatively inexpensive.We used a “Hill Reaction” assay for our experiment in order to create spinach chloroplast samples at a stock detergent concentration as well as a 1: 1 dilution detergent concentration (in addition to positive/negative controlls). For our experiment, we can say that our results are statistically significent, additionally, we were consistently able to see that both the stock concentration sample as well as the 1: 1 dilution sample had lower changes in average absorbance compared to the positive controll.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the natural process by which plants are able to use solar energy (sunlight) to create food from water and carbon dioxide. The most significent component to this process is Chlorophyll, as it creates Oxygen as a waste product. Oxygen is a gas that is considered to be essential for various organisms on Earth as it allows them to breath; in saying that, however, technological advancements, specifically in the fields of industry, have lead to the inadvertent production of pollution. This in turn harms the environment in many ways, one of them being the disruption of photosynthesis. Prior to conducting this experiment, we researched a similar study in order to form a hypothesis. In an experiment conducted in 2010, Jovanic tested the effect of laundry detergent on bean leaves. After 21 days of treating and watering the plants with a solution which had been mixed with laundry detergent, he saw that the photosynthetic activity of the plants with mixed solution was approximately 45% less than that the controll (no laundry solution) [Jovanic, 2010]. We decided to run a similar experiment on our own, where we measure the effect of various concentrations of detergent on the rate at which electrons are transferred (indirectly measuring rate of photosynthesis). For our experiment, we obtained multiple leaves of Spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) in order to obtain samples of enriched chloroplasts. The samples of chloroplasts were treated with “Charlie's Soap” detergent at a controll (0%), stock concentration and a 1: 1 dilution (with water). In order to determine the rates at which photosynthesis was occurring (Indirectly) we used the hill reaction and measured absorbance change. For our experiment, we hypothesized that the plants treated by the Charlie's Soap detergent are likely to experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Method:
The chloroplasts of spinach were isolated by centrifuging them twice (200 x G for 3 min, and 1000 x G for 10 min). The chloroplast sample was then used to prepare the hill reaction assay, which was treated with a stock concentration, and a 1: 1 dilution of water/detergent. The negative controll group was treated without chloroplast or laundry detergent. And the positive controll just contained chloroplast (no detergent). The tubes/treatments that had laundry detergent were prepared using 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of the cold reaction buffer and (100 Mm) and a phosphate of pH 6.5.The negative and positive controlls were also created using similar means, the difference being whether or not chloroplast were included in the sample. After each controll/treatment was prepared, the absorbance was measured at 10 minute intervals, for a total of 30 minutes. Lastly, a two - sample t_test was used to analyze the extent to which photosynthesis was inhibited in each of the samples after having been exposed to stock and 1: 1 dilution of detergent, by looking at the percent change in the absorbance of DCPIP.


Results:
After conducting the experiment, there was a decrease in photosynthetic activity from the treatment of spinach chloroplasts (more so than the controll group). During the total 30 minute time period of which the experiment was conducted, on average (in terms of percent change of absorbance) the positive controll sample had the largest difference in the initial value recorded, and the recorded value of absorbance at the end of the experiment. The opposite is true of the negative controll. In terms of the treatment groups, the stock concentration has the largest difference over the 30 minute period. For the 2 sample T test, for the stock vs no detergent, the following values were produced: t_stat =15.256, d.f =6 , P= 0.00000501 for the 1: 1 dilution of detergent versus no detergent, the following values were produced: t_stat =11.816, d.f = 6 , P= 0.0000222 	

Discussion:
The data collected throughout this experiment supported our original hypothesis, which states that the samples treated by the Charlie's Soap detergent are likely to experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity. Since our data is statistically significent, we can reject the null hypothesis and state that there is evidence to support the alternative (in our case, meaning that there is statistical likelihood that a relationship between photosynthetic activity and detergent concentration is caused by something other than chance). Both of our experimental groups, stock concentration and 1: 1 dilution did produce data (at a statistically significent level, p = 0.00000501, and 0.0000222 respectively) that supports the notion that pollutants inhibit photosynthetic activity. This data is also aligned with desptovic’s work that displayed that bean plants were impacted by detergents.[Jovanic, 2010]. Biologically speaking, we can anticipate the experimental groups to have a lower change in absorbance over time as the introduction of detergents causes chloroplasts to burst, leading, in turn, to a decreased rate of photosynthesis as the chloroplast are rendered innate.One of the potential sources of error for our experiment could have been the procedural error of introducing air bubbles into our measurement apparatus, as this could have lead to relatively inaccurate measurements.This could have explained why for the “1: 1 dilution” experimental group, we see that there is a lower change in absorbance over time compared to the stock concentration, as we would anticipate the dilution having a larger percent change value over time (given that photosynthesis is more likely to occur at a faster given that the dilution solution is not as strong of a pollutant as the stock detergent). Either that, or it is as simple as us mislabeling our experimental groups during the experiment. Aside from sources of error, there were various limitations to our experiment as well. To start, we only tested two (or 3, if you count 0%) varying concentrations of detergent. Increasing variability of the concentrations of  “Charlie’s Soap”  detergent would have reproduced conditions for similar to those representative to its environment. Additionally, we only tested one form/brand of detergent is a much more severe limitation to the experiment as there are multiple forms of pollution (in relation to detergent) that pollute the environment. And since there are various types of pollutants, they may all each have their own respective effects on the photosynthetic process, in terms of severity and the means through which they stop photosynthesis. In terms of expanding the scope of this experiment, we could potentially test a variety of plants to see how differently various plants respond to detergents (to see if certain plants are more resistant to pollutants than others). For future study, I find it beneficial to test how various pollutants affect the rate of photosynthetic activity, I believe that in doing so, we can see how various advancements in technology affect the rate at which a plant conducts photosynthesis.
