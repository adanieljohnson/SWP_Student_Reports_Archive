Title: Using the Hill Reaction to Measure the Rate of Electron Transport in Kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) and Spinach (Spinacia oleracea)

Abstract:
The differences in electron transport activity between kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) were evaluated in both a normal light control and enhanced light experimental group to demonstrate the properties of photosynthesis and electron transport. The hill reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light. DCIP was used as the alternative electron acceptor. The hypothesis is that there would be a change between the rates between the two plants and between the plants and their relative control. Enriched chloroplast preparations were made for both spinach and kale plants by using grinding buffer and isolating the pellet using a centrifuge. Absorbances were measured at time zero, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Absorbances decreased over time for both the control and experimental groups. There was a significant difference across the plants and their respective controls as well as between the two plants (P=0.00385, P=0.0220, P=0.00834). 

Introduction:
Many cellular processes require added energy from chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction potential and an electrical/chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer in order for the reaction to proceed [WFUBD: 2018]. All three of these forms of energy are used by plants, some protists, and certain bacteria from capturing and storing energy from the sun in a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, the chlorophyll molecules of the chloroplasts absorb solar radiation which allows for light-dependent reactions and then light-independent reactions to occur [WFUBD: 2018]. These light-dependent reactions produce a separation of charges from excited electrons carrying photon energy across the reaction centers in the membrane [Youvan: 1987]. Electrons end up on the outer surface of the membrane and the positive charged molecules end up on the inner surface of the membrane [Youvan: 1987]. This results in stored energy which is used to cleave water to release electrons for replacement and produce a proton gradient that powers ATP synthesis. The ATP and NADPH electrons are then used in light-independent reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from carbon dioxide [WFUBD: 2018].   

The hill reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light. The hill reaction reduces an electron acceptor with water. Measuring the reduction of NADP+ is very difficult. DCIP is used as the alternative electron acceptor since it is easier to measure. Oxidized DCIP is a compound with a dark blue color and aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600 nm. Reduced DCIP is a compound that is colorless with conjugated double bonds [WFUBD: 2018]. This color change can allow the electron transport to be measured as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm. 

The hill reaction will be used to measure the rate of electron transport between kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in a control and light experimental condition. The hypothesis is that there would be a change between the rates between the two plants and between the plants and their relative control. This hypothesis stems from a 1957 study that found the hill reaction activity in spinach leaves were much higher than that of red kidney beans suggesting that enriched chloroplasts in different plants respond differently [Jagendorf: 1957].


Materials and Methods:
Four medium sized spinach and kale leaves were used in this experiment. The leaves were deveined and rinsed. We added the spinach leaves and added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer and grinded until a thick paste formed. Another 10 mL of cold grinding buffer was added and grinded until slurry consistency. A three-layered cheese cloth was used to strain the slurry and the strained liquid was added to a 50 mL centrifuge tube to be spun at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatants were poured out of the tube and into a new 50 mL centrifuge to be spun at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The pellet was isolated, and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added and stirred gently with a transfer pipet. This was then repeated to make an enriched chloroplast preparation.

13 large test tubes were prepared. 6 tubes were made with 100µL enriched spinach chloroplasts, 6 mL water, 2 mL 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL 100 mM phosphate pH 6.5. 3 of these were used as the spinach controls and the others were used as the spinach light condition. 6 tubes were made with 100µL enriched kale chloroplasts, 6 mL water, 2 mL 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL 100 mM phosphate pH 6.5. 3 of these were used as the kale controls and the others were used as the kale light condition. A blank was made with 8 mL water and 2 mL of 100 mM phosphate pH 6.5. The enriched chloroplasts were added last and were mixed immediately to be transferred to spectrometer cuvettes. The spectrometer was set to 600 nm and blanked. Data points were taken at time zero, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The controls were placed in a dimly lit room and the light conditions were placed under a lamp. To evaluate the data, we used a two-sample t-test to determine significance. An alpha level of α=0.05 was used.


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, the kale control (n=3) had a total percent change of 27.3% after 30 minutes. The kale in light (n=3) had a total percent change of 44.1% after 30 minutes. The P value from two-sample t-test for the kale light sample with the kale control was 0.00385. The spinach control (n=3) had a total percent change of 43.4% after 30 minutes. The spinach in light (n=3) had a total percent change of 79.4% after 30 minutes. The P value for the spinach light sample and control was 0.0220. The P value for the kale experimental light sample and the spinach experimental light sample was 0.00834. 

Discussion:
The differences in electron transport activity between kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea) were evaluated in both a normal light control and enhanced light experimental group to demonstrate the properties of photosynthesis and electron transport. The hill reaction is the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light. As electrons become excited from photons, they move between electron acceptors. DCIP can be used as an alternative electron acceptor that is easily measured in a spectrometer at 600 nm. 

The hypothesis was there would be a change between the rates between the two plants and between the plants and their relative control. The results were significant, and the hypothesis was supported. There was an overall significant decrease in absorbance of DCIP between the two controls and two enhanced light conditions and between the kale and spinach chloroplasts. The kale control had a total percent change of 27.3% while the kale experimental had a percent change of 44.1% (Figure 1). There was a significant decrease in absorbance of DCIP between the kale control and experimental groups (P=0.00385). The spinach control had a total percent change of 43.4% while the spinach experimental had a percent change of 79.4% (Figure 1). There was a significant decrease in absorbance of DCIP between the spinach control and experimental groups (P=0.0220). The percent difference between the two experimental groups was 35.3%. The spinach experimental group had a significantly greater decrease of DCIP than the kale experimental group (P=0.00834) and therefore had more electron activity. This data supports the findings in Jagendorf’s study that the electron activity between two plants are different [Jagendorf: 1957].

The control and experimental conditions decreased in absorbance because as DCIP accepted electrons it became reduced and changed from dark blue to colorless. A decrease was expected in the control since there was still moderate light. The significant difference between the two plants could have been due to spinach’s high α-tocopherol, β-carotene, and lutein concentrations compared to grasses and other green leafy vegetables, including Kale [Gedi: 2017]. These antioxidant substances are synthesized in the chloroplasts and protect membrane components [Reddy: 2004]. Tocopherols specifically help the production of quinone which is a known contributor to cyclic transportation [Munné-Bosch: 2002]. Future studies could be done to determine if higher concentrations of tocopherols increase the rate of electron transport between different plants. Limitations in this study include the relatively low sample size (n=3) and inability to test all samples in the spectrometer at once.
