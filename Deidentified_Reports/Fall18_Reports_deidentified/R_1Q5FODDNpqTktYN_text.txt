Title: The Use of Lidocaine in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Anura caused Lower Muscle Contractions at Higher Stimuli 

Abstract:
Nerves stimulate muscle contractions when they are brought up to action potential. This occurs when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes sodium channels to open. The opening of these sodium channels allows sodium to flow in and generate an action potential of the muscle fiber. The opening of these sodium channels is required to get the cell to threshold to cause an action potential. In this experiment, the use of lidocaine was used in three frog legs to determine if the legs would have a lower response to the same stimulus used on frog legs that had been unaffected. A myogram was used to determine the levels of response and a paired t_test was run: Paired T-test: t_stat=8.481, d.f.=9, P=1.38E-05. The results of this test were significent, and the alternate hypothesis was accepted. This shows the importance of sodium and sodium channels in the action potential system in our cells. 


Introduction:
There are individual myofibers in vertebrates and invertebrates that are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups called skeletal muscles. These skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord. These nerves stimulate muscle contractions when they are brought up to action potential. This occurs when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes sodium channels to open. The opening of these sodium channels allows sodium to flow in and generate an action potential of the muscle fiber. The opening of these sodium channels is required to get the cell to threshold to cause an action potential. The spike threshold is logarithmically dependent on sodium channel density [Brett:2010]. Lidocaine is a drug that inhibits the opening of sodium channels. In this experiment, lidocaine was used in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Anora. It was hypothesized that if lidocaine was introduced into the gastrocnemus muscle, there would be a much lower response to the same stimuli used on an unaffected gastrocnemus muscle. 

Materials and Method:
There were three frog legs that were used in this lab, and they were first all prepared to complete the experiment. The skin of the leg was grabbed at the top and pulled off in the direction of the frog’s foot. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscles, starting at the top of the leg moving down towards the knee. At this point the sciatic nerve was revealed and the it was gently freed from its attaching connective tissue. The sciatic nerve was not pulled to tightly, exposed too far down toward the knee, or exposed to metal during this procedure. The gastrocnemus muscle was then separated from the bone. The muscle was then cut at the lower end with scissors, making sure to include some of the achilleas. The achilleas was then tied right where it met with the gastrocnemus muscle and hung so the muscle was at 90 degrees. The sciatic nerve was then put on the probes and stimulated with different stimuli; 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0. The legs were kept moist with frog ringer’s solution. A myogram was used to determine the muscles response at each stimulus. This was done for all three legs and then they were injected with 1Ml of lidocaine directly into the gastrocnemus muscle. They then went through the same experiment again. A paired t_test was used to determine significance of the experiment. 

Results:
Paired T-test: t_stat=8.481, d.f.=9, P=1.38E-05. 
There was a significent difference between the controll average and the experimental average. The averages of the experimental group were much lower than that of the controll group. 

Discussion:
The results of the t_test show the data collected in this experiment were significent and the alternate hypothesis was accepted. It took longer for the experimental group to respond to the stimulus (Table 1). When the experimental group legs started to respond, the values were significently lower than that of the controll group (Figure 1). This is due to the use of lidocaine in the gastrocnemus muscle. The results show that lidocaine did not completely block all of the sodium channels from opening. An action potential was eventually reached because some sodium channels remained open and a threshold level of excitation was reached [Brett:2010].  If less sodium channels are open, it will be harder for the cell to depolarize enough to cause an action potential, so a higher stimulus is required to create a response in the experimental group. The cells were less depolarized in the experimental group, which meant when the cells created the action potential the response would be lower. This experiment could be done again using a larger amount of lidocaine to see if there is a base number of sodium channels that would not be affected, or if there is a way to keep the leg from giving a response at all.
