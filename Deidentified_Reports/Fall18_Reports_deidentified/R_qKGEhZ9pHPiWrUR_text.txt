Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Neuromuscular Activity Before and After Injection  Abstract 

Abstract:
The semantic neuromuscular system is made of myofibers motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction released of ACH from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Ach binds to receptors opening sodium channels. The Ca2+  is released and contracts the muscle. The release of ca2 activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. In the experiment, we tested this on Rana Pipiens gastrocnemius muscles by injecting caffeine. The caffeine caused for more Ca2+ to enter into the muscle which caused for a longer period of contraction. The frog legs were tested by first finding the threshold. Then we needed to inject the muscle with caffeine. In our experiment our legs reached temporal summation and then tetanus occurred. Each leg you could see was contracting quicker and stronger. In the end of the experiment we found that our hypothesis of we would observe the increase in amplitude of muscle contraction to be supported by the experiment we performed.


Introduction:
Introduction
Rana Pipiens are a type of frog that we used in this experiment. Rana Pipiens are a type of Northern Leopard Frog found in a wide range of areas from the Hudson Bay south to northern Virginia and to the West as far as Southern British Columbia and Eastern Washington and Oregon. They are slime green and brown and vary in length from 5-11 cm.[ Stebbins:2003]. Gastrocnemius muscle is placed in the calf of the frog legs. We  used this particular muscle because it is similar to humans gastrocnemius muscle.  Neuromuscular are synapses’ between a motor neuron and skeletal muscle. Communication happens between the neuron and muscle nerve cells. [Advisor:2015] Contraction is then caused by muscles shortening due to chemical changes in the fiber.[Edition:2018] Caffeine causes for Ca2+ to enter into the myofibers and causes the muscles to instantly contract. Injecting caffeine may cause the muscles to contract and reach maximal contraction which is called tetanus.  Our hypothesis is that we will observe an increase in amplitude of muscle contraction when caffeine is injected, 


Materials and Methods:
First in the experiment, we prepared three frog legs from the species Rana pipiens by degloving the skin, separating the gastrocnemius muscle and following the instructions given on Sakai. The leg was sprayed with Ringer’s solution. Finding the threshold we than began the experiment by attaching the probes from a device named I Worx TA. First, setting the frequency to 1, the number of pulses to 1 and the pulse width to 5 msec. Then changing the number of pulses to 5 and the voltage to 0.5 V more than the threshold. The new amplitude and pulse number was recorded without caffeine injected. The pulse recorded 5 times. Then 0.1 ml of caffeine was injected as 5 pulses was recorded. At each pulse pre and post injection a specific amplitude was recorded. The process was repeated for the two other legs. We used a Paired T-Test to determine the mean and the standard deviation between the three frog legs.

Results:
Injecting the Gastrocnemius muscle with caffeine caused the muscles to contract and reach summation. This caused the muscle to have tetanus. As we searched for the threshold we noticed that the muscle became fatigued when repeatedly contracting muscle. The mean from the pre injection for frog leg 1 is (0.4538±0.005), frog leg 2 (0.0472±0.004) and frog leg 3 mean is (1.3408±0.020). The post injections mean for frog leg 1 is (0.7558±0.002), frog leg 2 is (1.022±0) and frog leg 3 is (1.9904±0.030). The mean of each frog leg muscle increased once injected with caffeine. Also, the frog legs muscles post injection contracted higher in each leg. Statistically the post injection frog legs contracted stronger and higher. The p value of frog leg 1 was (1.04E-9), frog leg 2 (1.25E-10) and frog leg 3 (1.04E-8). Both pre and post injections increased between the three frog legs. We than injected the leg with caffeine and watched as the muscle contract and became swollen. We observed that the muscle was extremely hard and tense. When we felt the muscle before injection it was soft, squishy and more relaxed than when we touched the muscle afterwards.  As you see in Figure 1, the each of the legs standard deviation are close given the group statistically significant results.


Discussion:
In the end of the experiment, our hypothesis was supported. We stated, we would observe an increase in amplitude of muscle contraction. The voltage was higher by 0.5 (V) from the threshold and we gave the frog leg 5 pulses.  When we felt the muscle before injection it was soft, squishy and more relaxed than when we touched the muscle afterwards. In each leg there were different thresholds causing the legs to be tested at either a higher or lower frequency. We tested all legs equally but a mistake took place on frog leg 2. The full 0.1 ml of caffeine was not fully placed into the muscle. In addition, one of the probes fell out of the muscle causing the experiment to not be read correctly. Also, the stimulus amplitude was not set at the correct amplitude of .78 but was set to .28. Frog leg 2 still showed the injection caused the muscle to contract more than before the injection. This is showing that the caffeine caused a sustained contraction and caused all parts of the gastrocnemius muscle that could contract: to continue to contract until the pulses stopped. This happened because the Ca2+  activated the contractile mechanism causing the muscle to shorten. When the caffeine was injected because it increases Ca2+ it caused the muscle to shorten quicker and did not allow the muscle to relax before contracting again. Caffeine potentiated both force and [Ca2+]i during tetanus. Since the increase of the Ca2+ transient was significantly greater than potentiation of force, it is likely that saturation of myofilaments occurs. The primary effect of caffeine on the Ca2+ transient was an elevation of the plateau phase. [Physiol:1989] The caffeine caused fast twitch and slow twitch but still resulted in fatigue. We can learn from this experiment because we can now understand how drinks with caffeine such as coffee, soda and etc.; can directly affect our muscles. We also see how our muscles contract such as while running when tired they become fatigued and from contraction happening continuously.
