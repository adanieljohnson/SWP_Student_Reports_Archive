Title: Influence of Juvenile Hormone Over Metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones, which had always been regarded as the main factor within the development of an organism, has a vital role in the growth during each stage of their lifespan. In this experiment we are going to study the investigate the effect of Juvenile Hormone over the metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta, which was the tobacco hornworm that took roughly 45 days to develop from a 1st instar larva to a adult moth. It is thoughted that the Juvenile hormone will generate the effect of stimulating the growth of Manduca Sexta, causing the increase in the average net change of Manduca Sexta’s body weight. The result of the experiment proved that the Juvenile hormone can lead to changes in metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta. To be specific, it caused the increase in the average net change of Manduca Sexta’s body weight to an obvious extent.

Introduction:
Hormones have vital effects during the development of the insect, respectively in different stages of their lives, and affect insects themselves from different aspects.  One of the new methods of regulating the insect pest control was utilizing the different, distinctive effects of hormones on managing the biological mechanism of insect to an effective extent. Those were substances called insect growth regulators” (also knowns as IGRs), have the effect of influencing insects on the level of physiological control, therefore generating the effect of controlling and regulating the survival of insects. Instead of being toxic to the insects directly, the IGR eliminates the pest through generating impacts that causes abnormalities that influences survival of insects. Common IGRs has effects that focused on the effect of inhibiting chitin synthesis that blocked cuticle formation or either block or over activated the process controlled by JH, or other types of hormones. [Tunaz: 2004] JH, which was also known as Juvenile Hormone, plays an important effect in the lifecycle of insects. It mainly regulates the growing process of the insect when they are in the stage of the larva. To be specific, Juvenile Hormone regulates the processes include molting, pupating, and the development of organs that an adult moth, or butterfly required to have for survival in the natural environment. In our experiment, we investigated the effect of Juvenile Hormone over the Manduca Sexta (the tobacco hornworm), which was a species of larva that has a lifecycle for about 50 days from an egg to a developed moth, which was majorly regulated by JH. Thus, we hypothesized that an increase in the JH level would prevent Manduca Sextas from developing into the stage of pupating and becoming moths. In other words, those larvae who got treated by JH mimics will remain in the stage of larvae with continuous growth stronger than the one without JH mimics since the JH delayed there maturing process. We imposed JH mimics to the larvae through adding the JH mimics into their food to observe the effect of JH on larva, with the comparison between  the control group and treatment group, with analysis of statistical tests over their net changes in mean body weight, respectively.

Materials and Methods:
We obtained 8 Manduca Sexta that were in the same instar with roughly the same size, 2 containers with 4 separate jars in each, larvae foods, water, droppers and JH mimics (Methoprene, which simulated the effect of JH). We first divided the 8 larvae into 2 groups of 4 and placed each larva in to separated rearing jars. The first group of larvae was feed with food that contained methoprene added (5 drops in each serve of the larvae food), marked them as the treatment group. The second group was feed with food with only water added.
 All larvae will be kept in the same incubator with conditions of 25 ℃ with 12hr dark, 12hr light cycle, and recorded the weight of 8 larvae I each day for 4 weeks. We subtracted the weight of the caterpillar to obtain the net change of weight of each larva. Then we compared the result between larvae in control group and those in treatment group, analyzed the result of the net change and analyze the data of average net changing through using two sample t test for the difference in mean of net change in body weight of Manduca Sexta, then drew the conclusion.


Results:
Based on the data we collected from the experiment, larvae 1, 2 and 3 in the treatment group experienced continuous increase in the average net change of body weight that exceeded it in treatment group for the majority of the time in the experiment with higher rate of increase demonstrated on the curve. The only exception occurs in the period from day 7 to day 9.
The data and the graph of the net change in larvae’s wait for both groups demonstrated significant difference between the treatment group that received JH mimic and the control group without it. The general trend demonstrated in the graph shows that the average net change of treatment group exceeds it over the control group. Both curves demonstrated increasing trend as the time passes, the curve of the control group is relatively higher than it of treatment group for the majority of the graph. The two groups were significantly differed from each other.
We ran a two sample t test for difference in mean (assuming equal variance) to the data we collected from the experiment with null hypothesis(H0): there is no difference between the net change in mean of two group; alternative Hypothesis(Ha): there is a difference between he net change in mean of two group.(α=0.05)the result(t value=-0.3 with df=18, thus p=0.38&gt;0.05) shown that we failed to reject the null hypothesis. One of the main reason is that the sample of Manduca Sextas we utilized in the experiment is not enough to generate convincing and representative result. Thus, statistically we do not have convincing evidence that there is an obvious difference between net change in mean of control group and treatment group.



Discussion:
The result we obtained about the net change of weight of Manduca Sexta  did supported the hypothesis that the impose of JH over the larvae will have relatively higher weight at the end of the experiment. The result we obtained from the experiment is that the larvae in the treatment group that received extra JH mimic demonstrate a significant difference between the weight of themselves and those larvae in the control group. For the majority of the time, the net change in the weight of the larvae in the control group was relatively higher than it in the treatment group that contradicted to the original hypothesis.     Normally the increasing level of JH will cause the larvae to have relatively higher body weight but the delay or cease of metamorphosis process in the development of larvae due to its effect of preventing the precocious adult and let the larvae grew more stronger than those without the treatment of JH in their lifecycle . The larvae will grow and metamorphosize within a relatively higher rate, the body weight will experience similar situation as the metamorphosis did. [Riddiford:2012] The curve of average net change in weight of both groups expressed the results that were similar to what Riddiford  had introduced in the experiment of JH toward larvae but without the relatively higher body weight. Starting from day 7, the net change, in other words, the rate of change of body weight in control group exceeded the treatment group, which means the control group actually had relatively higher growth rate than treatment group did.  Also, the result of statistical test demonstrated that there is no convincing evidence that there is a significant difference between net change in mean body weight of control group and treatment group.  There was two possible error in the experiment that might impact the result. One of them was a death of larva 7 in the control group on the third day of the experiment, which impacted the calculation of the average net change of weight of the control group. Data between day 8 (09/13) and day 13 (09/18) was unavailable due to the influence of Hurricane Florence that impacted the area we were in. Therefore, we are unable to measure the change in body weight of larvae, which could lead to a biased conclusion of our experiment. For the further study, we planned to increase the number of experimental larvae in the experiment in order to avoid the existence of occasional result, and sustain the survival of all experimental units. We will extend the time of experiment to the length that typically allows larvae to enter in the pupating stage to observe a more obvious result of JH on keeping larvae stay in the naïve stage.    In conclusion, the experiment of JH’s effect to the metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta has demonstrated its function of regulating growth and metamorphosis in the growing stage of larvae, but further investigations about its effect on larvae’s pupating process are still required.
