Title: The effects of inhibiting Adenosine triphosphate in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Anura

Abstract:
The contraction of muscles includes a variety of different steps and processes, including the stimulation of a muscle fiber by an action potential which releases calcium. In return, this calcium allows for the contraction of a muscle from the binding of myosin heads an actin filaments. Relaxation is caused by Adenosine triphosphate binding with the myosin head and causing it to release from the actin filament. An excellent example of muscle contractions can be seen in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Anura, or frog. We treated the Gastrocnemius Muscle with a drug called Sevin, which is an Adenosine triphosphate inhibitor. As a group we thought this would prevent the muscle from going though a relaxation period, although this did not happen. We tested the frog muscles by stimulating them at different frequencies using a force transducer and recording the time between contractions using a myogram. There was little difference between the control and treatment groups after the injection of Sevin. These results did not support our hypothesis, and we believe they were mist likely contributed to human error.

Introduction:
The contraction of muscles is stimulated by an action potential reaching a muscle fiber and causing a reaction. The action potential then speaks through the muscle fiber, which causes calcium to be released [Godt: 1974]. The calcium then in turn causes the myosin binding sites to be exposed on actin filaments [Godt: 1974]. This allows the myosin heads to bind with the actin filaments, imitating a “power stroke”. As this happens all thought the muscle fiber, causing the overall contraction of the muscle [Godt: 1974]. During relaxation, Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds with the myosin head at the binding site. This causes the myosin head to release from the actin filament as the muscle relaxes [Godt: 1974]. The myosin head with then bind with the actin filament again and the process will continue until calcium is not longer present and the actin binding sites become covered again [Godt: 1974]. The Gastrocnemius Muscle of Anura, or frog, is a perfect example of this. The muscle can be isolated and stimulated by a force transducer in order to measure the muscles reaction. This allows for a variety of stimulations and manipulations. We treated the frog muscle with the drug Sevin, which inhibits Adenosine triphosphate. We hypothesized that the gastrocnemius muscle of the Anura would continue to contract during the relaxation period if Sevin was injected into the muscle.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment involves the Gastrocnemius Muscle of three separate Anura. The skin was removed from the frog leg, which allowed the muscle to be removed from the rest of the leg using scissors. The sciatic nerve was also removed from the leg. After that, each muscle was hooked up to the force transducer, and stimulated. This included stimulating each frog leg at  varying levels of stimulation frequencies. These stimulations were be recorded using a myogram for each of the different frog legs. The muscles were then injected with Sevin, and left for five minutes to allow the drug to take effect in the muscle. Afterwords, the muscles were stimulated in the exact same fashion as before by the force transducer, and the results were recorded using a myogram. A paired T-Test was used to test the difference between the two groups before and after the injections.

Results:
There was no statistical difference in the Paired T-Test results from the treatment and control groups (t-stat=2.169, df=5, p=.1675). The results of the test would then support the null hypothesis as the p=value is great than .05. Overall, there was very little difference between the average time between contractions of the treatment and control groups (Fig. 1). In fact, some of the averages were exact matches throughout the two groups. This can be seen in the averages of the control and treatment groups for stimulation frequencies of 2 and 4. At the frequency of 2, the average of both the control and treatment was 500 (Fig 1.) At the frequency of 4, the average for both the control and the treatment was 250 (Fig 1.) From there, the average time between contractions were very similar.

Discussion:
Both the observational and statistical results of this experiment support the null hypothesis that Sevin did not have an effect on the contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Anura during the relaxation period. This results confused us as a group, because in theory, inhibiting Adenosine triphosphate would prevent the muscle from being able to relax, meaning it would continue to contract [Godt: 1974]. This means that most likely the Sevin was not successful in inhibiting the Adenosine triphosphate in the Gastrocnemius Muscle. These results could have happened due to a variety of different factors. There could have been an issue with the Sevin that we injected into Gastrocnemius Muscle. It could have been administered in too small of a dose, or it could also have not been used in a high enough concentration. There could have also been an issue with the absorption of the Sevin into the muscle fibers of the frog leg. This would in turn prevent it from inhibiting Adenosine triphosphate. The injection could have also been done in the wrong place, which would impact the ability of the Sevin to be absorbed into the muscle fibers. The issue was most likely due to human error. We could also have not waited long enough for the drug to be absorbed before testing the muscles again. This results of the experiment did not support our hypothesis. If we were to do the experiment again in the future, we would double check to make sure we were using the right amounts and concentrations of Sevin. We would also want to leave more time between the injection and the retesting of the muscles. This would give us more trustworthy results for the experiment.
