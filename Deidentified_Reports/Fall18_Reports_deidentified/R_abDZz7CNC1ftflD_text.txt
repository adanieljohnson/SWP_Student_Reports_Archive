Title: The Positive Correlation between Size and Aggression in Beta splendins

Abstract:
The type of organism, intraspecific vs. interspecific interaction, level of territoriality, time or mating season, and an array of other factors contribute to the overall level of aggression exhibited. Ethology aids in the understanding of behavior by using observational skills and knowledge of ecological, genetic, and evolutionary biological theories. The purpose was to determine if there was a correlation between the size of Beta splendins and the level of aggression exhibited. We hypothesized that Beta splendins of similar size would show greater levels of aggression toward one another than of larger Beta splendins due to the cost of greater energy expenditure. Behavior was observed for the following interactions between Beta spendens: large-large, medium-medium, small-small, large-medium, large-small, and medium-small. Following experimentation, both ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests showed a significent difference, meaning there was a positive correlation between the size and level of aggression in fish. Thus, having a basic knowledge of the relationship between size and display of aggressive behavior provide a better understanding of such behaviors, and could lead to research giving a greater insight of both feeding and reproductive behaviors in fish, as well as territoriality.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior using observational skills, laboratory method and knowledge of ecological, genetic, and evolutionary biological theories. The goal is to use ethology ​whether the size of Beta splendins effects the display of aggressive behavior. Also known as Siamese fighting fish, Beta splendins are the model organism for this experiment due to their array of intraspecific behaviors. The two types of intraspecific behaviors are broadside and facing movements; which can each be broken down further into three movements categorized by level of aggression. 
Aggressive behavior is most commonly occurring over territory, competition for a mate, and competition for food. While aggression may seem like a choice behavior, it can also be heightened by hormone production and hormone receptor activity [Jonsson, et al: 1997]. Without any alterations to the hormone levels in the Beta splendins, we hypothesize that they will show greater aggression toward fish of their own size than larger fish due to the cost of expending greater amounts of energy. 


Materials and Method:
         The behavior of isolated Beta splendins was​ observed and recorded. Then, the controll, a single fish of each size (small, medium, large), was exposed to their reflection in order for self-habituation to be observed. The fish of each size category was placed with another of the same size and observed for five minutes. Lastly, each will be observed in the presence of both of the other size categories. 
Large-Large
Medium-Medium
Small-Small
Large-Medium
Large-Small
Medium-Small 
          For each set, behavior /level of aggression was noted every thirty seconds for a total of five minutes using the following scale of aggression.
0 – No Reaction
1 – Pelvic Fin Flickering
2 – Dorsal Fin
3 – Tail Beating
4 – Tail Flashing
5 – Red Mane
6 – Attacking

Results:
There was a significent difference between large and medium-small, large-medium and medium-small, and large-small and medium-small; thus, there is a positive correlation between the ​size of competitor and level of aggression (p_value: 0.000144). 

Discussion:
Our data showed a significent difference in size and level of aggression in Beta splendins. This can be explained because of metabolism and the costs/benefits of energy use with aggressive behavior. While there was a significent difference between level of aggression displayed and the size, in certain categories, our hypothesis was not supported as the levels of aggression were higher in the presence of fish of greater size difference. Thus, aggression increased as the relative size of the fish increased. 
A better understanding of such behaviors could give greater insight into​ both feeding and reproductive behaviors in fish, as well as territoriality. Past research has shown that owners of territory have won 85% of contests with opponents of equal size and that size advantage is needed to balance the size advantage in fish of different sizes [Johnsson, et al: 1998]. Further research with larger sample sizes would be needed in order to draw more general conclusions; data regarding aggression in the presence of possible mate and/or in presence of food would be helpful in having a deeper understanding of reproductive and feeding behaviors in Beta splendins.
