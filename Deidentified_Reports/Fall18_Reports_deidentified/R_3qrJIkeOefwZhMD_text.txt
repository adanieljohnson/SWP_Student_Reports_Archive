Title: The Effect of Exposure to Cold Temperatures on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Frogs have the same gastrocnemius muscle in their legs as humans. Based on this information, frog legs are an appropriate animal to run tests of muscle fatigue on to be able to understand the workings of the human muscle in comparison. Different methods of stimulation of the gastrocnemius muscle in the frog leg can determine the abilities of the muscle. In this experiment, a method of electric shock to the gastrocnemius muscle was used and the outside factor effecting the leg muscles was temperature. We hypothesized that if the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease. The twitch threshold was determined for the gastrocnemius muscle of 3 frog legs and then increased by 1 to test the response voltage. Response voltage for each leg at room temperature (21.67°C) was determined three times and averaged. Then, response voltage for each leg after being iced for 5 minutes at 5°C was determined three times and averaged. A paired t-test was used to find that the results were not significant (T-Stat = 1.01105, DF = 2, P value = 0.41842) and our hypothesis was found to not be supported. Moving forward, more precaution should be taken about removing the frog legs from being iced too late before the experiment.

Introduction:
Both humans and frogs have a gastrocnemius muscle in their legs. This allows us to work on the gastrocnemius muscle in frogs and compare it to human abilities. By using different stimulators, like an electric shock, it is possible to see how muscles in frogs will react and how much the muscle can be strained before reaching tetanus. The ability of the gastrocnemius muscle in the Northern Leopard Frog, Rana pipiens, is determined by many factors. In their natural environment-–which is grasslands, brushlands, and forests–cold can affect how a frog’s muscles will react. Many frogs have a freeze tolerance, like the gray tree frog that uses glycerol as a cryo-protectant [Layne:1999]. Moreover, The Rana pipiens is the most cold-adapted of all the leopard frogs [Stebbins: 2003]. However, we are predicting that cold can still negatively affect the ability and duration of the leg muscles in Rana pipiens. If the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease. 



Materials and Methods:
3 Rana pipiens’ frog legs are prepared so that their skin is removed, and the muscles are exposed. The frog legs muscles are tied to a force transducer to reduce the movement of the leg while it is shocked. Needles were inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle that allow for electric shocks to hit the muscle. Data was sent from the needles in the muscle to a software called Lab Works. Lab Works helped determine the twitch threshold of each leg, which we then increased by one voltage to test before and after icing. The room was at a temperature of 21.67°C. The voltage response of the room temperature legs was determined three times for each leg and then averaged. Each leg was then iced for 5 minutes in ice water at 5°C. The voltage response was determined for each iced leg three times and averaged. A paired t-test was used to find the significance of the data results.

Results:
The average response voltage of the room temperature legs was 0.5463, and the average response voltage of the iced legs was 0.404. Standard deviation was 0.097089 for the room temperature leg and 0.299591 for the iced leg. The average voltage response did decrease, as seen in figure 1, but the mean differences of the room temperature leg voltage number and the iced leg voltage number was not significant (T-Stat = 1.01105, DF = 2, P value = 0.41842). The average difference was 0.1383. A two tailed paired T-test was used to calculate the data. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that if the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease was not supported. Cold will normally slow down chemical reactions in the muscle, resulting in worsening of muscle abilities. However, the frog legs could have not been iced long enough, since they were only iced for five minutes in this experiment. Another reason for our hypothesis not being supported could be that the legs were previously chilled in the lab. This would have had the frog legs exposed to cold before we intended it to be. The third frog leg was also set out in room temperature for longer than the others, which could explain the dramatic decrease in voltage from. In the future, if they the frog legs are chilled beforehand, the legs should be set out in the room temperature air before the experiment and tested for temperature till it is at an appropriate temperature to perform the experiment. Going forward, a related experiment that could be performed based on our experiment is the glycerol content of frog legs. It was found in one experiment that many frog species–including the Hyla versicolor–are freeze tolerant based on the amount of glycerol in their bodies [Layne: 1999]. It would be interesting to test how the amount of glycerol in the body would affect the twitch threshold of frog legs in terms of exposure to cold temperature. More specifically, if adding glycerol would help the muscle regain normal function after being iced.

Figure Legends: 
Fig 1. The mean of response voltage for the room temperature (21.67°C) Rana pipiens’ leg and the iced (at 5°C) Rana pipiens’ leg. The room temperature leg (blue bar) was an average of 0.5463 and the iced leg (orange bar) was 0.404. Standard deviation was 0.097089 for the room temperature leg and 0.299591 for the iced leg. The twitch threshold was determined to be 0.6 V, so testing conditions were set at 1.6 V, 1 pulse, 1 Hz, 5 ms pulse width. *************************************************************************
