Title: Allocation of Resources in Fagopyrum esculentum Under Light and Dark Conditions

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to observe how Fagopyrum esculentum allocates resources to its roots and shoots systems when placed in light and dark environments. Our group recorded the mean root:shoot ratios for length and weight, then conducted a statistical test for significance. Not surprisingly, our statistical test supported our hypothesis that plants placed in a dark environment will allocate resources differently than those placed in direct sunlight. 


Introduction:
For this lab, we will be focusing on resource allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum – commonly referred to as buckwheat. Historically, this plant has been harvested for its grain – like seeds as a  cover crop. Additionally, these plants serve as good organisms for this experiment since they are known to grow relatively rapidly. In reference to the experiment being conducted, our group observed how these plants react and allocate resources under certain environmental settings. Moreover, we will be experimenting how these plants react when there is a resource limitation imposed upon the population (Johnson 16). Furthermore, we will be observing how plants use a balancing system to manage resource uptake and use (The experiment was aimed to demonstrate how under certain conditions, plants will choose to allocate resources into either the roots or shoots system. Specifically, our experiment focused on how buckwheat responded when placed in light and dark environments. For this experiment, we expected for our plants that were placed in a dark environment to have a lower root:shoot weight and length ratio. 


Materials and Method:
First, a set of 20 plants was divided up and randoMly assigned to be part of either the “light” or “dark” population. The “light” population served as the controll group, while the “dark” population served as the experimental group. Next, the plants were placed in a greenhouse, with the light plants placed in direct sunlight, while the dark plants were covered to prevent contact with sunlight. The plants for each group were then monitored and watered regularly for a week before gathering data. First, the plants were weighed as whole plants (including both the roots and shoots systems). Next, the plants were cut at the intersection of the roots and shoots. The roots and shoots systems were then weighed individually and the results were recorded. Next, the roots and shoots were each measured for length in millimeters. Finally, an average root:shoot weight and length ratio was calculated for each group. These values were then run through a 2-sample T-test to test for statistical significance. 


Results:
After running a 2-sample T-test on the root:shoot weight ratios, we found a statistically significent difference, with a p_value of 0.042, 18 degrees of freedom, and a t-value of 2.11. However, after running a 2-sample T-test on the mean root:shoot length ratios, we did not find a statistically significent difference with a p_value of 0.099, with18 degrees of freedom, and a t-value of 1.74. 


Discussion:
Since there was a statistically significent difference in the root:shoot weights between our two groups, we were able to support our hypothesis that plants placed in light and dark environments will allocate resources differently. This conclusion makes sense, since plants placed in a dark environment will not have a steady “income” of energy, and therefore will have to make sacrifices when allocating carbon atoms to build new structures. For example, a plant that is receiving no light may choose to allocate more resources into its root structures. This is because there is no real point in expanding a shoots system if there is no light for the leaves to collect. Therefore, it may be more beneficial for the plant to expand its roots to gather the maximum amount of resources available.
