Title: The Effects of Vibration on Agonistic Behavior in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Ethology contributes highly to the understanding of how animals interact both intraspecifically and interspecifically allowing for a greater understanding of how species interact within their environment. One of main objectives of ethology is to examine behavioral processes such as aggression in animals. Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendins, are known to be aggressive in nature and therefore are an ideal test species for showing how intraspecific aggression functions within their species. This study uses ethological techniques to quantify the levels of agnostic behavior displayed by two male B. splendins before and after they have been stimulated by vibration. The study examines the relationship between this stimulus and the Betta fish hypothesizing that if the Betta fish are stimulated by vibration then they will exhibit higher levels of agnostic displays. This hypothesis was tested with four male Betta fish over two sets of trials within the same tank. The hypothesis does not prove true, nor does the stimulant show no effect on the test subjects. When stimulated by vibration before an encounter with another male Betta fish, the levels of agnostic behavior shown significently decreased upon the encounter. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, display aggressive, also known as agnostic behavior, when placed in contact with other male Betta fish. This agnostic behavior is a way for the fish to assert dominance within an environment and therefore ensure their sexual reproduction and their own longevity. These aggressive interactions continue to be studied with ethology, the study of animal behavior. There are detailed descriptions of how agnostic behavior is shown in B. splendins. These descriptions show that male Betta fish present their aggression in six recognized physical displays. These displays take two main forms, broadside display and facing display which each contain three increasingly aggressive levels of behavior. Respectively, and in increasing aggressiveness, these behaviors are: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, and erecting pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, presenting a red “mane” by enlarging their branchiostegal membrane. These displays have evolved as a result of intraspecific competition for mates, competition within the species. It is important to study these behaviors because ethologists are able to use this data to predict agnostic behavior for B. splendins populations as a whole as well as for species with similar aggressive tendencies. Testing the ways that outside stimuli affect agnostic behavior in Bettas allows insight into the ways that a changing environment may affect intraspecific interactions overall. This also allows a glimpse into how different species may interact in an interspecific environment and can be mapped onto other vertebrate animal interactions because there are similar internal relationships between aggressive displays and chemical receptors [Clotfelter:2007]. To agitate a Betta fish environment, a stimulus must be added into the environment. Options are limited to these stimulants, as the water needs to be disturbed without harming the specimen. In a previous study it was found that vibration was an effective stimulant, when used for short periods of time, in another aquatic species, Nereis pelagica [Peeke: 1970]. In our experiment we will be testing the effects of vibration as a stimulant for the agnostic behavior in the male Bettas. If the environment of a male Betta is agitated by vibration, then they will display higher levels of agnostic behaviors. 

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, we placed two male Betta fish on each side of an opaque divider and allowed them to rest without any outside stimuli for five minutes. After this time had passed, we removed the divider so that only a clear divider separated the fish and recorded the types of behaviors displayed for another five minutes. We quantified the behaviors by assigning numeric values to the three levels of aggressive display for broadside and facing displays. The assignments were as follows for broadside display: pelvic fin flickering = 1, tail beating = 2, tail flashing = 3. For facing display, the assignments were: erecting pectoral fins = 1, spreading the opercula = 2, presenting a red “mane” by enlarging their branchiostegal membrane = 3.  We then replaced the opaque divider and rested the fish for two and a half minutes then placed an electric toothbrush in each of the tanks for the remaining two and a half minutes before again removing the opaque divider and recording any behavioral displays. We repeated the above process a second time to ensure data for later computations. Upon completion of the second trial we removed the original male Bettas from the tank and replaced them with two new specimens. We repeated our process with this pair in the same manner as the first. We then selected the largest average agnostic displays by summing the data for the trials of each fish. We tested for significance using a paired t_test.

Results:
The results show a significent decrease in the level of agnostic behaviors displayed after male Betta fish were treated with vibration (Fig. 1, t_stat = 5.5, d.f. = 3, P = 0.01). The average level of agnostic behavior before and after vibration were 4.45 ± 0.25 and 2.35 ± 0.66. This data shows that there was a mean difference of between these agnostic levels of -2.10 ± 0.76. 

Discussion:
The results from the experiment rejected both our alternate and our null hypothesis. The significance of our experiment rather supports a new hypothesis that if the male Bettas are agitated by vibration, then they will display lower levels of agnostic behavior (Fig. 1). This effect has also been achieved in another study done by Ethan D. Clotfelter et. Al. in which male B. splendins were exposed to the neurotransmitter serotonin [Clotfelter:2007]. In opposition to our experiment the stimulant used in Clotfelter’s experiment was an internal rather than external stimulation [Clotfelter:2007]. One possible explanation as to why this decrease of aggression occurred in our experiment is that the Betta fish had become habituated to their environment. Habituation has been shown to decrease aggression in a prior study which showed that the recovery of B. splendins from habituation to a stimulus or environment was never complete [Peeke: 1970]. In our experiment the only variable that we manipulated was the presence of the vibration within the environment. Subsequent experiments would benefit from having multiple trials in which the environment was changed after each trial was completed so that habituation to the environment, in this case the glass tank, could be decreased or eliminated completely. To avoid a lack of conclusive data we completed trials with two pairs of male Bettas, however, all of our total trials showed the same end result, a decrease in agnostic behavior. This may have also been due to habituation to the fish on the other side of the divider during the multiple trials rather than a reaction to the vibrations of the water.
