Title: Inhibition of 20E Hormone Halts Pupation in Manduca sexta Caterpillars 

Abstract:
Hormone regulation is an extremely important topic in physiology and biology and by studying it we can gain useful insight into how we as humans function and better understand our role in the environment.  We looked at the effects of using an IGR for 20E (Azaguard) on the pupation of Manduca sexta caterpillars. We thought that the inhibition of 20E would result in no pupation because without the spike in 20E there would be no commitment pulse.  Our data showed a significant difference in the mean change in weights of the caterpillars. Also, since all of the caterpillars did not pupate when Azaguard was introduced in their diet while the control caterpillars did, we can attribute that significant difference to the inhibition of 20E.  This emphasizes the role of 20E in insect development and metamorphosis. 



Introduction:
Our experiment looked at how hormones regulate development in caterpillars.  Hormones are extremely important to our understanding of physiology and development in many complex organisms including humans.  We studied a species of caterpillar called Manduca sexta.  This species of caterpillar has been widely studied already and is relatively simple to alter its hormone levels.  The Manduca sexta begin their life as an egg.  After hatching they become a larva which then turns into a pupa and finally into an adult moth.  When they become larvae, they undergo a series molts until they become big enough to become a pupa.  Molting is when an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer of cuticle and the old layer of skin is shed. The timing of these molts and pupation are controlled by hormones in the caterpillar.  The two main hormones responsible for this are the JH and 20E. Juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during its development while 20 E regulates the timing of the molting. E20 is responsible for something called the commitment pulse; where the caterpillars’ levels of JH are very low and there is a small spike in 20E.  This spike in 20E tells the caterpillar that it is ready to pupate and starts the metamorphosis of the larvae to an adult moth. We were trying to see whether an E20 IGR(Azaguard) will change the insect’s hormone levels and change its development. Decreasing the amount of E20 in the caterpillars will halt their development and the caterpillars will not pupate.  




Materials and Methods:
We were given 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars in the larvae stage of similar size.  We then separated half of the caterpillars into two groups; one in which each caterpillar was fed 10 g of normal caterpillar food and another group which each was fed 10 g of normal caterpillar food with 10 drops of Azaguard.  Our caterpillars were kept isolated from each other and were also at constant temperature. We weighed and observed our caterpillars in the two groups every day for 12 days using a standard lab balance and recorded our findings in the lab manual.  We then used a 2 tailed T test to determine whether the change in weight of the caterpillars in the two groups were due to chance or the Azaguard. 

Results:

All of our caterpillars who were fed normal caterpillar food looked healthy and pupated.  All of the caterpillars who were fed caterpillar food with Azaguard did not pupate and 3 out of the 4 died right before the experiment was complete.  The mean change in weight for the control caterpillars was a gain of 1.49 grams. The mean change in weight for the experimental caterpillars was a loss of .597 grams (-0.597).  The standard deviation for the change in weight of the control caterpillars was 1.06 grams and the standard deviation for the change in weight of the experimental caterpillars was 0.24 grams.  We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the weight control group was statistically significantly different than that of the mean weight experimental group (t-stat = 3.958, df = 8, P = 0.00418).  As seen in figure one, the pie chart shows that all the control caterpillars pupated while all of the experimental caterpillars did not pupate. We also noticed that the experimental caterpillars initially grew bigger before losing much of their weight.  






Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that decreasing E20 in caterpillars will halt their development and not pupate was supported by this experiment.  We had a very significant difference in the mean change in weights of the caterpillars between the two groups(P=.00418). This suggests that our difference in the weights was not due to chance but because of the Azaguard in the diet of the caterpillars.  The Azaguard inhibits the release of 20E which is the hormone that is needed to have the commitment pulse. Even if the JH levels in the caterpillar are very low, without that spike in 20E the caterpillar will not pupate. A potential error in the experiment was that we were not able to feed the caterpillars for 3 days in a row due to Hurricane Florence, but i think it had little impact on the outcome of the experiment since all control caterpillars were able to survive.  Understanding how these hormones interact with each other on the caterpillar can help us better understand how hormones interact in the human body and what impacts the inhibition of certain hormones in humans may have. Also, as pollution becomes an issue, certain chemicals may inhibit the release of hormones in an organism so studying how they work and their effects can have a positive impact on preserving biodiversity as well. This experiment also shows the effects of Azaguard on being a potential pesticide since it can stop the pupation of larvae.
