Title: Effects of Calcium on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
In animals and most organisms, muscle contraction permits movement. This contraction occurs due to electrical stimulation via the nervous system. Within muscle, calcium ions permit contraction as a direct result of the electrical charge. In this experiment we tested the effect of additional calcium in a frog leg’s gastrocnemius muscle to determine the effect. Based on the results of the experiment, the calcium created a statistically significant effect on the intensity of contraction in the muscle. The hypothesis was proven correct through a paired t-test having p values of less than 0.05.

Introduction:
Most forms of movement by animals is done by the contraction of muscles . The contraction of the muscles is done by stimulating these muscles with an electrical charge. When this contraction occurs, movement occurs. In a lab, a muscle can be stimulated by placing metal electrodes into the muscles fiber and applying a charge. A force transducer can then be used to measure the force exerted by the muscle contracting. Using the data from the transducer, a myogram is produced. In this process of contraction, calcium is necessary to stimulate the muscle. Without calcium, the muscle can not contract. Based on this knowledge, we speculate that through the injection of calcium ions into the muscle, it will allow for a more intense contraction that occurs more quickly when stimulated(Johnson, 2016).

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the experiment in testing the effects of calcium, two frog legs will be used. Each leg will be tested on its initial strength of contraction, then each will be injected with the calcium ions and tested again. The initial test of contraction will act as the control while the same leg injected will be the treatment. First the legs were degloved(removed skin) as to expose the Gastrocnemius muscle and the Sciatic nerve; the muscle and nerve that are being stimulated. With scissors, the muscle is severed on one side from the leg. Using pins, the leg is laid down and the severed end of the muscle is tied to the hook of the transducer. Next, the electrodes from the unit controlled by LabScribe are placed in contact with the Sciatic nerve, which is responsible for muscle stimulation. Using the LabScribe software, the muscle is then stimulated with a charge and the data is recorded. After recording 5 trials of contraction for each leg, the muscle is injected with calcium and the procedure is repeated. This data will be used to conduct a paired T-Test to determine if the calcium injection created a significant difference in contraction. We will test with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
Through the experiment, the control group of the first leg exhibited an average contraction of 1.026 while after the treatment the leg had an average of 2.7; an average more than double the control. After completing the 5 contractions on each leg a paired T-test was conducted. The test yielded a t value of 24.147 and a p value of ˂0.0001. The second leg underwent the same procedure, however with different values due to the uniqueness of each leg. The second leg had a control and treatment average of 0.0926 and 0.212, respectively. The test yielded a t value of 8.695 and a p value of 0.0010.

Discussion:
The purpose in this experiment was to determine whether the increase in calcium in a frog leg’s muscle would make it contract with more force. This is a valuable experiment because it allows us to observe the significance of the presence of calcium in muscular structures. Based on our paired t-tests, with a p-value of 0.0001 and 0.001 for leg 1 and 2 respectively, we reject the null hypothesis for both. There is strong evidence suggesting that the presence of additional calcium made the Gastrocnemius muscle contract more intensely. The raw data also supports this conclusion as the additional calcium more than doubled the average contraction of both legs. Although the experiment was statistically successful, continuous experimentation with frog legs under a more specific hypothesis could further increase the accuracy and strength of the experiment and its results(Johnson, 2016).
