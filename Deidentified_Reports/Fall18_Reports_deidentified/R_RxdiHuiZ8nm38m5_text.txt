Title: Aggression of Betta splendens in the Presence of Basic Structures

Abstract:
This experiment will measure the change in aggressive behavior in male Betta splendens with the presence of basic structures. The structures added to the environment in the experiment are used to observe whether or not the betta acts territorially to defend the structure from a threatening male. Due to the fact that male betta fish are territorial, I hypothesized that the structure would result in an increase in aggressive behavior. To compare the change in behavior, two male betta fish were placed in the same tank and interaction was measured both quantitatively and qualitatively to analyze the fish’s behavior. The results of this study supported my initial hypothesis that the fish in the presence of added structures displayed a higher frequency of agonistic behavior. Increases in agonistic behavior in the presence of structures aid in the understanding of the trade-offs betta fish make in terms of territory and energy.

Introduction:
Throughout this experiment, I will analyze the aggressive behaviors of male betta fish, Betta splendens, in the presence of simple structures. Betta splendens are small fish that lived in rice patties in small countries in Southeast Asia who are known to be extremely aggressive while in the presence of other fish. Betta fish display three types of broadside behaviors and three types of facing behaviors when exposed to other males [Johnson: 2016][Rowland: 1999]. The broadside behaviors in increasing aggressiveness, are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2016][Rowland: 1999]. The facing behaviors, in increasing aggressiveness, are erected pectoral fins, spreading of the gill covers, and displaying the branchiostegal membrane [Johnson: 2016][Rowland: 1999]. Males displaying their otherwise concealed branchiostegal membrane, also known as the “red mane”, is the most aggressive behavior the males can display and will be the indicator of aggressive male behavior for this study. 

When two male betta fish are exposed to each other with no boundary, aggressive behavior is typically a default mechanism displayed by the dominant male [Simpson: 1968]. The males will use the behavior displays to impose dominance and short interactions typically do not end in physical fights [Simpson: 1968]. However, frequencies of male behaviors can change if one or both of the males see an opportunity for the acquisition of resources [Baenninger: 2014]. In most cases in the wild, the resource in question is usually either food or a mate; however, in this experiment, the structure exposed to one of the fishes can be viewed as a beneficial resource to both fish [Baenninger: 2014]. The betta fish treating the structure as a valuable resource is supported as betta males are extremely territorial animals when observed in the wild [Bronstein: 1980]. For that reason, I hypothesize that the male fish being observed will exhibit more aggressive behavior after being exposed to the structure.


Materials and Methods:
To test the effect of the structure on ethology, a tank with three sections separated by removable barriers was used to contain the fish. The fish were separated by a week in order to completely rest the fish so aggressive behavior was not limited by energy levels. Food intake, size of fish, and water conditions remained constant for all trials. For the control trial, one fish was designated as the test fish and the barriers were removed so the two fish were free to interact. To quantitatively analyze the aggressiveness of the fish, stopwatches were used to mark the total time, in seconds, the fish being observed exhibited the red mane. Each trial had a total time length of five minutes which began when the fish first saw each other. After the control trial took place, the barriers were placed back in the tank and the fish were given five minutes of rest. A basic structure shaped like a rock formation was then placed in the section of the tank holding the test fish, so the fish could become familiar with the structure. After the rest period, the barriers were removed and the test trial began with the same time restraints and measurement technique as the control trial. The two types of trials were repeated with two other sets of fish. To compare the results of the experiment, a one-tailed paired t-test was used with an alpha level of 0.05. 

Results:
In terms of informal observations, both of the fish were more aggressive with the presence of the structures which was supported by the quantitatively measured results. For all sets of fish, the total time spent exhibiting the red mane was higher after the test fish was exposed to the structure. The average time spent exhibiting the aggressive behavior with the structure present was 196.87 +/- 32.58 seconds while the average time spent exhibiting the aggressive behavior without the structure was 177.095 +/- 30.64 second (fig 1.). In addition, the differences in averages for the control and the test trials were statistically significant (t-stat=14.38, df=2, p-value=0.044).

Discussion:
The results support my initial hypothesis that the presence of the structure caused a significant increase in agonistic behaviors exhibited by the betta fish. In a study with similar uses of territory and male betta fish, oxygen consumption increased heavily for males after defending a given territory, which signifies that, in terms of metabolic trade-offs, the fish see the territory as a beneficial resource [Castro: 2006]. The fish are willing to take on both physical harm and a higher amount of energy use as a risk to either obtain or protect a territorial space. Both the data in this experiment and similar experiments support the conception that the territorial instincts of the male betta fish cause the increase in agonistic behavior; however, the total time of displaying the red mane behavior does not consider the extent of the betta’s sacrifice. An experiment with similar structure comparing the effect of both territorial structures when in the presence of both a contending male and a female found that a male betta fish will put more energy and risk into defending a territory than he will competing for a mate [Bronstein: 1981][Dzieweczynski: 2005]. Assumptions can be made that the male values the territory higher than the potential of an immediate mate because the possession of a territory in the future can result in multiple chances of mating. He sacrifices both energy and the potential of a mate in favor of territorial advantages. 

To improve the experiment and gain a clearer understanding of the resource trade-offs male betta fish make in the presence of structures, I would redo the experiment and allow the male more time with the structure before subsequent trials. The male only had five minutes with the structure and it is difficult to predict how aware the fish was of the additional benefit the structure offered. To further support the male betta fish’s awareness of the structure, the experiment could be done in a larger tank to hopefully make the structure more beneficial in the context of a larger ecosystem rather than a small, relatively empty tank. The test fish in the experiment was given only five minutes of rest between the two trials which could have resulted in a decrease in agonistic behavior because the fish has less potential energy after the first interaction. However, this potential side effect, if true, would only further support the conclusions made about the data and does not discredit the data at all. If the potential sources of improvement were carried out, it can be predicted that they would all increase the statistical significance of the data in relation to my initial hypothesis.
