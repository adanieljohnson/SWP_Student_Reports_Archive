Title: An Analysis of the Effects of Dibutryl-cAMP and Curcumin on the Chemotaxis of Physarum polycephalum Towards Glucose

Abstract:
All organisms rely on some signaling pathway in order to properly respond to stimuli in their environment. G-protein coupled receptors with cAMP as a second messenger is a common method of signaling. In this experiment, we tested the effects of dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin on the growth of the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. Dibutryl-cAMP activates the Protein Kinase A in this pathway which should promote growth in the direction of glucose while curcumin inactivates PKA and should inhibit growth. While no growth occurred on the two treatment plates, only about 0.03cm of growth was observed in the control plates, and therefore, the statistical analysis determined the data insignificant. Signaling is an important subject to study because it allows insight into the daily biological processes and mechanisms that many organisms undergo. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, is a jelly-like organism that has the ability to crawl along a surface by using its actin microtubules. This organism is perfect to study because it is so simple, but still utilizes many important signaling pathways in order to properly respond and react to its surrounding environment. Physarum cells respond to stimuli such as the presence of specific chemicals or physical contact with another cell and can have varying responses to these external stimuli. Chemotaxis is a response in which Physarum senses a certain type of molecule in its environment and as a result either crawls towards or away from that stimulus [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we decided to target Protein Kinase A which plays a large role in the cAMP mediated pathway . For this pathway to work, the stimulus binds to the receptor, which activates the G-protein coupled receptor to begin turning ATP into cAMP. The cAMP then activates our target protein, Protein Kinase A which causes an amplification of the signal and allows the cell to elicit a response [Johnson: 2018]. We tested two different treatments, dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin and used glucose to trigger the chemotaxis response in the physarum sample [Carlile: 1970]. After collecting our results, we will measure the migration of the Physarum after 24 hours and use a paired t-test in order to statistically analyze our data. This simple organism proves very important to the study and understanding of these signaling pathways that many other species, such as humans, also possess. When one part of this chain reaction fails to function properly, cells are unable to communicate with their surroundings, and the result may be as extreme as the development of certain diseases or cancers [Martin: 2003]. We hypothesize that when glucose is provided as an incentive for migration, dibutryl-cAMP will stimulate migration towards glucose because it activates Protein Kinase A, while curcumin will inhibit migration towards glucose when it inhibits activation of PKA in the signaling pathway.

Materials and Methods:
Sterilizing Equipment
	At the beginning of the experiment, we were given ethanol in a beaker along with a lighter, forceps, and a flat metal spatula to sterilize our equipment. Before using each tool, we removed it from the ethanol and placed it in the flame briefly so that it ignited. After the flame had gone out, we waited for about ten seconds before using it on the agar plate. Each time a tool was used on a plate, we resterilized it in  order to keep from contaminating our different treatment.
Preparing Assay Plates
	First, we placed the flat metal spatula and forceps in the tube of ethanol to sterilize it. We took each of the nine 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar medium (at room temperature) and labeled them with our initials and the date on the back of the plate in sharpie. Then, we drew lines on the back of the plate to form two 1x1cm squares: one at the bottom center of the plate, and the other one three centimeters above, also in the center. 
The Experiment
We removed the spatula from the ethanol and cut out the 1x1cm square of water agar from the bottom of the first three plates. We treated the second three plates with the dibutryl-cAMP (10mM) treatment and the third group of three plates with the curcumin treatment (10mM) for ten minutes. Then, we cut out the 1x1cm square at the bottom of the rest of the plates, and replaced them with cubes of Physarum. We removed the top cube next and replaced it with glucose as the incentive for the Physarum to migrate. To store the plates, we wrapped them in tin foil and placed them in a black bag to incubate for 24 hours before measuring any chemotaxis that had taken place. 


Results:
In order to obtain our results, we measured any movement the Physarum had over the 24 hour period. Figure 1 shows our expected data in which plates 1-3 without either of the treatments, the Physarum would grow around 0.07cm per hour in the direction of the glucose. For plates 4-6, treated with the dibutryl-cAMP solution, we expected the Physarum to grow 0.1cm per hour until it just about reached the glucose, and we expected the Physarum samples in the final three plates to grow very minimally, perhaps 0.02 cm per hour. However, we observed there to be very minimal movement in any of our plates after the 24 hour period and as a result, had very little data at the end of the experiment. As seen in Figure 2, we observed an average of 0.03 cm of movement per hour in our control plates while the dibutryl-cAMP treatment plates moved an average of 0.007 cm per hour over the 24 hour period. We would have used a paired t-test and analyzed our p-value in order to determine if our data was statistically significant. 

Discussion:
Overall, our results did not support our hypothesis which stated that when glucose is provided as an incentive for migration, dibutryl-cAMP will show elevated growth and curcumin will show a decreased growth towards glucose when compared to the plates which were not treated. This is due to the fact that the Physarum cultures did not show any normal growth due to a pre-existing or external factor. First, it is important to note that our groups’ Physarum samples came from two different samples which could account for the small amount of growth, about 0.03 cm per hour, in a couple of the control plates and no observed growth in most of the treatment plates. Our group started preparing plates from one sample, but when those plates ran out, we had to take the remainder of our plates from another sample for our control group. We did not think this would greatly affect our results, however, it is possible this variation in plates had a small impact. It is possible that the Physarum shut down due to its placement in the incubator over the course of this experiment. There are certain responses that can occur when masses of Physarum are exposed to light. Positive and negative phototaxis are when the organism moves towards or away from the light source, respectively [Johnson: 2018]. In addition, after a period of starvation in the dark, Physarum has proven to undergo sporulation in response to light [Wormington: 1976]. The incubator in which the Physarum plates were stored before we used the for this experiment is equipped with a refrigerator light which stays off as long as the door is closed, but is triggered to turn on when the door is opened. With numerous different lab sections and groups utilizing this incubator, the Physarum was most likely exposed to enough light to trigger the start of the reproductive cycle [Wormington: 1976]. Sporulation is the process by which the Physarum fragments into sporangia, undergoes meiosis, and forms spores which are dormant and can spread to new locations [Golderer: 2001]. Because this is a dormant stage, the fact that no growth was observed in our Physarum samples after they had been stored in the incubator makes sense. This theory could be tested by comparing results from this sample of Physarum with the Physarum on plates that had been stored in a completely dark incubator. Although this specific experiment is not relevant due to the lack of data, the study of the signaling pathways in Physarum is very important when looking at human signaling pathways. If there is a way to activate a pathway that no longer functions properly, it would be possible to cure a disease that resulted from that error in the individual’s signaling [Martin: 2003]. A specific example of this can be seen in the progression of a cancerous tumor. These cells do not respond to growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting signals and are able to ignore common cell responses such as apoptosis which would also limit the growth [Martin: 2003]. As a result, the tumor is able to grow and spread continuously.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure shows the expected hypothetical results of the effects of curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP on Physarum. Plates 1-3 show a normal chemotaxis response to glucose. Plates 4-6 show the activation of the signaling pathway through treatment with dibutryl-cAMP with further growth, about 0.1cm per hour and plates 7-9 show close to no growth due to the treatment with the Protein Kinase A inhibitor, curcumin. 

Figure 2. This figure show the actual data that our group observed after the 24 hour period. The control group grew an average of 0.03cm per hour in the direction of the glucose, while the other two groups had little to no relevant growth.
