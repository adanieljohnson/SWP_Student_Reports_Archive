Title: The diminishing effect of light restriction on root: shoot ratios in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to determine if phenotypic plasticity was observable in Vigna radiata. The effect of light availability on the root: shoot ratio of Vigna radiata (mung bean) plants was tested in this experiment. This ratio was determined in order to test the phenotypic plasticity of Vigna radiata in response to a light stimulus. If sunlight availability affects root: shoot ratios, then Vigna radiata exposed to less light will have a lower root: shoot ratio. Two groups were studied: one group subjected to a normal light and dark schedule and another subjected to a shade and dark schedule. They were watered daily and the root: shoot length and weight ratios were assessed. The root: shoot weight (p=0.0002) and length (p=0.02) ratios were significantly lower for the shade plants than the light exposed plants. The shade plants needed to allocate more resources to their stems and leaves in order to procure sunlight, a struggle that the sun exposed plants did not face. Phenotypic plasticity is observable in mung bean plants due to their adaptation of different root: shoot ratios depending on light availability.  

Introduction:
Plants allocate carbon and nitrogen resources when their seeds germinate at varying amounts depending on the plant type. Environmental conditions can also affect resource allocation; this ability to change growth patterns over time is referred to as phenotypic plasticity. In this experiment, the effect of light availability on the root: shoot ratio of Vigna radiata (mung bean) plants will be tested. Mung beans were selected as the model organism because they are small seeds and they sprout quickly. Mung beans require between eight and ten hours of sunlight daily, therefore, if they are placed in a permanent shade environment, the plant will have to allocate resources differently than is typical. Mung beans typically grow in temperate rainforests, which support an abundance of plant species including broadleaf, hardwood trees. These trees have a negative effect on lower vegetation because they are able to block sunlight from reaching understory plants, like mung beans [Kubota: 2003]. Due to strain for sunlight, these understory plants will be forced to allocate more resources to shoots than to their roots. In this experiment, mung beans will represent the understory vegetation in sunlight competition with broadleaf, hardwood trees. In order for mung beans, and all understory vegetation, to survive in varying light conditions, they must be able to adapt to their environment. If these plants are unable to adapt to their environment, they are the most likely to die from light unavailability [Kitajima:1994]. The purpose of this study was to examine root: shoot ratios in mung beans exposed to different levels of light to determine light availability’s effect on phenotypic plasticity.  If sunlight availability affects root: shoot ratios, then mung beans exposed to less light will have a lower root: shoot ratio. 

Materials and Methods:
Before beginning the experiment, about 100 mung bean seeds were soaked in water for 24 hours before planting. Two separate groups were created: 18 plants exposed to full sunlight and 18 plants exposed to permanent shade conditions. The pots were labeled and filled with vermiculite. Each pot was pre-watered and Miracle Gro (50 mls) was added to each. Then, indentations were made in the vermiculite, the seeds were planted, and covered and watered daily for two weeks.  At the conclusion of two weeks, three mung beans were harvested from the full sunlight group and were washed and patted dry. Individually, each plant was weighed. Then the plant was cut at the root: shoot junction and these parts were weighed individually. This process was repeated for each of the three plants. Then, the maximum shoot length and root length were recorded. This process was repeated for the permanent shade group. A two sailed two sample t test was performed on the mean root: shoot length and weight of each group. A p-value of 0.05 was used to determine if the groups were statistically different from each other.

Results:
The mung bean plants growing in normal light conditions had a larger root: shoot length ratio (0.63 ± 0.06) than the mung beans growing in limited light conditions (0.42 ± 0.07). There was a significant difference between the groups, as seen in Figure 1 (t= 3.98, df=4, p= 0.02). The mung bean plants growing in normal light conditions had a larger root: shoot weight ratio (0.61 ± 0.03) than the mung beans growing in limited light conditions (0.33 ± 0.03). There was a significant difference between the groups, as seen in Figure 2 (t=13.38, df=4, p= 0.0002).

Discussion:
Mung bean plants growing in low light availability had a lower root: shoot ratio than those growing in high light availability, therefore, the hypothesis is supported. If plants, like the mung bean, were not able to respond to their environment through differential resource allocation, then a changing climate could mean extinction for many plant species. Plants growing with less light must allocate more resources to the leaves and stems in order to capture appropriate sunlight. In a study on perennials, plants growing at three different light levels were observed over three years. Although in the first year, the plants in low light availability had to allocate more resources to stems/leaves than reproductive means, in subsequent years allocation was not significantly different between the two categories [Soule: 1981]. This study supports the present study’s suggestion that plants with less light must allocate more resources to stems and leaves, yet, also suggests that after proper height is reached, the plant will be able to resume usual growth in other areas. In a study on Cirsium arvense (Canadian thistle), the effect of heightened carbon dioxide levels was studied. The Canadian thistle was able to allocate significantly more resources to its roots within months, again, demonstrating the phenotypic plasticity of plants [Ziska: 2017]. Sunlight availability can be altered depending on climate and current season, therefore, plants must be able to allocate their resources differently. In a study on pasture grasses, the effect of varying soil temperature on root: shoot ratios were studied. It was determined that the root: shoot ratio became progressively higher, the further the soil temperature deviated from the optimum [Davidson: 1969]. Throughout the provided studies and the present study, phenotypic plasticity in plants is supported. Whether the environmental change affects the plant aboveground of belowground indicates where the plant is likely to begin allocating more resources; therefore, the notion that in a light restricted environment, mung beans would allocate more resources to their shoots, is plausible. In the present study, only two levels of light were studied: a regular light/dark cycle and a shade/dark cycle. In order to expand this study, different light levels could be studied, like constant light, in order to observe the effect of no darkness in root: shoot ratios. The results of that study could be used to determine how low growing plants with no climax species competition can drain soil nutrients due to a higher root: shoot ratio. Phenotypic plasticity is observable in mung bean plants due to their adaptation of different root: shoot ratios depending on light availability.
