Title: Effects of Various Wavelengths on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts 

Abstract:
 Spinacia oleracea were subjected to various wavelengths to study lights effect on photosynthetic activity. Plants grow and develop in association with photosynthesis. Light is absorbed through the stomata, which can be regulated by different colors of light. Enriched chloroplasts from spinach were reduced from differential centrifuging. This assay was exposed to fluorescent, red, blue, and green light. To measure the photosynthetic activity, absorbances were collected every ten minutes during a 30-minute time period. It was hypothesized that when Spinacia oleracea was placed under these various wavelengths, blue light would induce the most photosynthetic activity. Fluorescent light was used as a controll. Green light was found to have the highest levels of photosynthetic activity (t_stat value= 1.16; p_value=0.366), followed by red (t_stat= 1.31; p_value=0.321), then blue (t_stat=6.14; p_value= 0.003). Statistical significance is variable, and these results do not support any found literature. However, further study is necessary as this scientific field is curtail to the determination of environments the optimize light utilization for efficient plant grown and development. 

Introduction:
     Sunlight is an environmental factor that influences behavior and physiology of many organisms. Photosynthetic organisms such as plants depend on light energy to evolve, grow, and develop. Photosynthesis allows plants to convert light energy into chemical energy stored as carbohydrates. This process occurs in distinct phases though the utilization of the Calvin Cycle and Krebs’ Cycle to carry and release high energy electrons to produce energy [Zong: 2018]. Through the simultaneous interaction between glycolysis and cellular respiration, ATP energy is generated for the plant’s survival.
     Plants are able to receive light energy through stomata located throughout the plants body. The stomata are pores formed by guard cells and allow the diffusion of carbon dioxide to enter and oxygen to exit. The structure of the stomata allows the plant to respond to various environmental conductions due to photosensors [Galvão:2015]. These photosensors, or photochromes, to optimize light absorbance and have evolved to respond to changes in light direction, duration, and wavelength. Plants have evolved many different classes of photoreceptors: red/far-red phytochrome (phy) and blue light receptors such as cryptochrome (cry) [Suetsugu: 2012]. These receptors are found in all green plants.
     Light responses from the photosensors are dependent on photosynthesis-independent and photosynthesis-dependent components. The photosynthesis-dependent component is blue light specific and induces rapid stomatal opening [Wang: 2011]. When plants are subject to the wavelengths of blue light, “cry” receptors known as phototropins, will activate a signal transduction cascade that optimizes the harvesting of energy from photosynthesis and production of ATP. The photosynthesis-independent component, or red-light response, primarily inhibits photosynthetic electron transport. Hence, stomatal opening is not optimized, and limited light energy is able to be absorbed from photosynthesis. It is important to note that blue light is recorded at highest abundance during the afternoon, whereas red light is found in the evening and early morning [Galvão:2015]. Green light, and its effect on stomatal opening, has limited research. However, green light is abundant in the daylight spectrum, but plants prefer the utilization of blue and red light to controll stomatal opening.
	Spinacia oleracea plants are the ideal plant to study the effect of various wavelengths from light energy on photosynthesis due to their abundance and common baseline to many plant organisms. Photosynthetic reduction will be analyzed through the chloroplast absorbance levels after being subjected to light over an interval time period. Dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), which acts as an alternate electron acceptor, was substituted to visually quantify the photosynthetic activity [Liu: 1991]. With its addition, the assays change color when reduced during photosynthesis, which aids in the measurement of absorption to determine activity. It is hypothesized that chloroplasts from the Spinacia oleracea leaves are placed under the same various wavelengths of light, then higher photosynthetic activity will occur under blue light.


Materials and Method:
     Chloroplasts from 6 Spinacia oleracea leaves were extracted by differential centrifugation. Leaves were deveined and reduced into a liquid using 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer. A solution of enriched chloroplasts was generated through centrifuging set at 200 x G. A chloroplast assay was set up for four experimental trials, each triplicates. The assay was prepared using 2 Ml of M DCPIP, 6 Ml of deionized water, and 2 Ml of a reaction buffer containing 100 mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5. Four lamps with a fluorescent, red, blue, and green bulb were set up. 
     The absorbance of each trial was measured at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer to determine photosynthetic activity. Over a 30-minute experimental period, absorbances were read ever 10 minutes. A percent change in photosynthetic activity was calculated using the data from the absorbances. Data was analyzed using a standard two sample paired t_test.


Results:
     The results obtained had various levels of significance. Average percent of photosynthetic activity was calculated and is presented in Table 1. Highest average photosynthetic activity, reduction of electrons, occurred with the chloroplasts exposed to green light (56.63%). After green light, photosynthetic activity was highest in red (35.40%), followed by blue (12.66%), then fluorescent lighting (12.40%). These results are illustrated in Table 1. Using the fluorescent lighting as a controll, a standard two sample paired t_test was conducted to determine the data’s significance. Green light had a t_stat value of 1.16 and an insignificent p_value of 0.366. Red light, the second highest in photosynthetic activity, had a t_stat value of 1.31 and an insignificent p_value of 0.321. Finally, the lowest in activity, blue light had a t_stat value of 6.14 and a significent p_value of 0.003. The data collected portrays an unreliable representation of photosynthetic activity due to varying p_values. A graphical interpretation of these results is found in Figure 1.

Discussion:
     The data generated from this experiment does not support the initial hypothesis. Originally, it was predicted that blue light would have the highest photosynthetic activity due to the wavelength’s induction of rapid stomatal opening. However, chloroplasts placed under green light had the most photosynthetic activity, followed by red light, then blue light. One caveat to thus data is the prevalence of insignificent data. The data collected for both red and green light was insignificent compared to the data collected from the blue light. Green light is known to reflect photos emitted from the sun giving plants their color. However, at the conclusion of this experiment, it was noticeable that the chloroplasts assays became colorless, suggesting that light was absorbed. This is highly unrealistic because if plants only absorb green light, the rate of photosynthesis would decrease, and the plant would die [Wang: 2011]. In addition, red light, has a longer wavelength than blue, making photosynthetic activity decrees in speed which contradicts the data presented. With the support from outside research and insignificent p_values, technical error is presumed to have occurred. Various variables such has a non-natural light environment, and limited experimental repetitions can attribute to poor data. 
     Although the results of this experiment lacked significance, study in this scientific field remains prevalent. Understanding behavior and development of plants in association to stomatal opening can aid in finding the optimal environments for plants to grow in, thus, increases the efficiency of worldwide agriculture agencies. Understanding the proper wavelengths that induce the most photosynthetic activity can help predict which light environments are required for a specific plant organism.
