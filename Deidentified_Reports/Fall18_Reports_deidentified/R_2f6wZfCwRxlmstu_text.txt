Title: Adding Methoprene to the Diet of the Manduca sexta Altered the Growth Rate by Increasing Weight

Abstract:
Pest controll is highly important in aiding the production of crops from an economical standpoint. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) serve as an alternative form of more harmful method of pest controll such as insecticides and pesticide. In this experiment, the effects of Martin’s IGR were observed on the Manduca sexta, which contains Methoprene that behaves as a synthetic form of Juvenile Hormone. Juvenile Hormone is found in low concentrations in the caterpillars when they begin their development through metamorphosis into a pupal and adult moth, making it essential among Manduca sexta maturation. In this experiment, Methoprene was given to four Manduca Caterpillars approximately the same size, while water was given to four controll caterpillars. The expectations were that the high levels of Juvenile Hormone would decrease the growth rate of the insects, however the results revealed that adding Martin’s IGR caused the insects to increase in weight compared to the controll group that received no IGR. This concludes that the Methoprene did not reduce growth in terms of weight and size, possibly due to a diluted concentration of Methoprene within the Martin’s IGR or the point in the Manduca Caterpillar life cycle at which the hormone was given.

Introduction:
This experiment observes the effects of a synthetic hormone that affects the maturation of the Manduca Caterpillar. Manduca Caterpillars are insects that belong in the Order Lepidoptera, scientifically known as the Manduca sexta. This insect serves as a model organism for observing the effects of manipulating hormonal growth because it visibly transforms through stages of life as levels of two hormones change in their levels of production. Hormones regulate the growth and development that affect the behavior and physiology of the organism, and these specific hormones produced by the Manduca Caterpillar regulates the growth process controllled simultaneously by the two hormones Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone (Johnson:2016). This insect has a holometabolous life cycle, meaning it goes through 4 stages of life that include the embryo, larvae, pupa, and the adult stage (Johnson:2016). These stages occur through molts until the final transformation from larvae to pupa occurs, where it undergoes metamorphosis (Johnson:2016). To reach the pupa stage, the levels of Juvenile Hormone must decrease while levels of Ecdysterone rise, which is referred to as the commitment pulse, where it pupates and finalizes in to its adult stage as a moth (Johnson:2016). This calls into question how the holometabolous life cycle will be affected if one of these hormones are manipulated.

The adult form of this insect differs from the larvae form in that it consumes nectar, whereas the larvae acts as a pest by eating vegetation (Johnson:2016). This larvae form of the Manduca sexta is commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, which causes damage to plants such as tobacco and tomatoes (Bryon:2017). One method in reducing the harmful effects of pests, such as the tobacco hornworm, is by manipulating the hormones of pests that prevent proper development is through Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) (EPA:2001). In this experiment, the holometabolous cycle will be manipulated by adding an IGR to the Manduca sexta called Methoprene. Such as any IGR, Methoprene is different from pesticides because it is not directly toxic to the insect, however it still alters how an insect matures through its typical life cycle (EPA:2001). One study was done on the Neomysis integer (Mysid Crustaceans) in the juvenile form, where they were either given .01, 1, or 100 μg  of methoprene/1. For the Mysid Crustaceans that were given 100 μg, the weight showed a decrease which reveals that when the Juvenile Hormone is presented randoMly in an the insects life cycle it can cause “morphogenetic abnormalities” (Ghekiere:2006). If methoprene is added to the Manduca sexta, then it should act similarly to its performance with the Mysid Crustaceans because of high concentrations of the synthetic hormone. Therefore if the Juvenile Hormone levels are increased in the diet of Manduca Caterpillars through an IGR, than the caterpillar’s growth rate will decrease. The difference in the weights of the caterpillars from the start of the experiment to the last day will be dependent on whether the caterpillars are given methoprene in their diet or not. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca caterpillars were chosen from the lab that were approximately the same size. They were divided evenly into a controll and an experimental group, where they were each labeled as a number between 1 and 4 in each group. Both groups had its own container with four compartments that each housed one Manduca Caterpillar. Before placing the caterpillars into their compartments, four breathing holes were poked through each compartment for the air to circulate. Each caterpillar was weighed on a scale and the weights were recorded in grams. Ten grams of food was measured for all eight of the caterpillars. Four of these food servings were given six drops of water as the controll groups diet using a pipette. The other four servings of food were each given six drops of Martin’s IGR. The food was then placed into the correct compartments. The caterpillars were stored in an incubator at 22 °C and each day for two weeks the caterpillar's weights were recorded. Food was weighed and given either the drops of water or hormone, depending on which group it belonged to, each time a caterpillar was out of food. A two sample t_test was used to determine if the average difference in weights for the experimental groups was smaller than the average difference in weights for the controllled group in order to test the effects of adding more Juvenile Hormone to the Manduca Caterpillar’s diet.

Results:
The mean difference in weights for the experimental group of Manduca caterpillars is 7.375 grams and the standard deviation is 1.9467 (Fig 1). The mean difference in weight for the controll group is 2.21 and the standard deviation is 1.621 (Fig. 1). Figure 1 reveals that the standard deviation for the experimental group is only slightly larger than the standard deviation for the controll group, revealing slightly more variation in the weights in the group that received the Martin’s IGR. The two-sample t_test revealed the t-value to equal 4.078 and the degrees of freedom to equal 6. The one-tailed p_value equals .00652, which is less than .01. The experimental group appeared much larger and swollen compared to the controll group by the end of this experiment. The controll group became much smaller and skinnier, and on the 10th day of the experiment they all began to pupate. Overall the experimental group grew larger than the controll group that did not receive Martin’s IGR. The experimental group grew steadily with a little fluctuation in weight during the middle of the experiment, but they overall increased towards a much higher weight than they started with. The controll group also fluctuated in the middle of the experiment, but the weights continued to decrease until there was very little daily change, which resulted in their pupation.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment concluded that the mean of the experimental group was statistically significently different than the mean of the controll group of caterpillars. However, this only proved that our the averages of the controll and experimental groups were different. Our hypothesis was not supported because the eight caterpillars that were given Martin’s IGR in their diet had a mean difference of weight that was significently higher than the eight caterpillars in the controll group. This outcome could be the result of the the Martin’s IGR that was used. It was confirmed that the Martin’s IGR used was very diluted, meaning the actual Methoprene concentration in this IGR was very small and possibly not as effective. Referring back to the study performed on the Neomysis integer, it was concluded that only the Mysid Crustaceans given the most Methoprene (100 μg ) weighed significently less than the others that were given smaller concentrations of methoprene (Ghekiere:2006). This supports that the IGR used in this experiment potentially had a smaller concentration of Methoprene, which is why the Manduca caterpillars were able to increase in size. Another study tested the effects of different concentrations of juvenile hormone on the embryonic development of silkworms before leaving the oviducts of the female moth and after oviposition of the egg. This study also revealed that the higher concentrations of juvenile hormone greatly inhibits further development, which in this case the silkworm did not mature past its blastoderm stage which is early into their development (Riddiford: 1967). This study also reveals that the time that the egg was given the Juvenile Hormone is vital because the earlier it was given, the more likely the silkworm was to end development prematurely, whereas if an egg was treated after leaving the mother its development would continue into the first-instar larvae stage and increase in size (Riddiford: 1967). In this experiment on the Manduca sexta, the caterpillars were in their larval stage which may have been too far into the development to greatly affect the caterpillars. 

The results of this experiment revealed that Methoprene did not necessarily prevent the growth rate of the experimental group from decreasing in terms of weight, but it did prevent the caterpillars from undergoing further molts and metamorphosis. The high levels of Juvenile Hormone from the Methoprene therefore hindered the commencement of the commitment pulse and froze the caterpillar in its larvae form. Theoretically, if the Martin’s IGR was less diluted and given at an earlier stage of development then the caterpillars would  have potentially weighed less and developed less. Ultimately increasing methoprene concentrations should stunt the growth and development of the tobacco hornworms and eliminate the damage of crops such as tobacco, however this could potentially harm the Manduca sexta population. The next step for this study would be to focus less on the growth in weight of the Manduca sexta, but rather focus on the behavior and physiology to reveal the internal effects of using an IGR on insects.
