Title: Weight Increase in Manduca sexta due to Precor-methoprene

Abstract:
The JH hormone regulates the metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta caterpillar by dictating its pupation. JH levels drop during the 5th larvar instar, where the caterpillar experiences its commitment pulse. Precor-methoprene is an example of a JH analog. Our study serves to observe the effect of precor-methoprene on a Manduca sexta’s mass. We predicted that a Manduca sexta caterpillar fed a diet of 10 drops of methoprene for every 10 grams of food will have a larger weight than a Manduca sexta caterpillar fed a standard diet of food with 10 drops of distilled water. Over a two week period, we found that this increase in methoprene in food led to heavier caterpillars (t_stat=2.8064, d.f.=6, p_value=0.01545). This is likely due to the JH hormone’s ability to keep the caterpillar in its larvar stage, inhibiting pupation and thus gaining additional weight rather than undergoing metamorphosis.


Introduction:
The juvenile hormone is a long chain of organic molecules produced by the corpus allata. It regulates the type of molt of Manduca sexta and controlls its metamorphosis. JH levels stay high up until the 5th larvar instar, where the 20E hormone rises and the Manduca caterpillar experiences its commitment pulse. At this stage, the caterpillar begins pupation. In a previous study of young caterpillars of the Papilio xuthus, it was found that with treatment of a JH analog at the beginning of the fourth instar stage, the insect repeated its mimetic pattern [Futahashi: 2008]. Although the study focused on insect color patterns, this color switch was associated with the progression of larvar stages. The repetition of the mimetic pattern signaled that the insect remained in the larvar stage and did not undergo pupation. This leads us to believe that with a treatment of a JH analog, the mass of a Manduca sexta could be increased as well. In our experiment, we want to see the effect of the JH hormone on the mass of Manduca caterpillars, using Precor-methoprene as our JH analog. Our controll group for comparison is caterpillars fed standard food with no presence of methoprene. If Manduca caterpillars are fed food with 10 drops of Precor-methoprene for every 10 grams of food, then they will weigh more than those fed standard food.



Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars weighing between 1.2 and 1.8 grams were selected and randoMly divided into two groups of four. We placed each group into a separate container with four sections (one for each caterpillar) after poking holes in the sides to ensure air flow. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets: the four controll caterpillars were fed a standard diet of 10 grams of caterpillar food mixed with 10 drops of distilled water (to maintain similar consistency to the experimental food), and the four experimental caterpillars were fed a diet of 10 grams of caterpillar food mixed with 10 drops of Precor-methoprene. All eight caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 25 degrees Celcius. Each day, we measured and recorded the Manduca’s weights. We also wrote down other general observations about their size, movement, and color. We used a two-tailed, two-sample t_test to compare the average change in weight between the controll and experimental groups. 


Results:
Overall, our experimental group consistently gained more weight within the two week period than the controll group. None of the Manduca caterpillars from the experimental group underwent pupation, whereas the Manduca caterpillars from the controll group began pupation by day 7. Our controll group had an average change in weight of 4.1025 +/- 0.837 grams and our experimental group had an average change in weight of 8.7525 +/- 3.2057 grams. A two-tailed, two-sample t_test with 6 degrees of freedom resulted in a t-value of 2.8064 and a p_value of 0.01545.



Discussion:
Because we found a p_value of less than 0.05, the data are statistically significent and we can reject the null hypothesis. The data reveal that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are fed food with 10 drops of Precor-methoprene per 10 grams of normal food, their weights increase, as seen in Figure 1. Our hypothesis was therefore supported. One explanation of these results could be that because methoprene is a JH analog, the experimental caterpillars stayed in the larvae stage for longer, thus gaining weight and not pupating. This explains their comparatively large weight to the controll caterpillars who were fed normal food and pupated within a week. Our results line up with the previous study that found that with treatment of JH, young caterpillars of the swallowtail butterfly repeat their mimetic pattern and thus do not begin pupation [Futahashi: 2008]. These results could be useful to farmers who are trying to controll the Manduca population because a ratio of 10 drops of methoprene to 10 grams of food will inhibit metamorphosis of the caterpillar. By inhibiting metamorphosis and keeping the species in the larvae stage, farmers could inhibit reproduction of the pests, thus eventually eliminating the population. A possible future study could be adding varying levels of Precor-methoprene to the food and seeing how much is necessary to inhibit pupation.
