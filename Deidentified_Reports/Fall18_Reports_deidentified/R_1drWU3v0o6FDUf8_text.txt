Title: The effect of juvenile hormone mimic on the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
Some insects can be considered pests in any distinct stage of their life cycle. Modifying the juvenile hormone levels in insects is one way of pest controll. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are substances capable of mimicking JH. Subsequently, we conducted an experiment to test the effect of IGRs on the growth of Manduca sexta larvae. We hypothesized that adding IGRs to the Manduca caterpillar’s diet will result in faster growth, but will take a longer period of time to mature into an adult. Eight Manduca caterpillars were split into two groups of four. Both groups were fed 10g of food each day, however, the treatment group's food had 5 drops of IGR added to it. The caterpillars were checked on every other day for two weeks to be fed record their individual weights. After two weeks have passed, we averaged the weight change of each group and found out that the treated caterpillars grew faster than those in the controll group during the second week, but the duration of the experiment was not enough to observe whether the caterpillars will molt into adult moths. Therefore, our hypothesis was partially supported. We can conclude that the use of insect growth regulator proved to be a good method of pest controll. 

Introduction:
Some insects can be considered pests in any distinct stage of their life cycle. One form of pest controll is the alteration of the juvenile hormone, the hormone that regulates several insect functions and their molt type, in the insect’s body system. A specific species of interest is the Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. Juvenile hormones play a very important role in the tobacco hornworm’s life cycle [Johnson: 2016]. The caterpillar’s life is separated into multiple stages, with the ultimate result of transforming into adult moths, which are widely known as pests in the agricultural industry [Jouanin: 1998]. During its life, the Manduca’s pattern of molting into multiple stages is greatly influenced by the juvenile hormone. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are substances that are capable of mimicking the juvenile hormone. IGRs were previously tested on linden bugs, resulting in a relatively low hatch rate and a drastic decrease in the chances of maturing into an adult [Tunaz: 2004]. As a result, a number of questions was raised. Do synthetic juvenile hormones impact Manduca development? How will they be affected? We carried out an experiment to test IGRs that mimic juvenile hormones on the life cycle of Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that adding IGRs to the Manduca caterpillar’s diet will result in faster growth, but will take a longer period of time to mature into an adult.

Materials and Method:
We collected eight Manduca caterpillars, all in their 3rd instar larva stage, and split them into two groups of four. Each group had a container with four cells for each caterpillar to be placed in. In addition, we punctured holes into each cell to allow air flow for our caterpillars. We weighed and stirred 10g of food to be placed in each cell for each caterpillar. Five drops of IGR were added to four caterpillars’ food using a transfer pipet, whereas the other four (controll, in the other container) were given food without IGR. We organized the containers so that the caterpillars would still have room for movement after the food and liquid was placed into each individual section. After the initial feeding and weighing, all caterpillars were kept in an incubator and checked on every other day for two weeks to record their individual weights and weight change in grams and clean their containers and replace their food. A two sample t_test was completed to determine if the data was statistically significent.

Results:
 The results of the experiment are outlined in the figure above. In Figure 1, the caterpillars in both the controll and treatment group grew at the same rate for the first 7 days. After the first week has passed, the average weight change of the caterpillars in the controll group was still increasing, but at a significently decreased rate. Meanwhile, the caterpillars in the treatment group continued to grow at a relatively rapid rate. On the 12th day until the end of our experiment, the average weight change of the caterpillars in the controll group decreased, and that of the treatment group continued to increase. The caterpillars were still in their 5th instar larva stage. As for the statistics, the p_value for the two-sample t_test was calculated to be 0.06 for a t-value of 2.3.

Discussion:
After observing the Manduca sexta caterpillars and collecting data, we concluded that our hypothesis was partially supported. The caterpillars that were treated with IGR grew faster than the controll group. None of the caterpillars matured into adults over the course of the experiment, so we cannot tell if it actually takes a longer period of time for the treatment group to mature into adults than the controll group.  Over the first week, it seems like the IGR hasn’t taken a significent effect yet. After that, the average weight change of the caterpillars in the controll group was reduced due to the death of a caterpillar in this group. This sudden death could be the result of a lack of food, or possibly low hormone levels in its body. The continued increase in the average weight change of the caterpillars in the treatment was due to the successful contribution of the IGRs in regulating and enhancing the caterpillars’ development and functions. What we can take away from the p_value is that the results were somewhat significent as a result of all that was discussed. We can conclude that the use of insect growth regulator proved to be a good method of pest controll. This experiment could be improved in a number of ways, such as increasing the amount of IGR given to the treatment group in drops, in addition to extending the duration of the experiment to see if the caterpillars in both groups molted into adult moths. The use of IGRs in integrated pest management for stored product insects may be an important factor for the long term. Manifestly, there is a critical need for these agents based on the loss of other chemical method due to resistance and environmental considerations [Oberlander: 1997].
