Title: Effect of increased sodium in gastrocnemus muscle of a frog 

Abstract:
Sodium is a vital hormone in the process of the muscle contraction of a frog. The opening of sodium channels in the sciatic nerve (located above the gastrocnemus muscle) activates the necessary action potential that floods into the muscle fiber and, through another hormone called calcium, eventually causes muscle contraction in the frog. Here we observe how muscle contractions are affected when the amount of sodium is increased in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle as opposed to a frog without the added amount of sodium in the gastrocnemus muscle. Our group expected that added sodium would lead to a stronger contraction (measured by volts) in the gastrocnemus muscle, especially compared to the contraction of the unaffected gastrocnemus muscle.  Our data showed that there was not a significent difference between the contraction force of the experimental group (added sodium) and the contraction force of the controll group (no added sodium).  This significance suggests that increased levels of sodium in a frog leg, on the whole, does not cause a significently stronger contraction. 

Introduction:
There are many chemicals which influence muscle contractions. One such chemical is sodium. However, sodium doesn’t act alone; the opening of sodium channels is activated by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal and the binding of acetylcholine to its receptor on the targeted muscle fiber. Without the initial release and binding of acetylcholine and the eventual opening of sodium channels, contractions wouldn’t occur [Johnson:2018]. Contractions are important in the gastrocnemus muscle, located in the frog’s leg, because they enable the frog to jump. Jumping is essential to the frog because this is one of its primary means of escaping potential predators [Bulbert:2015]. This specific experiment specifically studies sodium and its role in facilitating the movement of a frogs’ leg. We gathered three frog legs and stimulated each with and without increased sodium levels in a before-and-after type fashion. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of sodium in a frog’s gastrocnemus muscle will cause a significently stronger contraction than that of a frog with no increased sodium within the gastrocnemus muscle. Without these contractions, frogs cannot utilize one of their greatest defense mechanisms against prey, and could become endangered. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, the controll group was the 3 frogs without the added sodium. The experimental group was the 3 frogs with the added sodium. The dependent variable was contraction, while the independent variable was the amount of sodium. 

The sample size was three frog legs. The first step was to attach the first frog to the stimulus apparatus, also known as a transducer, and electrically stimulated it the first time without the added sodium (.1 Ml in volume). The then, using the interface on the apparatus and our lab notebooks, to record the results of the contraction. After this came the removal of the frog leg from the apparatus and injection of the added sodium into the first frog leg’s gastrocnemus muscle via a Sharps needle. The group then reattached the first frog leg to the apparatus and electrically stimulated it again. Using the interface of the apparatus and our notebooks, we then recorded the results of this contraction. The group repeated these steps again with the other two frog leg gastrocnemus muscles, recording each of their respective results. Then, the group used a one-tailed-T test to determine the statistical significance of the gathered data.

Results:
The increased amount of sodium did not consistently cause stronger contractions, with an obtained p_value (0.704) that is not statistically significent. While the first contraction influenced by sodium was stronger, further contractions did not repeat this trend [Figure 1]. The controll group with no increased sodium levels did have consistently stronger contractions, though the gap between this and the experimental wasn’t that dramatic. There was a t-value of .438608, which signifies that while there was some evidence against no statistically significent difference, it was not enough evidence to quantify a statistically significent difference. There is not a statistically significent relationship, in this experiment, between added sodium and contraction force. 

Discussion:
The results did not confirm our hypothesis. The addition of the hormone sodium to the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, on the whole, does not cause significently stronger contractions. That said, these contractions enable the frog to leap away and escape from potential predators, showcasing how important the opening of sodium channels in the frog’s leg truly is to its survival. Sodium, alongside the hormone calcium, is still important in the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, even if it isn’t an increased dose.  This also aligns with another study done on the effects of sodium on muscle contraction in humans; in that experiment too, “reduced sodium” caused a drop in contraction force [Clausen, 2003]. This information could be useful if a specific species of frog was ever to become endangered; perhaps they are suffering from a reduced volume of sodium and increasing their sodium intake could enable them to escape predators more efficiently and continue to reproduce. As for further studies on sodium and contraction, it may be more efficient to utilize a test other than injection into the gastrocnemus muscle. Maybe an injection instead into the sciatic nerve would be a more useful experiment.
