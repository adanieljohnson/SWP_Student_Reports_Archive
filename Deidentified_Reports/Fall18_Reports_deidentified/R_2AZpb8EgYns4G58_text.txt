Title: The Effect of IGR on the Growth of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) uses a hormone known as juvenile hormone (JH) to trigger growth in its larval form. This experiment was performed to test the hypothesis that the addition of JH would cause larval M. sexta to have reduced growth. IGR, a juvenile hormone mimicker, was given to one group of caterpillars in their food, while another was given only food and water. They were left to grow for 2 weeks and weighed each day. At the end the difference in their growth each day was compiled. The analysis of the data collected show that there is a no significant difference (p =  0.903) between the experimental and control groups, showing that group given JH did not grow any larger or smaller on average as the one that was not fed JH. This does not support the hypothesis, suggesting that JH has little to do with the actual mass of the caterpillars. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also called the tobacco hornworm, a type of moth, use several different hormones to regulate their growth. M. sexta is a known pest animal, and studying their use of hormones might allow for better control of their populations. The juvenile hormone (JH) is essential for starting a phase in development called the commitment pulse, which occurs when very low levels of JH are combined with rising levels of another hormone called Ecdysterone [Johnson: 2016]. The commitment pulse is the first step in pupation, which allows the larval M. sexta to grow into an adult moth. If given artificial JH before this stage, they will be prevented from reaching their commitment pulse, which will cause them to grow abnormally. Similar experiments have found that other factors such as temperature difference can affect growth in this larval stage [Hayes: 2015], and alteration JH is known to affect growth of Bombyx mori, another moth species [Zhang: 2017]. Our hypothesis is that giving larval M. sexta JH will prevent them from growing as large as they would otherwise.

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were obtained and placed into individual compartments in two separate groups: the experimental group, fed standard caterpillar food with the addition of 5 drops IGR each, a chemical that mimics the effect of JH the control group, fed only standard caterpillar food as well as 5 drops of water to control for the IGR given to the other group. The caterpillars were then placed in the same incubator at an optimal temperature for growth and left for 14 days. They were weighed daily and fed when necessary. Each caterpillar was assessed by averaging the growth they did each day, and this was totaled into a mean growth for each group. A two-sample t-test was performed on the data. 

Results:
The mean of the control group was not significantly different from the mean of the experimental group (P = 0.903), shown in figure #1. The control group grew rather consistently, and each individual was quite similar to each other in size. In addition, two of the control group had pupated by day 12 (see figure #3). The experimental group was very strange in that two caterpillars were markedly smaller than the others, shown in figure #2. For example, experimental caterpillar #1 had an average daily growth of 0.153, which is staggeringly smaller than #2’s 1.191. These two smaller caterpillars also showed signs of health problems, such as shed moltings that were caught around the abdomen for the bulk of the experiment. 

Discussion:
According to these data, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups. This noes not support the hypothesis that giving JH to larval M. sexta would lessen their growth compared to those given no extra JH. 
Though the growth was not any different on average, the two groups were quite different in some surprising ways. The experimental group was quite varied as compared to the control group. Caterpillars #1 and #4 of the experimental group were stunted and much smaller than those of the control group, but #2 and #3 of the experimental group were large, with #2 ending as the largest caterpillar. Granted, this is why statistical tests are done, to “iron out” these types of anomalies. However, the question remains: why did the JH only effect two caterpillars? Is it possible that experimental caterpillars #2 and #3 had mutation or trait that allowed them to thrive? Or, perhaps their reaction was the “normal” one, and the health issues noted by #1 and #4 are more anomalous. One  experiment on M. sexta found that the addition of JH did not affect the final size, only the rate of growth [Hatem: 2015]. This would match the two larger caterpillars from the experimental group, as they seemed to grow just as large as those in the control group, only neither of them pupated before the experiment was concluded.  Ideally, the experiment should be repeated with a much larger sample size to help answer some of these questions. 
It is also interesting to note that the two smaller caterpillars shared the “collar” of shed exoskeleton around the abdomen. In both cases it seemed to cause some harm, discoloring the body behind it. Presumably it was blocking the flow of nutrients to that part of the abdomen. It seems that this binding was somehow caused by whatever made their growth stunted, or perhaps it was itself the cause. Again, further tests should be done to assess the cause and effect of this strange injury. 
Note that this experiment had a few potential points of error. Unfortunately, several days were unaccounted for. One day was left blank because a team member was temporarily unable to access the lab, and three more were unrecorded because the lab was closed due to Hurricane Florence.
