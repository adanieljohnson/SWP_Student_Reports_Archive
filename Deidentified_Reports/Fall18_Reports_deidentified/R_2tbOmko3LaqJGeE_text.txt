Title: Effect of Sunlight on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Oil seed Radishes 

Abstract:
Oilseed radishes (Raphanus sativus L.) are a cover crop often used to restore the nutrients to the soil. These versatile plants are key organisms in the maintenance and restoration of soil properties and the cycling of nutrients. While they are not shade-tolerant, they are able to allocate and distribute resources evenly and maintain their growth in such conditions. The hypothesis was that the root: shoot ratio of radishes grown in the sun would be lower than those grown in the shade. This was drawn from the idea that with stable growing conditions, the plant had no urgency to allocate resources. Meanwhile, the counterpart should compensate for the lack of sunlight with larger roots to seek out nutrients. By measuring the root to shoot ratio of oilseed radishes in different light environments, the length and weight can be calculated and compared to see how differently the two would grow. For the following experiment, ratios of root: shoot measurements were recorded to determine the effectiveness of the radishes ability to allocate resources. After measuring their growth following a two-week period, the results showed that roots grown in the sunlight had a higher root to shoot ratio than those grown in the shade. With these results, the original hypothesis was rejected.

Introduction:
When it comes resource allocation in plants, sunlight is often the most important resource because of the energy that is synthesized from it. To photosynthesize, plants require access to moderate to high levels of sunlight to provide a sustainable energy source. This chemical energy is stored in sugars and other carbohydrate molecules, where it is later allocated and distributed throughout the plant. [Bazzaz: 1997] Plants often try and compensate if there is a lack of sunlight, changing the root to shoot ratio of their growth. With a lack of sunlight, there is no need for large leaves as there is a limited light source. With that in mind, resource allocations should be directed towards root growth in order to obtain more nutrients from the soil. Based on Gadgil and Solbrig’s theory of life history evolution, patterns of resource allocation respond to different environmental conditions to ensure the best survivability strategy. [Soule: 1981] In two different environments, the same plant is expected to grow differently depending on the benefit or harm created by the environment it exists in. The oilseed radish, also known as raphanus sativus L., is a cover crop and grows best in cool, moist, growing conditions and moderate levels of sunlight. [Bazzaz: 1997] If a reduced light environment is exposed to these seeds, the expectation is that the roots would have a higher root: shoot ratio because the lack of sunlight forces the plant to invest in other method of resource allocation. A lack of surface nutrients should force larger roots to find more resources. The hypothesis tested is that oilseed radishes grown in the direct sunlight will have smaller root to shoot ratio than those grown in the shade.

Materials and Method:
The experiment conducted focused on the germination and young life of radish seeds. The experiment was set with 40 seeds spread evenly over eight boxes. With five seeds in each box, there were spares available if some of the seeds did not germinate. After planting the seeds, half in the shade and half in the sun, they were left to grow on their own for two weeks. Each day, they were watered with 100 Ml of water for each plant box. Once the two-week period ended, three plants from each of the boxes, both dark and light, were randoMly selected and taken as part of the experimental pool. They were then measured for their root and shoot ratios. In total, the experiment allocated 12 radishes grown in the dark and 12 in the light; a total of 24 plants. Then, using a two-sample, one-tailed t_test for both the length and weight of the radishes, the ratios and standard deviations were recorded. From those tests, two p_values, one for weight, and one for length were also recorded to test the statistical accuracy of the experiment.  By using a one-tailed two-sample t_test, the two groups of light and dark could be recorded separately, as they were independent of one another. 

Results:
The mean root: shoot ratio for weight was 0.29 +/- 0.14 grams for the sunlight controll and the mean root: shoot ratio for the weight of the experimental shade was 0.18 +/- 0.12grams. (Fig. 1) The mean of the weight controll was statistically significent compared with the experimental group. Using a two-sample t_test (one-tailed) to analyze the results (t_stat = 1.927311, d.f.= 22, p = 0.033476), the experiment found that the weight for the experimental shade was lower than the sunlight controll. The mean root: shoot ratio for the length of the controll was 2.09 +/- 0.84cm and for the shade, it was 1.65 +/- 0.81cm.(Fig. 2) The mean of the length controll was not statistically significent compared with the experimental group. (t_stat = 1.33078, d.f.= 22, p = 0.196891). While the shade was lower in the length category, the data did not show statistical significance in the comparison.

Discussion:
The hypotheses, that the root: shoot ratio of those grown in the sun would be lower than the growth in the shade, was not supported. The mean of the root: shoot ratio for both weight and length were higher, although only the weight was statistically significent. These plants showed plasticity in their ability to partition resources in response to environmental differences, shifting resources of plants to favor shoot growth as seen in similar experiments. [Coleman: 1989] Radishes primarily grow underground, with most of their nutrient allocation in the soil, however, oilseed radishes still rely heavily on the sunlight needed for growth. Repeated studies indicate that oilseed radishes are not shade-tolerant. [Weil: 2006] Since both shade and sunlight were planted in the same nutrient-rich soil, both got the adequate and equal nutrients they needed. Plants grown in the sunlight have large roots in order to support the large radish grown underground, requiring higher root to shoot ratio. Oilseed radishes have thick taproot penetration potential, compared to other cover crops. The deep rooting ability enables it to leave large and deep holes, enabling air, water, and other nutrients to penetrate the soil. [Downey: 1971] This ability to allocate resources could have benefitted the oilseed radishes to grow well could have outweighed its need for sunlight. Despite it being in the shade, the radishes still grew remarkably well and showed that those grown in the sun still had a higher root: shoot ratio. In order to improve this experiment for the future, there should be a completely dark room instead of simply shade. The shade may not have been enough to trigger a proper response from the seeds that were tested. A larger sample size should also be considered to test the accuracy, as well as increasing the duration growth time. These factors should contribute to a more reliable method of recording data in root: shoot scenarios.
