Title: Calcium improves reaction time.

Abstract:
In vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscles function via motor neurons. Using action potentials, they conduct impulses that cause movement.Tubules in the cell membrane help spread the AP and cause change in DHP and ryanodine receptors releasing calcium.This triggers actin/myosin binding which in turn causes muscle contractions. To test this we found the stimulus threshold for the frog leg and we found the latent period at .1 above the threshold. We then repeated this process except injecting calcium prior to finding the latent period and threshold. We hypothesize that calcium will cause a quicker reaction time in the muscles. After experimentation, we concluded that the hypothesis was supported as the muscles injected with calcium had a faster reaction time. This experiment helps to explain how calcium affects muscle contractions in organisms.


Introduction:
In vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscles function via motor neurons.These are nerve cells that pass from the central nervous system towards a muscle and conducts an impulse that causes movement. This is caused using action potentials. When an AP arrives at a neuromuscular junction, which is a synapse between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber, acetylcholine is released from motor neuron terminals and diffuses across the synaptic cleft to bind to receptors [Ebashi 1968]. This causes ion channels in the motor end plate to open Na+ channels. T tubules in the cell membrane help spread the AP. As the AP travels down the tubules this causes change in the conformation of DHP and ryanodine receptors, releasing Ca++ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to sarcoplasm. This triggers actin/myosin binding by calcium ions binding with troponin, causing tropomyosin to move from the face of the actin filament to which myosin heads must use to cause muscle contraction [Berchtold 2000]. At rest the intracellular calcium ion concentration is about 10⁻⁸ M. Then after stimulation (action potential) this increases to about 10⁻⁶ M [Szent-Gyorgyi 1975]. Without calcium the muscle wouldn’t be able to contract. In this experiment we are examining how the release of calcium affects reaction time in the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog leg. We hypothesized that calcium will cause a quicker reaction time in the muscle. 


Materials and Method:
First we started off by preparing the frog leg. Using forceps, we grasped the skin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin off. Using a dissecting probe we separated the inner thigh muscles to locate the sciatic nerve. We then isolated the nerve from the surrounding connective tissue. Next we used a force transducer to find the threshold potential of the muscle by applying the stimulus directly to the muscle. We then found the reaction time at .1 above the threshold for 3 trials. We then waited a minute for the muscle to relax and injected .1 Ml of 50 mM calcium into the muscle. We then found the threshold potential and reaction time for 3 trials. We repeated this process again for two more frog legs. 


Results:
After performing the experiment, we saw that each frogs reaction time was quicker after calcium injections. Based on Figure 1, the average reaction time after calcium was injected was 12.22 s, while the average reaction time prior to calcium injection was 20.55 s. After performing a paired t_test, it was shown that the data was statistically significent (t value: 4.4721, d.f.: 8, 95% confidence interval, p value: .0021). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis we set out to test was supported by the data. Based on Figure 1, calcium did increase reaction time in the gastrocnemus muscle. When calcium is injected into the muscle this causes the action potentials to travel more rapidly and increases the rate at which contractions occur because there is more calcium flowing in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and being released to bind the actin/myosin structure. The rate of Ca2+ uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and the rate of SR filling affects the speed at which muscle contractions occur [Berchtold 2000]. Each frog leg was different, and the variation in the data could be due in part to more liquid in the muscle which increases tension. This experiment can be used by professionals in the healthcare field to learn ways to help patients with cramps, muscle spasms, and other symptoms of calcium. One way to improve this experiment we would be to look at how calcium channel antagonists affect the muscle contraction and reaction time.

Figure 1. Effect of calcium on reaction time. Three frog legs were each stimulated using a force transducer on the gastrocnemus muscle. The latent period was found for 3 trials.Then each muscle was injected with .1 Ml of mM calcium and the latent period was again for 3 trials. Each bar is the time for the 3 trials of controll and calcium groups. Error bars are +-3 s.d.
