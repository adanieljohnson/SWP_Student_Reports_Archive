Title: The effect of color variations on level of aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior brings together many different skills in the laboratory: observational, theories across different sciences, and especially experimental. It is important to understand how abiotic factors affect the behavior of animals because it can help us better prepare for changes in the environment and what that will mean for different species. In this experiment, we tested how changes in color of water affect the level of aggression in Betta splendins. The expected result was that there would be a significent difference in their level of aggression but in reality there was no significance. However the data suggested that there was a trend towards higher levels of aggression when there was no glass divider as opposed to when there was. 


Introduction:
Ethology brings together theories from evolutionary biology and applies them to observations within animals. In this experiment we will test the effects of changing water color on the agnostic behavior of Betta splendins, small fish also known as Siamese fighting fish. We will divide the two aquariums into three sections: ne with red, one with green, and one with normal water. We predict that there will be a significent difference between their normal behavior in clear water and their behavior in colored water. This field is a developing one. It is unclear how the mechanisms of color work to influence the behaviors of animals but past studies have shown that it can impact many different behaviors. “In fish, some studies have shown that environmental color affects growth (4-6), feeding (7-9), food conversion rate (10), stress (10,11), aggression (12), and egg development (13)” [Volpato: 2004]. There is still much work to be done in this field of research because if changing environmental conditions as simple as color could greatly impact an organism, what greater changes could impact the behavior of animals?


Materials and Method:
To test this experiment, we will have two separate tri-divided aquariums in which one has colored water (red and green) and one aquarium filled with normal uncolored water. After observing the betta males interact for five minutes while physically separated, they will rest and then we will observe them when they are not partitioned. We will repeat the same process in both colored waters. Our independent variable is the water color and the dependent variable is the aggressiveness of the males together. To measure this, we will record the behaviors based on a scale of 1-5, from least aggressive to most aggressive:
1. No aggressive behavior
2. Broadside: pelvic fin flickering; facing: erect pectoral fins
3. Broadside: tail beating; facing: spread opercula
4. Broadside: tail flashing; facing: protrude branchiostegal membrane
5. Agonistic behavior: raising dorsal fin, lowering head, arching back, darkening skin, darting, biting/nipping


Results:
The trend shows that color had little effect on animal behavior in betta fish. The mean levels of aggression for all 4 fish with glass divider in every condition is not statistically significent (F(11)=0.842, p=0.462). This was similar for the no glass divider results which were also not statistically significent (F(11)=0.206, p=0.818). However, it did suggest that the amount of separation between the fish does impact their levels of aggression because they had a higher overall level of aggression when they were not separated by a glass divider in an aquarium.


Discussion:
The trend reveals that there is very little correlation between color and level of aggression. They was not a significent difference between clear, red, and green colors thus rejecting the original hypothesis that color would increase the level of aggression. While there was no significent difference between colors in an aquarium, the trend revealed that the betta males were more aggressive when put in a tank without a glass divider, regardless of the color. Overall, this reveals that the betta fish are more likely to attack each other when there is no separation. This further suggests that escalation [Johnson: 2018] is a key component of agnostic behavior because once the fish were put together, they escalated their behaviors much faster than they had when they were divided by glass. They were able to reach a 5 much quicker than they had when they were separated. This experiment on betta splendins is just a small step in understanding animal behavior. Even in just this one trial it was easy to see that each pair of fish varied in their levels of aggression from others. However, betta fish are clearly very agnostic animals even though this current experiment did not show that color increased this aggression.
