Title: Effect of Azaguard on Manduca sexta pupation

Abstract:
I forgot to add this

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta depends on two essential hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E), for the organization and maintenance of its life cycle. Because of its large size, the fact that it can be precisely staged and that it is reared on an artificial diet (see Gilbert et al., 1980), it has been possible to accumulate a considerable amount of data on the three principal hormones controllling its growth and development [Bollenbacher: 1981]. JH is present in higher levels during the larval stage of the Manduca sexta and regulates the type of molt development,  while 20E spikes during metamorphosis and pupation and regulates the timing of molting during insect development. To signal that the Manduca sexta has grown large enough, a commitment pulse (small increase in ecdysteroids prior to 5th larval stage) is carried out. In general, it appears that there are three components of the ecdysteroid titer that influence the development of an insect: temporal, quantitative and qualitative [Bollenbacher: 1981].  The temporal component includes the time at which a change in titer occurs and the duration of that change; the quantitative component is the change(s) in the absolute amount(s) of ecdysteroids present; and the qualitative component represents the types of ecdysteroids that comprise the titer [Bollenbacher: 1981]. The present study will be examining what will happen if 20E is inhibited in the Manduca sexta leading up to pupation. The study will address the importance of the commitment pulse and subsequent 20E levels for successful pupation to occur. It is predicted that a decrease of 20E, due to the administration of the 20E inhibitor Azaguard, will result in unsuccessful pupation for the Manduca sexta. The effects of the 20E inhibitor will be measured by observing weight (g) and length (mm) as well as taking general observations over two weeks.



Materials and Method:
Manduca sexta were separated into equally sized experimental and controll groups. The experimental group received 3 drops of Azaguard for every 10g of artificial diet, while the controll group received 3 drops of distilled water for every 10g of artificial diet. All caterpillars were stored in an identical incubator. More food was added as seen necessary. Weight (g) and length (mm) were recorded once a day for two weeks. We used a two sample t_test to compare the weight and length respectively of the two groups.


Results:
After two weeks it was found that the four Manduca sexta in the controll group were all still alive, while the treatment group had zero subjects still alive. The treatment group had all deaths occur at some point between day 10 and day 15. The controll group average weights experienced a larger percentage of growth than the treatment group (111% compared to 44% from day one to max weight). The controll length compared with the treatment length has a similar pattern, although to a lesser extent, with the controll group experiencing a 31% growth with day one being compared to max average length, while the treatment group experienced a 21% increase. Both groups saw a similar pattern of weight and length increase for the first four days and then a decrease in both weight and length for the remainder of the study. The standard deviations for the controll group were 1.236 for the weight and 7.011 for the length. The standard deviations for the treatment group were 0.816 for the weight and 6.200 for the length. The caterpillars from the controll group all underwent pupation by the end of the study, while only one subject from the treatment group started pupation before dying. We used a two tailed t_test to examine statistical significance. The t-value in comparing the weights of the two groups was 6.054 and the p_value was 4.30 x 10^(-6). The t-value in comparing the lengths of the two groups was 2.842 and the p_value was 0.00948.


Discussion:
The hypothesis that introduction of a 20E inhibitor to the Manduca sexta diet would have a negative effect on pupation was proven to be correct. Due to the fact that 20E is necessary for a successful commitment pulse and during the experiment the commitment pulse would have been inhibited, the test subjects in the treatment group did not successfully pupate and instead died. For a successful molt to occur the pupation stage must observe a 20E rise much higher than JH levels. However, when we inhibited the secretion of 20E, the rise in 20E was not able to occur. Our caterpillars that received the 20E inhibitor all died without successfully entering the pupal stage, which is due to the inability to undergo a successful commitment pulse. The 20E inhibitor also limited the growth of the treatment group, which further explains why the commitment pulse was unsuccessful. The treatment caterpillars did not reach a large enough size to where they had enough nutrients stored up for a successful pupation. Although we were not able to collect data from day 11-13, our data still showed significent correlation. Our study was found to be statistically significent in that our p_value was well under .05 in comparing both weight and length of the different groups. This means that we can say to a greater than 95% (in our case greater than 99%) certainty that our data was not due to chance. For future experimentation we would first add more caterpillars to the study so that each group had a larger data set. We would also check in on the caterpillars every day to gain a more precise picture of 20E inhibitor effects. If the results from that experiment match what we have learned already, we would move into testing what amount of 20E inhibitor causes the unsuccessful pupation of the Manduca sexta.
