Title: The increase in root to shoot ratios in Vigna radiata with higher levels of nitrogen 

Abstract:
Organisms respond to resource limitation in two ways: trade-offs and resource allocation. Trade-offs involve consuming more resources during one stage of a lifetime than another and resource allocation is the pattern in which a species distributes and utilizes the limited resources. This study looks specifically at plant resource allocation by measuring root to shoot ratios in Vigna radiata. Focusing on nitrogen levels in soil, high levels of nitrogen in one group were compared to normal levels of nitrogen in the controll group to see if changing the amount of nitrogen would affect plant growth, allowing this to later be applied to agricultural techniques. Due to the fact that nitrogen is an essential nutrient needed for plant growth it was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of high nitrogen level plants would be lower than that of the normal levels of nitrogen plants. After watering the plants for two weeks, either with nitrogen solution or regular tap water, the masses and lengths were recorded for the root to shoot ratios. The results showed that the average mass and length root to shoot ratios were greater in the high levels of nitrogen group. After performing a one tailed two-sample t_test statistical analysis it was found that only the length ratios were significently

Introduction:
Plants change their allocation strategies due to different environmental conditions in order to increase growth. Plant allocation occurs in various plant activities including growth, reproduction, and defense under strong selection. [Bazzaz: 1997]. Allocation patterns are always shifting under changing environmental conditions. For example, when light is limited, plants reduce their investment in the enzyme Rubisco and shift their investment from nitrogen to chlorophyll to obtain more light. [Bazzaz: 1997]. It is truly impressive how competitive plants are and how this is a greatly beneficial technique for the organisms. A good indicator of change in growth is root to shoot ratios with weight and length. The model organism that was chosen to study plant allocation in is the Vigna radiata, better known as the mung bean plant. This is a well-suited organism because of its small size and short life cycle. Since it was known that plants often allocate the growth of their roots depending on amounts of nutrients in the soil, it was decided to study how different nitrogen levels effect root and shoot growth. The nitrogen cycle is very important when it comes to industrial food production, but also leads to many environmental problems. The cycle has been greatly accelerated due to the use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers worldwide, enabling a large increase in food production. Unfortunately, it has led to issues like eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic systems as well as acidification. [Galloway: 2008]. This shows that adding nitrogen has improved agricultural techniques and food production yet may be harming the environment. As a society, it should be taken into account how important the rise in food production is, before the environment suffers. A study on two invasive plant species investigated biomass allocation growth by comparing the phenotypic responses to nitrogen with mass and area measurements of the roots and leaves. They found that the two plants demonstrated considerable nitrogen-acclimation abilities by investing more biomass into different parts of the plant than others and concluded that their two species had improved competitive abilities in higher nitrogen environments, suggesting that enhanced soil nitrogen levels might promote their invasion. [Manlian: 2005]. With studies like this in mind and due to the fact that nitrogen is an essential nutrient needed in plants, it was predicted that increasing the levels of nitrogen would improve plant growth meaning the shoots would grow longer. If using two different groups and manipulating the soil nitrogen levels, then the root to shoot ratio of high nitrogen level plants should be lower than that of the regular amounts of nitrogen plants.

Materials and Method:
The Vigna radiata plants were grown in two different nitrogen conditions, with four pots in each group. The high levels of nitrogen plants were kept on a different tray than the controll group that was given regular water. 24 hours before planting, the mung beans were soaked in water. The next day, eight pots were assembled with vermiculite. They were each pre-watered and given 50 milliliters of Miracle Gro. Each pot had nine holes dug with a few seeds being added to each. The two trays were left in the greenhouse with the same conditions except for the amounts of nitrogen in the water added. The plants were watered daily for two weeks with either regular tap water or the high nitrogen solution. After the two weeks, the plants were removed from the soil and cut to separate the root and the shoot. The roots and shoots of each plant were weighed and measured in length. From here a one tailed two-sample t_test was used to compare the root to shoot ratios of the different conditions and a critical p_value of less than 0.05 was desired for the data to be significently different. 

Results:
The general trends for the root to shoot ratios are that the high nitrogen level groups have a larger value when averaged together. For the length root to shoot ratio displayed in Figure 1, the mean of the high nitrogen levels group was statistically significently different than that of the controll group. (t_stat=3.78, d.f.=6, p=0.0046). The high level of nitrogen group has an average value of 1.389 mm (0.117) and the controll group has an average of 1.030 mm (0.149).  However, the mass root to shoot ratios shown in Figure 2 have significent difference indicated by the two-tailed t_test. (t_stat=0.17, d.f.=6, p=0.435). The two averages are very close in value with the high nitrogen level average at 0.794 grams (0.242) and the controll group at 0.764 grams (0.253). 

Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis that the root to shoot ratio in high nitrogen level mung bean plants would be lower than those in regular levels of nitrogen. Root to shoot ratios were calculated for both length and weight, which was helpful because only the length ratios gave significently different results. Although the mass ratios were not significently different, it was visually apparent that the controll group plants grew taller, while the high nitrogen group showed signs of death with loss of coloring and holes forming in the leaves. This is an example of a phenomena called nitrogen burn which is a common problem caused by fertilizers. This was demonstrated in a study on cowpea plants focusing on the influences of nitrogen fertilization on grain yield with well-watered and dry field conditions. They used the fertilizer Folian which contains N, P, K, S, and Fe and found that higher concentrations of Folian (33 g N/L) caused leaf burn and did not increase yield as much as lower concentrations (22 g N/L and 11 g N/L). [Elowad: 1987]. This helps explain why there was leaf burn and shorter shoots in the high-level nitrogen group. Although these results were not predicted, they are logical because the Miracle Gro and soil used already should have provided a sufficient amount of nitrogen nutrients for the plants. By adding higher amounts of nitrogen, it became harmful for the plant and hindered growth. High amounts of nitrogen can be harmful in any aspect of the environment, whether it is contributing to climate change or ecosystem acidification. The nitrogen cycle often leads to a cascade of effects like causing photochemical smog, then being oxidized in the atmosphere to nitric acid, then deposited on the ground leading to eutrophication. [Galloway: 2008]. A study similar to this one focused on the effect of nitrogen and sun levels on net photosynthesis and growth in coffee plants. They found that high nitrogen levels increased plant height no matter the amounts of light and promoted a larger leaf area in the plants grown in the shade. [Fahl: 2015]. This does not align with the results in which higher nitrogen levels decreased plant height, but probably because the controll group already had sufficient levels of nitrogen. The way the plants in different groups produced varying root to shoot ratios demonstrates resource allocation at work, while the plants try to maximize their fitness. In Bazzaz’ book it is explained how it has been shown that when the nitrogen supply is sufficient the relative growth rate is directly proportional to the photosynthetic rate, but when the nitrogen supply is limited, photosynthesis has no effect on growth. It was also stated that nitrogen nutrition is closely related with carbon gain and allocation. [Bazzaz: 1997]. Some possible sources of error in this experiment are that a larger sample size could have been used, with more plants, and also more than just two levels of nitrogen could have been tested. For future studies, one could look at multiple levels of nitrogen in more than just one plant, while also comparing the results to different soil nutrients. Through this design it was concluded that when using soil and Miracle Gro that already has essential nutrients needed for a plant, adding extra amounts of nitrogen can be harmful to plant growth and later lead to other environmental issues. Environmental impacts are difficult to measure, but there are many more studies to be done on the negative effects of the nitrogen cycle for instance studying the effect of nitrogen oxides, which are a critical component of photochemical smog, on the growth of plants.
