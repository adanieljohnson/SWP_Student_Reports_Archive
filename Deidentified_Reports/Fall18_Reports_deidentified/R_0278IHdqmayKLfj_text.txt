Title: Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone is a naturally occurring hormone in insects that helps regulate growth and molting. This hormone can also be used to kill off insects thus removing unwanted pests that can be harmful to plant life. This experiment is a study of the effects of increased levels of JH on Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that the caterpillars given JH in their diets would not be able to move onto their next phase of development (pupation). The data showed no significant difference between control and treatment weights and lengths. However, while they did grow larger, the treatment caterpillars did not pupate while the control group did. This suggests that if JH levels in Manduca sexta are higher than normal during development, the caterpillars will not be able to pupate and metamorphosize into full grown adults.

Introduction:
This experiment was conducted to study the effects of juvenile hormone on the development of Manduca sexta. Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone (20E) are two of the main hormones in insects [Johnson: 2018]. They are responsible for regulating the type of molts and timing of molts in insects. The type of molt is based on the ratios of JH and 20E in the Manduca sexta larvae [Johnson: 2018]. Juvenile hormone has also been known to prevent metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980]. Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) are a form of pest control that utilizes this property of juvenile hormones to prevent the larvae of insects from developing into adults [Tunaz: 2004]. One of the first observations of IGRs was when paper towels containing juvabione caused a group of lab raised insects to fail to mature into adults [Tunaz: 2004].  In this experiment, the treatment group of Manduca sexta caterpillars receive doses of Precor Methoprene, which acts as a form of juvenile hormone. Based on the information, we predict that an increase in levels of juvenile hormone in the Manduca sexta caterpillars will prevent them from entering the next phase of development.

Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars ranging from .35 to .72 grams, and 28 to 35 millimeters, were placed into two groups of 4 (control and treatment). Each caterpillar was placed in an individual plastic cell after being weighed and measured. 80 grams of food were measured out and then divided into 8 groups of 10 grams. The 4 control caterpillars were each given 10 grams of food with 5 drops of water added. The 4 treatment caterpillars were each given 10 grams of food with 5 drops of Precor Methoprene added. The caterpillars were weighed and measured every day over the course of two weeks with the exception of three days where they could not be measured due to hurricane Florence. The food was replenished as needed and 5 drops of water and 5 drops of Methoprene were added to the new batches of food. A two tailed t-test was used for statistical analysis.

Results:
The control group had a standard deviation in weight of 2.657g (fig. 1). The treatment group had a standard deviation in weight of 3.954g (fig. 1). The control group had a standard deviation in length of 13.394mm (fig. 2) while the treatment group had a standard deviation in length of 16.983mm (fig. 2). Using a two-tailed T-test we found that there was not a significant difference between the control and treatment weight (t-stat = .66, df = 22, P = .513). The mean length of the control group was also not significantly different than the mean length of the treatment group (t-stat = .45, df = 22, P = .654). The test accounts for the fact that both the control and treatment groups grew in weight and length, but it does not account for the fact the all of the control group caterpillars pupated while the treatment caterpillars did not.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that increased levels of juvenile hormones would affect the development of Manduca sexta, was not supported by the statistical data. However, the data is not completely relevant to the hypothesis because we proposed that the caterpillars would not move on to the next stage of development, which they did not. The data focuses on whether the caterpillars grew in length and weight, which they did. Therefore, we could not reject the null hypothesis. The caterpillars in the control group grew significantly and then lost weight and length a few days before pupating. The treatment caterpillars did not experience the same levels of weight and length loss and did not pupate. This suggests that increased levels of JH prevent Manduca sexta caterpillars from becoming full adults. In order to pupate the caterpillars have to have a significant drop in JH and an increase in 20E, which allows for a “commitment pulse” [Johnson 2018]. The experiment suggests that due to the added JH, the caterpillars were unable to go through the commitment pulse.
