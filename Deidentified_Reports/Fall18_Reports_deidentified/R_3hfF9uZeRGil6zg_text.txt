Title: The Effects of Injecting Calcium on Frog Leg Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is unique to animals. Action potentials generated in neurons which spread to muscle cells allow muscles to contract and relax in response to stimuli. This study used frog legs as models of neuromuscular system function. In the muscle, calcium is released to stimulate muscle. We monitored muscular response in frog legs when shocked with voltage. Frog legs which were injected with calcium were expected to have a greater force of muscle contraction than those which were not injected with calcium as a result of an increase in available calcium in the muscle. There was statistically significant evidence to suggest a difference between muscle contraction in control and calcium injected frog legs, but the frog legs which were injected actually had a lower force of muscle contraction. These findings suggest that injecting calcium oversaturates frog legs, inhibiting strong muscle contraction.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to interact with their environment. While hormone-based systems take seconds for an organism to process, the neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to stimuli in a matter of milliseconds [Johnson: 2018]. The neuromuscular system is made up of skeletal muscles which are innervated by motor neurons. The binding of neurotransmitter acetylcholine to a receptor on the membrane of a muscle fiber generates an action potential which spreads through a muscle fiber. Due to the action potential, calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and stimulate muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium’s importance in muscle contraction is not a new concept. As early as 1958, a study by Ethel Cosmos examined calcium’s role in frog muscle. Cosmos used similar methods to investigate frog legs, including electrical currents through the muscle and injecting calcium. Cosmos stimulated frog muscles at a frequency of one shock per second, injected calcium, and determined the effects of the rate of exchange of calcium-40 with calcium-45 isotopes [Cosmos:1958]. Studies like this one and Cosmos’ are important in understanding neuromuscular function. Frog legs serve as model organisms for neuromuscular function because they are readily available for use in labs and small enough to be shocked by a probe. The same basic principles investigated in frog legs such as sodium channels, calcium, and action potentials are crucial to our understanding of human muscle function. The objective of the experiment described here was to discover the effect of injecting calcium to the exposed gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg.  We hypothesize that if injected with calcium, frog legs will have an increased force of contraction than those frog legs without injected calcium.  

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were assembled and placed in a dissecting pan. Forceps were used to remove the skin from each frog leg, exposing muscle. Frog legs were regularly moistened with Ringer’s solution for the duration of the lab. Labscribe software was used to apply voltage to the frog leg. The probe was inserted into the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle of the frog leg. Each frog leg was used twice, once for control measurements and once for experimental. For the control portion of the experiment, no calcium was injected into the frog legs. We applied voltage to the muscle ten times and recorded the response from the legs. The voltage increased each time using amplitude intervals of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.  After recording response from the legs, the experimental portion of the experiment began. Each frog leg was injected with 0.1 mL calcium, and voltage was applied in the same intervals listed above. Responses were recorded for each of the three frog legs. Observations were maintained in lab notebooks. A one-tailed t-test was used to determine any statistically significant difference in force of muscle contraction as a result of gastrocnemius muscle being injected with calcium. 

Results:
The average difference between force of muscle contraction in frog legs without added calcium and frog legs with injected calcium was -0.099 hertz (Fig. 1). A one-tailed p-value of 0.001 was obtained. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that injecting frog legs with calcium would result in muscle contraction of greater force, was not supported. While there was statistically significant evidence to suggest a difference in frog legs with and without injected calcium, the direction contrasted with our hypothesis. There was a connection between injecting frog legs with calcium and a lower force of muscle contraction than the control frog legs (Fig.1). R.L. Moss explored calcium’s effect on muscle contraction in 1978. He points out that changes in the amount of calcium released form the sarcoplasmic reticulum may not have a large effect on the amount of calcium bound to regulatory proteins [Moss: 1978].  While an influx of calcium will change the free calcium ion concentration available in the leg, it will not change the number of receptors to which it can bind. This may help explain why more calcium did not result in an increase in muscle contraction force. The calcium may have in fact inhibited muscle contraction by increasing available calcium ions to a level above maximum efficiency. Further research on the effects of added calcium to the muscles could be useful in studying muscle function. With further research, perhaps a link between muscle exhaustion and calcium can be made.
