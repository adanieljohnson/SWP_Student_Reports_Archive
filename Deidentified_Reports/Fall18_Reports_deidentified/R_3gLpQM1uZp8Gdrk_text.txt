Title: Nerve and Muscle Activity When Treated With Tubocurarine

Abstract:
The purpose of our investigations will isolate the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg, and demonstrate some basic properties of neuromuscular controll. In our experiment, we  injected the  Frog Leg with Tubocurarine (a chemical that functions like nicotine which stops acetylcholine from binding). To test these affects we injected out frog leg with Tubocurarine to test what would happen to the twitches and varying thresholds when acetylcholine is not present. We found that our Relaxation Phase (in milliseconds) was much longer than the legs that were only injected with Frog Ringer's. We hypothesize if frog legs are treated with acetylcholinesterase then we will observe longer period of time during the relaxation phase recorded in myograms.

Introduction:
Place the leg in a dissecting pan. Using your finger, grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull the skin down toward the foot. Gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. The white sciatic nerve and accompanying blood vessels should we visible. Gently free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue, using a dissecting needle and forceps. The less the nerve is traumatized or comes into contact with metal, the better it will perform. Keep the exposed tissue moist. Determine the threshold voltage for direct muscle stimulation by increasing the stimulus voltage in .1V increments. Once the threshold voltage has been determined, test the muscle’s response to direct stimulation at additional stimulus voltages. Increase the stimulus amplitude in 1.0V increments, up to 5V. Record the muscle response and mark the recording as described previously. Repeat these steps with single stimulus pulses of increasing amplitude. When inserting the probes into the frog leg make sure the black side is on the BOTTOM. Inject Frog Ringer’s into the muscle, wait 5 minutes, change stimuli frequency (varying from 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 Hz). Use several injection sites to decrease the total deformation of the muscle. After the muscle’s response to nerve stimulation has disappeared, disconnect the BNC connector of the sleeve electrodes from the stimulator. Connect BNC connector of the pin electrodes to the stimulator. Stimulate the muscle directly for 2 seconds and observe the contractions. If there is no response, repeatedly increase the stimulus amplitude and stimulate the muscle until it shows an observable contraction. When a visible muscle contraction is seen, quickly disconnect the pin electrodes from the stimulator and reconnect the sleeve electrodes. Immediately stimulate the muscle through the nerve with pulses that have the same parameters as the ones just used for direct muscle stimulation. Label the recording to identify the mode of stimulation and the stimulus parameters used for each response. Next inject Tubocurarine into the frog muscle and vary Hz applied and record findings.

Results:
The general trend in our data is that the systolic BP increased significently after the exam. Here the paired T-Test shows that the standard deviation is 2.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported because we observed longer period of the relaxation phase after the frog leg has been injected with tubocurarine. These results were consistent for all 3 frog legs. This is mainly due to the fact that turbocarine stops the binding of ACh since it is an antagonist. In a different study by Dr. Dreyer, he concluded, “The action of tubocurarine on voltage‐clamped frog muscle end‐plates has been re‐examined by means (a) equilibrium dose‐ratio measurements, (b) current fluctuation measurements and (c) voltage‐jump relaxation measurements”. His findings are similar to our finding because he also concluded that he  The other is much slower (1‐‐3 sec), and, in relaxation experiments it is in the opposite direction to the fast relaxation, were fast relaxation was untreated with tubocurarine” (Colquhoun)
