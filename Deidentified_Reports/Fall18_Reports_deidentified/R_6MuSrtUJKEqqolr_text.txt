Title: Nitrogen Allocation in Mung Beans 

Abstract:
Plants allocate available resources in order to prioritize the growth of their roots and shoots. One of these resources is Nitrogen. I will be looking at the effects of nitrogen on the growth patterns of the roots and shoots of Vigna radiata. To conduct this experiment, four pots of 15 seeds were watered with water as a control; and four pots of 15 seeds were treated with nitrogen enriched water. After two weeks the plants were harvested and the root:shoot ratios were recorded. I expected the plants treated with nitrogen would have a smaller root:shoot ratio than plants treated with just water. .In actuality, the data showed no significant difference between the root:shoot ratios for weight or length. This suggests that the growth patterns of Vigna radiata do not respond to higher levels of nitrogen in the soil. 

Introduction:
Plants face fierce competition when journeying to adulthood. This competition fosters a scarcity for resources in many ecosystems, so plants must allocate their resources carefully in order to survive. In the process of allocating the available resources, plants have to react to an assortment of biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors include agents such as producers, decomposers, and competition with other organisms. Abiotic factors include agents such as soil nutrients, water, and sunlight. Both biotic and abiotic factors are included in an important occurrence for plant growth known as the nitrogen cycle [Johnson AD, 2016]. Nitrogen is a vital part in the development of species diversity and the functionality of ecosystems [Vitousek et. all, 1997]. This experiment evaluates the effect of nitrogen enriched soil on the root to shoot ratio of mung beans. Mung beans are important due to their varied agricultural uses. Mung beans are commonly used as both feed for livestock as well as feed for crops or green manure [Rosales, 1998]. We will be comparing mung beans treated with nitrogen to a control group that received strictly water. I hypothesized that the mung beans that received the nitrogen treatment will have a lower root to shoot ratio than the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
Cultivation of mung beans. 15 mung beans were planted in 8 pots of vermiculite. All 8 pots were pre-watered and treated with miracle grow. 4 pots were designated to be treated with nitrogen and 4 were designed as a strictly water control group. The pots were then placed in the same spot in a greenhouse. The plants were watered every day for two weeks, during this time the nitrogen group received it’s nitrogen treatment. After two weeks, the mung beans were harvested, separated from the vermiculite with water, and dried. The plants were then weighed and measured, these values were recorded. The roots were then separated from the shoots and their lengths and weights were recorded individually. Maximum root and shoot lengths were recorded. Mean values for root/shoot length and weight were recorded. A one tailed two sample t-test was then performed to compare the root:shoot ratios, lengths and weights of the plants grown in nitrogen enriched soil and the control group. 

Results:
The plants in the nitrogen enriched soil had a higher mean length root:shoot ratio (1.389 +/- 0.117 ) than the strictly water control group (1.134 +/-  0.405). This is not the same for the mean weight root:shoot ratio. The control group had a higher mean weight (.841 +/- 0.174) compared to the nitrogen group (.794 +/- 0.242). A two sample t-test yields p-values of p = 0.07 for length (Figure 2) and p = .35 for weight (Figure 4).  Based off of the high p-values (above 0.05) we can determine that there is no significant difference between the root:shoot weight and length ratios between the control group and the group treated with nitrogen. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis that the nitrogen treated group would have a lower root:shoot ratio was not supported. While my hypothesis was not supported, the alternate hypothesis was not necessarily supported either due to the fact that neither group had higher values for both length and weight R:S ratio. This suggests that the growth pattern of mung bean roots and shoots is not affected by an increased level of nitrogen. It is possible that the levels of nitrogen the experimental group was treated with was not drastic enough to cause a change in growth. However past experiments have shown that nitrogen rich soil is cause for higher root allocation[Lloret et. All, 1996]. This makes sense in context due to the fact that the group treated with nitrogen had a higher R:S ratio for length, although the difference was not statistically significant. To further this study, an experiment could be conducted that compared the difference between two groups treated with different levels of nitrogen instead of nitrogen and a control. In conclusion, the experiment did not yield statistically significant data to support the hypothesis that mung beans treated with nitrogen would have a lower root:shoot ratio than a control group treated with water.
