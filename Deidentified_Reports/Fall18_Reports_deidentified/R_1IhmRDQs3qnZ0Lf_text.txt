Title:   The effects of Calcium Channel Blocker, Lanthanum Chloride on the contractile threshold of the Rania pipiens frog  

Abstract:
The muscular contractions produced by a frog are initiated by motor neurons and chemicals working together at the neuromuscular junction. The Rania pipiens frog is easily able to be manipulated in order to measure the contraction threshold using a probe inserted in the gastrocnemus muscle. In this experiment, we will be comparing the difference in contractile thresholds in 3 different frog legs, comparing their initial contraction and then recording their contractile threshold after they are injected with 0.2Ml of lanthanum Chloride. We hypothesize that the calcium channel blocker will cause an increase in the contractile threshold because the lack of Calcium present will cause the inhibition of Acetylcholine to be released into the neuromuscular junction, which is vital for muscle contraction to occur. Our hypothesis was not supported because even though there was an increase in the threshold of the experimental group of 0.053V, there was not enough evidence to support our claim from the three tests that we completed. After running a paired t_test​, we received a p_value of 0.762, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. Although the average difference was small, we cannot conclude that the addition of lanthanum Chloride, increase the overall contractile threshold.


Introduction:
The Northern Leopard frog is part of the Rania pipines species. These frogs have easily dissectible legs, muscles, and nerves that we will be manipulated in this experiment. The neuromuscular system of the frog consists of all the muscles in your body as well as the nerves that controll them. The skeletal muscles are striated and innervated by motor neurons, which enable and inhibit contractions. The motor neurons are nerve cells which transport information from the brain and spinal cord to the muscles. Motor neurons work together with neuromuscular junctions, which are chemical synapses that are formed by the connection between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. Acetylcholine is released at the neuromuscular junction is a result of the firing of an action potential and if the threshold is reached. Then, this Acetylcholine binds with sodium receptors and opens sodium channels in order to generate an action potential. This action potential causes calcium ions to be released from the intracellular calcium bank the sarcoplasmic reticulum, contracting and shortening the muscle fiber. In this lab, we will be testing the effects that the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride, has on the overall threshold of the muscle contraction. This is important because we will be able to see the immense role that calcium plays in muscle contraction. Calcium is critical in the human body, as imbalances are associated with a large variety of neurological disorders. [Friedman: 1998]. A Calcium channel blocker that was injected in snapdragon plants, resulted in an inhibition in the stem curvature of the plant, preventing several gravity dependent processes. [Friedman: 1998] . Calcium works as a key messenger in a variety of organisms, acting intracellularly as a second messenger and extracellularly as a first messenger that is associated with neurotransmitter release [Brown: 2000]. The effects of the calcium-specific receptors is altered when a blocker is initiated, and there is also an impact on the sodium channels opening and closing, which alters the action potential as a whole. This system of calcium receptors was found in a study to enable organisms to adapt successfully to wide variations in dietary calcium intake while maintaining a consistent level of calcium within the body. [Brown: 2000]. In this lab, we will have three different frog legs, testing their initial threshold using a probe inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle. We will then inject the calcium channel blocker into the same three frog legs, measuring the new threshold level. The fact that there will be no Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic cell able to bind with the postsynaptic receptors and open calcium channels with the cell, this will result in no muscle contractions. We hypothesize that the calcium channel blocker will increase the threshold and cause the muscle to work harder to generate a contraction.


Materials and Method:
In order to complete this experiment, we obtained 3 frog legs of the Rania pipiens species. We then carefully peeled the skin off of the leg until all of the muscles and veins were exposed so that we could separate the gastrocnemus muscle from the rest of the leg. We also made sure to carefully free the sciatic nerve from the muscle body. Using a dissecting tray, we pinned down the muscles of the frog and tied a surgeon’s knot around the top of the gastrocnemus muscle so that it could be attached and hanging from a hook above the tray.  It is important to make sure that the string is not too tight or too loose because it can interfere with the reading of the muscle contraction. Next, we inserted a transducer into the gastrocnemus muscle and record the threshold for each of the three frog legs. We will then inject 0.2 Ml of lanthanum chloride into the belly of the gastrocnemus muscle, insert the probe back into the muscle and then record the new threshold values for each other the three frog legs. It is also important to wait 10 min between the time when you inject the calcium channel blocker and when you record the threshold. This gives the Calcium channel blocker time to move and absorb into the striated muscle. In the end, we collected two data points from each frog leg, the initial threshold, and the new threshold with the calcium channel blocker in effect. We will be using a paired t_test in order to determine if our threshold values between our experimental and controll group are statistically significent.


Results:
We observed that the frog leg one had an experimental threshold lower than the controll threshold, but frog legs 2 and 3 had an experimental threshold higher than that of the controll threshold [Figure 1]. We also observed that small details, such as the tension of the string holding up the gastrocnemus muscle can greatly impact our overall results.  For example, if the tension of the string is too tight, then it will be harder for it to vibrate back and forth as a result of a muscular contraction. If the string is too loose, then, the muscular contraction will not move the string enough for us to observe. The controll threshold for frog leg 1 was 0.45V and the experimental threshold was 0.022V. The controll threshold for frog leg 2 was 0.2V and the experimental threshold was 0.4V. And finally, for frog leg 3, the controll threshold was 0.3V and the experimental threshold was 0.39V. The difference between the experiential and the controll thresholds was 0.053V. After computing our paired t_test, our p_value was 0.762, our t value was 0.346, and our degrees of freedom was 2. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of our hypothesis our experiment was not supported. Our hypothesis was that adding the calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride to the gastrocnemus muscle of a frog, the overall threshold will increase. The addition of the calcium blockers did increase the threshold of the frog legs 2 and 3, but not for frog leg 1.  We also fail to reject the null hypothesis because our p_value was extremely high, meaning that our experiments could have been a result of chance and that we had weak evidence against our hypothesis. This weak evidence because of the inconsistent data in frog leg one could be due to the tension of the string on the muscle. Also, the chemical makeup of lanthanum chloride does not always function the way that it should. In a similar study of the effects of lanthanum chloride had on the calcium receptor pathways in the neuromuscular junction of crayfish [Friedman: 1998]. Their results concluded that the calcium channel blocker did not function properly failed to inhibit Non-Selective Cation Channels, which are activated to compensate for neurotransmitter release as a response to a change in calcium levels. The failure to inhibit these cation channels means that there was not a sufficient change in the flow of Calcium ions within the neuromuscular junction. One of the reasons they believed this happened was because the lanthanum chloride might work differently in plants than vertebrate animals [Friedman: 1998]. What should have happened is in frog leg 1 the calcium blockers would have inhibited the release of calcium so that Acetylcholine would not be able to be released into the neuromuscular junction. This fault in acetylcholine would cause the muscle to inhibit contraction, therefore making the muscle work much harder and raise the intensity of the threshold in comparison to the controll group.  If I were to complete this experiment again I think it would be interesting to use a different, more commonly used calcium channel blocker such as aMlodipine, a commonly used drug that is used to dilate the blood vessels, allowing for an increased blood flow in patients with coronary artery diseases and chest pain.  It would be interesting to see the effects that these commonly used calcium channel inhibitors would have on the threshold of the frog legs, or even on frog cardiac muscles. We would be able to receive information on how the different calcium channel blockers affect the threshold of heart contractions.
