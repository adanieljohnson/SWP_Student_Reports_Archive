Title: The Effects of Dibutryl-cAMP and Curcumin on the cAMP pathway in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Organisms are dependent on signaling pathways that help control cell function. This experiment focused on the cAMP pathway that is found in Physarum polycephalum and is associated with migration. Protein Kinase A is essential to the signaling process, and either inhibiting or activating Protein Kinase A causes a change in migration towards food source (glucose). We used water agar plates that contained blocks of physarum and glucose and soaked them in dibutryl-cAMP, which is known to activate Protein Kinase A, as well as curcumin, which is known to inhibit Protein Kinase A. We measured their migration rates towards glucose, and found that the control physarum migrated approximately 0.03cm/hr towards the glucose, the physarum exposed to dibutryl-cAMP moved approximately 0.008cm/hour towards the glucose, and physarum exposed to curcumin moved away from the glucose at approximately 0.008cm/hour. Our data was statistically insignificant, likely because we picked physarum from multiple sources, and it is possible some of the physarum was not active.  
 


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a common slime mold characterized by its bright yellow color. It primarily feeds on fungal spores, bacteria, and other microbes and moves about its environment by using actin microfilaments. It is a single celled organism that moves its contents and cytoplasm back and forth throughout the cell, constantly switching the direction of flow. Physarum is unique in that it doesn’t rely on hormones or a nervous system to respond to its environment, but rather is constantly responding by using intracellular signal transduction pathways which control metabolic processes [Johnson, 2016]. For our purposes, we will be looking at the cAMP mediated path that occurs in physarum. The G-protein coupled receptor activates adenylate cyclase, which then converts ATP into cAMP which activates protein kinase A [Johnson, 2016]. We are investigating the effects of Protein Kinase A on the migration towards a food source. In order to do so, we will be looking at chemotaxis, and use dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin on a water agar plate. Dibutryl-cAMP is known to activate protein kinase A, and curcumin is known to inhibit protein kinase A. We hypothesize that when glucose is provided as incentive for migration, dibutryl-cAMP will stimulate migration towards glucose, and curcumin will inhibit migration towards glucose. The slime mold moves using an acto-myosin cytoskeletal system similar to systems used by animals, and is a widely relevant model for motility. [Alim et al., 2013]. If we are able to target and either inhibit or accelerate the protein kinase a processes in physarum, it can have indications for processes that exist in animals that are related to motility.


Materials and Methods:
Note: Tools need to be sterilized in between touching different materials. We sterilized our tools by dipping them into alcohol and burning the alcohol off with a lighter, being sure that the tools were cooled before being exposed to the next item.
 
Experiment 1: Control
First, we collected three water agar plates. Then, we labeled each of them by drawing a line dividing the plate in half, followed by two one centimeter by one centimeter squares one centimeter apart in the middle of the plate. We then drew another square that is three centimeters away from the line, equally spaced between the two other squares on the line. These were then label “control.” Using a sterilized spatula, we cut out the square on the left and the square that is three centimeters away from the line. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of physarum and placed it in the empty left block. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of glucose (25mM) and placed that in the square that was three centimeters away from the center line. Afterwards, we taped the lids shut, and covered the plates entirely with aluminum foil. They were then placed in an incubator for 24 hours.
 
Experiment 2: Dibutryl-cAMP
First we collected three water agar plates. Then, we labeled each of them by drawing a line dividing the plate in half, followed by two one centimeter by one centimeter squares one centimeter apart in the middle of the plate. We then drew another square that is three centimeters away from the line, equally spaced between the two other squares on the line. These were then label “dibutryl-cAMP.” Afterwards, we soaked each plate with 10mL of dibutryl-cAMP (10mM) for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, we removed excess liquid and used a sterilized spatula to cut out the square on the left and the square that is three centimeters away from the line. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of physarum and placed it in the empty left block. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of glucose (25mM) and placed that in the square that was three centimeters away from the center line. Afterwards, we taped the lids shut, and covered the plates entirely with aluminum foil. They were then placed in an incubator for 24 hours.
 
Experiment 3: Circumin
First we collected three water agar plates. Then, we labeled each of them by drawing a line dividing the plate in half, followed by two one centimeter by one centimeter squares one centimeter apart in the middle of the plate. We then drew another square that is three centimeters away from the line, equally spaced between the two other squares on the line. These were then label “circumin.” Afterwards, we soaked each plate with 10mL of curcumin (10mM) for 10 minutes. After ten minutes, we removed excess liquid and used a sterilized spatula to cut out the square on the left and the square that is three centimeters away from the line. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of physarum and placed it in the empty left block. We re-sterilized our spatula and cut out a block of glucose (25mM) and placed that in the square that was three centimeters away from the center line. Afterwards, we taped the lids shut, and covered the plates entirely with aluminum foil. They were then placed in an incubator for 24 hours.
 
We will use a two tailed t-test to test for statistical significance.



Results:
Figure 1 illustrates the effects of curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP on physarum migration towards a food source (glucose). Figure 2 is a fabricated depiction of what data we were expecting to see.  The data that we collected proved to be statistically insignificant in all cases (p&gt;0.05). We were hoping to see the physarum in our control plates migrate towards the glucose. For the plates soaked in dibutryl-cAMP, we were hoping to see even more rapid growth than the control, and for the plates soaked in curcumin, we were hoping to see stunted migration toward the glucose. Our data indicated that the average rate of migration for the control was 0.03cm/hour towards the glucose. The average rate of migration for the physarum exposed to dibutry-cAMP was 0.008cm/hour towards the glucose and 0.008cm/hour away from the glucose for curcumin.


Discussion:
Our physarum results proved to be inconclusive because there was very little physarum growth on the water agar plates. We had hoped that the dibutryl cAMP would accelerate migration towards glucose and that curcumin would inhibit migration towards glucose, but our data proved to be statistically insignificant. When gathering physarum samples for our plates, we used multiple different physarum plates, which would explain why some of our physarum grew and others did not. It is possible that some of the physarum may have descended into the sclerotium stage, and therefore would have ceased growth. Physarum usually descends into sclerotium (also known as hibernation), when there is a lack of food or humidity drops [Jump, 1954]. Although physarum was kept in an incubator before being used, humidity was not being controlled and may have caused the physarum to descend into sclerotium. When light is added, which in this case the plates were left uncovered in the incubator, physarum will begin its reproductive cycle, which would prevent it from migrating towards its food source. If our experiment had gone according to plan, the physarum exposed to dibutryl cAMP would have had more growth than the control, and the physarum exposed to curcumin would have had less growth than the control.  Understanding the effects of protein kinase A on migration is applicable to human fungal pathogens. For example Cryptococcus neoformans is a human fungal pathogen, and knowing what chemicals inhibit movement suggest whether or not protein kinase A is activated or inhibited, which suggests what things allow and/or prevents slimes or fungi from migration [Xue et. Al, 2006] .

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure illustrates the effects of dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin on the physarum migration rate. The controlled physarum moved on average 0.03cm/hour towards the glucose, while the physarum exposed to dibutryl-cAMP moved on average 0.008cm/hour towards the glucose. The physarum exposed to curcumin moved on average 0.008cm/hour away from the glucose.

Figure 2. Figure 2 shows fabricated data. This is what we hypothesized would happen when physarum was exposed to dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin when migrating towards glucose. We hypothesized that the physarum introduced to dibutryl-cAMP would have moved more rapidly towards the glucose than the control, and that the physarum introduced to curcumin would have moved at a slower rate towards the glucose than the control.
