Title: The Effects of Blocking Ecdysone on Growth Rate of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on the effects of inhibiting ecdysone on the growth of the manduca sexta caterpillar. The chemical azadirachtin was fed to the caterpillars in order to block the release of ecdysone. The hypothesis was that inhibiting the ecdysone of the juvenile caterpillar with azadirachtin (brand name azagaurd) will decrease the weight of the manduca sexta caterpillar, and the caterpillar will not reach the pupating stage of development. The caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food per 4 drops of azadirachtin and their weights and appearance were recorded over a 14-day period. The two-tailed p_value resulted in 0.137. Therefore, the results were not significent and the hypothesis was not supported. This information provides important insight into cost effective pest controll.

Introduction:
Insects rely on hormones to regulate their growth and life cycle stages. These hormones are referred to as IGRs or insect growth regulators. Many insects including caterpillars undergo a major change in body shape, driven by the changing hormones within its system. The two main growth hormones are ecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysone is responsible for regulating timing of molting during insect development. Whereas Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molting during development. In other words, the JH determines whether or not molting will occur or if the insect will remain as a juvenile [Staal: 1975]. If either of these hormones are tampered with, the life cycle of the insect will be affected. This experiment will focus on how blocking ecdysone of a juvenile manduca sexta caterpillar affects the growth rate. The results and experimental outcome will be based on observations and weight change. The manduca sexta is a model organism for other insects, who’s growth hormones can be easily manipulated by adding chemicals to the food source. Azadirachtin is a chemical that when given to the insect (caterpillar), the ecdysone is blocked in their system, therefore affecting the typical growth rate of the caterpillar [Robbins: 1970]. These changes in weight and growth stages can be easily measured and observed. We hypothesize that inhibiting the ecdysone of the juvenile caterpillar with azadirachtin (brand name azagaurd) will decrease the weight of the manduca sexta caterpillar, and the caterpillar will not reach the pupating stage of development.

Materials and Method:
Eight manduca sexta caterpillars of similar weight, about 2.75 g to 3.75 g, were selected and divided into controll and experimental groups (4 caterpillars in each group). Each caterpillar was placed in its own container with air holes and properly labeled. Each was fed one of two diets. The controll was fed ten grams of food with four drops of di water thoroughly mixed in. The experimental was fed ten grams of food with four drops of azadirachtin (azagaurd) thoroughly mixed in. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 28C in a twelve-hour dark, twelve-hour light cycle to mimic the environment. The caterpillar’s food was replaced on days 5 and 8 when they appeared to have eaten most of it. Each day the caterpillars were weighed. The weight along with observations of how they appeared were recorded. In order to assess the results of the experiment, a two-tailed t_test was used. 

Results:
The results showed that the controll caterpillars grew more than the experimental caterpillars. The average difference in the growth of the controll from the beginning to the end of the experiment was 1.928 g. Whereas the average difference in growth of the experimental caterpillars was 1.005 g. The standard deviation for the controll was 0.3008 and 1.033 for the experimental as shown in figure 1. Similarly, in the observations, the controll caterpillars appeared to progress throughout the life cycle stages faster and more regularly than the experimental caterpillars. Around day 5 the commitment pulse appeared in the controll caterpillars. However, the commitment pulse appeared in the experimental caterpillars around day 8. Finally, the controll caterpillars reached pupation around day 10, and the experimental caterpillars reached pupation around day 14. Experimental caterpillar 3 appeared dead on day 14. The two-tailed p_value is 0.137, degrees of freedom is 6, and the t-value is 1.714. Based on the p_value of the experiment, the results are not statically significent. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that inhibiting the ecdysone of the manduca sexta juvenile caterpillar would decrease the weight and prevent pupation of the caterpillar, was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the amount of azadiractin used in this experiment did not inhibit enough ecdysone to change the path of development of the caterpillar. These results are likely due to the amount of azadiractin that was being given to the caterpillars. We only used 4 drops of the chemical with the food, and the chemical was also diluted to a great degree, further reducing the amount of ecdysone blocking chemical that the caterpillars were receiving. Additionally, past studies have suggested that blocking ecdysone is successful in preventing pupation of insects, however a greater amount needed to be used to be effective [Robbins: 1970]. Understanding the growth hormones of insects is an important component of pest controll. In order to eliminate the pest, experimentation on the hormones can provide important insight into the most cost-effective method to eliminating the problem.
