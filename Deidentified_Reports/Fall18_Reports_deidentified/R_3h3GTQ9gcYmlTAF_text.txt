Title: How the interaction of Betta splendens of similar sizes and the interaction of Betta splendens with varying sizes effect their displayed aggression

Abstract:
Aggression displays by animals tend to either be used for protection, claiming of one’s territory, or for mating purposes. In the action to show dominance over an individual’s competition, a higher level of aggression will be displayed as required. There are numerous reasons as to why an individual may show increased agonistic levels towards one individual of their species compared to another. This experiment stems from whether size plays an active role in the levels of aggression displayed between male Betta splendens. Based on the energy cost of agonistic behaviors towards a smaller individual compared to interactions of similar sizes, it was predicted that similarly sized individuals require the highest aggressive displays for intimidation. Interactions were categorized by aggression levels. As for the interactions, all similar sizes were permitted to interact while separated by a glass sheet. The same applied to contrast sizes, such as small and large, small and medium Betta splendens interactions, not of individuals of similar size. Due to this, it would be valuable to continue this experiment using more precise groups. For example, Betta splendens of the same color to decipher if the increase aggression levels were affected by the varied colors and not just size.

Introduction:
There are many different factors that could attribute to varying displayed aggression levels. In a natural environment, organisms tend to vary in sizes. In species that live in group settings, the most constant recorded leaders gravitate towards the larger individuals in the group. Under most circumstances, that alpha is the male. Under the concern of how size variation effects the displayed aggression levels, Betta splendens were chosen as the species of concentration. Male Betta splendens, also referred to as Siamese fighting fish, were chosen as suitable candidates due to their extreme aggression expressed towards other males [Miley, 1977]. It displays visible signs of aggression such as the following, listed in increasing order, pectoral fin flickering, erecting of the dorsal fin, tail beating, tail flashing, and expansion of branchiostegal membranes; also known as “red mane.” In order to perform these displays or aggression, Betta splendens require excess energy to perform these locomotive actions. This can be detected by the increased oxygen consumption; indicating raised metabolic rates of the individuals [Becker, 2006]. Using the Betta splendens, multiple environments were developed. The purpose of these environments was to actively expose the male individuals to similar or a varying size of another male Betta splendens. The varying environments provide the ability to measure the levels of aggression that are shown between the interactions of two Betta splendens that are of similar size and Betta splendens that have sizable differences. The question of whether the size of the individuals involved in the interaction relate to aggression levels is to decipher if there is a direct correlation to the amount of energy needed to portray these aggressive actions. Through this experiment, it would be possible to determine how the energy cost of aggressive actions correlates with size variation in Betta splendens interactions. To interpret why aggression levels may vary by size interactions, it’s valuable to review the energy requirements for competitions between same and varying size individuals. There is more competition for mating between Betta splendens of similar size than, for example, a large Betta splendens and a smaller one. The larger individual would be able to portray lower levels of aggression to intimidate the other, smaller individual compared to Betta splendens of similar size; therefore, using less energy. Due to the energy cost of these actions, it was hypothesized that aggression levels displayed between Betta splendens of similar sizes would be the highest compared to interactions between Betta splendens of varying sizes. 

Materials and Methods:
Initially, six different Betta splendens were obtained of three size categories. Two small, two medium, and two large Betta splendens. Each were separated in three aquariums by category; as well as being separated while in the aquarium. In order to measure the levels of aggression for data recording, each level was assigned a ranking from 0-6. The numbers stood for the following: 0 being no response, 1 being pelvic tail flickering, 2 being dorsal fin erecting, 3 being tail beating, 4 being tail flashing, 5 being the displaying of the red mane, and 6 being the attacking of the other individual. Although, each pair were separated by a glass sheet for the entirety of the exposure to avoid possible maiming. The exposure time was a length of five minutes, with a five minute rest period after, where the fish would be secluded from each other. This is necessary to allow relaxation and to prevent habituation from exposure. The level of aggression was recorded every thirty seconds during the five minute exposure. The first interaction recorded was the small-small Betta splendens exposure. The following was medium-medium Betta splendens, and lastly the large- large Betta splendens. After the rest period past for each of the fish, the size variance interactions began. The following interactions were arranged between the Betta splendens: Large-medium, large-small, and medium-small. It was important not to use a fish twice in this arrangement though, to prevent altering reactions through habituation or previous exposure to a larger or smaller Betta splendens. After the data was recorded it was applied to an ANOVA test to find whether size played a significant role in aggression levels displayed. 

Results:
The results of the ANOVA test showed that there was a significant relationship between similar size interactions of Betta splendens and varying size interactions. With a significance threshold of .05, the the final results were (P= .000144, sds= 59). 

Discussion:
Although the data was significant, it didn’t support the stated hypothesis that Betta splendens of similar sizes would display the most aggression towards each other. If this were true, the highest recorded aggression levels would be collected from the similar sized interactions opposed to the actual interactions that displayed the highest aggression.  Based on the data, there is a correlation between the groups that displayed higher aggression levels. The top three groups involved large Betta splendens. This could result from the larger, energy storage held in the large fish compared to fish of smaller size [Elser, 1996]. Due to the larger Betta splendens having more energy to dedicate towards aggressive displays, and in turn intimidating their opponent, the overall energy cost is less detrimental to the larger Betta splendens in contrast to smaller individuals. These higher levels of aggression displayed allow for the intimidation of the individuals surrounding the Betta splenden. With the large display of agonistic behavior, the fish saves more energy in the future due to the learned intimidation from past experiences. There are also other possibilities that could have been in play. For instance, the color of the Betta splendens could correlate to the aggression levels displayed. To obtain results with increased accuracy, it would be wise to only utilize individuals of the same color. An additional obstacle was that the Betta splendens used in the medium group weren’t remarkably larger or smaller than their opponents in the other size categories; which could affect the end results. To calculate more accurate results, it would be wise to gather groups of the same color, and then apply the previous experiment; removing other factors.
