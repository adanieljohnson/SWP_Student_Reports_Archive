Title: The impact of water color on the aggression levels of male Betta splendens and their interactions

Abstract:
The bright displays of aggression performed by male betta fish provide a great opportunity to study the intraspecific competition of males in a population. Learning about what affects and alters this type of competition is important to the study of sexual selection and breeding patterns within a species. Here we look at how, if at all, changes to the color of water in which they reside alters the displayed levels of aggression between two sets of B. splenden males. It was projected that the alterations made to the water color of the aquariums would have no significant impact on the agonistic behaviors of the fish. The data we gathered confirmed that water color is statistically insignificant and has no impact on the betta’s behaviors. This conclusion suggests that these intraspecific actions are genetically based and are not influenced by the environment. 


Introduction:
This experiment looks at how differences in water color may or may not affect the agonistic behaviors, or levels of aggression, of male betta fish (B. splendens). Generally, male betta fish are extremely aggressive in the presence of other males of their kind as displayed by many flamboyant movements of their fins and bodies. Male betta fish in the wild are typically dull in color and only display their bright red and blue “fighting colors” when faced with another male opponent. However, through domestication, their baseline appearance is now that of their previous “fighting” appearance [Johnson: 2018]. We hypothesize that, through conducting this experiment, there will be no significant change in the displayed aggressive behaviors of these fish based on the color of water that they are in. We do not anticipate any impact on aggression because the male bettas already consistently display their fighting colors as their regular appearance, so manipulating the water color should not yield any more or less aggression than that of the already-displayed aggressive colors. 


Materials and Methods:
To test this hypothesis, two separate, clean aquariums were divided into 2 individual “tanks” with glass dividers and opaque coverings. One aquarium was filled with clear, treated water and the other was dyed red using 4 drops of organic food coloring. Once the tests were complete for both sets of bettas in one condition, they were switched and tested in the other tank’s condition. These two sets of B. splenden males were allowed to see each other through the glass barrier for 5 minutes and their levels of aggression, 1-5, were recorded. They then got a 5 minute period of rest before they were placed in one large section of the respective tank and their unimpeded interactions were recorded using the same scale. After both conditions were tested for each group, the clear tank was dyed green using 4 drops of organic food coloring and the same process was repeated. The levels of aggression are as follows: (1) No aggression (2) Broadside movement of tail flickering and/or facing movement of erect pectoral fins (3) Broadside movement of tail beating and/or facing movement of spreading gill covers (4) Broadside movement of tail flashing and/or facing movement of displaying red mane (5) Physical fight (including biting, darting, and attacking). An ANOVA test was constructed to analyze the results of the study for each individual fish in all three conditions. 

Results:
The mean levels of aggression for all four B. splendens with glass dividers in every water condition is not statistically significant (F(11)=0.8412, p=0.462). This continued in the results of the bettas in all conditions without a glass divider (F(11)=0.206, p=0.818), which also shows no statistical correlation to their displayed levels of aggression. The large standard deviations of both glass and no glass divider agonistic levels in each water condition shows about an even rank for every interaction between the pairs of bettas, which furthers the statistical insignificance of the data yielded in the ANOVA test.  


Discussion:
The hypothesis presented for this experiment is supported by the data gathered in the research. The data shows no statistically significant difference in the levels of aggression in the bettas based on the color of their tank water. In addition, the presence of a glass divider also yielded statistically insignificant. The trend present in Figure 1 displays that there is no major variation in betta fish reactions in any condition. One error that may have been present during the study is the habituation of the two males in their environments. In their research article on the habituation of displays of aggression in B. splendens, Clayton and Hinde found that from after the first few minutes to around the 24-hour mark of interaction between two male bettas, their aggressive displays rapidly decreased until nearly gone [Clayton & Hinde: 1967]. As stated in this research article, the four bettas present in our study may have gotten familiar with each other or learned when the glass barrier was present and when they could attack their pair without impediment.
