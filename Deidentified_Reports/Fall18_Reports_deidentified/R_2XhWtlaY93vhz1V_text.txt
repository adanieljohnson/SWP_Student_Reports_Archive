Title: Azadirachtin’s Imitation of the Effects of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta Larvae and It's Potential Use as an Insecticide

Abstract:
Hormones disrupting metamorphosis could be a better option for an insecticide on crops because many people are realizing they do not want insecticides on products that they will ingest. Azadirachtin can imitate the effects of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars by inhibiting Ecdysterone, which starts the pupation process. If the pupation process can be inhibited, the caterpillars can be exterminated eventually because they will die if they do not complete this part of their life cycle. Thus, Azadirachtin could potentially be a better alternative to insecticides. Four of our caterpillars were given 10g each of controll food with deionized water and another four of our caterpillars were given 10g each of food with Azadirachtin (commercial brand Azaguard, specifically) for 14 days. We hypothesized if the caterpillars were given azadirachtin, then the pupation process would be inhibited, and they would lose weight. The results were not significent, with a p_value of 0.384867, and did not support our hypothesis since the experimental caterpillars did eventually pupate. The dosage of azadirachtin was too low to disrupt the metamorphosis. Moving forward, more experiments need to be done to see what dosage of azadirachtin is the correct amount. 

Introduction:
Hornworm (Manduca sexta) caterpillars release a hormone called Juvenile Hormone (JH), which keeps them in the larva stage. The caterpillars also release a hormone called Ecdysterone to regulate the timing of molting. These insects are generally pests for anyone working with crops. Insecticides are not necessarily ideal as they put toxins on our crops, so what if there was a better way to eliminate more of these pests? Azadirachtin is a hormone that inhibits Ecdysterone, thus imitating similar effects of JH, which are delaying the pupal stage from beginning. If given the correct amount of azadirachtin, the Manduca sexta could potentially never reach the pupal stage, which would exterminate the animal, since it needs to reach the pupal stage to continue the life cycle. This would get rid of the pest without having to spay insecticides on the crops, which is a more preferable method since spraying the insecticides on crops the public will eventually eat is not ideal. As seen in other studies, giving azadirachtin to last-instar larva shows different results based on the dose administered (Schlüter: 1985). Part of the steps of metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta is the caterpillar's weight will gradually increase as Ecdysterone is released. If the Manduca sexta is given azadirachtin, which will inhibit Ecdysterone, then the weight will decrease.

Materials and Method:
My lab partners and I divided a group of 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups. One
group was the controll and one group was the experimental. The two groups were put into two separate containers that each have four compartments for each caterpillar. We labeled each compartment of the containers controll/experimental 1, 2, 3, or 4 and poked two holes for each caterpillar. We weighed and recorded the weight for each caterpillar before putting them in their containers. Then, my group wrote down initial observations of the caterpillars. We took 80g of food and divided it into two 40g piles. One pile was set aside for the controll and then received 16 drops of deionized water and mixed well. For the other 40g, 16 drops of Azaguard, a commercial form of Azadirachtin, with a ratio of 1: 1250 were added and mixed well. Four caterpillars were given 10g each of the controll food and 4 caterpillars were given 10g each of the food with the Azadirachtin (or Azaguard, specifically). The caterpillars were weighed every day for 14 days before being fed. Then, observations of how much food had been eaten and how the caterpillars appeared were recorded for 14 days as well. A two sample t_test was used to calculate the t-score, p_value, and DF number. 


Results:
The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than the mean experiment group (t_stat= 0.93712, p_value= 0.384867, DF = 6). As seen in Fig. 1, the controll had an average difference of 2.3075 with a standard deviation of 0.2965777 and experimental had an average difference of 1.715 with a standard deviation of 1.229240958.

Observations:
No difference in days 1-3. Day 4, all experimental caterpillars are small, and lethargic, eaten less food than controll, and feces are smaller and much less. All controll caterpillars are very fat, squishy, and barely moving.
Day 5, controll number 1 is very active and skin is translucent and darker not as soft as other controlls. Experimental smaller more lethargic and greener than controll. Day 6, all controll caterpillars are fat and lethargic, seem greener than experimental. experimental are small and lethargic as well, colors are much brighter, 4 is bright blue. Day 7, controll caterpillars are much more lethargic and greener than experimental, feel stiffer than experimental, and seem to have eaten less than experimental. Experimental 1 and 3 are starting to turn greener, but 2 and 4 are still bright blue. All caterpillars seem to have lost weight. Day 8, all experimental have reached commitment pulse, as with all of controll. Experimental 2 is still bright blue, rest are turning yellow. 


Discussion:
The results did not support our hypothesis, since the results were not significent. However, most of the controll caterpillars were still bigger than the experimental. The most likely reason that this happened is not enough azadirachtin was given to make a difference in the metamorphosis. The azadirachtin put in the food was at a ratio of 1: 1250. As seen in another study, low doses still permitted pupation to occur in most of the cases, but caterpillars given higher doses usually did not fully complete development (Schlüter: 1985). However, the same study showed that the resulting pupae of the low doses were defective for the most part (Schlüter: 1985). So, this low of a dosage could perhaps still be beneficial as an insecticide. Moving forward, the experiment should be repeated, but with higher doses of azadirachtin to see what a more effective dose of azadirachtin would be.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The average weight differences, including standard deviations, of both the controll and experimental Manduca sexta caterpillars. Blue bar graph, controll; orange bar graph, experimental. Control has an average weight difference of 2.3075 +/- 0.2965777; Experimetnal has an average weight difference of 1.715 +/- 1.229240958. This graph shows how experimental lost less weight than controll over the eight days, which does not support our hypothesis. *************************************************************************
