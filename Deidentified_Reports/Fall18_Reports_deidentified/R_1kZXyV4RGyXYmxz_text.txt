Title: Effects of the addition of Juvenile Hormone to Manduca sexta Diet 	

Abstract:
The effects of hormones is an important topic in comparative physiology. When trying to understand what makes living things grow and change, it is important to understand how a certain chemical will affect the internal processes of plants and animals. In this experiment, we look at the effect of adding Juvenile Hormone to the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars. The expectation was that feeding Manduca sexta larva juvenile hormone would inhibit the caterpillars from becoming pupae, thus allowing the larvae to grow to a significantly different weight than those in the control group. However, our data and statistical tests showed no significant difference in weight gain or loss between the experimental group of caterpillars and the control group.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a type of caterpillar that turns into a moth after pupation. It has a life cycle that lasts between 37 and 49. This life cycle is holometabolous, meaning that it consists of four stages: egg, larva, pupa, adult. Two major hormones that influence development into an adult. These hormones are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Ecdysterone is a steroid hormone that helps to regulate the timing of molting in insect development and regulates adult function. Juvenile Hormone is an organic molecule that regulates the type of molting of insects and also regulates adult functions. The corpora allata in the brain of the caterpillar ceases to secrete JH when a larva attains a weight of approximately 5 g. The JH takes approximately 24 hours to clear from the hemolymph, a fluid in the body of the invertebrate [Nijhout: 2004]. This process sends a signal to the brain to release prothoracicotropic hormone, PTTH, which is another hormone that is responsible for the development of insects. Because of this process, insects can only mature when JH levels are low  [Hatem: 2015]. Due to the nature of insect hormones, our group hypothesizes that if Manduca caterpillars are given 4 drops of Juvenile Hormone mimic per each 10g supply of food then they will have different mean weights than caterpillars not given additional JH hormones, both kept in standard conditions.

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained eight Manduca sexta caterpillars and separated them into a control group and a treatment group, putting four caterpillars in each group. Using separated containers, we labeled each caterpillar habitat with a number 1-8. Then we made 10g of food for each caterpillar. For the experimental group, 4 drops of JH mimic were added to the food, and 4 drops of water was added in place of the drops of JH mimic. The initial weights and observations of the caterpillars were recorded prior to putting them into their habitats with their food. Every day for two weeks, observations and weight of the caterpillars were recorded, and the caterpillars were fed as needed. Three days of observations had to be omitted due to Winston Hall being closed for the weather. At the end of the two weeks, the mean change in weight for each caterpillar and determined if there was a statistical difference between the control and the treatment groups using a 2-sample t-test.

Results:
The mean change in mass for the control group was an increase of 0.915 g with a standard deviation of 2.31 g [figure 1] The mean change in mass for the experimental group was an increase of 1.975 g with a standard deviation of 4.52 g [figure 1]. We used a two-sample t-test to analyze our results. The t-value for the calculation was 0.418 and the degrees of freedom was 6. The two-tailed p-value for the experiment was 0.691. The two- tailed p-value was greater than 0.05.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if Manduca sexta receive 4 drops of Juvenile Hormone mimic per each 10g supply of food then they will have different mean weights than caterpillars not given additional JH hormones, was not supported by the experiment because p-value for the experiment was not statistically siginficant. This means that we accept the null hypothesis that Manduca sexta that receive drops of JH mimic and those who do not do not have a difference in change in weight. One reason that these results could have occurred is that the caterpillars were different weights when we received them. This indicates that some of the caterpillars were in more mature instars than others and closer to the molting stage of the life cycle.  For example, some of the initial weights of the caterpillars were greater than 5 g. This means that they had already naturally stopped producing JH, and future processes in the life cycle could have already begun [Nijhout: 2004].  Another possibility for these results is that many of our caterpillars became pupae during the course of the experiment. This metamorphosis caused the insects to eat less and lose weight. Many of our caterpillars actually ended the experiment with a lighter mass than at the beginning of the test. Using negative values  in the statistical test could explain why the standard deviations were so large.  If the experiment were to be performed again, it would be more accurate to choose caterpillars that appear to be in the same instar based on weight and color.
