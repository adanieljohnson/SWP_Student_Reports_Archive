Title: The Effects of 2% Solution of Sevin on the Muscle Contraction in Frog Leg

Abstract:
Like most organisms, the Rana pipiens frog relies on the contraction of its gastrocnemius muscle to move. Through the use of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), an action potential is transferred from the motor neuron over the neuromuscular junction to a muscle cell after receiving a stimulus. When the enzyme that causes the uptake of ACh into the motor neuron is inhibited, the neurotransmitter remains in the synaptic cleft and continues to fire action potentials and thus creates muscle contractions. In this experiment, the effects of the inhibition of the acetylcholinerase enzyme was investigated by injecting three frog legs with 2% of sevin solution to determine if there was a significant difference in muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that the addition of 2% of sevin in the gastrocnemius would cause an increase in the twitch frequency and would ultimately lead to tetany at a lower amplitude. The data showed that the experimental frog legs failed to reach tetany at a lower amplitude than the control frog legs. A paired t-test was run on the control and experimental data and the results showed that there was no significant difference between the control and experimental frog legs. Consequently, the alternate hypothesis was rejected.


Introduction:
The ability to respond to stimuli is vital for organism survival. The unique structure and function of nerve and muscle cells as well as their constant interaction provides animals with the ability to respond quickly to multiple stimuli within their environment. Skeletal muscles are composed of tubular multi-nuclear myofibers innervated by motor neurons. Stimuli will initiate an action potential generated by depolarization in the axon hillock. This action potential propagates down the axon of the motor neuron, which causes a series of events that aid in muscle contraction. First, the action potential triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction where it binds to receptors on the motor end plate. This signals the opening of sodium channels and causes subsequent depolarization. When threshold is reached, an action potential is fired down the T-tubules, triggering calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum due to the conformational change in the DHP receptor and ryanodine receptor. The released calcium binds with troponin, a protein that conceals its myosin binding sites on actin. Upon binding, the myosin binding sites on actin are exposed, which allows myosin heads to create cross bridges with actin filaments. The binding of the heads to the filaments releases a phosphate group that initiates a power stroke, where there is a conformational change in the myosin heads and the filaments begin to slide past one another. As a result, the muscle is contracted. Once ADP is released at the end of this powerstroke and ATP once again binds to myosin initiating a conformational change, actin is released and myosin returns to its initial position. When calcium is no longer supplied by the sarcoplasmic reticulum due to the lack of depolarization by the action potential, the muscle stops contracting and begins to lengthen. The ending of the action potential in the motor end plate is when the neurotransmitter leaves the neuromuscular junction and stops enabling the release of sodium ions into the muscle cell, which causes the depolarization and resulting release of calcium. Acetylcholinerase (AChE) is the control mechanism responsible for the motor neuron uptaking the ACh left in the synaptic cleft. Based off previously conducted experiments, it is believed that 2% solution of Sevin inhibits this vital enzyme.  From a recent study, it was found that 2% of sevin solution, or carbaryl, inhibits AChE activity and can often be used as insecticides in agriculture [Heinrich: 2018]. Moreover, 2% of sevin solution is known as a nerve agent that is able to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes, leading to an overabundance of Ach in the synaptic cleft [King: 2015]. In this experiment, the effects of inhibiting the AChE in frog legs’ muscle tissue will be studied using 2% solution of sevin. The biological question investigated was whether or not the injection of this inhibitor into the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower stimulus amplitude. In order to answer this question, the effects of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude and twitch frequency was investigated. It is hypothesized that when 2% of Sevin solution is injected into frog legs, the muscle will twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower amplitude.


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs of similar size were selected for this experiment. After their limbs were severed, they were kept moist with Ringer’s solution in order to aid in maintaining their muscle’s contractile ability postmortem. Before running the tests on the legs, they first had to be dissected and connected to specific instruments. To look at the muscle switch, the components of the leg had to be isolated. The skin was peeled back from each leg to expose the inner thigh muscles. These muscles were gently separated and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated from the connective tissue by cutting through the tendon distal towards the Achilles tendon. A 30 cm long piece of threat was used to tie a knot around the end of the gastrocnemius muscle so that it could be suspended by the arm of the force transducer. Doing so both separated the muscle and nerve components as well as revealed a thin sciatic nerve that could be tested on using an electrode stimulator. Pins were carefully placed to secure the leg to the dissecting tray in order to control its contractions. The electrode was placed underneath the sciatic nerve so that appropriate stimulation can be applied from the amplifier. This data then appeared on a computer in the form of a myogram, which measured the twitches in the muscle cell during specific parameters of stimulation.   Once the setup of the frog leg was complete, a control was run on the frog leg in which the muscle was stimulated by action potentials generated in the nerve attached to the muscle (the sciatic nerve). Using the computer software, the nerve was stimulated for short periods at stimulus frequencies (2,4,5,10,15,20, and 25 Hz). For every new stimulation frequency, the number of pulses was set to zero, the pulse amplitude remained constant at 1.0 A, and the pulse width was 5 ms. Observations were made about the myograms produced from the recorded stimulations and resulting twitches. The distance between peaks of the twitches in ms was recorded even when the distance was 0 ms (the frog leg had reached tetany). This process was repeated for two other control frog legs. After, this procedure was repeated for each of the three frog legs, but before recording data, their gastrocnemius muscle was injected with 0.1 mL of 2% of sevin solution using a needle. These were the experimental frog legs. A paired t-test will be performed on the averages of the control and experimental data to determine if injecting the frog legs provides statistically significant data.

Results:
There are some general trends to take note of from the data. The control frog legs for the most part had the same normal results and observations with each increase in frequency. Temporal summation was beginning to be observed and then tetany was eventually reached. The experimental frogs’ legs had similar results as the control for the first few increases in frequencies (from 2-10 Hz) while at higher frequencies, the frogs were still unable to reach tetany. As shown by Figure 1, at 25 Hz stimulation the control frog legs were consistently brought to tetany, or a distance of 0 ms, while the experimental frog legs had an average distance between twitches of 40 ms. A paired t-test was conducted on the data collected in order to determine the statistical significance of injecting the frog legs with 2% solution of sevin. The average distance between twitches in ms with a 0.1 mL of 2% of sevin injection was not statistically different from the control group (t-stat=0.995, df=6, P=0.357512).


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a 0.1 mL injection of 2% of sevin solution into a frog leg would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently, or decrease the time between twitches, and reach tetany at a lower stimulus. Based on the results recorded, the alternate hypothesis must be rejected. Since the results show that the times between twitches in ms at different frequencies was not statistically different between the control and experimental frog legs, it cannot be concluded that 2% of sevin solution causes the leg to reach tetany sooner. In fact, it was observed that the experimental frog legs did not even reach tetany by a frequency of 25 Hz, despite the control legs being able to. This could have been attributed to the fatigue the frog was feeling after the control tests. While this experiment involved using a low dosage of the enzyme inhibitor to determine its effects on muscle contraction, the 2% of sevin solution has also been known to be a powerful and common insecticide since it is able to paralyze the muscles by promoting constant contraction [King: 2015]. In the future, if this experiment were to be performed again, it would be interesting to see if waiting for the injection of 2% of sevin solution to take effect by providing a longer rest period or by increasing the dosage would parallel these known results.
