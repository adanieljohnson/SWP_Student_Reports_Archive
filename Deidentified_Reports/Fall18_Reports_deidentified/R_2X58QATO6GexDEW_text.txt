Title: Spinacia oleracea: Effects of Salinity on Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to examine the effect of salinity concentration on photosynthetic activity in plants. Spinacia oleracea are used to test the hypothesis that if salinity concentrations are increased in reaction buffers, then the percent changes of absorbances obtained at 600 nm will be lower. The absorbances reflect photosynthetic activity by the use of electron acceptor DCPIP which becomes colorless when reduced. Higher absorbances therefore higher photosynthetic activity which is measured by percent change. Increased salt concentrations will have this influence because they will dehydrate the chloroplasts and pull water out of the cell. Water is a necessary input of photosynthesis and without it, photosynthesis will be inhibited. The experiment treats chloroplast mixtures of different salinities seen in nature to evaluate the effects of salinity on photosynthesis. The study found a trend within significent data that the higher salinities had a lower percent change, however only two pairs of groups were found to be significent out of  six possible pairs. The experiment used ANOVA tests and the p value was 0.016. The trends presented by these two pairs supports previously published studies that describe the negative influence of excess salt on photosynthesis.

Introduction:
All living organisms obtain energy from one or more external sources. Plants capture and store energy from the sun through photosynthesis. This stored energy is released by glycolysis and respiration, which are processes that occur in both plants and animals. Photosynthesis uses multiple redox reactions in which electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to another. These complexes use energy from the moving electrons to pump protons, hydrogen ions, across membranes to generate a proton gradient. This gradient is then used to synthesize ATP, which is the main source of energy for plants. The equation for photosynthesis is as follows:
		6 CO2 + 12 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2
		Figure 1. Photosynthesis equation.
	Photosynthesis occurs in three stages. The first two are called the light-dependent reactions, which generate reducing power in the form of NADPH and create a proton gradient [Johnson: 2018]. The third stage consists of light-independent reactions which create glucose molecules. Measuring ATP production is very difficult; however electron transport chains in chloroplasts will actually pass electrons to acceptors other than NADP+ that are easier to measure [Johnson: 2018].  The specific organism used in this experiment is Spinacia oleracea. This experiment uses DCPIP which is a dark blue compound that becomes colorless when reduced. A DCPIP assay is conducted to measure the effects of salinity on photosynthesis. DCPIP has been used in other studies to examine the effect of different environmental
 factors on photosynthesis. One such study found that in Amaranthus chloroplasts that were exposed to ultraviolet-B radiation, the electron flow from water to DCPIP was inhibited, which contributes to the inactivation of the photosystem II reaction center [Noorudeen: 1982]. Since plants are exposed to varying environmental conditions it is important to study different factors, like salinity, and examine the effects they have on photosynthesis. Salinity changes can be due to runoff in the area a plant grows or location closer to a body of water that contains salt. Therefore, different plants in different locations can have varying amounts of salinity in their environment. It is important to understand the influence of salinity because it can help evaluate how plants adapt to different environmental conditions. Excess salt can have a negative effect on photosynthesis because it will interfere with osmosis and pull water out of a plant when it is needed for different metabolic pathways. Additionally, it has been discovered that excess salt can affect the conductance of CO2 diffusion, specifically in spinach, which led to an inhibition of photosynthesis [Wang: 2018]. Therefore, if the salinity of the reaction buffer used with the spinach increases, then the calculated rate of photosynthesis derived from the absorbances of the chloroplasts at 600 nm will decrease.

Materials and Method:
Pack a mortar and pestle, 150-250 Ml beaker, and three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into ice. Remove the central veins from four spinach leaves, then rinse and dry them. Add the leaves to the mortar and pestle along with 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer and grind the leaves. Once there is a thick green slurry, add 10 more Ml of grinding buffer, mix, and strain into the beaker using three layers of cheesecloth. Transfer the liquid to a centrifuge tube labeled “A” and spin in the centrifuge at 200 X G for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After the three minutes, pour the supernatant into a second centrifuge labeled “B”. Spin this tube in the centrifuge at 1,000 X G for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After the ten minutes, pour the supernatant into a centrifuge tube labeled “C”. Add 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and stir, making sure to break up the pellet at the bottom of the tube. Turn on the spectrometer and set it to 600 nm. Label and prepare 13 test tubes as described below:

Add 100 microliters of chloroplasts to each test tube and mix. Transfer the mixtures to spectrometer cuvettes. Blank the spectrometer and measure the absorbances immediately for the Time Zero data. Place the cuvettes on the windowsill. After a total of 10, 20, and 30 minutes repeat the process of obtaining absorbances for the chloroplast mixtures. Record the data and discard the waste appropriately. ANOVA tests will be used to determine if the data from the experiment is statistically significent.

Results:
In general it was seen that the salinity concentration of 0.2 M had the highest percent changes throughout the experiment. This was followed by the controll group at 0 M. The groups treated with 0.4 M and 0.6 M reaction buffer had very similar results of lower percentages than the other two groups. At each time interval, the 0.2 M group had the highest percent change that consistently increased over time. The percent changes for the controll group also increased over time, however those for the 0.4 M and 0.6 M groups remained relatively constant especially after 20 and 30 minutes. The ANOVA tests concluded the following information: Fs = 4.02, d.f. = 3, p = 0.016. The only two pairs that were statistically different from each other were between 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M.

Discussion:
The significent data in the experient (between 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M) supports the hypothesis which stated that higher salt concentrations would have lower percent changes. As a whole, the data could not support the hypothesis because not all of the data was significent. However, in regards to those two pairs of data, they are able to support the trend presented in the hypothesis. An increase in salt concentrations will affect the amount of water available in the plant by pulling out water, which causes dehydration. Water is a necessary input for photosynthesis as seen in Figure 1 and without it, photosynthesis will not occur. Therefore, if the salt concentrations of the chloroplasts are increased, then there will be decreased amounts of water that will inhibit photosynthesis. This is translated by the data because the absorbances represent the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. The DCPIP is used since when it is reduced through photosynthesis, it becomes colorless. This will increase the absorbance obtained. Therefore, higher percent changes represent higher photosynthetic activity.
The results obtained from the significent data support other studies which have concluded that salt stress has negatively affected photosynthetic activity in spinach. In a study titled “Restrictions to Carbon Dioxide Conductance and Photosynthesis in Spinach Leaves Recovering from Salt Stress”, the researchers discovered that salt accumulation in spinach leaves inhibits photosynthesis by negatively affecting the function of stomata [Delfine: 1999]. Stomata controlls the conductance of carbon dioxide diffusion and when carbon dioxide cannot diffuse through the stomata, photosynthesis will cease. Although this doesn’t necessarily relate to chloroplast function, it has been seen that salt negatively affects photosynthesis in spinach leaves. Salt not only has an affect on water, but on other ions in a cell. A separate study discovered that salt accumulation caused a drop of calcium and magnesium which can decrease membrane stability and chlorophyll content [Delfine: 1998]. This would also have a negative effect on photosynthesis by disrupting the stability of the chloroplasts in the spinach leaf cells.
The next logical step for this experiment would be to run it for a longer period of time and gather more data. The most apparent problem with this experiment was that the data was not statistically significent and did not allow for interpretation of wider results. This can be improved by running the experiment for a longer period of time and collecting more data to hopefully obtain better results. An experiment titled “Photosynthetic and Stomatal Responses of Spinach Leaves to Salt Stress” was run over a time period of three weeks and found more concrete results regarding the functions of stomata under varying salt concentrations [Downton: 1985]. This also proposes another of idea of future study which would be examining the overall function of spinach leaves through examination of stomatal functioning rather than looking only at chloroplasts.
