Title: The Effect of Exposure to Cold Temperatures on the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Different method of stimulation of muscles in a frog leg can determine the abilities of the muscle. In this experiment, a method of electric shock was used and the outside factor effecting the leg muscles was temperature. We hypothesized that if the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease. The twitch threshold was determined for the gastrocnemus muscle of three frog legs and then increased by 1 to test the response voltage. Response voltage for each leg at room temperature (21.67°C ) was determined three times and averaged. Then, response voltage for each leg after being iced for 5 minutes at 5°C was determined three times and averaged. A paired t_test was used to find that the results were not significent (T-Stat = 1.01105, DF = 2, P value = 0.41842) and our hypothesis was found to not be supported. Moving forward, more precaution should be taken about removing the frog legs from being chilled too late before the experiments begin.

Introduction:
By using different stimulators, it is possible to see how muscles in frogs will react and their ability. The ability of the gastrocnemus muscle in the Northern Leopard Frog, Rania pipiens, is determined by many factors. In the natural environment of frogs, cold can affect how a frog’s muscles will react. Many frogs have a freeze tolerance, like the gray treefrog that uses glycerol as a cryoprotectant [Layne: 1999]. However, in this experiment, exposure to cold is assumed to negatively affect the muscle abilities of Rania pipiens. If the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease. 

Materials and Method:
3 Rania pipiens’ frog legs are prepared so that their skin is removed, and the muscles are exposed. Needles are put in the gastrocnemus muscle that allow for electric shocks to hit the muscle. The twitch threshold of each leg is determined, then increased by 1 voltage to test before and after icing. The room was at a temperature of 21.67°C. The voltage response of the room temperature legs was determined 3 times for each leg and then averaged. Each leg was then iced for 5 minutes at 5°C. The voltage response was determined for each iced leg 3 times each and averaged. A paired t_test was used to find the significance of the data results.

Results:
The mean differences of the room temperature leg voltage number and the iced leg voltage number was not significent (T-Stat = 1.01105, DF = 2, P value = 0.41842). As seen in Fig. 1, the voltage only decreased dramatically once iced with the third frog leg. Iced legs appeared less red than room temperature legs, though.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that if the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens is exposed to cold, then the response voltage of the electric shocks will decrease was not supported. A reason for this happening could be that legs were previously chilled in the lab. The third frog leg was also set out in room temperature for longer than the others, which could explain the dramatic decrease in voltage from. In the future, the frog legs should be set out in the room temperature air if they are chilled beforehand. Another improvement for future experiments could be to ice the frog legs longer, since we only iced them for 5 minutes. Another related future experiment that could be performed based on our experiment is the glycerol content of frog legs. It was found in one experiment that many frog species, including the Hyla versicolor are freeze tolerant based on the amount of glycerol in their bodies [Layne; 1999]. It would be interesting to test how glycerol would affect the twitch threshold of frog legs in terms of exposure to cold temperature.

Figure Legends: 
Fig 1. The mean difference of each frog leg from the voltage number of the room temperature (21.67°C) leg to the iced (at 5°C ) leg voltage number. The twitch threshold was determined to be 0.6 V, so testing conditions were set at 1.6 V, 1 pulse, 1 Hz, 5 ms pulse width.*************************************************************************
