Title:   The Effect of Heat on the Movement of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum responds to environmental stimulus, such as temperature change, through the cAMP mediated pathway. There are ways to modify the pathway to mimic different events. In this experiment, the physarum was exposed to heat to mimic the growth stimulating effects that calcium would have on these organisms. The physarum were placed on water agar plates with food surrounding them and kept in 3 different environments: 3 in room temperature to act as the control group and 3 in an incubator. The last 3 water agar plates received a calcium treatment and were kept in room temperature. Movement of physarum was measured 25 hours later. The results of the experiment show that heat does mimic the effects of increased calcium levels and increased the motility by altering the actin filaments. 


Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways are pathways that allow cells to respond to different environmental stimuli as well as internal stimuli. It is important to understand the mechanics of these pathways to better control bacteria and fungi that grow in a certain area. Additionally, studying environmental effects on these pathways can be used as predictor to what would happen in the human body since all organism possess at least a similar mechanism. The target organism in this experiment is physarum polycephalum, a yellow, slime like bacteria that grows in damp and dark environments. It moves towards its food through cytoplasmic streaming because of actin filaments to extend its leading edge [Terry et al: 2008]. When this food is unavailable the physarum responds by hardened itself. Different environmental factors can trigger various changes within physarum behavior. For example, heat shock will cause the physarum to begin its reproductive system [Johnson: 2016]. Heat shock is an interesting area of study because it can also mimic a biochemical mechanism within the physarum cAMP mediated signaling pathway. The G-protein coupled cAMP pathway begins with a G-protein activating an effector enzyme, which will then convert ATP into cAMP. This action allows the molecules to bind to other molecules and substrates like protein kinase A, which can phosphorylate other enzymes. The cAMP is shut off when cAMP is broken down [Johnson: 2016]. Studies have shown that increased levels of calcium within the signaling systems will increase the amount of cAMP and vice versa. The changes in calcium levels influence the cross linkages of the actin filaments that the physarum use to move. The movement of physarum is caused by the myosin II and actin interactions that cause the leading edge to gravitate towards food [Terry et al: 2008]. Calcium is believed to propel them. It is hypothesized that the physarum will be more mobile when exposed to heat because heat is believed to increase the calcium levels. Theoretically, the plate with calcium should induce the same movement in the physarum as the plate placed in the incubator. 



Materials and Methods:

The materials used in this experiment were metal spatulas, ethanol, nine water agar plates, calcium, opaque bags, and an incubator. Nine 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water agar were obtained. Three plates were labeled control, three plates were labeled calcium, and three were labeled heat. Each plate was marked on the backside with a straight line down the middle. The three calcium plates were prepared by diluting calcium into a 1M solution, then pouring the solution on top of the open water agar plates. The solution was left to soak in for 10 minutes before discarding the excess, placing a kimwipe against the edge to absorb residue. Two 1-cm squares were evenly spaced out and drawn upon the line on each plate and then turned over towards the front. The spatulas were sterilized in ethanol and used to cut out and lift the squares that were just outlined. The agar plates were wiped off with a kimwipe after the blocks were removed. The spatulas were placed back into the 95% alcohol for 15 seconds to sterilize. From the physarum stock plate, 18 1cm blocks of physarum were cut, placing the spatula back into the ethanol solution to sterilize after each cut. The areas containing the most oats and the most condensed areas of physarum were selected to cut from. Using the forceps, a precut block from the stock culture was placed into each of empty slots in all of the plates. The forceps were placed back into the ethanol solution. Five oats were evenly sprinkled across each plate. All nine plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and labeled again accordingly. The plates were placed into 3 opaque black bags. The control plates were put into a drawer at room temperature. The calcium plates were also kept at room temperature in a drawer. The other three plates labeled heat were placed in an incubator. Measurements of physarum movement were taken 25 hours later. The statistical test used was a two-sample t-test.  


Results:
Although the results of the experiment are not statistically significant, the data seems to show a general trend that the physarum of the two treatment groups extended their leading edges further than those that were under normal conditions. Additionally, the physarum placed on the calcium plate and those placed in the incubator migrated relatively the same distance towards the food as seen through figure one. For each individual plate, the distance traveled by the physarum was similar between those two treatment groups, with the exception of plate 3. The physarum exposed to the calcium extended its edge significantly further than those of the control group (p= 0.357). However, although very similar, organism placed in the heat exhibited a slightly faster rate of migration (p=0.2860). As a collective, the physarum extended their edges towards the food source under all conditions. The error bars on the graph represent the relative error factoring into the calculations. The actual distance traveled is somewhere within the error bars. 


Discussion:
The results were not statistically significant, but the statement holds true that Physarum polcephylaums’ rate of migration was fastest when exposed to heat. Little is known about heat’s effect on slime mold movement; however, there are logical explanations for the possibilities. Light induces the release of cAMP within the pathway. Naturally, light radiates heat. By this logic, heat should increase the levels of cAMP as well [Miura et al: 1999]. When cAMP levels are increased, the calcium levels are consequently increased. The changes in calcium levels influence the cross linking in the actin and myosin filaments that the physarum use to move. It is believed to increase the contractile rate; therefore, increasing the movement. Another study proposes that physarum have a calcium sensitive contractile mechanism. It is possible that outside factors, such as heat for example, could directly increase movement by inhibiting certain enzyme activity [Costello et al: 2013]. There are ways to interfere and manipulate the cAMP mediated pathway. In this experiment, the pathway was altered by adding heat to mimic the release of calcium. If heat truly did increase calcium levels, then theoretically, the movement of physarum was supposed to be extremely similar between those placed on a calcium agar plate and those placed in an incubator. Figure 1 exhibits this phenomenon. If this experiment were to be conducted again, we would focus on precision overall to achieve more accurate results. As an environmental stimulus, heat is important to study so one can be cognizant of the changes it causes to the organism and therefore act accordingly. A topic for future study is to observe physarum movement when exposed to different calcium concentrations increasing in molarity.  Calcium concentration increase is intended to greater increase the movement of physarum [Terry et al: 2008]. In turn, this should mean that progressive increase of temperature would cause the physarum to grow even closer towards their food source.
