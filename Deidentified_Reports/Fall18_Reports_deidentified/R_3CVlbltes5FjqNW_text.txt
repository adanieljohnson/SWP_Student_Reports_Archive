Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Mass of the Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
 This experiment explores the effects of giving the manduca sexta excess Juvenile Hormone and the effects it has on its life cycle. By taking the control group and the treatment group which was treated with methoprene, we were able to observe the larva with excess hormone as opposed to without the hormone. By measuring the weights of larva and observing their growth throughout a two week period, we hypothesized that the treatment group would gain significantly more mass than that of the control group. After taking the data and analyzing it we concluded that the data was statistically insignificant. 


Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in the growth and development of most organisms. Hormones allow for the regulation of homeostasis of organic systems as well as allowing changes of the body to occur. For example, hormones control the homeostasis of calcium levels in humans, while also allowing puberty to occur. The type of hormone, along with the cell it targets, dictates the effect it will have on the organism. This is true for the Manduca Sexta, which is studied in this experiment. The Manduca Sexta goes through metamorphosis which requires a major transformation [Hatem:2015]. It goes through a series of 5 Instars in which it molts until it finally becomes a Pupa. During this molting phases, the outer layer of the caterpillar goes from its thick cuticle made out of varying ploidy levels into a thinner one [Nardi: 2018]. This transaction requires a division of cells and changing of ploidy levels all of which are initiated through hormones[Nardi: 2018]. Both Juvenile hormone and Ecdysone, moderate the process from the insects larval stage into adulthood. In this experiment, we explore the ways in which the ratios of these hormones affect the development of the larva. The hypothesis of this expirement is that if we give the Manduca Sexta an excess of Juvenile hormone, the mass of the treatment group will be significantly larger than that of the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta were used in this experiment. Four were part of the control while the remaining four where part of the treatment. Each group of caterpillars was placed in a plastic container each containing 4 cells as to keep the caterpillars together but away from each other. Their initial masses were taken and 10 grams of food were added to the control group. 10 grams of food was weighed for the treatment group but five drops of methoprene (synthetic Juvenile hormone) was added as well. The caterpillars were weighed and observed sequentially for a period of two weeks. After weighing the caterpillars for two weeks, we took the difference in their masses between the last day and the first day. In order to analyze the statistical significance of the data, we used a two sample T- test. The P value derived was a two-tailed p value. 


Results:
The results of the experiment consisted of a control average of .4575 and a treatment average of 1.9375. These averages represent the average in the change of mass between the last day and the first day. The standard deviation among the control group was 2.026 while the deviation between the treatment group was 1.336. The degree of freedom is 6. The T value is 1.22. The two tailed P value is .267 which makes the results statistically insignificant. On the last day of observation all four control group organisms were pupating. The treatment group green, larger than previously noted, little to no movement was noted. 


Discussion:
Giving the Manduca Sexta a synthetic form of Juvenile hormone did not support our hypothesis stating that they would grow significantly.  As shown in figure 1, although the results show a trend similar to that hypothesis, the changes in mass were not statistically significant. Although the results of this experiment were rejected, other studies have been shown that indicate a correlation between juvenile hormone and the prevention of metamorphosis. One study showed methoprene was directly correlated in preventing the Tobacco Hornworm from pupating [Meng: 2018]. This can be explained through the ratio of Juvenile hormone and Ecdysone in Manduca Sexta. During the larval stages of their life cycle Juvenile hormone is high while Ecdysone is low. When the larva is ready to start pupating, Ecdysone levels rise while Juvenile hormone levels drop. By giving the larva the excess hormone, the larva is unable to pupate and thus continues to increase in size in the larval state. The insignificant results could have been a source of error. It is possible that five drops of methoprene is not enough Juvenile hormone to make an adequate difference in the size of the larva. This study is important for many reasons. For one, it is important for the understanding of the importance of hormones in the regulation and changes in an organism. In this case, the Juvenile hormone regulates the larval stage, while a spike in ecodyne initiates the start of the metamorphosis process. This study is also important for the study of pest control. By manipulating the hormones of certain pest, it would be easy to eliminate pest problems without having to use hazardous pesticides. Future studies could focus on the exact ratio in which this happen, and can explore the effects of the two hormones further.
