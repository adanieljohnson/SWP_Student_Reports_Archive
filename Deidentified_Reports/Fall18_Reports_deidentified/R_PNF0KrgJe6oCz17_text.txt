Title: The Difference in Rate of Photosynthesis between Spinach and Kale Leaves

Abstract:
We explored whether the variability of a plant, such as shade of green or thickness of leaves, affect reduction reactions for photosynthesis. Spinach and kale are good model organisms for experiments exploring photosynthesis because they both have green leaves which means they contain chlorophyll. We hypothesized that kale will have a higher rate of photosynthesis than spinach because kale has a thicker leaf. The greater the number of chloroplasts available to absorb light, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. There would be an increase in the rate of reduction of DCIP which indicates photosynthesis has been carried out more in the kale and in light versus dark conditions. We used a centrifuge to obtain our spinach and kale chloroplasts, and used spectrophotometer to record absorbances after 30 minutes in light and dark conditions. The absorbances of the chloroplasts in light, 0.001 for spinach and 0.075 for kale, show that there is a higher rate of electron transfer in the kale after 30 minutes than in the spinach which can indicate a higher rate of photosynthesis in the kale. Factors that affect photosynthesis are important because as global warming increases, it is crucial that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to better the planet. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the biochemical pathway which converts the energy of light into the bonds of glucose molecules. This process is split up into two main parts, Photosystem I and II. Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts where proteins are stored in the lumen of the thylakoid where the photosystem I is prominent in the stroma lamellae and photosystem II is prominent in the grana (Nelson: 2006).  Redox chemistry is the transfer of electrons or hydrogen atoms and is key to the energy conservation in photosynthesis as the redox state of an electron carrier determines the distribution of absorbed light between photosystems. The light that the plants absorb drive ATP synthesis by exciting electrons so that it generates them onto NADP, electron carrier molecules, which combine to synthesize glucose from CO2. Therefore, after many processes, glucose is the major product of photosynthesis. Because light is needed to initiate the process, the rate of photosynthesis of a plant is higher in lighter areas and lower in shaded areas. DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol) is a blue due that acts as an electron acceptor and becomes colorless when reduced which allows any reducing agent produced by the chloroplasts to be detected. Additionally, in ground tissue of plants’ leaves are mesophyll cells which are specialized for photosynthesis. These cells are in the middle of the leaf and contain many chloroplasts, which as mentioned earlier is the organelle that performs photosynthesis. Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll, which is a green pigment that is responsible for the absorption of light to provide energy for photosynthesis. It has been studied that has mesophyll cells increase in size and frequency, the thickness of the leaf of the plant increases (Nobel: 1975). In this experiment, we explored whether the variability of a plant, such as shade of green or thickness of leaves, affect reduction reactions for photosynthesis. Spinach and kale are good model organisms for experiments exploring photosynthesis because they both have green leaves which means they contain chlorophyll and the rest of the machinery needed for photosynthesis. Both these plants are readily available at local supermarkets and they are relatively inexpensive, therefore; they are good model organisms for experiments dealing with photosynthesis. Due to prior studies and general knowledge, we hypothesize that kale will have a higher rate of photosynthesis than spinach because kale has a thicker leaf. This means that it has more intercellular space that can be filled with mesophyll cells indicating that more chloroplasts are present. The greater the number of chloroplasts available to absorb light, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. As a result, in relation to the electron transport chain, there would be an increase in the rate of reduction of DCIP which indicates photosynthesis has been carried out more in the kale and in light conditions versus dark conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
Our hypothesis was tested by measuring the rate of transfer of electrons, using DCIP, which helped us approximate the differences in photosynthesis between kale and spinach leaves. Our group obtained chloroplasts from both kale leaves and spinach leaves. We then packed two mortar and pestles, two medium sized beakers, and six 50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortars and pestles were cooling, we removed the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves and four medium-sized kale leaves. We then rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water, and blotted off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortars and pestle were cold, we wiped them drive and added the spinach leaves to one and the kale leaves to the other. We then added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to the spinach and 10 mL of grinding buffer to the kale mortar. Grind the spinach and the kale until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. We then added an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer to the spinach, mix with the spinach slurry, and strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We did the same with the kale, added 10 mL of grinding buffer, mixed with the kale slurry, and strained the entire volume of green kale slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the other chilled beaker. 
We then transferred 200 uL of the filtered liquid from the beaker of spinach into a microtube labeled “Sample of A Spinach”, and stored it on ice. Next, we transferred 200 uL of the filtered liquid from the beaker of kale into a microtube labeled “Sample of A Kale”, and stored that on ice as well. We then transferred the remaining green liquid from “Sample of A Spinach” to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge marked “A-Spinach”, and we spun it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. Then, we transferred the remaining green liquid from “Sample of A Kale” to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A - Kale”, and spin it at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. We then poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A - Spinach” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Spinach”. We did not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A - Spinach”. Then, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A - Kale” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Kale”, and did not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A – Kale.” 
Next, our group removed 200 μL of the liquid from the 50 ml tube marked “B - Spinach”, and placed it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B - Spinach”, & stored it on ice. We then removed 200 μL of the liquid from the 50 ml tube marked “B - Kale”, placed it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B - Kale”, & stored it on ice. We then centrifuged the 50 mL tube containing the chloroplasts suspension (“Tube B- Spinach”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the Rt-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. Next we centrifuged the 50 mL tube containing the chloroplasts suspension (“Tube B- Kale”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the Rt-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. We then poured the spinach supernatant into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C- Spinach”, were careful not to disturb the pellet, and placed the tube on ice. Then, we poured the kale supernatant into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C- Kale”, were careful not to disturb the pellet, and placed the tube on ice. Next, we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We then transferred 200 uL of this resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “ Sample of B Pellet – Spinach”, and stored it on ice.  Then, we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We then transferred 200 uL of this resuspended pellet into a microtube labeled “ Sample of B Pellet – Kale”, and stored it on ice. Finally, we removed 200 uL from the tube “C-Spinach”, and placed it into a microtube labeled “Sample of C – Spinach” and stored it on ice. The same was done with the kale, we removed 200 uL from the tube “C-Kale”, and placed it into a microtube labeled “Sample of C – Kale” and stored it on ice. 
In the next section of our experiment, we labeled 17 large test tubes and placed them in a tube rack, turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to 600 nm. We then prepared three replicates of each of the following reaction mixers, only one blank for each, spinach blank, kale blank, negative control with no chloroplasts, spinach chloroplasts in light, spinach chloroplasts in dark, kale chloroplasts in light, and kale chloroplasts in dark. We added water, 130 mM DCIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) to the tubes accordingly. When we were ready to begin the assay, we added 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts to blank 1 and tubes #6-11, and we added 100 uL of kale chloroplasts to blank 2 and tubes #12-17. We mixed each tube after immediately after adding chloroplasts and transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. We then immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 1 (Spinach blank) and recorded all absorbances for spinach tubes (#6-11). Then we blanked the spectrophotometer with the Kale blank (tube 2) and recorded all absorbances for kale tubes (#12-17). We then places tubes 1-8, and 12-14 in lamp light, and we placed tubes 9-11 and 15-17. After 10 minutes, we blanked the blank the spectrophotometer with spinach blank (tube #1) and record absorbance for spinach samples - tubes #6-11. We then blanked the spectrophotometer with kale blank (#2) and recorded absorbances for kale samples (tubes 12-17). After 10 more minutes (20 min total) in light or dark, we blanked the spectrophotometer again with each sample and recorded absorbances a second time, repeating the spectrophotometer steps from the first reading. After 10 more minutes (30 min total)  in light or dark, we blanked the spectrophotometer again with each sample and recorded absorbances a third time, repeating the same steps. A two-tailed t-test was employed to compare the rate of photosynthesis between kale leaves and spinach leaves. 


Results:
In our experiment, we found that in our spinach samples that the average percent change after 30 for tubes with no chloroplasts, chloroplasts in light, and chloroplasts in dark was 43.9%, 99.5%, and 73.0% respectively. In our kale samples, we found samples that the average percent change after 30 for tubes with no chloroplasts, chloroplasts in light, and chloroplasts in dark was 776%, 254%, and 53.3% respectively. The comparison of spinach and kale chloroplasts in light and dark conditions can be found in Figure 1. The major trends observed were the fact that the chloroplasts for both leaves tended to greatly increase in light conditions, kale even more so than spinach. The main, unexpected, numerical differences in results between groups were between the no chloroplast absorbances with the spinach blank and kale blank. The percent change of the spinach was only 43.9% whereas it was 776% after using the kale blank. After 30 minutes, the final absorbances read for spinach chloroplasts in light and kale chloroplasts in light were 0.001 and 0.075 respectively. With the use of a two-tailed t test, we could compare the average absorbances of spinach in light to average absorbances of kale in light to find if there was a significant difference for the results we obtained. We calculated a p-value of 0.361 between the spinach chloroplasts in light and kale in light after 30 min, and a t-value of 1.03 which means that our results were insignificant. 

Discussion:
	 Our results did not support our hypothesis that kale will have a higher rate of photosynthesis because our p-value was not equal to or less than 0.05. Our obtained p-value, 0.361, is most likely due to the outlier absorbance recorded for one tube of kale in light after 30 minutes. Due to a broken spectrophotometer used at the beginning of the experiment, the probability that an error occurred while trying to organize switching spectrophotometers and keeping the tubes in the correct order is high. This could account for greater variation between our samples of kale chloroplasts in light. However; the fact that the average kale percent changes in light was higher than spinach indicates that there is a higher rate of electron transfer in kale leaves (Figure 1). This makes sense because kale leaves are thicker than spinach leaves, therefore; kale has more mesophyll cells than spinach. More mesophyll cells means more chloroplasts which means more light can be absorbed and transformed into energy. The high percent change in the light conditions and low percent change in dark conditions of both spinach and kale illustrate that light is needed to excite the chloroplasts and for the electron transfer to occur. Additional unexpected results we obtained were the percent change in the no chloroplast tubes, which were 43.9% and 776% for the spinach and kale respectively. Because there were no chloroplasts in the tubes, there should have been no change in absorbance. The fact that there was such a high percent change in absorbance, especially kale, suggests that some type of error most likely occurred in the experiment. The absorbances of the chloroplasts in light, 0.001 for spinach and 0.075 for kale, give an effective snapshot of the overall success of the experiment and how our results align with our hypothesis. The final absorbances show that there is a higher rate of electron transfer in the kale after 30 minutes than in the spinach, which can indicate a higher rate of photosynthesis in the kale leaves. It is important to know the factors that affect photosynthesis because as global warming increases, it is crucial that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. By learning more about photosynthesis, it helps scientists discover biochemical measures that can increase the plants’ biological potential (Tkemaladze: 2016). An increase in biological potential will impact the plants’ “photosynthetic and energy opportunities…[which] will contribute to drought resistance and will prevent increase of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere” (Tkemaladze: 2016). Our results compare quite in line with previously performed studies, for other studies found that photosynthesis was more prevalent in sun leaves than shade leaves. Additionally, other studies have found that “density thickness variation is important in photosynthetic adaption to sun and shade” as well (McMillen: 1983). An obstacle that we encountered during our experiment was a broken spectrophotometer. This  It would be useful to further study if different compositional factors “such as the amount of ribulose-1,5-bisP carboxylase/ oxygenase” affect the different between sun and shade leaves (McMillen: 1983). Another possible study could explore whether dry weight or fresh weight impacts the rate of photosynthesis in similar plants. The next steps could be to analyze the impact of different environmental factors on the rate of photosynthesis in plants and how we can preserve those qualities so as to better the planet as a whole long term.
