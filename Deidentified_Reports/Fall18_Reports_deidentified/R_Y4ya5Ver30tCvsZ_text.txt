Title: Negative Effects of Insect Growth Regulator, Precor, on the Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Our experiment is testing the effects of the insect growth regulator (IGR), precor, on the development of the Manduca Sexta, specifically the commitment pulse. We hypothesize that the addition of precor will inhibit the Maduca Sexta in reaching the commitment pulse, obstructing pupation and resulting in a continuous weight increase. In order to perform our experiment, we have a control group and an experimental group which receives precor. Our results show the control group following the normal life cycle of the Manduca Sexta, reaching the commitment pulse and beginning to pupate, while the experimental group does not reach the commitment pulse and continues to increase in weight. In conclusion, the addition of precor inhibits the commitment pulse, resulting in a prolonged larval stage and continuous weight increase in the Manduca Sexta.

Introduction:
Our experiment is testing the effects of an insect growth regulator (IGR), specifically precor, on the development of the Manduca Sexta. The Manduca Sexta is an exemplary model organism for our experiment in that the life stages and hormone releases/responses have been widely studied, giving us an ideal basis on which to interpret and discuss our results. The addition of an insect growth regulator like precor affects the normal development of insects, specifically the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is the stage at which the Juvenile Hormone release slows, and the Manduca Sexta begins pupating. Most species will respond to an IGR treatment by continuing larval, nymphal, or pupal forms, in which they continue to increase in weight between immature and adult forms without pupating [Staal: 1975]. Our chosen IGR, precor, forces the insect to remain in a juvenile state, inhibiting the commitment pulse and continuing growth and weight increase [Izadi: 2005]. The biological question we are asking is that if the precor is added to the food of the Manduca Sexta caterpillar, will the weight of the caterpillars increase, and will the commitment pulse be inhibited? In order to answer this question, we will need to have a control group as well as an experimental group with the addition of precor. The weight of the experimental group of caterpillars will act as our dependent variable, while the addition of precor will act as the independent variable. We hypothesize that the addition of precor will inhibit the Maduca Sexta in reaching the commitment pulse, obstructing pupation and resulting in a continuous weight increase.


Materials and Methods:
Eight Maduca Sexta caterpillars were obtained and were randomly split into two groups of four: one being the control group and the other being the experimental group. Two containers with four cells each were prepared with breathing holes and labeled in order to distinguish between the two groups. 10g of caterpillar food was measured for each caterpillar (80g total). The food was stirred and split up into eight separate containers containing 10g of food each. Seven drops of di water were added to four of the containers, stirred, and then these four 10g blobs of food/water were placed in the four separate cells of the control group container. Seven drops of precor were added to the remaining four containers, stirred, and then these four 10g of food/precor blobs were placed in the four separate cells of the experimental group container. The weight of the four control group caterpillars was recorded in grams, and then they were placed in their cells, while the four experimental group caterpillars were weighed in grams and then placed in their own cells. All eight caterpillars were weighed and observed every other day for one week, and the same process was used to change food when necessary. In order to evaluate the results, we used a two-tailed T-test and evaluated the p-value.

Results:
Table 1: Recorded Weights of Control Group Table 2: Recorded Weights of Treatment Group Table 3: Average Final Weights Table 4: Average Growth Rates  Figure 1: Average increase in weight of Maduca Sexta- control group vs experimental group (addition of precor). Error bars represent standard deviation. T-test results showed p value of 0.74. High p-value can be contributed to error/unusual variation in control group.

Discussion:
Tables 1 and 2 show the recorded weights each day that a measurement was taken, displaying an increase in weight in both the control and treatment groups. Table 3 shows the average final weights for both groups, resulting in an average final weight of 7.05 g for the control group and an average final weight of 8.07 for the treatment group (date measured being 9/12). These final weights parallel our hypothesis which states that the addition of precor would inhibit the commitment pulse and result in an ongoing weight increase as shown in the greater average weight of the treatment group. Figure 1 displays the average growth rates of both the control and experimental groups, resulting in a higher average growth rate of the treatment group. This higher average growth rate once again supports our hypothesis in that the treatment group had an inhibited commitment pulse and an elongated span of weight increase. The average growth rate for the control group shows evidence of error when observing the growth, or lack thereof, of caterpillar 1. Caterpillar 1 did not increase in weight at all throughout the experiment, and ended up dying, which has an effect on the average growth rates for the control group, as well as the standard deviation. This variance in data also points towards our two-tailed p-value of 0.74. Our p-value is on the larger side; however, this can be contributed to the fact that the weight increase of one of our caterpillars varied greatly from the others and did not increase in weight at all. One week prior to our final recording, our control group had pupated while our treatment group had continued to increase in weight and showed no sign of the commitment pulse. These results further confirmed our hypothesis that the addition of precor would obstruct the commitment pulse and sustain weight increase. Furthermore, these results hold strong both Izadi and Staalâ€™s prior-mentioned findings that insect growth inhibitors like precor will force the insect to remain in a juvenile state, inhibiting the commitment pulse and sustaining an increase in weight between the immature and adult forms [Staal: 1975], [Izadi: 2005].
