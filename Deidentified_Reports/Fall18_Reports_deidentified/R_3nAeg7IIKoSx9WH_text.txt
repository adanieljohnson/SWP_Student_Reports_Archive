Title: The Inhibition of Ecdysterone on Manduca sexta Caterpillars Through the use of Azaguard.

Abstract:
Hormone regulation allows for maintenance, growth, and survival of organisms. When spraying insects with hormone based pesticides it is important to understand the effects that it might have on the organism. The hormone ecdysterone is involved in regulating the timing of molting. The hypothesis was that the Manduca sexta caterpillars that were exposed to azaguard would weigh less compared to the other caterpillars in the control group. We used azaguard to inhibit the production of ecdysterone in Manduca sexta caterpillars. The azaguard that we used was saturated into the food supplies of the Manduca sexta caterpillars. On the last day after two weeks, our data showed a significant difference between the two weights of the caterpillar groups. This significant difference goes along with the concept that the ecdysterone regulates the molting cycle in the caterpillars thus when the caterpillars are unable to grow larger, they are unable to molt.

Introduction:
The development of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is regulated by the two hormones of ecdysterone, 20E, and the juvenile hormone, JH. Hormones are chemical signals that allow for the coordination of the functions of various parts of the body as well as development and growth. Hormones allow for both organisms that contain an exoskeleton or endoskeleton to grow and become larger as they progress towards adulthood. In the case of the Manduca sexta caterpillar the production of these hormones are regulated through the corpora cardiaca which is a pair of small neurohemal organs located behind the brain [Córdoba-Aguilar: 2018]. Endoskeletons are able to grow without the organism shedding its skeleton, while exoskeleton organisms must shed their skeleton through the process of molting. The molting process is when an exoskeleton organism sheds its own skelton only to have it replaced by a newer and larger layer of cuticle [Sadava: 2017]. Insects progress through several stages of molting and morphological changes until they reach their adult form. In order to be able to molt though, an organism must be able to increase its weight and size. The Manduca sexta caterpillar was used as the model organism for this experiment because there has been several experiments in the past that have tested the effects of hormones on the life cycle of these specific caterpillars. In the case of the Manduca sexta caterpillar the four stages of the life cycle are: egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. During the life cycle of the Manduca sexta there is a committed pulse in which the fifth instar larvae will wander and after day six will start to pupate [Igarashi: 2018]. These experiments have revolved around the IGR’s which stands for insect growth regulators. 20E regulates the timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects [Johnson: 2018]. JH regulates the type of molt during development, and like 20E, regulates multiple functions in adult insects [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, the chemical azaguard was used which has the effect of inhibiting the amount of 20E that a Manduca sexta caterpillar can produce. By altering the amount of 20E that the Manduca sexta caterpillar can produce, the normal life cycle and development will be thrown off. Our hypothesis is that by inhibiting the amount of ecdysterone that a Manduca sexta caterpillar can produce, the less the Manduca sexta caterpillars will weigh.


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected, and divided into two groups and each caterpillar was placed into its own separate rearing jar which had air holes punched into them and labeled. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets: food with 20 drops of water or food with 20 drops of azaguard. The diets were prepared by first measuring out 40 grams of the food and adding 20 drops of water or 20 drops of azaguard and stirring the food up in a square container. These 40 grams were then split into even groups of 10 grams and placed into each caterpillar’s rearing jar. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator and when a caterpillar ran out of food we prepared a new batch of food for all of the caterpillars in each group. The caterpillars were allowed to live and grow for two weeks. It is key to note that our TA provided us with the caterpillars during the 3rd or 4th instar larvae. Each day the weight of every caterpillar was measured and recorded through the use of a standard lab balance. The statistical test that was used was a two sample t test which was used in order to determine if azaguard did cause the caterpillars in the experimental group to weigh a different amount.

Results:
The standard deviation for the weight of the control group on the last day was 0.035 and the mean weight of the control group was 3.8525 grams. The standard deviation for the weight of the experimental group on the last day was 0.40377 and the mean weight of the experimental group was 2.91667 grams (Figure 1). We used a two-sample t test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the control group was statistically different from the mean weight of the experimental group tested on the last day (t-sat: 4.77316, df: 5, P: 0.005009). When observing the Manduca sexta caterpillars on the last day there were visual differences. All caterpillars in the control group where in the pupa stage (Figure 3). Two of the caterpillars in the experimental group were still caterpillars, one was pupating, and the last one was dead (Figure 4). Overall, the control group progressed through the life cycle development, while the experimental group lagged behind in terms of mass (Figure 2).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, by inhibiting the amount of ecdysterone that a Manduca sexta caterpillar can produce, the less the Manduca sexta caterpillar will weigh, was supported. We observed a significant difference, suggesting that azaguard does inhibit the production of 20E in Manduca sexta caterpillars and that these caterpillars will weigh less. A biological reason for this is that ecdysterone regulates the molting cycle in Manduca sexta caterpillars. The hormone 20E is a interendocrine hormone produced by the endocrine gland which is influenced by the brain which in turn influences the progression through the life cycle of the Manduca sexta caterpillar [Bollenbacher: 1988]. The Manduca sexta caterpillar also uses the prothoracic gland to convert α-ecdysone into β-ecdysone which is the active form of ecdysone [King: 1974]. By the Manduca sexta caterpillars weighing less they are unable to molt as fast and therefore do not progress through their life cycles at a normal rate. The Manduca sexta caterpillars in the control group went through each stage normally, whereas the experimental group either died, did not reach the pupa stage, or had abnormalities during the pupa stage. This could suggest that without 20E the Manduca sexta caterpillars would remain in one stage of their life cycle forever. However this is not the case due to hemolymph protein fraction (HPF) which takes 2-dehydroecdysone and 3-dehydroecdysone and rapidly converts them into ecdysone even in the absence of a prothoracic gland [Waren: 1988]. The reason for this would be that the larva is never fully grown and therefore never receives the pulse of 20E that is need to become and adult [Córdoba-Aguilar: 2018]. The more we know about the effects of 20E on the life cycle of Manduca sexta, the better off we are at determining if using chemically sprayed IGRs are a safe option. Future studies could examine the effects of inhibiting JH on Manduca sexta caterpillars without inhibiting 20E to determine what role JH plays in the life cycle development.
