Title: The effect of calcium blocker on the strength of muscle contraction

Abstract:
Calcium is an ion vital to muscle contraction because it triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The objective of this experiment was to determine the effect of a calcium blocker (lanthanum chloride) on the strength of muscle contraction. To test this, we tested 3 frog legs and stimulated the sciatic nerve at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 voltages and measured the strength of contraction. We then injected the same legs with lanthanum chloride and stimulated the sciatic nerve at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 voltages and measured the strength of contraction. The means of the control group for leg 1, (1.0634) and leg 2, (0.039) were larger than the means of the treatment group, (leg 1: 0.052; leg 2: 0.016). The mean of the treatment group for leg 3 (0.1906) was higher than the mean of the control group (0.2362). Calcium did not have a significant effect on the strength of muscle contraction (t stat= 0.97 df=2 p=0.42).

Introduction:
The neuromuscular junction is a kind of synapse that forms between skeletal muscle fibers and motor neurons [Wu 2010]. Neuromuscular junctions make up the neuromuscular system that allows for movement through muscle contractions. A muscle contraction is produced when an action potential travels to the presynaptic cleft of a motor neuron and opens voltage gated calcium channels [Johnson 2018]. Calcium is responsible for molecular responses such as neurotransmitter release [Nurullin: 2012]. Calcium enters the presynaptic cell and is the determinant of the amount of neurotransmitter released by binding to vesicles containing acetylcholine [Dodge:1967]. The vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Acetylcholine binds to ligand gated channels and causes sodium ions to depolarize the postsynaptic cell, resulting in a muscle contraction [Johnson: 2018].  The more calcium released, the more neurotransmitter released and the higher the amplitude of the muscle contraction [Dodge:1967]. This experiment addresses the question of what happens to the strength of a muscle contraction when calcium is blocked. We hypothesized that if calcium was blocked, the strength of the muscle contraction would decrease because less calcium being released would mean that less acetylcholine was being released.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were harvested and brought into the lab. The legs were each skinned and cut so that the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle were exposed. Next, the leg was connected to a transducer to measure the force of muscle contraction.  To test the effect of calcium blocker on the strength of muscle contractions, the sciatic nerve was connected to electrodes and was stimulated at 0, 0.5, 1, 3, and 5 voltages. The force of the muscle contraction was recorded. To test the treatment (calcium blocker), the same leg was injected with 0.2 mL of lanthanum chloride. To let the lanthanum chloride soak in, we waited for 8 minutes before stimulating the leg at 0, 0.5, 1,3, and 5 voltages. The new strength of the muscle contractions was recorded. We repeated this process for each leg and analyzed our results using a one tailed paired t test.

Results:
The mean of the control test for leg 1 was 1.0634 and the mean of the treatment test for leg 1 was 0.052. The mean of the control test for leg 2 was 0.039. The mean of the treatment test for leg 2 was 0.016. The mean of the control test for leg 3 was 0.1906 while the mean of the treatment test for leg 3 was 0.2362. These means were compared using a paired t test which resulted in a P value of 0.42 (t stat= 0.97 df=2 p=0.42). The first two legs had lower responses to electrical stimulation after being given lanthanum chloride. The means of the treatment groups were lower than the means of the control groups. However, leg 3 had a higher response after being given the dose of lanthanum chloride. The mean of the treatment group was much higher than the mean of the control group. Figure 1 shows the frog leg’s response to electrical stimulation before (control) and after (treatment) being given lanthanum chloride.

Discussion:
The mean weight of the treatment group for legs 1 and 2 are smaller than the means of the control group suggesting that the implementation of a calcium blocker has an effect on the strength of muscle contractions by not allowing the vesicles containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and be released into the synaptic cleft. This is not shown by the results of our paired t test. Because of our large p value, our results are not statistically significant. This suggests that there is not a difference between the control and treatment groups. This could be due to our sample size, inconsistency of the tension on the thread holding the leg up, the voltages we chose to use to stimulate the leg, the concentration of lanthanum chloride, our inexperience with injecting muscle with a syringe, or the third leg having a higher mean for treatment than for control. If we were to throw out the results of the third leg, we would still get a get a large p value, which suggests that there is not a significant difference between the control and treatment groups, thus disproving our hypothesis. To further test our hypothesis, we would need more legs and a stronger concentration of lanthanum chloride. We could also test more data points by exciting the nerve at smaller intervals of electrical stimulation. In a similar study, scientists used patch clamps to record synaptic currents on the muscle fibers of crayfish after giving them different concentrations of calcium. When the concentration of calcium was cut in half, the amplitude of muscle contractions decreased more than was proportional to the concentration of calcium [Dudel: 1981]. Also, when there was less calcium, the muscle contractions were found to be “slightly shorter” [Dudel:1981]. This study shows the important role calcium plays in muscle contractions and that if there is not enough calcium, muscle contractions either cannot occur or will be smaller. This is important as it shows how those with calcium deficiency have pain in their muscles and feel fatigued because they have to work harder to get their muscles to contract.
