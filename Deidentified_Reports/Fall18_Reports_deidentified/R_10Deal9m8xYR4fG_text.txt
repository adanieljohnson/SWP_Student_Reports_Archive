Title: Hunger driven aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins – commonly known as betta fish – are known to display agnostic behaviors towards intruding fish. These behaviors come in a wide variety of forms, such as broadside movements and pelvic fin flashing. This experiment focuses on how Betta fish react to intruders when they are starved of food and energy, hypothesizing that the fish would be less likely to display agnostic behaviors when they lack food as a resource. To test this hypothesis, we observed the behaviors of five different betta fish before and after being fed. After running the experiment and analyzing the data with a 2-tailed paired t_test, we found that the mean number of aggressive behaviors of starved Betta fish were not significently different than Betta fish that had been fed. However, these results did not appear to be conclusive since levels of aggression appeared to vary from fish to fish, and we were confined to a small sample size. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish or betta fish, are a tropical species of fish that are now well known for their use as household pets. Over the years, betta fish have been popularized due to their variety of vibrant colors. Furthermore, Betta splendins is a territorial species with a known fixed action pattern: when a Betta fish’s territory is threatened, it will display agnostic behaviors towards the intruder. [Simpson: 1968],[Klopfer: 1990] Examples of these agnostic behaviors include broadside movements, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. However, some studies have shown that these behaviors may be a means of transmitting information to surrounding fish. [Doutrelant: 2001] This experiment focuses on how Betta spelndens display aggressive behaviors towards encroaching fish based on hunger. We hypothesize that if a betta fish is starved of food, it will be less likely to display agnostic behaviors towards intruders since it will have less energy. Therefore, the fish will choose not to display aggressive behaviors, as it would be an extra expenditure of a resource that has been limited. 


Materials and Method:
For the experiment setup, I used a glass fish tank that was divided into three sections using transparent glass panels. One betta fish was then placed in each of the two outer sections of the tank to serve as controlls. Then, five separate fish that were starved of food were sequentially placed in the middle section of the tank, where it was able to see and interact with one of the controll fish. Only one controll fish was displayed the experimental fish at a time. The experimental fish’s response and actions were then recorded for three minutes. After I had recorded all the responses of the starved fish, each fish was fed and given a 10 minute period of rest. Once the 10 minute rest period was complete, the fish were sequentially added to the middle section of the tank, and their responses recorded. A 2-tailed paired T-test was used to compare the levels of aggression in the fish before and after they had been fed. 


Results:
The data shown in Figure 1 suggests that starved Beta fish may display more aggressive behaviors than Betta fish that have been fed. The mean number of aggressive behaviors for the starved Betta splendins was 5.4, while the mean number of aggressive behaviors in fed Betta splendins was 2.4. However, is it worth note that there was one fish that appeared to be an outlier since it displayed high levels of aggression both before and after being fed. This, in turn, led to a high standard error for both groups, as the outlier’s level of aggression was much higher than any of the other fish. This can be seen in Figure 1, as the standard error bar for the “Fed” group reaches negative values. However, even after excluding this fish as an outlier, our hypothesis was still not supported. The results of a 2-tailed paired T-test proved that the mean number of aggressive behaviors between fed and unfed Betta splendins were not statistically significent (t-value=2.91, d.f.=3, p_value=0.062). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis that starved Betta splendins will display less agnostic behaviors than fed Betta splendins was not supported. Although the fish appeared to display less aggressive behaviors, the results of a paired t_test proved that these results were not statistically significent. However, this may be due to our extremely low sample size. In the future, this experiment may yield statistically significent results if there were more fish to work with. Additionally, this experiment may have yielded better results had we given the fish a larger break time to eat and digest the food they were provided in between observations. However, betta fish are no longer bred for their aggression, so their agnostic behaviors may have been reduced over time. [Brannan: 2015]
Moreover, since Betta fish are currently being selected for their morph, rather than their ability to fight, this may lead to an overall decrease in aggression among Betta splendins. [Lucas: 1968]
