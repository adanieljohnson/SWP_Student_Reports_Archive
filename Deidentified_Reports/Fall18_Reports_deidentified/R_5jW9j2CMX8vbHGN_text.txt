Title: Effects of Herbivory on Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) Root:Shoot Ratio 

Abstract:
Competitiveness is fundamental in the natural world, especially among plant species who must compete with both biotic and abiotic factors in order to obtain the necessary resources for survival. Expressing certain phenotypical characteristics in order to thrive is common among plants, especially through changes in their root-to-shoot ratios. Specifically, herbivory is a common biotic factor that plants must compete with in order to survive as insects commonly target plants for nutrition. These ideas were the center of study in this experiment through the use of the buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plant species. It was hypothesized that the plant would experience a decrease in R:S ratio in order to accommodate for the loss of leaf area/photosynthetic activity. In order to test this hypothesis, a control group, which included five buckwheat plants was grown in pots it they received water and sunlight every-day for two weeks and did not experience herbivory. After the two-weeks, the plants were removed from their pots, massed and measured so that their R:S ratios could be calculated in terms of mass and length. The experimental group was treated the same as the control group with the added variable that it had its leaves clipped during the second week of the experiment in order to 

Introduction:
Plants are often competing in nature for the valuable resources that they need in order to thrive. With regards to competition, these organisms often compete with both biotic and abiotic factors. These organisms then express phenotypic characteristics in order to adhere to their environmental conditions and continue to thrive [Strauss: 1999]. Root to shoot ratio is one of these examples as plants shift resources to either their roots or shoots in order to combat difficult environments and competition [Jing: 2015]. Biomass can be used to measure this ratio and determine how a species has allocated resources in order to account for difficulties and ultimately, thrive [Jing: 2015]. More specifically, this experiment explores the idea of herbivory—the eating of plants, especially those living. In order to study this topic, the experiment utilizes the buckwheat species (Fagopyrum esculentu) as the species is known widely for attracting wildlife as a source of nutrition [Peschiutta: 2018]. This research is based on this insect behavior and tests how a plant species can accommodate for this competing biotic variable (herbivory) by allocating resources in specific locations and therefore, causing shifts in root-to-shoot ratio. Two studies suggest that the buckwheat species has accounted for herbivory by developing mechanisms, where the plant allocates more resources in its shoots in order account for loss in leaf area. Ultimately, this research suggests that these mechanisms has allowed the species to combat this behavior and coevolve with insects. The articles explain the significant changes that biotic factors like herbivory can have on plant species, especially with regards to R:S ratio (considering that this is one of the most effective mechanisms utilized by plants with regards to adapting to a challenging environment) [Jing: 2015 ] [Strauss: 1999]. Exploring this topic can aid in understanding how plants can utilize changes in root-to-shoot ratio in order to accommodate for biotic variables like this and others like it. Studying shifts in root-to-shoot ratio of the plant while it is experiencing herbivory could aid in answering how the plant accommodates for the insect behavior. In this experiment, it is expected that plants that experience the effects of herbivory will accommodate for such conditions but shifting resources to their shoots to offset loss in leaf area. It is hypothesized that buckwheat plants exposed to herbivory will have a lower root-to-shoot ratio than buckwheat plants not exposed to herbivory. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the experiment, we planted a total of 10 plants by embedding seeds into separate trays filled with soil. Five plants were designated to serve as the control, while the other five served as the experimental. Plants were placed in sunlight and watered every day for two weeks. The experimental group also experienced an added variable as its leaves were clipped in order to simulate the herbivory factor, which the control group did not experience. After two weeks, both the control and the experimental groups (each plant containing five plants) were harvested by being carefully pulled with adherent medium out of each tray. Each plant was broken at the vermiculite in order to separate the roots. Each whole plant from both the control and experimental group was then weighed. The roots were then separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction. Each shoot was then weighed. From here, the root mass of each was calculated and recorded by subtracting the shoot mass from the total mass of each whole plant. The maximum shoot and root length for each plant was then measured and recorded to the nearest millimeter. After calculating this data, the root to shoot ratio was calculated for both mass and length for each plant from both the control and the experimental group by dividing the root mass/length by the shoot mass/length. The averages for root mass, root length, and R:S mass/length were then recorded for both control and experimental groups.  Root to shoot ratios were calculated in order to observe the significant differences in the means of our control and experimental groups with the use of a one-tailed, two sample t-test.


Results:
After conducting the experiment, the experimental group yielded a higher R:S ratio mean in terms of mass (0.26 ± 0.06) than the control (0.28 ± 0.17), which are differences that are not significant (t-stat= 0.37, df= 30, P= 0.35)(figure 1). In terms of length, the control group produced a higher R:S ratio mean (0.83 ± 0.26) than the experimental group (0.97±0.21), which are differences that are not significant (t-stat=0.07, df=30, t-value=1.45)(figure 2). 


Discussion:
These data suggest that the experiment did not support my hypothesis. There is no significant difference between the means of the experimental and control groups. It has been observed that herbivory did not affect R:S ratio in my experiment. Reviewing findings from figure 1, the red bar (experimental) indicates that this group experienced a higher R:S ratio as opposed to the control group (represented in blue) (figure 1). In terms of length, represented by figure 2, the experimental group (red) did experience a lower R:S ratio as opposed to the control group (blue), however, these differences in R:S were not significant because they are small (figure 2).  Interpreting results from figure 1, it is likely that instead of decreasing R:S ratio, the species was able to increase R:S ratio in order to accommodate for the effects of herbivory. For example, aside from their shoots, plants also acquire valuable resources through their roots. It is likely that the plant was able to extract resources from the soil in order to offset the loss of resources instead of allocating resources to its shoots in order to offset the loss in leaf area. These ideas are the focus of study in two scientific articles, where researchers explore the idea that the buckwheat species is able to allocate resources to its roots in order to accommodate for the loss in resources that could have been obtained by the plant had it not loss leaf-area due to herbivory [Peschiutta: 2018][Yu-Ling: 2018]. However, interpreting results from both figures, it is likely that the plants from both groups were limited to the amount of resources available to them in the small pots that they were grown in, which could explain why they were not able to allocate many resources to either their roots or shoots—resulting in little difference between the means of the two groups in terms of both mass and length [Erb:2018]. It is also likely that the simulated version of herbivory used in this experiment (clipping of leaves) did not match well with the natural herbivory that plants experience in nature. It is likely that in natural conditions, herbivory is more intense as insects eat a higher amount of leaf area. The increased loss of leaf area caused by insects in natural conditions could lead to a significant shift in R:S ratio as the plant attempts to offset the loss of leaf area/photosynthetic activity. Conducting this experiment again with a significant increase in herbivore activity could help explore this idea. Also, giving the plants more resources to allocate to certain parts of its structure could lead to higher differences among average R:S ratios. Considering these changes and also testing this idea on different species of plants could help explore how variations of species respond to these sorts of pressing biotic factors in nature.
