Title: The Effects of Hormones On Manducas

Abstract:
My group hypothesized that tobacco hornworms (manduca sexta), would have a greater increase in size if given juvenile hormones. To test this, eight manducas were divided into two groups. One group was the controll, not given any hormones. The latter group was given the juvenile hormones, which was mixed into their food. 

Introduction:
Hormones have the ability to affect the growth of insects. Despite working slowly, these chemical messengers have a significent impact on the behavior of organisms. For example, one of the earliest studies of insect growth regulators demonstrated that linden bugs failed to hatch into adults. While accidental, this still demonstrated that IGRs result in abnormalities that reduce the survival of insects. Our experiment, on the other hand, involves the effect of juvenile hormones on caterpillars. We speculate that the addition of juvenile hormones will increase their weight, in contrast to a controll group without added hormones. 

Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were divided into two groups of four, each group in separate containers with four compartments each. The first group was the controll, which was not given additional hormones. The second group had added juvenile hormones, which was mixed into their food. Each day, we measured the weight of all eight caterpillars, while simultaneously comparing the two groups in sizes. While they were each given 10 grams of food individually, the second group had added hormones. 

Results:
In the first three days, both groups maintained a relative constant in size. Towards the middle of the week, both groups began to grow. By the end of the first week, the controll group had a greater average weight than the hormone group. However, by the tenth day, the hormonal group and the controll group were both at approximately ten ounces. The following days saw the hormone group outpace the growth of the controll group. Both groups then experienced a decline until the end of the experiment. by the end, the controll group averaged ten ounces, while the experiment group weighed 13.8 ounces. These results were evaluated by the T-Test, which measures the distribution of two different sets of data.  

Discussion:
Upon examining the results, it seems that the hormones did not initially appear to create a noticeable difference between the two groups. By the conclusion of the seventh day, the hormones even seemed to be a deterrent to potential growth, as the controll group was outpacing the experimental group. Eventually, this trend reversed, as the experimental group surpassed the controll group after the tenth day and held the lead in average weight for the remainder of the experiment. This could be due to an excess of hormones applied to the experimental group at the commencement of the experiment, or just a slow reaction time. The hormones ultimately proved to assist the manducas in growing faster than average.
