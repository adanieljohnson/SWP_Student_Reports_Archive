Title: Simulated herbivory affects resource allocation and root-to-shoot ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
The effect of herbivory on resource allocation in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum), as manifested in the root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) of length and weight, was studied in this experiment.  It was hypothesized that herbivory would lead to a higher R:S for both length and weight.  Two groups of radish plants, each consisting of four pots with seeds planted in vermiculite, were grown in a greenhouse under similar conditions, with one group receiving simulated herbivory.  Herbivory was simulated by using a Phillips head screwdriver to perforate the leaves.  The R:S was calculated separately for the weights and lengths of the roots and shoots.  It was observed that the average R:S length was higher in controls than in the group experiencing herbivory, while the average R:S weight was higher in the test group than in the control.  The data for length were found to be statistically significant; however, the data for weight were not statistically significant.  Our hypothesis was not confirmed, but our observation that R:S for length was higher in controls suggests that further research should be conducted on the effects of herbivory on length.

Introduction:
Herbivory is one of the biggest threats to crop production.  Each year, billions of dollars are lost due to herbivorous pests, such as deer, rabbits, and various insects.  One plant that could be affected by herbivory, the radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), is an important food crop.  Radishes were chosen as a model organism because of the ease of growing them in the laboratory and because of their relatively large leaves.  The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether herbivory affects resource allocation, here measured as root-to-shoot ratio (R:S), and phenotypic plasticity.  Root-to-shoot ratio is usually defined as the ratio of the weight of the roots to the weight of the shoots [Harris: 1992].  R:S can be used as a metric for resource allocation, as it shows to what degree the plant allocates its resources to the roots and shoots respectively.  A higher R:S is usually considered not ideal, and is associated with decreased health, although most trees have a high R:S [Harris: 1992], and do not appear to suffer from that.  Simulated herbivory has been shown to have deleterious effects on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. nevadensis), leading to an increased R:S [Hódar: 2008].   Here the effect of herbivory on resource allocation was studied by simulating herbivory on radish plants.  It is important to study herbivory in crop plants, including radishes, because of the economic implications of crop loss.   It was hypothesized that simulated herbivory to the leaves would lead to a higher R:S, as plants would need to compensate for the loss of function in leaves.

Materials and Methods:
Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) seeds were soaked in water for 30 minutes.  While seeds were soaking, eight pots of vermiculite were prepared, four labeled “herbivory” and four labeled “control.”  After 30 minutes of soaking the seeds, each pot was planted with 10 seeds to ensure that each pot would contain a few plants.  All pots were then watered thoroughly.  The plants were then grown in a greenhouse for two weeks. Throughout this period, they were watered regularly, and a Phillips head screwdriver was used to create holes in the leaves, in order to simulate herbivory.  After growing for two weeks, 3 plants from each pot were taken.  Roots were measured from root-shoot junction to the tips; this was recorded, along with the length from root-shoot junction.  Root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) was calculated for length using these data.  Following this, the plants were separated at the root-shoot junction; the shoots of all three were weighed together and recorded, as were the roots, and R:S calculated.  This was repeated four times for the control group, and four times for the test group experiencing herbivory.  The data were analyzed using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test to determine whether they were significant.

Results:
The average R:S weight for controls was 2.16; for test 2.75 (Figure 1).  Average R:S length was 2.66 for controls and 3.39 for test (Figure 2).  This indicates that R:S weight was observed to increase with simulated herbivory and that R:S length was observed to decrease.  The p-value for R:S length was 0.01, which indicates that the data are statistically significant.  For R:S weight, the p-value was 0.05, which indicates that the data were not statistically significant.

Discussion:
As expected, the average R:S weight for controls was higher than that of the test group.  This is consistent with prior research on herbivory and resource allocation in Scots pine [Hódar: 2008].  However, the data were found to be not statistically significant, so it cannot be confirmed that simulated herbivory indeed does result in an increased R:S weight, rather than the results being due to chance.  As such, further research may elect to increase the sample size or increase the amount of time the plants are allowed to grow (and thus the time the test group is subjected to herbivory).  Plants growing in an atmosphere with higher CO2 levels have been found to have a higher R:S [Rogers: 1996]; we did not take into consideration the level of CO2 in the greenhouse, which may have had an effect on the R:S of the plants.  An interesting finding was that the R:S length for controls was higher than that of test subjects.  This indicates that the roots of the controls were of a higher weight than those of the test group.  This may indicate a need on the part of the plants experiencing herbivory to compensate for leaf tissue; however, it has been found that plants’ ability to compensate for herbage loss from herbivory is more determined by abiotic factors such as availability of sunlight and water than it is by herbivory itself [Hódar: 2008].  It is important to note that R:S is typically defined as the ratio of the weight of the roots to that of the shoots, not the ratio of the length [Harris: 1992].  The negative effects of herbivory are not limited to stunted growth.  Radishes that have experienced herbivory have been shown to become less attractive to pollinators [Lehtilä: 1997]. Further research may be done to determine whether this is related to a need to compensate for herbivory.  It is known that wild radishes experiencing herbivory are less reproductively successful.  However, herbivory has been found to be potentially important in the maintenance of a flower color polymorphism in wild radishes (Raphanus sativus), by countering selection by pollinators of yellow and white flowers at the expense of pink and white flowers [Irwin: 2003].  Herbivory may have an important part in preserving genetic diversity in some cases.  Overall, the findings of this experiment neither confirm nor contradict prior research; while the results tended to support our hypothesis that R:S for weight would be higher in plants experiencing herbivory than in controls, the results were found to be statistically not significant, and therefore not useful to support or reject the hypothesis.  The finding that R:S length was higher in controls than in the test group contradicted our hypothesis, but it is entirely possible that herbivory may lead to stunted growth of roots in comparison to shoots, which may result in a higher R:S weight.
