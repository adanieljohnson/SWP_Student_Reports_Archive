Title: The Lack of Effect of Ethanol on Muscle Contraction in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to their internal and external environments. When nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, ACh is released, which then causes a series of effects that end with the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. This causes shortening, otherwise known as muscle contraction. Our study serves to observe the effect of ethanol on the muscle contraction of the Rania pipiens. We predicted that there would be a significent difference between the twitch amplitude of a muscle injected with ethanol compared to a normal muscle. We used three frog legs and recorded the twitch amplitude of the normal muscle at twitch threshold and then again after injecting a 2% ethanol solution. We found no significent difference between the twitch amplitude with and without ethanol (t_stat=0.008, d.f.=4, p_value=0.993.) This lack of significent effect could be a result of the low concentration of ethanol in the solution injected into the muscle.


Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to respond to their different environments. The neuromuscular system responds within milliseconds, unlike the hormonal system, which can take much longer to respond. Myograms are used to capture the amount of force generated by a muscle over a given amount of time. We plan to use myograms to study how ethanol affects muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens, a Northern leopard frog. This organism was a good fit for this experiment because the gastrocnemus muscle is easy to separate and probe, and muscle contractions are clearly visible to the naked eye. A previous study examined the effects of ethanol on mouse skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, focusing on ethanol’s effect on intracellular calcium transients that are responsible for excitation and contraction. It found that ethanol reduces the calcium transients and thus excitation-contraction coupling by inhibiting “sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via voltage-operated Ca2+-channels” [Cofan: 2000.] This study found a decreased amplitude of muscle contraction when treated with an ethanol solution. Another study found that alcohol intoxication before stimulation produces a “transient anabolic resistance within muscle” which could lead to muscle atrophy and long-term diseases [Steiner: 2015.] Although our species is not intaking the alcohol via consumption we believe injecting of ethanol will have a similar effect. We hypothesize that there will be a significent difference in twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle injected with ethanol and a gastrocnemus muscle without it. 


Materials and Method:
We prepared the frog leg for stimulation by pulling the skin at the top of the leg towards the foot using forceps. The leg was moistened with frog Ringer’s solution. We gently separated the inner thigh muscles and freed the sciatic nerve. We then tied the end of the gastrocnemus muscle with thread and hooked it onto the transducer, and probed the muscle with the pins. On LabScribe, we set the Pulse amplitude to 0.000V, the Number of pulses to 1, the Frequency(Hz) to 1, and the Pulse width to 5 ms. Apply a light load to the muscle and record the twitch amplitude. Increase the stimulus amplitude by 0.1V until a clear contraction is recorded to find the twitch threshold. Stimulate that muscle with that amplitude three times, recording the twitch amplitude each time. Average these numbers to find the average twitch amplitude for Control #1. Inject the muscle with 0.2 Ml of 2% ethanol solution, making sure to inject at several different points. Wait 5 minutes after injection to repeat this stimulation process, using the same threshold amplitude. After collecting three twitch amplitudes, average them for Experimental #1. Repeat this entire process on two more frog legs, totalling 3 controll averages and 3 experimental averages. Conduct one two-tailed t_test using the averages of the amplitudes of each leg to compare the experimental values to the controll values.



Results:
Overall, there was no difference between our twitch amplitude averages for the controll legs and the experimental legs. Our Control #1 had an average twitch amplitude 0.572+/-0.0170 V and Experimental #1 average was 0.558+/-0.321 V. Our Control #2 had an average twitch amplitude 0.459+/-0.0087 V and Experimental #2 average was 0.399+/-0.0072 V. Our Control #3 had an average twitch amplitude 0.260+/-0.0195 V and Experimental #3 average was 0.337+/-0.0843 V. When we averaged these averages, we got a final controll average of 0.430+/-0.158V and a final experimental average of 0.431+/-0.114V. Our statistical analysis resulted in 3 sets of values. Leg #1 (t_stat=1.13, d.f.=4, p_value=0.321), Leg #2 (t_stat=9.12, d.f.=4, p_value=0.0008), Leg #3 (t_stat=1.54, d.f.=4, p_value=0.198). Our final statistical analysis yielded (t_stat=0.008, d.f.=4, p_value=0.993.)


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was not supported because our p_value was greater than 0.05 when we averaged all three legs. For Legs #1 and 3 our p_value was well above .05, although #2 was less than 0.05. These results suggest that there is no statistically significent difference in muscle contraction of ethanol-injected frog legs compared to frog legs without ethanol. There are several reasons that could explain why no significent difference was seen. One possible reason would be because of the low concentration of ethanol in the solution we injected into the muscle. The 2000 study found that ethanol reduces the [Ca(2+)](i) transients that cause muscle contraction [Cofan: 2000.] This study of mouse muscle contractions used a solution of higher concentration of ethanol than our 2% solution, which could account for our lack of significent difference. Additionally, injection of the alcohol rather than consumption by the species could have an affect. The 2015 study used mice that consumed ethanol prior to stimulation, which caused less muscle contraction [Steiner: 2015.] A further study could be injecting a muscle with a solution of higher ethanol concentration. These results could be helpful when studying how alcohol affects the human neuromuscular system both immediately and long-term.
