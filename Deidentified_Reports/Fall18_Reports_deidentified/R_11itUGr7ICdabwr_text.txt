Title: The effect of heat shock on Physarum polycephalum migration.

Abstract:
The slime mold Physarum polycephalum shares many signaling pathways with humans, one being the cAMP signaling pathway. This pathway activates calcium-dependent channels to stimulate movement in the slime mold. In this experiment, we analyzed the effects of heat shock on the migration of slime mold when compared to calcium. To do this, we prepared cultures of both and determined the migration of the mold after 25 hours. This study is important, because the results can be used to infer information about signaling in humans, and the effect heat can have on movement in the human cAMP signaling pathway.



Introduction:
In this lab, we explored the signal transduction pathways of Physarum polycephalum. This slime mold has multiple nuclei enclosed in the same plasma membrane, and all undergo mitosis at the same time, essentially acting as one giant cell. This makes it an ideal test subject for experimentation because of its behavior and the fact that it shares many signaling pathways with humans. The pathway being tested in this lab is the cAMP signaling pathway [Johnson 2018]. One study noted that heat shock of Physarum activated the calcium-dependent protein kinase [Maruya 1996]. Our research question focused on the same idea, analyzing the effect of heat on the movement of the Physarum, and whether the addition of heat will mimic the effects of the addition of calcium. The increased temperature of the cultures will activate calcium-dependent channels and thus cAMP concentrations, influencing the cross-linkage of actin filaments and causing overexpression. Thus, adding heat to the cultures will have the same effect as calcium does. It is our hypothesis that heat will increase mobility of the Physarum in the same manner as calcium. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, we obtained and prepare nine water-agar plates, three for the control, three for heat treatment, and three for the calcium treatment. The calcium plates must be prepared by diluting the calcium to a 1M concentration then pouring 10mL of the solution into each plate and letting sit for 10 minutes. For all nine plates, draw a line in permanent marker down the middle of the back of the plate and draw two 1cm squares evenly spaced along. We then labeled the plates with our name and group/lab section and cut out each square using a sterilized metal spatula, taking care to re-sterilize it between uses. Next, we cut 18 1cm squares from the Physarum stock plate, placing the squares into the spaces in the water agar plates, ensuring the slime mold was face up. We tapped out 6-8 oatmeal flakes onto each plate, then taped the lids down and wrapped the plates in foil. After wrapping them in foil, we placed the calcium plates in one black bag, the heat plates in another, and the control plates in a third. The calcium and control plates were put in a drawer and the heat plates were placed in the incubator and left for 24 hours. After 24 hours, we returned to measure the movement of the Physarum on each plate and used a two-tailed t-test to analyze our results.

Results:
The distance travelled was highest in the heat plates, closely followed by the calcium plates, with the control plates having the lowest distance travelled. The heat plates ranged from 11-15mm movement, the calcium plates from 10-15mm, and the control plates from 1.5-15mm. None of the data yielded statistically significant results. We did a two-tailed t-test with a p-value of 0.357 for the calcium plates and 0.287 for the heat plates.

Discussion:
Overall, our data supported our hypothesis given that the movement was the highest in the calcium and heat plates, indicating that the heat mimicked the effects of the calcium. Our data, however, was not statistically significant. One reason for this is that the Physarum polycephalum cultures had a systemic problem causing normal growth to shut down. A study also found that the addition of agar caused alterations to the functioning of the Physarum and with time, its migration and other abilities decreased [Knowles 1978]. Migration of the Physarum polycephalum is necessary to determine success of the hypothesis and determine the significance of the experiment. Thus, our results cannot be conclusively defined as significant or not significant, given the issues with the stock cultures. Assuming, however, that our results are significant, this could provide an explanation to mold growth in warmer environments being faster, but beyond that to human inferences given the similar signal transduction pathways. If humans are in warmer environments, the heat will increase mobility of muscles via the cAMP signal transduction pathway as well, helping explain why it is easier to move in warm weather than in cold.
