Title: The Significant Effect Martin’s IGR has in the Development Rate of the Manduca Sexta Over Time. 

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta caterpillars are dependent on two hormones known as Juvenile Hormone and Prothoracicotropic Hormone used for their growth and development. When there is an imbalance in the Juvenile Hormone, the Manduca Sexta does not to pupate. The lab tested the effect martin’s IGR had on the growth rate of Manduca Sexta. Martin’s IGR was added to the food source of four out of eight Manduca Sextas. It was hypothesized that the addition of Martin’s IGR to their diet would affect the maturing rate of the Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis was supported by the experiment. There was a significant difference between the control group and the experimental group. The experimental Manduca Sexta failed to mature past the fifth instar larval stage. 

Introduction:
The hormones present in the Manduca Sexta that permitted it to molt and pupate are the juvenile hormone, prothoracicotropic hormones, and ecdysteroids. The juvenile hormone works alongside ecdysterone allowing the process of molting to go through. The presence of juvenile hormone in the Manduca Sext does not allowto  it molt, so the amount of juvenile hormone must decrease and the amount of ecdysteroids must increase for molting to occur. Martin’s IGR is serves as an insect growth regulator. IGR’s are can cause abnormalities that do not allow insects to complete  a full life cycle due to the fact that they interrupt biological systems.  There was a study conducted to observe the effect of IGR on pest control, it was hypothesized that the species that relied on Juvenile Hormones for maturing purposes, then become extremely large, and/or produce extra larval, nymphal, or pupal forms [Staal: 1975].  The results showed the Manduca Sexta that had consumed Martin’s IGRto eat large quantities, therofre the Manduca Sextas 
were significantly large [Staal: 1975]. The Manduca Sexta developed at a much faster rate, however they did not molt. The purpose of the experiment is to determine the effect Martin’s IGR would have on the biochemical functions of the Manduca Sexta and how these changes would affect the Manduca Sexta Physically. It is hypothesized that Martin’s IGR will have a significant effect on the maturing rate of Manduca Sexta. This is predicted because the purpose of an IGR is to inhibit the growth development of pests. This means that the experimental group will most likely not pupate.


Materials and Methods:
Eight, 11- 12 day old Manduca Sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups, control and experimental. Each Manduca Sexta caterpillar was placed into their own separate cubicle within their group. Four of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars were fed 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet with 10 drops of water each. The other four Manduca Sexta caterpillars were fed 10 g of GLM diet with 10 drops of Martin’s IGR. All M. Sexta caterpillars were kept in the sam incubator kept at 28°C , in a 12 hours of dark, 12 hours of light cycle. Once a day the M. Sexta caterpillars were measured by weight, length, and observations were recorded. When food had been fully consumed the GLM diet with 10 drops of either water or Martin’s IGR was replaced. 

Results:
General Trends: 
-	The control group’s appearance was different from the experimental group. By the end of the two weeks, the caterpillars had formed orange-brown shells wrapping their bodies.
-	More food had to be replaced and more feces cleaned up in the experimental group.
These caterpillars were a bright green throughout the duration of the experiment, but significantly increased in size.
-	The size of experimental caterpillar 2 was much larger than the rest of the caterpillars despite starting off with as the smallest in both weight and length. This trend can be noticed in Figure 3. 
-	In Figure 3 is Experimental Caterpillar 4 has a small growth value. It had a significant decrease in weight and length and rapidly became the smallest of all the experimental caterpillars. Experimental 4 caterpillar was the only caterpillar to have black mold on its body starting on Day 6.
Summary of Data:
-	In Figure 1, the caterpillars in the control group were found to have lost both weight and the caterpillars in the experimental group were found to have gained weight by the end of the two weeks. 
-	As seen by Figure 2, the caterpillars in the control group lost length and the caterpillars in the experimental group increased length in two weeks. 
-	Figure 3 shows each caterpillar’s growth in weight and length from Day 0 to Day 14. Caterpillar 1 in the control was found to have the largest decrease in weight. Caterpillar 2 in the experimental had the largest growth value in weight and length. Caterpillar 4 in experimental had the smallest growth value in weight and length.
○	Statistical difference: The average weight of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=1.76, df=22, P=0.0915).
○	The average length of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=1.96, df=22, P=0.0623).


Discussion:
○	The hypothesis stated that Martin’s IGR would have an impact on the caterpillars maturing rate. Based on analysis of the data collected from the experiment, it can be concluded that the hypothesis was supported, and the IGR did impact the experimental caterpillars maturing rate.
○	The difference in between the control group and the experimental group could be expressed by several factors. As stated in the hypothesis, the insect growth regular provided to the experimental group could possibly be responsible for preventing the caterpillars from molting and pupating. It mimicked the juvenile hormone typically released during the larvae stages. But, the continuous release did not allow the caterpillars from ever reaching the cocoon stage because the levels did not decrease like they did in the control group.
○	As soon as the control group started to develop their orange and brown shells, or pupating, they stopped consuming food. This explains their drop-in weight and length that occurred around Days 7 and 8. 
○	The fact that Experimental 4 Caterpillar was found to not have a significant weight or length gain by the end of the two weeks could be attributed to the mold surrounding its body. Food was not replaced nearly as often for the caterpillar and it was often thought to be dead. 
○	Based on the results of the two sample T test, giving the caterpillars the growth hormone provided weight and length results that were (not) statistically different from the control group.
