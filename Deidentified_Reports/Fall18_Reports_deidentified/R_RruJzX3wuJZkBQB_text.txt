Title: Unlimited light availability leads to smaller root weight and has inconclusive effect on length in Fagopyrum esculentum Buckwheat Plants

Abstract:
	To improve agricultural practices and adapt to varying landscapes, phenotypic variation among Buckwheat plants, Fagopyrum esculentum, was explored by imposing environmental stimuli. Buckwheat is a major crop in Asia, therefore understanding how it is affected by environmental changes is crucial to agricultural success. By altering the amount of light available to Buckwheat plants, changes in resource allocation can be measured through the root-to-shoot ratio for length and weight. It was expected that the root-to-shoot ratio would be larger for plants with unlimited light compared to plants in natural light because plants with unlimited light would not have to grow their shoots longer to obtain sunlight. This was not observed. The root-to-shoot weight ratio for the unlimited light plants was smaller than that of the natural light plants. This is likely due to the decreased amount of water in the roots because of a higher rate of transpiration. The root-to-shoot length ratio was not significent; therefore, no conclusions can be made. Overall, the data collected was not supportive of the hypothesis as far as weight and was inconclusive as far as length. Further testing would be necessary to strongly support the relationship between environmental changes and phenotypic variation. 

Introduction:
Biotic factors (effects from living organisms) and abiotic factors (effects from non-living sources) contribute to a plant’s fitness, or its ability to contribute alleles to the next generation’s gene pool. Changes in these factors can lead to a modification in resource allocation, and in turn change the phenotype of the plant. Plants can adapt to environmental conditions in order to survive and reproduce, two important components to an organism’s fitness. Most often resource limitations are what trigger these changes, causing the plant to perform a trade-off. An organism only has so much energy and must withdraw in one area to improve in another. For instance, pollen limitation causes resource allocation in perennial plants, and sparks phenotypic variation in seed sizes [Huang: 2017]. 
Plants obtain different resources from different parts. For example, energy is obtained through photosynthesis in the leaves, while nitrogen and phosphorus are obtained by the roots. All of these resources are allocated to the plant for further growth. Thus, by altering the environment, plants may react differently to different resource changes in order to reproduce effectively, stimulating phenotypic plasticity. Changes in phenotype benefit the plant and increase its chance of survival and chance of reproduction. This can be seen in the savannah landscapes of Brazil. By comparing the different abiotic characteristics of two landscapes, researchers concluded that intraspecific organisms in different locations will develop different traits as a result of their respective environmental conditions [de Cássia-Silva: 2017].  
This experiment explores phenotypic variation in plants, specifically how Buckwheat plants are affected by varying levels of light in terms of resource allocation. Buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, is a major grain crop in many Asian countries. In these locations, the amount of sun can vary as the seasons change. Understanding how the plant reacts to longer or shorter amounts of daylight is crucial for agricultural and financial success. It is also cheap, easy to plant, and grows quickly. In doing this experiment, we hope to determine how plants change their resource allocation in response to different levels of light. 
According to a study conducted on the effect light on basil plant growth, varying amounts of light has a major effect on stem length in plants, where shading induces stem elongation [Stagnari: 2018]. The change in resource allocation can be best measured by the root-to-shoot ratio. We expect the root-to-shoot ratio to be larger for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with a varying light source because plants with unlimited light will not have to grow their shoots longer to obtain sunlight. 


Materials and Method:
To begin, we gathered about 250 Buckwheat seeds and 10 soil containers — five for the experimental group and five for the controll group. In each soil container, there were nine holes, with 2 or 3 seeds planted in each hole. By planting more seeds than was required, this ensured that there would be enough surviving plants to carry out the experiment. The controll containers were placed in front of a window and received natural patterns of light and darkness for two weeks. The treatment containers were placed in a “light box” and received constant, or unlimited, light for two weeks. Both the controll and treatment groups were watered daily and kept in the same temperature. After two weeks of growing, the plants were harvested. Four plants from each group were harvested, making sure the roots were intact and had no soil on them. This was done by moving the soil containers into a bucket of water and breaking down the soil from the roots, then patting them dry. For each plant, several measurements were recorded ¬— overall plant weight, root weight, shoot weight, longest root length, and shoot length. All weights were recorded in grams and all lengths were recorded in millimeters. These measurements were used to calculate the root-to-shoot ratio for both length and weight. The root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) was calculating the root value (length or weight) divided by the corresponding shoot value. These ratios were then used in two separate two-sample t_tests, one comparing the weight ratios and one comparing the length ratios between the two groups. Both two-sample t_tests were one-tailed and conducted at the alpha level 0.05 with the degrees of freedom of 6 (Method are adapted from the WFU Biological Principles Laboratory Manual). 

Results:
After growing for two weeks, the required measurements for each group were recorded. The average root-to-shoot weight ratio for the natural light plants was much greater than that of the unlimited light plants (0.0559 mm ± 0.02588 unlimited light, 0.1493 mm ± 0.0276 natural light) as shown in Figure 1. In contrast, the average root-to-shoot length ratio was very close for two groups (0.43306 mm ± 0.1263 unlimited light, 0.4386 mm ± 0.0673 – natural light), as shown in Figure 2. 
Two separate two-sample t_tests were conducted, one comparing weight and one comparing length. The weight t_test showed the data was significent (t=4.935, d.f.=6, p=0.001308), while the length t_test was not significent t=0.0776, d.f.=6, p=0.470335).


Discussion:
It was predicted that the root-to-shoot ratio for both weight and length would be larger for the plants placed in the unlimited light because these plants would not need to grow to get more sunlight access. After analyzing the statistical test data, we cannot support our hypothesis. 	
The root-to-shoot weight ratios showed the opposite of what we expected, where the mean root-to-shoot weight ratio for the unlimited light plants was actually much smaller than that of the natural light plants. A smaller root-to-shoot weight ratio indicates that the roots weighed less compared to plants with a large root-to-shoot ratio.
 In both the natural light and unlimited light plants, there was an adequate amount of light for the plants to survive. This means the varying amount of light was not causing the trade-off observed through the root-to-shoot weight ratios. An alternative explanation for the difference in weight ratio is transpiration and the amount of water in the roots. In a study conducted on potato plants, leaves that were exposed to more light had an increased rate of transpiration [Ku: 1977]. On the surface of leaves, stomata (small pores) allow water and gases to enter and exit the plants. Because carbon dioxide moves in and oxygen leaves through the stomata, photosynthesis is regulated by the opening and closing of these pores. Therefore, in an unlimited light environment, more photosynthesis would occur, keeping the stomata open. When the stomata are open, transpiration occurs, and water is lost. This would cause a lack of water in the roots at any given time, and thus a smaller root-to-shoot ratio. 
Alternatively, plants placed in natural light would have a lower rate of transpiration, and thus have more water in the roots. This would make the roots heavier, causing a larger root-to-shoot ratio. 
Unlike the weight ratios, the difference in root-to-shoot length ratios was not statistically significent. Therefore, no conclusions can be made regarding the root-to-shoot length ratios. 
	Overall, half of the collected data did not support our hypothesis, and half was not significent. The root-to-shoot ratio is a measure of resource allocation when resources are limited. It was expected that the unlimited light group would distribute resources more evenly due to no lack of light, resulting in a large root-to-shoot ratio. However, the unlimited light groups lacked water, resulting in a smaller root weight. 
	There are several limitations to this study. The amount of water given to the plants during the two-week growing period was not measured or recorded. Although the plants received roughly the same amount, it was not precise and could have affected the data. There were most likely measuring inaccuracies in the weight and length recording. The most important limitation is that of sample size. Only four plants were used from each group and most certainly do not represent the entirety of the Buckwheat plant population. 
	In terms of our hypothesis, the data collected was not supportive. In the future, it would be beneficial to conduct this experiment again, but focus on water movement rather than stem growth. From this study, we can take away that at a certain point, too much light might be detrimental to plants in terms of how much water is available. Further studies might test to determine the threshold for amount of light, where once it is reached, plants do not need to allocate resources. Understanding this is important in order to know how much agricultural businesses should water their plants when light conditions vary.
