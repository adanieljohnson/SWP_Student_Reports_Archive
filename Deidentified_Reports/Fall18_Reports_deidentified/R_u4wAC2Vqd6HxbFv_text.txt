Title: The negative effects of Precor on the development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The growth and development of the Manduca sexta is controlled mainly by the concentrations of the hormones Juvenile Hormone and Ecdysteroids. Juvenile hormone has a large impact on the Manduca sexta’s ability to molt, and is found in decreasing concentrations as the animals develops and matures. This experiment used Precor, which mimics the effects of Juvenile hormone, to increase the concentration of the hormone in the Manduca sexta with the intention of determining how it would effect development and growth. After a period of two weeks group of Manduca sexta treated with Precor did not molt while the control group treated with water did. While the control group started to to molt, the treatment group continued to grow. This leads us to believe that increased concentrations of Precor prevented the treatment group from going through molting and caused them to continue to grow while the control group did not, which supported our hypothesis. This shows the important and significance of the concentration of Juvenile hormone when it comes to the development of the Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta or Tobacco Hornworm, goes through several different phases of development, including larvae, pupa, and adult. The growth and development of the Manduca sexta through these phases is dependent up on the concentration of two main hormones [Baker: 1987]. These hormones are called Juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids. Ecdysteroids help to regulate the timing of molting in the Manduca sexta [Baker: 1987]. Juvenile hormone impacts the development of the Manduca sexta by controlling what type of molting the animal goes through [Baker: 1987]. As the Manduca sexta goes through different phases of life it requires different varieties of molting. Ecdysteroids and Juvenile hormone work together to determine how and when the Manduca sexta grows. Differences and shifts in their concentration lead to changes in the Manduca sexta [Baker: 1987]. This is especially true of the Juvenile hormone. As the Manduca sexta goes through different molts, the levels of Juvenile hormone decrease in varying degrees [Baker: 1987]. As the Manduca sexta continues to develop, Juvenile hormone is found in constantly decreasing concentrations [Baker: 1987]. We were curious how the development of the Manduca sexta would be effected if concentration of Juvenile hormone did not drop off. In order to answer this question we would need to expose Manduca sexta to increased amounts of Juvenile hormone. This experiment used Precor, which mimics of the effects of Juvenile hormone, in increased quantities with the goal of testing how it would effect development in the Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that if the Manduca sexta is exposed to increased levels of Juvenile hormone it will effect their ability to move on to the next phase of development. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta in the larval stage of development were divided into two groups, a control group and a treatment group. Both groups were put in plastic, four cells containers, and holes were poked in the side of each cell to allow for air flow. The containers were labeled “control” and “treatment” and each cell was given a number, 1-4 respectively. Initial weights (in grams) and lengths (in millimeters) were taken for each of the Manduca Sexta . Ten grams of Manduca Sexta food were then weighed out for each of the Manduca Sexta. The treatment group had five drops of the hormone Precor from a pipet in each ten gram portion of food. The control group of five drops of water in each portion. The two containers were then placed in an incubator. The Manduca Sexta were weighed and measured each day for fourteen days. Food was replaced as needed with correct quantities of Precor and water being added to each portion. Two Two Tailed T-Tests were used for this experiment. One compared the  average weight of the control group with the average weight of the treatment group while the other compared the average length of the treatment group with the average length of the control group.

Results:
At the beginning of the experiment, the means per day of both weight and length were larger in the control group. The control group grew to be consistently heavier and longer than the treatment group over the first eight days (Fig.1) (Figure.2). This trend was very clear on the eighth day when the control group was on average 1.5 grams heavier than the average weight of the  of the treatment group (Fig.1). On Day Eight the average length of the control group was 4.75 mm longer than that of the control group (Fig.2). However after Day Eight this tend began to change. The average weights and lengths of the control group began to decrease while the average weights and lengths of the treatment group continued to rise (Fig.1)(Fig.2). The standard deviation in weight for the control group was 2.657 while the standard deviation in weight for the treatment was 3.954. The standard deviation in length for the control group was 13.394 while the standard deviation in weight for the treatment was 16.983. Two two sampled T-Tests were used to analyze the results. The mean of the length control group was not statistically different different than that of the length experimental group (t-stat = 0.4538, df = 22, P = 0.65443). The mean of the weight control group was also not statistically different than that of the weight experimental group (t-stat = 0.6645, df= 22, P = 0.5131). There was a clear visible difference in the control and treatment groups. On Day Five the treatment group was noticeably much more pale than the control group. On Day Fourteen three of the control group Manduca Sexta were molting and one was brown in color, while the treatment group was still green.


Discussion:
The results observational of our experiment, while the statistical results did not. The use of precor seemed to have a noticeable effect on the development of the Manduca Sexta. This can be seen in the fact that the treatment group did not molt while the control group did. The treatment group also continued to grow when the control group began to decrease in size and go through molting(Fig.1)(Fig.2). We believe that this was due to the increased concentration of precor. It prevented the Manduca Sexta from molting into the next stage of development, which caused them to continue to grow while the control group began to go through a molt. This supports the theory that the concentration of Juvenile hormone has an effect on the Manduca Sexta’s ability to molt [Baker:1987]. Due to the nature of growth between the treatment and control group, the results of the Two Tailed T-Tests did support our hypothesis. The p-values of both tests were fairly high, indicating that there was no significant difference between the control and treatment groups. This is because the total means of the two groups were fairly similar for both weight and height, because originally the control grew faster. Later on in the experiment the treatment continued to grow while the control did not. This offset the statistical difference in weight and length between the two groups. The next logical step of study for the experiment would be to test the same hypothesis using identical procedures. This would help to verify if the differences in molting between the control and treatment groups was due to the use of Precor. Using ten Manduca Sexta per group instead of four would make the results and the experiment itself more reliable.
