Title: Inhibition and Activation of Protein Kinase A in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Signal transduction pathways are a vital process to living cells. Their communication, ability to obtain nutrients, and replicate are all induced through these pathways. An example that illustrates these pathways can be seen in Physarum polycephalum. This unicellular, multinucleated organism uses a variety of pathways to locate and obtain nutrients, one of them being the G-coupled protein linked pathway. Our experiment aims to look at the activation and inhibition of a second messenger in this pathway, Protein Kinase A, compared to a controll sample. To do so, we obtained nine, 2% water agar plates with a block of physarum and added in Dibutryl cAMP to three plates labeled activation, added curcumin to three plates labeled inhibition, and left the remaining three plates to be our controll. We hypothesize that the activator, Dibutryl cAMP, would have shown the most growth and the curcumin would have showed the least growth. After viewing the results, we unfortunately yielded no conclusive data as no plates showed any growth. If we had results, a two-sample t test would have been used to determine statistical significance. The reasoning for this was due to the faulty physarum culture, however, further conclusions can be made based on external research studies. 


Introduction:
Cell communication is vital to completing the microscopic processes that allow a cell to develop, make proteins, replicate, and obtain nutrients. These are all done through signal transduction pathways. How these pathways work first involves a ligand, or a small binding molecule, that induces a conformational change on a specific integral membrane protein. This conformation causes a series of events that eventually produce a second messenger. This can activate continual, subsequent second messengers. The phosphorylation cascade produced from this is continued until the desired protein or transcription factor becomes activated that causes the actual response in the cell [Wallace: 1995]. An example that highlights these signaling pathways is Physarum polycephalum, as it uses signals to recognize its environment and respond to stimuli that impact its ability to obtain nutrients and survive. 
It is known that physarum use the fastest most accessible pathways possible to locate nutrients. These aspects can be manipulated to a microscopic scale that can be digitally analyzed through both physics and software to create maps, understand movement, and visualize the most efficient way to get from point A to point B. A separate study helps illustrate the versatility and mobility of physarum. In this experiment, P. polycephalum was used to map out Roman roads that were actually made in the Balkans during the 4th Century BC [Evangelidis: 2017]. The petri dishes that were plated with the physarum were accurate to the topography and landscapes that were present during this time period in this region. The results were used to get a better understanding of how geographically the once most powerful empire was able to transport and locate goods, people and create further roads around Rome [Evangelidis: 2017]. The physarum in this study showed to use the same principles of movement and cell signaling that was observed in the experiment that we conducted. 
One of the physical properties that allow physarum to do move towards or away stimuli can be generalized as chemotaxis [Alder: 1974]. This allows the multinucleated, single cell to adapt and respond to chemical stimuli in its environment. Two specific pathways that are used by physarum are G-protein coupled and IP3-mediated pathways. A key difference between the two pathways is the second messenger used in the phosphorylation cascade portion of the pathway. In IP3-mediated, that protein is Protein Kinase C, in the G-coupled pathway, it is Protein Kinase A (PKA) [Karl: 2004]. This experiment aims to observe and analyze the effects of added inhibition or activation that directly impacts Protein Kinase A. This specificity was done to ensure that we are testing only the G-coupled pathway rather than adding in a variety of chemicals that activate or inhibit a number of pathways: yielding inconclusive results about what actually happened in the physarum. To do this, we added Dibutryl cAMP to activate PKA and curcumin to inhibit it [Kong: 1993]. We can visually measure the results by looking at the growth of the physarum towards food with the activator, the inhibitor, and the controll. We can then compare all three of them to conclude which petri dish had the most growth. Understanding that the Dibutryl cAMP would allow the physarum to be more susceptible to a stimulus and a response because they have activated PKA. From here, we hypothesize that the petri dishes with the Dibutryl cAMP will have the most growth of physarum and the petri dishes that contain curcumin will have the least growth. 


Materials and Method:
Nine, 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water were obtained. These plates were labeled on the back with the name and the date. On the back, the patterns of 2cm by 2cm squares were drawn and then labeled each with the respective chemical compound tested. The name of the activator in the space “+ Dibutryl cAMP” was written on the three activation plates. On the other three plates, the name of the inhibitor used, “+ curcumin” was written on the back. Next, all nine plates were turned over, lid up. We then spread three water agar plates with 5Ml Dibutryl cAMP and spread three water agar plates with 5Ml curcumin. The remaining three water agar plates were used as a controll and did not have any chemical spread on them. The spatula was sterilized and cooled, then used to cut one, 2cm x 2cm square into the agar in each of the nine water agar plates. The block of agar was removed and we added the 2cm x 2cm block of physarum culture to each plate. Proper sterilization was ensured during this process by washing with ethanol and drying off prior to cutting out the squares. Eight oats were placed on each plate, four on the left 3.5cm away and four on the right 3.5cm away from the physarum block. The lid of each plate was tapped down to hold it in place. Finally, all nine plates were put into a dark bag and placed into the lab drawer overnight (18-24 hours).
Method for Scoring plates:
The nine plates from the dark were removed and taken out of the bag. The tape was left on the lids, initially. A millimeter ruler was used to measure the distance that the slime mold migrated from the initial blocks added to the oats 3.5cm away.  All of the data was recorded in our lab notebook. After completion, all plates were thrown away that have been finished scoring, or no longer needed for stock plates.


Results:
Unfortunately, there is no data to interpret or analyze further, however, if we had results, it would be predicted to be the Dibutryl cAMP plates having the most growth and curcumin having the least amount of growth. Because we were testing 2 groups compared to the controll, we would have used a two-sample t_test for our statistical analysis. This test would have allowed us to determine significance between our 2 data points in relation to the controll. The controll group would have also been used for visual conformation of what normal growth would have looked like under standard conditions. The graph below depicts our theoretical yields if our experiment had shown results with the error bars indicating standard deviation.


Discussion:
Our experiment unfortunately yielded no actual results. The physarum showed no growth in any of the plates for any of the lab groups. The expected results would have shown discussable results: the petri dishes with Dibutryl cAMP would have showed more growth than the petri dishes with curcumin. These results were thought to come from the Dibutryl cAMP acting as an activator of Protein Kinase A, which would allow the cell to be more receptive to signals in its environment [Kong: 1993]. In this case, the signal was used to find food and grow throughout the petri dish and its environment consisted of two different chemical concentrations. Theoretically, the cell should have showed growth with these results. Unfortunately, we did not observe any growth in any of our dishes, implying there was a problem with the physarum itself. However, there are applicable concepts we examined that are relevant to our study and to other experiments. 
	The reasoning behind the lack of growth of the physarum could be a simple problem or either a complex issue that was beyond the scope of our experiment. A reasonable explanation could simply be that we did not have enough physarum in our cut out blocks for it to grow and move towards the oats that were 3.5cm away. This is simply just a problem of quantity of physarum and makes sense, especially knowing that our culture was old and fragile to begin with and needed excessive amounts to induce movement towards nutrients. Another, more elaborate reason comes from a separate study that shows how oxidative stress impacts physarum mobility and growth. In this study, titanium dioxide nanoparticles were incorporated into petri dishes with physarum culture that impacted these signal transduction pathways by denaturing key proteins or inactivating pathways entirely from the environmental stress that the cultures of physarum were under [Zhang: 2017]. The same principles could have applied to our experiment. If the environmental conditions we used were similar to these high oxidative stress rich environments that were induced in the study previously mentioned, then it offers insight as to how our experiment failed to yield any results. This could have occurred without us knowing and could have caused the physarum to automatically become inhibited before us being able to observe the accurate theoretical results. This could have been the temperature, other chemicals in the lab that happened to contaminate our dishes, or even the unfavorable climate that these samples were in. Any environmental factor that has the ability to induce oxidative stress on the environment the physarum was in could have caused for these pathways to fail, and give our group no results. 
On a larger scale, another study showed how cancerous cells in osteosarcoma were destroyed with a chemical inhibitor that acted on many aspects of cell division and one included the inhibition of a G-protein coupled receptor. This study yielded promising results as the cancerous cells tested proved to undergo apoptosis at a faster rate than the controll group of functional cells [Qin: 2018]. This experiment discussed further potential into the receptors of G-proteins. These enormous problems associated with cancer in our world today have shown to be suppressed with stopping a variety of pathways in the cell, one being the G-protein coupled receptor. Our experiment although ineffective, was seen to examine the same principles of signal transduction pathways that are applicable to the real world.
