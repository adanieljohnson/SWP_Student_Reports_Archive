Title: Testing the behavioral differences between the red and blue Betta splendens in response to the same stimulus

Abstract:
The actions of Betta splendens in response to a certain stimulus is the focus of this lab. Observing the visual reactions of the fish in response to aggressive stimulus will aid in making conclusions about the evolutionary basis for these behaviors.  Due to patterns seen in previous labs, it was hypothesized that the color of the fish could indicate its level of aggressiveness.  In order to test this, we placed a decoy fish showing signs of aggression in the tank with each color fish, red and blue and observed what aggressive behaviors were displayed and how frequently.  Overall, most of the Betta fish had no interest or reaction to the decoy fish and our p-value (0.2923) showed that the differences in aggressive behaviors shown in the red fishes versus the blue were not significant. 


Introduction:
This lab focuses on the behavior of Betta splendens, more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, towards the same stimulus.  Siamese fighting fish reach to about 4-5 cm and originated in southeast Asia.  At rest, the males tend to be inconspicuous- usually dull, grayish brown or green color.  When excited by another male presence (intraspecific behavior), their color changes to an intense dark blue or red.  However, due to selective breeding, Betta males have retained their “fighting colors” even when at rest.  Siamese fighting fish are known for their aggressive behavior (agonistic), which can be shown through broadside displays and front facing displays.  Each type of display has sublevels of visible actions that indicate levels of aggressiveness [Johnson: 2018]. These visual communications allow us to observe the behavior of the B. splendens in certain stimuli.  One study was performed to test if there was a significant difference between the aggressiveness of Betta fish to different colored stimuli.  The results showed that the Betta fish were significantly more aggressive towards the same colored fish than towards a different color fish and these results lead to questions regarding if the color of the Betta fish affects its aggressiveness [Bones: 2017].  In cichlid fish, it is known that there are multiple color morphs among the population that differ in dominance [Peter: 2009].  Through observing their colorful displays and agonistic behaviors, typical behavior patterns will be revealed, allowing a basis for conclusions surrounding the evolutionary basis for their behaviors.  In the base B. splendens observation lab, through our initial behavioral observations revealed that the blue fighting fishes showed overall more aggression than the red fishes.  It is hypothesized that certain color fish will be more aggressive in the same stimulus.
 

Materials and Methods:
First, three red Betta fish and three blue Bettas were collected.  Each fish was placed in individual tanks with the same decoy fish (showing signs of aggression) for five minutes.  We observed how the Betta fish responds to the decoy and marked down which aggression signs were displayed and how many times they were displayed (Level 1, least aggressive behaviors-pelvic fin flickering, erect pectoral fins.  Level 2 behaviors include, tail beating and spreading of their opercula (gills).  The most aggressive behaviors are in Level 3 and consist of tail flashing and protruding branchiostegal membranes, known as the red “mane”).  Two five minute trials for each fish were conducted with a five minute rest between each trial.  Once all the behaviors were collected we found the mean of numbers for aggression (1, 2, or 3) and used the highest mean of each trial per fish as its graphing point and used unpaired t-test.


Results:
Most of the fish showed very low levels of aggressiveness towards the decoy fish, however as seen in Figure 1, the Red 3 Betta fish demonstrated high levels of aggressive behaviors.  Comparing raw data of aggressive displays in blue Betta fish versus red Betta fish in an unpaired t-test (t-stat:1.077, df:23, p:0.2923).


Discussion:
According to the p-value, there is not a significant difference between the aggressiveness of the blue versus red B. splendens and therefore the hypothesis was not supported. Most of the fishes showed no signs of interest in the decoy fish, besides occasional glances, and few signs of aggression.  This could be due to the fact that the decoy did not imitate an aggressiveness and threatening Betta fish and therefore the test fish did not consider it a threat. Possible future methods that could improve results would be to have the decoy swim around the tank by utilizing a mechanical decoy, which would better convince the test fish that this decoy is a possible threat.  The influence of color in B. splendens is currently unclear, and these findings can open the door for future hypothesis surrounding the effects of color [Bones: 2017].
