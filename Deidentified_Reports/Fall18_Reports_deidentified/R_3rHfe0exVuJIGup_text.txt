Title: The Effects of different stimuli on the aggressive behaviors shown by male Betta fish (Betta splendens)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if different stimuli provoke a difference in aggression in male Betta fish (Betta splendens). Male Betta fish demonstrate various aggressive behaviors with varying levels of aggression. The hypothesis is that the male Betta fish will be more aggressive in the presence of another male and food. In order to determine this, we will test a control group with just two male Bettas and two treatment groups: one with two males and a female and the other with two males and fish food. After recording the aggressive behaviors during each trial and tallying the point totals, a statistical test could then be used to test for significance. The main observation is that there is no significant evidence that there is a difference in the aggressive behaviors in male Betta fish in the three trials, and, as a result, our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Consequently, we were able to conclude that the male Betta fish do not have different levels of aggression in the presence of different stimuli. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will be observing animal behavior amongst Betta fish, scientifically known as Betta splendens. These fish are naturally very aggressive and certain stimuli cause these fish to react in varying levels of aggressiveness. For example, male Betta fish are typically a grayish brown or green; however, they become a more vibrant red or dark blue when triggered by a stimulus [Johnson: 2018]. These aggressive acts are interesting to observe as it is very common for these acts to be directed at other male Bettas, otherwise known as intraspecific behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. Male Betta fish display either broadside movements, which is when their side is directed towards their foe, or facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. Within broadside movements, there are varying levels of aggressive acts. The least aggressive act is pelvic fin flickering, then tail beating, and the most aggressive broadside movement is tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. The facing movements also increase in the same fashion beginning with erect pectoral fins, then the expansion of its gill covers, and the most aggressive maneuver occurs when the Betta protrudes its branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we will be observing male Betta fish in two different environments and recording the frequency of each type of movements and how many times they are repeated. We will be testing whether the male Bettas become more aggressive in the presence of another male and food or in the presence of another male and a female. The hypothesis is that the male Betta fish will be more aggressive in the presence of a male and food. 


Materials and Methods:
We conducted three trials in this experiment. During each trial, we recorded the amount of times they performed their aggressive behaviors. In order to give them a quantitative value, we assigned points to each level of aggression. The least aggressive acts were worth one point, the next two, and the most aggressive were given three points. Every time the act was stopped and then repeated we tallied more points and kept track of each individual male in the trials. The first trial tested the aggressiveness of the two males together with no other stimuli for five minutes. They were each then given a rest period where they were completely isolated from each other for five minutes. The next trial we ran was with the same two males and a female in the same space for five minutes. They were all then given another five-minute rest period. The final trial was with the same two males in the presence of six flakes of fish food. The scores were all tallied and recorded. The process was then repeated with two new males and their aggressiveness was also recorded. An ANOVA statistical test was used for this experiment. 


Results:
The difference in aggressive behaviors in the three trials were not significantly different from one another (df =2, p-value = 0.56). Although there is no significance between the trials, it is important to note that the average aggressive behavior points for the two males with the female (13.25 +/- 3.057) is higher than with the two males (6.0 +/- 3.057) and with the two males and food (8.0 +/- 3.057) as seen in Figure 1. 


Discussion:
The main observation in this experiment is that there is no significant evidence that there is a difference in the aggressive behaviors in male Betta fish in the three trials. As a result, the data does not support our hypothesis that aggression would be significantly different in the trial with two males in the presence of food. Despite this, there are differences in the average aggressive behavior points between the three trials, as seen in Figure 1. It can be noted that certain males displayed more aggression than others. Specifically, in the second round of males, as they had overall lower raw data for aggression in comparison to the first round of males. In addition, internal hormones are known to control behaviors in the Betta fish. In particular, serotonin is known to control aggression in certain animals [Lynn et. al: 2017]. In an experiment, it was found that aggression did not necessarily change with stimuli, but it was found to diminish in presence of an abundance of serotonin due to fluoxetine, which prevents the reuptake of serotonin [Lynn et. al: 2017]. This may suggest that our experiment does not show significant evidence of a difference between the different stimuli because we did not hormonally effect the Betta fish.
