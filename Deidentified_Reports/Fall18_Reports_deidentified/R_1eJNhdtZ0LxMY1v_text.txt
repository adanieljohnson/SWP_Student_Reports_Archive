Title: Different Wavelengths of Visible Light and their effects on the Rate of Photosynthetic Reduction in Spinach Leaf Chloroplasts 

Abstract:
Known information about the flow of electrons in the photosynthetic reductive process and quantum mechanics suggests that certain wavelengths of light are more optimal than others for increasing the rate of the photosynthetic reductive process.  In this study, spinach chloroplasts are isolated and treated with red, green, blue, and white (controll) wavelengths of light with colored light bulbs and rates of photosynthetic reduction are recorded through a DCIP assay by collected absorbances with a spec-20 photometer.  It was experimentally determined that red and blue light exposed spinach chloroplasts did not undergo significently increased rates of photosynthetic reduction and green light exposed spinach chloroplasts did not undergo significently decreased rates of photosynthetic reduction in comparison to spinach chloroplasts exposed to white light, as was hypothesized.  This study highlights the essentiality of more sophisticated techniques and equipment in photosynthesis research, and/or emphasizes the intricacies and complexities of the Hill reaction in the photosynthetic reductive process in plants. 



Introduction:
Photosynthesis is performed by all plants, algae, and other microorganisms to store energy in covalent bonds, redox potential, and as an electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer [Johnson].  The general process of electron transfer in chloroplasts is known as the Hill reaction, which is essentially photoreduction of an electron acceptor, NADP+. Solar energy is essentially converted to chemical energy by the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH [1].

Instrumental in performing this process are the photosystems I and II and others, which are multi-subunit membrane-protein complexes [Nelson:2006]. Photosystem I generates an extremely negative redox potential, and photosystem II generates an oxidant with a redox potential high enough to oxidize water [Nelson:2006]. More specifically, during the light-dependent reaction, chlorophyll and other pigments are clustered in these photosystems and vibrational energy can be passed successively through the pigments [2]. Electrons in these pigments are excited by light, which can be in the form of many colors, each having its own defined range of wavelengths [2].  Based on what is known in the field of quantum mechanics, certain wavelengths of light maintain amounts of quantized energy that are more appropriate than that of other wavelengths to excite chlorophyll electrons and drive redox processes until NADP+ is reduced [2]. 

Furthermore, it is known that pigments in plants such as chlorophyll do not absorb the green part of the visible light spectrum and that they are reflective of it and absorbent of others [Nishio:2001].  Also, in a study that tested the responses of leaf photosynthesis in cucimus sativus plants to different combinations of red and blue light, the blue part of the light spectrum was confirmed to be associated with functional photosynthetic operation in the plant leaves [Hogewoning:2010]. The major conclusion of the study was that blue light during growth is quantitatively required for normal photosynthetic functioning [Hogewoning:210]. It was of interest to us to attempt to experimentally determine which wavelengths of light are most conducive to faster rates of photosynthesis in chloroplasts. 

The objective of our study was to measure the rate of photosynthetic reduction of energy carriers such as NADP+  in spinach leaf chloroplasts in varying wavelengths of light conditions, specifically green, red, blue, and white (controll), and determine which light environment is most conducive for faster rates of the photosynthetic reduction process. A DCIP assay allowed us to do this, and in the assay, DCIP+ served as a carrier molecule and acceptor of the reduced electrons released in the electron transport chain.

According to the electromagnetic spectrum, since blue wavelengths of light are higher energy than both green and red wavelengths, it makes sense that plants would harvest them [4].  This is because based on quantum mechanical theory, these higher energy photons make for a greater redox potential [4]. It is also sensible for plants to absorb lower energy red light when considering this idea from an evolutionary context and perspective [4]. Since plants first evolved in marine environments, and seawater only allows red wavelengths of light to penetrate its surface, bluer and greener wavelengths are reflected, hence the bluish-green appearance of seawater. Therefore, an optimization of pigments to absorb lower energy red light seems to have been effective, and likely a major trait naturally selected for in plants [4]. Perhaps, the reason why plants reflect green wavelengths of light rather than absorb them is that it is a consequence of the essential quality of maintaining the ability to absorb red wavelengths of light [4].  In other words, since plants needed to be able to absorb red light since it was most abundant to them in seawater, it would have been advantageous if they were able to reflect the wavelength of light that was not as readily available such as blue or green.  Since blue is the higher energy and provides higher energy photons, it makes sense for green wavelengths of light to be reflected [4].

We believed it to be plausible for spinach chloroplasts to have an optimal photosynthetic performance in blue light because of the greater availability of higher energy photons.  Similarly, because of the aforementioned evolutionary explanation which suggests that plants needed to be able to harvest red light because of its abundance helped us find it also plausible for spinach chloroplasts to have an optimal photosynthetic performance in red light. We hypothesized that the spinach chloroplasts treated with red and blue light would have substantially fast rates of photosynthetic reduction, which would be displayed in the data as a statistically significently larger decrease in absorbance on the spec-20 machine over time in comparison to the controll group with spinach chloroplasts in white light.  We also hypothesized that the group with spinach chloroplasts exposed to green light would have substantially slow rates of photosynthetic reduction over time, which would be displayed by the data as a statistically significently smaller decrease in absorbance on the spec-20 machine in comparison to the controll group with spinach chloroplasts in white light.  Notable is that absorbance on the spec-20 photometer machine is inversely related to the rate of photosynthetic reduction, meaning that a large decrease in absorbance on the machine is indicative of a large increase in the rate of photosynthetic reduction. Our null hypothesis was that the amount decrease in absorbance on the spec-20 machine will not be affected by the wavelengths of light in each of the treatment groups, and the alternative hypothesis was that the different wavelengths of light in the treatment groups would lead to significent change in the amount of decrease in absorbance which is again indicative of the rate of photosynthetic reduction in the spinach chloroplasts. 


Materials and Method:

The veins were removed from 6 large spinach leaves and then grounded in a mortar and pestle with 10Ml of grinding buffer (10mM sucrose in a tricine buffer, pH 8). Another 10Ml was added, and the mixture was grounded additionally for 2-3 minutes and then filtered into a beaker through cheesecloth. This solution was then centrifuged in a centrifuge tube at 200G and 1200RPM for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. This tube labeled Tube A’s supernatant was poured into a tubed labeled tube B and centrifuged again at 1000G and 2800RPM for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Tube B’s pellet was saved and resuspended with 20Ml of grinding buffer. 

Four dark boxes were set up which each contained a lamp with a different colored light bulb: blue, green, white, and red. Each bulb had 8 watts of power, except for the white bulb which had 9. 13 test tubes on a rack were numbered 1-12 and 1 was left for a blank.  The tubes numbered 1-12 were divided spatially into 4 groups of 3 on the rack.  The first 3 groups were treated with red, blue, and green light and the final group of 3 was for the controll group, white light. To tubes 1-12, 6Ml of water, and 2Ml 100mM phosphate pH 6.5, and 2Ml of 130mM DCIP were added. To the blank tube, 8Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer was added. 

The spec-20 photometer was set at 600nm, and then 0.1Ml of chloroplasts from the resuspended solution was added to each test tube and mixed well. The machine was then blanked with the blank test tube, and then solutions 1-12 were poured into 12 cuvettes until capacity.  The first 3 cuvettes were placed into a cuvette stand and then placed into a box with the white light lamp after the initial absorbance reading of each cuvette was measured and recorded.  This same process was repeated with the other 3 sets of cuvettes, and the time at which each was placed into its corresponding light environment was documented.  Absorbances for each treatment group were then taken every 10 minutes for a 30-minute duration.  

A two-sample one-tailed t_test was conducted to analyze the significance of the effects that red, green, and blue wavelengths of light may have had on the rate of decrease in absorbance or the rate of photosynthetic reduction of spinach chloroplasts in comparison to the controll group of spinach chloroplasts exposed to white light. The alpha value was set to 0.05.


Results:
The results of the two-sample one-tailed t_test comparing the mean percentage decrease in absorbance of the spinach chloroplasts in the red light treatment group to those in the white light controll group were: (t_stat: -0.07924, d.f.: 2, p_value: .470324). The results of the two-sample one-tailed t_test comparing the mean percentage decrease in absorbance of the spinach chloroplasts in the blue light treatment group to those in the white light controll group were:(t_stat: 1.02345, d.f.: 2, p_value: .315297).  Finally, the results of the two-sample one-tailed t_test comparing the mean percentage decrease in absorbance of the spinach chloroplasts in the green light treatment group to those in the white light controll group were: (t_stat: 0.51988, d.f.: 2, p_value: 0.51988).

The mean percent change in absorbance for the spinach chloroplasts in the red light treatment group over the duration of the first 10-minute interval was: (M= -91.595, SD= 8.07), over the second 10-minute interval was: (M= -43.37%, SD= 2.62), and over the third 10-minute interval was (M= -37.47%, SD= 3.43).

The mean percent change in absorbance for the spinach chloroplasts in the green light treatment group over the duration of the first 10-minute period was: (M=-65.01%, SD= 11.09), over the second 10-minute interval was: (M=-34.54%, SD= 3.93), and over the third 10-minute interval was (M=-31.62%, SD= 6.44). 

The mean percent change in absorbance for the spinach chloroplasts in the blue light treatment group over the duration of the first 10-minute period was: (M=-47.56%, SD=12.73), over the second 10-minute interval was: (M=-28.35%, SD=5.92), and over the final 10-minute interval was (M=-26.11%, SD=7.85). 

The mean percent change in absorbance for the spinach chloroplasts in the white light controll group during the first 10-minute interval was: (M=-94.86%, SD=13.91), over the second 10-minute interval was: (M=-37.88%, SD=3.3), and over the final 10-minute interval was (M=-33.47, SD=1.89).     

General Trends:

Absorbance values in the red light experimental group decreased at rates most similar to that of the controll group (white light), and absorbance values in the green and blue experimental groups decreased at rates slower than that of the controll group, especially during the first 10-minute interval. 





Discussion:
Our initial hypotheses, which were that the experimental groups each consisting of spinach chloroplasts treated with red and blue light respectively would both undergo statistically significently larger mean decreases in absorbance during the 30 minute period than the chloroplasts in the controll group treated with white light and that the group with spinach chloroplasts exposed to green light would undergo a statistically significent smaller mean decrease in absorbance over the duration of 30 minutes in comparison to the controll group were both unsupported by the two-sample one-tailed t_tests for means conducted for our significance test.  Essentially, spinach chloroplasts in the red and blue light exposed treatment groups did not undergo statistically significent increases in the rate of photosynthetic reduction in comparison to those within the controll group, and spinach chloroplasts in the green light exposed treatment groups did not undergo a statistically significent decrease in the rate of photosynthetic reduction in comparison to those within the controll group.

Figure 1 demonstrates that the spinach chloroplasts in the white light controll group underwent a larger mean decrease in absorbance than did those in the red and blue light treatment groups based on a comparison of sharpness of the positive slopes of the lines. This was contrary to our hypothesis. The mean percentage decrease in absorbance in the red light group was not statistically significently greater than that of the controll group (t_stat: -0.07924, d.f.: 2, p_value: .470324), nor was the blue light group in comparison to the controll group (t_stat: 1.02345, d.f.: 2, p_value: .315297). Similarly, the mean percentage decrease in absorbance in the green light group was not statistically significently smaller than that of the controll group either (t_stat: 0.51988, d.f.: 2, p_value: 0.51988).  On Figure 1, although the white light controll group’s decrease in absorbance was greater than that of the green light treatment group, our significance test at alpha level 0.05 did not find this difference to be of significance.  Therefore, we could not reasonably conclude that the different wavelengths of light in either of the treatment groups significently altered the rate of photosynthetic reduction in spinach chloroplasts in comparison to spinach chloroplasts in the white light controll group, or in the generic wavelengths of light that they would traditionally be exposed to in the sun, which the white light controll group is representative of. 

The results of our experiment leading to the rejection of our hypotheses were rather interesting and concerning considering the foundational basis that our sources offered for our hypotheses. Of supreme concern was the fact that the spinach chloroplasts treated with blue light underperformed greatly in terms of rate of photosynthetic reduction according to our hypothesis, which was based on the consultation of a source which suggested that chlorophyll a, a pigment found in all plants absorbs most strongly in blue wavelengths [4], as well as the evolutionary basis to explain this occurrence. 

This suggests that likely, we failed to consider a factor brought up in this source when making our hypotheses. This factor concerns the drawbacks of using some of every day, household-like materials that we utilized to conduct this experiment that was supposed to be substitutions for naturally abundant materials, which can have significently different properties according to this source [4].  It was mentioned that blue wavelengths in traditional fluorescent lights like the ones we used for this experiment are quite weak, but are very strong in natural sunlight [4].  The implications of this could have been that the specific numerical wavelength of blue light, and/or the shade and intensity of the color could have been important in influencing the results of our experiment.  The blue light on the visible light section of the electromagnetic spectrum is between 380nm to about 500nm.  Although we were not aware of the wavelength of our blue light we conducted the experiment with, it is likely according to this source that it lied closer to the lower parameter of the range in wavelength, contrary to the wavelength of blue light that spinach plants would generally be exposed to by the sun [4].  Also according to this source, plants take cues to undergo synthetic processes, not by the presence of either red or blue wavelengths of light alone, but by a combination of both [4].  However, our experiment explored the potential effects of red and blue wavelengths of light individually on the rate of photosynthetic reduction spinach chloroplasts.  According to this source, perhaps, an optimal wavelength of light conducive to an increased rate of photosynthetic reduction would involve a blending of colors or at least a simultaneous presence of multiple. It seems to be apparent that an experiment testing the effect of different wavelengths of light on the rate of photosynthetic reduction with the purpose of discovering an optimal wavelength would require techniques and equipment more sophisticated than those used to conduct our experiment.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure displays the average percent change in absorbance values in each light condition over a duration of 30 minutes. Absorbances for each experimental group were measured in  10-minute intervals. The rate of decrease in absorbance, or the positive slope of the lines, is analogous to the rate of the photosynthetic reduction occurring in the chloroplasts. A sharper increase indicates a faster rate of photosynthetic reduction.  The error bars are representative of the standard deviation values for the 3 trials of each treatment group in each of the three 10-minute intervals.
