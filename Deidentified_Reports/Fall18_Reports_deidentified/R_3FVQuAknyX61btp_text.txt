Title: The influence of the environmental pH on the rate of electron transport in Spinach

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process that done by the plants to do the carbon fixation. Photosynthesis helps the plants to turn the solar energy into chemical energy as well. It is separated into two parts, the light dependent part and the light independent part, and Electron transport is an important procedure that exist in the light dependent part of the photosynthesis. Electron transport is an essential step in photosynthesis, and its rate indirectly increase the rate of photosynthesis. In this paper, the relationship between the pH of the environment and the rate of electron transport is discovered. pH3, pH6.5, and pH10 represent the acidic, neutral, and basic environment. From the experiment, the conclusion that there is an optimum range of pH that is neither too acidic nor too basic, which is around pH6.5 for the spinach to do the electron transport. The electron transport appears to have the highest rate in the neutral environment. The electron transport activity in pH 6.5 is significently higher than that in pH3 and pH10.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process that done by the plants to do the carbon fixation. Photosynthesis helps the plants to turn the solar energy into chemical energy as well. It is separated into two parts, the light dependent part and the light independent part, and the waste of photosynthesis is oxygen, which is the essential material for cellular respiration. In other words, photosynthesis consumes the waste of cellular respiration and re-produce the material needed for photosynthesis. Electron transport is an important procedure that exist in the light dependent part of the photosynthesis. A higher rate of electron transport indicates a relative high rate of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis also helps to generate energy for plant daily use. Since the photosynthesis is that important to the lives on the Earth, and the electron transport rate is essential for the photosynthesis rate, the question that what natural factors would influence the rate of electron transport and as well as photosynthesis. In this experiment, the rate of electron transport is measured. All green-leave vegetables could be used as the source of observing the rate of electron transport. Spinach is used in this experiment. In nature, there are so many factors that would influence the rate of electron transport. As pH indicates the proton concentration in the solution, the proton concentration in the environment influence the energy needed for the electron transport to build up a proton concentration gradient in the thylakoid lumen, pH is undoubtedly an important factor that would influence the rate.  Photosynthesis is an essential procedure in plants’ growth and living. The carbon fixation involved in the photosynthesis provides the source for aerobic respiration (Black, 1973), which is the main process of plants getting usable energy and keep growing. Since electron transport rate could indirectly indicates the rate of photosynthesis, discovering how the environmental factor influence the rate of electron transport helps discovering the influence on photosynthesis. The pH of the mud or water environment would highly influence the metabolism of plants. So, the Biological Question of this experiment is: How the pH value affects the rate of electron transport in spinach leaves? The initial hypothesis of this experiment made in this experiment is as the pH goes down, the electron transfer will increase.

Materials and Method:
First of all, removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves, threw away the veins, and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water; Blotted off any excess moisture from the leaves. Then, added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), grinded the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. When done with grinding, added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed with the spinach slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.

Transferred the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun it at 200 times the force of gravity, 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4oC. Made sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. After centrifuged for the first time, poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Prevented the debris at the bottom of tube “A,” from going into tube “B”. Centrifuged the second time for the 50-Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Again, poured the supernatant to another container. Added an extra 15 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Then, aliquoted into 3, 5 Ml volumes by dividing among 3 conical tubes. Added 5 Ml of reaction buffer to each conical tube and spin again at 2800 ppm for 10 minutes. Re-suspended pellet in approximately 3 Ml grinding buffer to concentrate chloroplasts.

Labeled 10 large test tubes, one Blank tube containing 8Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of pH 6.5 Buffer; three Acidic tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2Ml of pH3 Buffer; three neutral tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2Ml of pH 6.5 Buffer; and three Basic tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 Mm DCIP, and 2Ml of pH 10 Buffer. Placed them in a tube rack. Turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to read at 600nm. Added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepare. Then mixed each tube immediately after adding the chloroplasts. After mixing, transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 0, and then immediately measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. Placed all tubes directly under direct light for 10 minutes, after 10 minutes, blanked the spectrophotometer with Sample 0, Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light, blanked the spectrophotometer, again measured the absorbance a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blanked the spectrophotometer and measured absorbance one more time for all 10 samples. 

Since there are three sets of data, two paired t_tests are used to find the significance of the result.


Results:
For pH3, during the first 10 minutes of the experiment, the absorbance decreased for about 0.1, while in the next ten minutes, it rose to about + 0.05, and at the end of the experiment, it re-decreased to -0.2. The general trend of change in absorbance is the decrease in the absorbance. For pH 10, the absorbance of the solution is increasing compared to the initial absorbance value. In the first 10 minutes, it increased slightly about 0.02, while the increase trend kept going till the end of the experiment to about 0.075. However, for the pH 6.5 curve, the absorbance of the solution decreases dramatically in the first 10 minutes down to around -0.8, and then decreasing slower to around -0.98, and in the last 10 minutes, the absorbance increases by a small amount up to -0.92. (Figure 1)

Two paired t_tests are used in this experiment, for comparing pH 3 and pH 6.5 sets of data. The p_value gained from comparing the data of pH3 and pH6.5 is 0.008 while the t value got from this comparison equals to 78.53. The p_value got from comparing the data in pH6.5 and pH10 was 0.6 x 10-5 and the0 t value was 69.56. 


Discussion:
Though the trend in pH3 curve is zigzagged, the final change in absorbance at the end of the experiment (30 minutes) in pH3 environment decreases the absorbance by about 20% which means that electron transport chain could take place under acidic environment. However, in pH10 environment, the absorbance increases about 7% at the end of the experiment. This indicates that the electron transport chain could not take place under alkaline environments, or the basic environment inhibits the electron transport. For pH 6.5 environment, the absorbance dramatically decreased to 80% in the fits 10 minutes of the experiment, which means that the pH6.5 environment highly encouraged the electron transport to take place. At the 30 minutes session, the absorbance even decreases down to 99%, this indicates the almost all the dyes used to indicate the rate of electron transport are used up and became transparent. From comparing these three sets of data, pH 6.5 is the most optimum environment among the three chosen environments for electron transport to occur. The p_values are much less that 0.05, which means the three groups are significently different from each other. So, the electron transport rate in pH6.5 environment is significently higher than that in acidic and basic environments. This doesn’t match out initial hypothesis: the lower pH, the higher rate of electron transport occurs. Instead an alternative hypothesis is supported that there is a certain range of pH that is suitable for the electron transport to take place. From this experiment, the optimum pH for electron transport is around 6.5. 

There are some possible errors in the experiment. there’s an abnormal value appeared in pH3 30 minutes absorbance: The absorbance dramatically increased to 0.091, which is 225% higher than the normal value that we got from other groups of experiment. It’s rarely possible to have a data that had more than twice of the value got from the experiments did in exactly same condition. So we conclude that there may be an error in measuring or doing the data collection. For further experiment, more different values of pHs should be tested to minimize the range of optimum pH for electron transport, and more other factors that may influence the photosynthesis rate else than electron transport rate, like the rate of Calvin Cycle could be tested to more accurately determine the rate of photosynthesis. (Emerson, Robert, and Charlton M. Lewis, 1939) After knowing how pH influences the rate of electron transport, and after doing more experiments on the factors that would influence the rate of photosynthesis, the influence on photosynthesis rate by different environmental factors could then be conjected. With the data of how pH influence photosynthesis and electron transport, the farmers could theoretically measure and manipulate the pH of the soil to maximize the rate of electron transport, thus the rate of carbon fixation. As the rate of carbon fixation is maximized, the plants would grow faster and better.
