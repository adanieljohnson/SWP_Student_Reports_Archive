Title: Manduca sexta Exposed to Increased Level of Juvenile Hormone

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone is a type of insect growth regulator that affects the growth and molting of the caterpillar Manduca sexta. For this lab, we decided to investigate how increasing the levels of JH in the caterpillars’ diet would affect their weight. Using two groups, a control and an experimental, we tested our hypothesis and analyzed our results using a two-tailed two-sample t-test and found the results to be significant. The increased levels of JH caused the caterpillars to not molt, and subsequently gain more weight than the control group who received no increased levels of JH. This is relevant to the real world as it allows scientists who study growth and development investigate how certain inhibitory growth hormones function and how they affect a species without studying humans.

Introduction:
All insects have hormones and enzymes that allow them to molt and grow, insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect the different growth hormones in these insects. IGRs affect Juvenile Hormone (JH), which is the hormone that regulates the type of molting that occurs in the Manduca sexta [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta are a type of caterpillar that are known as the Tobacco Hornworm. JH is thought to have the primary effect on the metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta and has shown that it causes a delay in the metamorphosis of the organism [Safranek: 1980]. Knowing this, we decided to look into how JH affects the growth and molting of the Manduca sexta. We hypothesize that if the level of Juvenile Hormone is increased, then the weight of the caterpillars will change.

Materials and Methods:
We tested our hypothesis in the field. There were two groups of four caterpillars. The first was the experimental group and the second was the control. These two groups were fed different diets: the control group received a normal diet and no drops of JH in the food. The diet consisted of 10g of the standard caterpillar food that was provided for each caterpillar and added 5 drops of distilled water to the food to keep the consistency the same as the experimental group. The experimental group was given a normal diet (10 g of standard caterpillar food each), but instead of adding distilled water, five drops of JH added to the food. All other variables were kept constant. The caterpillars were observed every day for two weeks and all observations were recorded. We used a two-tailed two-sample t-test to analyze the data that was recorded.

Results:
At the beginning of the week, all the caterpillars were growing consistently and as days passed there were bigger increases in weight gain. When the control group began to near the 8g mark, their weight gain started to slow down as they readied themselves to pupate. Pupating is the process through which the Manduca sexta, like all caterpillars, transform from the immature stage of being a caterpillar to the mature stage of being a moth. In this process, the Manduca sexta create a brown cocoon, in which the metamorphosis takes place. In the process of getting ready to pupate, the caterpillars turn from a vibrant blue to a pale yellow-green color and begin to lose weight as they stop eating. At the end of the two-week period, none of the experimental group looked ready to pupate, while the majority of the control group had already begun that process. The average weight of the control group caterpillars was 7.6475 with a standard deviation of 2.7293. The average weight of the experimental group caterpillars was 13.625 with a standard deviation of 1.3759. These are both shown on the graph below. We used a two-tailed two-sample t-test and found our p value to be .007881.

Discussion:
Given that the p-value of our two-tailed two-sample t-test was .007881, and is less than .05, our results are statistically significant, and we accept our hypothesis that if the JH levels were increased, then the weight of the Manduca sexta would change. The JH significantly increased the weights of the Manduca sexta. Because JH directly affects metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta and causes molting of the caterpillars to be delayed [Safranek: 1980], the experimental group for pupating and as a result, they continued to eat and ended up gaining significantly more weight than the control group. In the control group 3 out of the 4 caterpillars pupated or began to pupate, and as a result ended up losing a little bit of weight because they were not eating. In the future, it would be interesting to see how much weight the experimental group could gain before they died, or to test how long it would take for them to pupate if the JH drops were replaced with drops of distilled water.

Figure Legends: 
The graph above displays the mean weight change in weight for the control and experimental groups of Manduca sexta. The control group is the one that received 0 drops of JH and the experimental is the group that received 5 drops of JH. The error bars show 1 standard deviation on either side of the mean.*************************************************************************
