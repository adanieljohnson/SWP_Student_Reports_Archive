Title: Simulated herbivory affects resource allocation and root-to-shoot ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
Resource allocation continues as an important study in ecological biology. As pests and insects continue to exploit by deformation of plant leaf areas, the proper health and growth of plants will be susceptible to harm. In this experiment, we observed the effects of herbivory on plant growth and health in radishes (Raphanus raphanstrum). It was hypothesized that radishes in herbivory conditions would grow longer root systems in comparison to controllled plants in an effort to combat less nutrient intake and decreased photosynthetic rates in the leaves. The resulting data did not show any significent difference in length root-to-shoot ratio but did show significent difference in weight root-to-shoot ratio. The insignificent difference in root length between the two groups showed that herbivory did not directly affect in the growth of root systems; however, the significent difference in shoot length between the two groups could support the idea that the lack of energy caused by herbivory conditions results in less growth of plant shoots. Together, the lack of herbivory conditions provided large to no growth difference during the study.

Introduction:
This experiment observes the natural allocation of resources in radishes (Raphanus raphanstrum) that have undergone herbivory conditions. Radishes typically hold large leaf surface areas, allowing insects and pests to obtain nutrients from ingesting segments of their leaves [Masters, Jones, Rogers: 2001]. Also, past research has shown that the supply of resources such as nutrients tend to show positive correlation with plant growth [McConnaughay.: 1999]. Comparison of the natural growth of radish plants without herbivory to the growth of those simulated to undergo herbivory is used to determine the difference in resource allocations. In order to measure actual growth of the two groups, root-to-shoot ratios of plants from each group were used for comparison. Radishes that undergo herbivory conditions should grow longer roots in an effort to compensate for less absorption of resources and, therefore, result in higher root-to-shoot ratios than our controllled radish plants in natural conditions.

Materials and Method:
We obtained eight soil cups filled with Raphanus raphanstrum seeds and designated four cups as the controlls and four cups as herbivory conditioned. Water, sunlight, and typical conditions were provided daily in a greenhouse so as to not induce any outside factors for affecting growth. Once leaves began to grow, clipping of leaves were done to the plants in the herbivory designated cups to simulate insect or pest manipulation. This was done daily to ensure leaf area was properly reduced. After a period of two weeks, we compared the weights (grams) and heights (millimeters) of the controll group and herbivory group by measuring and weighing five plants from each cup of each group. In order to accurately observe differences, we compared the two groups' data through a two-sample one-sided t_test. This and the resulting root-to-shoot ratios allowed us to determine the differences in resource allocations.

Results:
	The average root-to-shoot length ratio for herbivory plants was 2.66. This is lower than the average root-to-shoot length for the controlls, as shown in figure 1. The average root-to-shoot weight ratio for herbivory plants was 2.17 while the average root-to-shoot weight ratio for controll plants was 2.75, as shown in figure 2. For comparison, two two-sample one-sided t_tests were used, and the resulting mean ratio for root-to-shoot length was statistically significent (t_stat = 2.47, d.f. = 22, P = 0.01). The resulting mean ratio for root-to-shoot weight was not statistically significent (t - stat = 1.83, d.f. = 6, P = 0.058). The controll plants tended to grow more elongated shoots, growing larger in height than the plants that underwent herbivory conditions. However, the root length of both groups did not show significent difference in length, and both groups did not show any difference of greenery or health.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that radish plants that undergo herbivory conditions would grow longer roots in comparison to plants in the controll group was not supported by the resulting data. There was no significent difference in root lengths measured between the plants of the two groups at the 0.05 level, suggesting that herbivory does not directly affect the growth of root systems. An explanation for these results could be that the decrease in leaf area caused by manipulation caused a lack in intake of energy and nutrient through decreased photosynthetic rates which resulted in less energy allotted for plant growth [Smith: 1989]. However, when comparing to past research experiment, it is possible that the period of observation was too short for accurate understanding of the behavior of plants that undergo herbivory [Baskin, Beemster: 1998]. This experiment along with past research have allowed us to understand that detrimental effects can occur when herbivory is forced onto radish plants [Agrawal: 1999]. Further experimentation with herbivory could provide more insight into the different resource allocation behaviors of other plants including other agricultural crops, allowing individuals to develop better method of combatting pest infestations and other insect-caused complications.
