Title: Limited growth and arrested development in Manduca sexta resulting from 20E blocker

Abstract:
Hormones regulate the growth and development of plants and animals through a variety of functions. In many insects, including the caterpillar Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone (20E) are primarily responsible for development and maturation. Insect growth regulators are substances used commercially to alter the natural demonstration of these hormones in a form of pest controll. We hypothesized that by inhibiting the 20E hormone in M. sexta, the insect larva would grow smaller in weight than a controll group and would be unable to successfully pupate to adults. We fed a controll group standard food and an experimental group identical food with the added commercial 20E blocker, Azaguard, over the course of a two-week experiment observing the subjects’ larval development. Our experiment supported our hypothesis finding the change in weight to be significently less in the experimental group fed the azaguard than in the controll group. Limited development was also evidenced in the experimental group as many of them died while the controll pupated. This demonstrated the effectiveness of commercial insect growth regulators in altering Manduca sexta development. 

Introduction:
Hormones are signaling molecules responsible for the regulation of organism physiology. Ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone are two types of insect hormones that primarily regulate growth and development [Johnson: 2018]. Extensive experimentation has been done with the caterpillar, Manduca sexta, as a model organism for trends in insect developments. The life cycle of a Manduca sexta caterpillar typically consists of five instar stages of larva before pupation that leads to the insect’s adult form [Johnson: 2018]. During its larval period, juvenile hormone allows for growth of the larva while 20E regulates timing of the molting process to each subsequent larval stage and to the pupal stage [Riddiford: 2003]. Specifically, spikes in 20E concentrations have been correlated to the initiation of a molt to another instar stage. Additionally, a spike in 20E with simultaneous low levels of juvenile hormone initiate what is called a commitment pulse that leads to pupation [Riddiford:2003]. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) alter the expression of these insect hormones and are used commercially as pest controll [Tunaz: 2004]. Specifically, they are effective in causing the rapid death of an insect by causing typical regulatory processes to fail [Tunaz: 2004]. In this experiment, we used the insect growth regulator Azaguard which functions as a 20E inhibitor. For proper growth and regulated development, the relative concentrations of juvenile hormone and 20E must be carefully maintained [Johnson: 2018]. Through altering this ratio with an IGR, the growth of the organism will be impaired and the stages of development will be altered. I hypothesize that by introducing this 20E inhibitor to the diets of Manduca sexta larva, the insects will grow smaller in weight than a controll group and will be unable to follow the typical life processes of molting and pupating. 

Materials and Method:
To test the effects of 20E blocker, we selected eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of similar initial size and weight. The caterpillars were categorized into two groups of four each to be tested as a controll group and experimental group. Each caterpillar was placed into individual enclosures and housed in identical temperature and light conditions throughout the experiment. Each subject of the controll group was fed 10g of prepared food with an added 4 drops of distilled water. Each subject of the test group was fed 10 g of prepared food with four drops of Azaguard, a 20E blocker, added. Every day for two weeks, each caterpillar was weighed, and its physical appearance was observed. Food was replaced when the supplied food was largely consumed or dried at an average rate of every other day. A one-tailed, two sample t_test was used to compare the difference in initial to final mass of the controll and experimental groups. Averages and standard deviations of group daily mass measurements were plotted on a line graph to compare general group trends throughout the experiment.

Results:
The mean growth difference in the controll group was 6.765 g and the experimental group was 2.1275 g (Fig. 1). The standard deviation was 1.38 for the controll group and 0.975 for the experimental group (Fig. 1). The difference in growth averages between the controll group and experimental group was statistically significent (t_stat=5.48, d.f.=6, p_value=.000774). The average weight of Manduca sexta in the experimental group was consistently less than that of the controll (Fig. 2). All four of the caterpillars in the controll group pupated by the end of the experiment. The experimental group ate less than the controll and appeared lethargic throughout the experiment. Three out of four of the experimental group died by the end of the experiment.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Manduca sexta fed 20E inhibitors would grow smaller in weight and would not develop properly, was supported. The t_test rejected the null-hypothesis with an incredibly low p_value demonstrating a significent difference in the growth change between the experimental and controll groups. Additionally, a graph of average weight in the groups over the course of the experiment demonstrates clear differentiation between the experimental groups (Fig. 2). In the time frame of the experiment, all of the controll Manduca sexta were able to successfully pupate demonstrating the expected developmental progression. On the other hand, most of the experimental group died. This is consistent with the commercial purpose of insect growth regulators as pest controlls through alteration of normal development [Tunaz: 2004]. The experimental group also demonstrated a drop-in mass before pupation. Studies have shown the spike in 20E that initiates pupation to cause larva to stop feeding and lose weight in preparation for their pupal stage [Nijhout: 2007]. The more gradual loss of weight in the experimental group could be indicative of an attempt to pupate in the 20E inhibited organisms or a result of general deterioration. Additional experimentation would be necessary to determine causality. Overall, this experiment demonstrated the effectiveness of insect growth regulators in preventing development and hastening the death of insects. Many IGRs have been synthesized from plants to function as pesticides [Tunaz: 2004]. This methodology can be used effectively in commercial practice to target pests without negatively impacting desirable crops.
