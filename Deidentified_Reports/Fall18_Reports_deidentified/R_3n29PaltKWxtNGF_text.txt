Title: Inhibitive effects of Juvenile Hormone on growth of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The insect pest control is an important topic and action that is continuously being discussed and modified by human beings. Outbreaks of pests can result in tremendous damage to agriculture, especially for damages of crops, but overuse of traditional insecticides have both advantages and disadvantages, for which they eliminate pests and leave residual toxins in crops at the same time. Thus, excavating the potentiality of nontoxic and effective synthetic insecticide is an urgent work. This experiment investigated the effect of juvenile hormone on inhibiting the growth of Manduca sexta. The expectation is that Manduca sexta caterpillar will not undergo pupal eclosion but stays at larvae stage and becomes larger larvae instead, under the circumstances that excessive amount of precor functioning as juvenile hormone is added to caterpillar’s food before molting. The collected data showed great difference between caterpillars with normal JH level and caterpillars with high JH level. Specifically, caterpillars with normal JH level have smaller sizes and molted, and caterpillars with high JH level have larger sizes and didn’t molt. This disparity indicates that high JH level prevents pupal eclosion and leads to abnormalities for Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
This experiment generally identifies how juvenile hormone affects the growth and development of Manduca sexta. Manduca sexta insect is under the order of Lepidoptera, with several common names such as tobacco hornworm and hawk moth. It has a total life cycle of around 39 to 48 days, consisting of four main stages embryo, larvae, pupa and adult, and this is classified as holometabolous life cycle [John: 1980]. During the life cycle, the growth and development of Manduca sexta relies heavily on ecdysterone and juvenile hormone. Without either of these two hormones, the insect dies immediately. Coordination of two hormones’ concentration within the insect’s body directly determines at which stage eclosion, the molting process, happens. Before the pupal eclosion, the ecdysterone level is high and juvenile hormone level is low to make sure the caterpillar can pupate and form a moth with normal size [Louis: 1980]. This phenomenon leads to the question that what happens if the juvenile hormone level is high before the pupal eclosion. The experiment focuses on increasing the juvenile hormone level during growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars to seek consequences on pupal eclosion. Precor, a form of insect growth regulator, is used in this experiment to mimic the effect of juvenile hormone. The hypothesis is that Manduca sexta caterpillar will not undergo pupal eclosion and pupate if the juvenile hormone level is excessively high.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars with the similar weight and length were selected. Each caterpillar was placed in separate rearing jar, and all samples were divided into two groups with four caterpillars in each group. Two groups of caterpillars were given with different food diet, so one is control group, the other is treatment group. Each caterpillar in control group received 10 grams standard diet with 5 drops of water. Each caterpillar in treatment group received 10 grams diet with 5 drops of Precor soaked completely into the food. Then all caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 28℃, 12 hours dark and 12 hours light cycle. Food was replaced if becoming low and dry. The weight (g) and length (mm) of every caterpillar were measured with standard balance and ruler every day lasting for 12 days in total. Statistical analysis based on one-tailed two-sample t-test was used to make comparison of weight and length values between control group and treatment group. 

Results:
In figure 1, the mean weight of control group wasn’t statistically different from the mean weight of treatment group. (t-stat = 0.66, df = 22, P = 0.51)
In figure 2, the mean length of control group wasn’t statistically different from the mean length of treatment group. (t-stat = 0.45, df = 22, P = 0.65) 

Discussion:
The hypothesis, the Manduca sexta caterpillar will not undergo pupal eclosion and pupate if the juvenile hormone level is excessively high, is supported. From the data itself, p-values for both caterpillar length and caterpillar weight show the results are statistically insignificant, which means the null hypothesis is supported and the alternative hypothesis is rejected. However, in this experiment, the hypothesis couldn’t be fully assessed based on the recorded data, because the hypothetical statement that determines if pupal eclosion happens is subjective. Rather, the general trend of the data should be also assessed. Specifically, from both figures, the eighth day is an obvious turning point for size change of controlled caterpillars. This corresponds to the fact that caterpillars start molting. On the contrary, the size of treated caterpillars always increases, and they showed no signs of molting. In this case, determination of general trend is more effective than judging hypothesis with the data analysis only. In general, those results correspond sufficiently to previous studies that excessive amount of Juvenile hormone can inhibit Manduca sexta pupal eclosion and turn them into larger caterpillars [Frederik: 1974].Thus, understanding the mechanism of regulating Juvenile hormone level for manipulating insects’ growth can give contribution to creating and applying hormone-based insecticides, which may even replace the role of traditional toxic insecticides in the future.
