Title: A Study of the Behavior of Betta Fish to Find if Varying Color Correlates with Type and Number of Aggressive Display

Abstract:
Betta splendins are known for their aggressive displays between males. They have been helpful in past studies on animal behavior and how behavior varies under different conditions. In our experiment, we tested whether the color of a betta fish, red or blue, correlates with the aggressiveness of the fish. We assigned the signs of broadside and facing aggressions numerical values of 1 through 3. This is because different aggressive displays represent different levels of aggression in betta fish. We then recorded the aggressive behavior of the fish, took the median value of the highest trial of aggression, and calculated the significance of the data. We found that there is no significent correlation between betta color and aggressive behavior.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. It brings together observational skills from natural history, laboratory method, and insights and theories from ecology. To understand a small part of the behavior of fish we watched their responses to a stimulus. We studied the behavior of Betta splendins (betta fish), a common aquarium fish from Asia. We used betta behavior because of their colorful displays in the presence of other members of their species. This colorful display is an example of intraspecific behavior. These displays can be divided into two types: broadside movements and facing movements. Types of broadside movements in order of increasing aggressiveness are: pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing. Other agnostic or aggressive behaviors a betta may perform include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, darting, biting, and nipping an opponent. The fish who did not initiate the aggressive interaction can choose to escalate by showing another agnostic behavior of higher intensity [Johnson: 2016]. These betta fish behaviors respond to habituation where after repeated frequent exposure to a male betta separated by a clear screen, they would eventually stop attacking due to the repeated exposure [Peeke: 1970] and bettas even respond to classical conditioning, responding aggressively to light which was shown in previous trials of aggressive interactions between the betta and another fish [Thompson: 1965]. In our experiment, we tested whether the color of a betta fish, red or blue, correlates with the aggressiveness of the fish. In prior research, it was found that aggression varied as a function of color with respect to the color of the fish [Thompson 1965]. Our hypothesis was that blue betta fish would be more aggressive towards a red decoy, compared to red fish towards the same decoy because of the difference in color between the fish and the decoy.


Materials and Method:
We divided a fish tank into 3 compartments. The first compartment held a blue betta, the middle compartment held a red decoy, and the final compartment held a red betta. The compartments were divided by a removable screen making it impossible for the fish to see the decoy while the screen was in place. We assigned the signs of broadside and facing aggression numerical values of 1 through 3 in order of level of aggression. For broadside: (1) pelvic fin flicking, (2) tail beating, (3) tail flashing. For faing: (1) erect pectoral fin, (2) spreading of gill cover, (3) protruding the bronchiostegals. We then ran trials on six fish. Three of each color: red and blue. Two trials for each fish. During each trial the screen was removed for one fish and the aggressive behavior that it displayed towards the decoy was recorded. These trials lasted for 5 minutes. We then took the median value of the highest trial of aggression, ignored the other trial for analysis, and then created a box and whisker plot for that fish’s trial. We ran a 2-tailed t_test on the data to test for significance between the correlation between level of aggression and fish color towards the decoy.


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, it was found that the level of aggression displayed by each fish per trial of highest aggression was extremely variable. Red Fish 1 had a median, quartile 1 and 3 value, and minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2. Red Fish 2 showed no aggressive behavior. Red Fish 3 had a minimum aggression level of 1, a quartile 1 level of 2, and a median, quartile 3, and maximum of 3. Blue Fish 1 only displayed an aggressive level of 1. Blue Fish 2 showed a minimum, quartile 1, and median aggression level of 1, a quartile 3 level of 2 and a maximum level of 3. Blue Fish 3 showed no aggressive behavior. The aggressive behavior between red and blue fish were not significently different (t_stat = 0.707; d.f. = 4; 2-tailed p = 0.519).


Discussion:
The results show that variation between red and blue fish was not significent, seen in Figure 1. This means that neither red or blue fish acted more aggressive when in a trial with the red decoy and that our hypothesis, that blue fish would be more aggressive towards a red decoy than a red fish would be because they are of different color, was rejected. This may be due to the lack of reciprocation of aggression by the betta fish decoy used in the experiment. Habituation in betta fish has been obtained in recurring trials in past experiments [Peeke: 1970]. The lack of aggression could be because of habituation towards the decoy where after a while of the decoy not responding to aggression, the bettas simply gave up trying to provoke it. However, this would not explain why Red Fish 2 and Blue Fish 3 showed no aggressive response to the decoy. Being that classical conditioning has been found in bettas in past research [Thompson: 1965], an interesting experiment for future study would be to have a decoy in the presence of two fighting bettas and then see if this eventually conditions the betta to become aggressive around the decoy through conditioning.
