Title: Acidity and neutral soil effects on buckwheat root to shoot ratio growth

Abstract:
Under the concern what would be the optimum pH of a soil for buckwheat to grown under, an experiment was conducted where two environments were provided, varying in pH. One being more acidic at approximately pH 3, and the other being neutral at pH 7. It was predicted that the more acidic domain would result in a lower root to shoot ratio, concluded that it provided the better catalyst for nutrient absorption in the roots. Although, the end results were not numerically significent, there was a slight difference in the root to shoot ratios of the two environments; the more acidic being the lower ratio of the two. 

Introduction:
In order to learn what soil conditions provides the best outcome for buckwheat growth, two separate environments were created to expose the plant to different settings. In the concern of whether acidic conditions would develop a more conducive habitat, the two environments that were generated consisted of a neutral soil base at a pH of 7, the controll, and an acidic soil base of approximately pH 3 the independent variable. Buckwheat acts as a suitable candidate due to its durability and growth results when planted in soil with more aeration, instead of tightly packed; which for this environment, coordinates appropriately. The deciding factor of whether the acidic or neutral environment produced the most vital organism, the root to shoot ratio was applied. The root to shoot ratio is credited by the knowledge of nutrient and resource distribution by the plant. Plants are organisms that optimizes their total growth depending on their environment [Agren: 2003]. Environmental cues lead to the plant allocating its resources to the developmental stages that will produce the highest possibility of survival and reproduction [Bennett, Roberts, [Wagstaff: 2012]. When resources aren’t as readily available above ground, the plant is forced to direct a more substantial portion of its materials towards its roots, allowing them to expand further to provide the adequate supplements to sustain the plant. In habitats that are nutrient rich or provide substantial resources above ground don’t require the plant to allocate its resources towards its roots, instead, it can allow growth of the shoot. To determine whether the acidic or neutral soil provides a better domain for the root maturity, it is possible to compare the resulting ratio of the lengths of buckwheat roots and shoots. The soil that is more conducive will have a lower root to shoot ratio because the buckwheat won’t be required to allocate resources to the development of its roots. It has also been found that buckwheat absorbs more nutrients, such as P_2 O_5, Nitrogen, and K_2 O when it’s grown under more acidic circumstances [Cornell University, 2009]. Due to these results, it was hypothesized that buckwheat would have a lower root to shoot ratio when grown in soil possessing approximately a pH 3 rather than a pH of 7. This would mean, the buckwheat grown in acidic conditions would absorb more nutrients than buckwheat grown under neutral conditions as a result of not having to allocate its resources towards root growth.

Materials and Method:
The experiment began by pre-soaking the buckwheat seeds in water for thirty minutes as the planting pots were prepared. Because it is necessary to have multiple sources to draw information from, three 4x 4-inch pots were made for each pH environment, resulting in a total of six pots of vermiculite, the chosen soil. After labeling the pots appropriately by the intended pH, the pots were watered, and each had 50 Mls of miracle grow added to the vermiculite.  In each pot, twelve indentations approximately three times the size of the buckwheat seed were made in the vermiculite in three rows of four. A seed was placed in each indentation of each pot before being covered with vermiculite. Two large black trays constructed with holes in the base were used to hold the two separate pH domains. 
The following two weeks, once a day, the pots were watered, the pH 7 controll with neutral water and the acidic environment with a solution of a 3.6 pH. After the week had passed, the plants were collected. From each pot, nine buckwheat plants were removed with care to not damage the roots or shoots of the plant. After the dirt was removed, each individual plant was weighed. After recording the data of the whole individual organism, the plant was separated where the root connected to the shoot of the plant. The shoot was then weighed. Using the recorded shoot weight, it was possible to calculate the root weight as well. From each set of nine from each pot, the maximum root and shoot length were then recorded to the nearest mm. 


Results:
The t value was reported to be 1.022786 and the p value .206989. The data resulting in a slight variation in root to shoot ratio of the two separate pH environments.


Discussion:
As seen in the results, there is a slight difference in in the root to shoot ratio of buckwheat found in the two separate environments of the vermiculite. The ratio found with a pH of approximately 3 is slightly lower than that of pH 7 as hypothesized, but when evaluating the p_value, the results show there is no significance difference. Therefore, the stated hypothesized is not supported, despite the slight variation. The variation more than likely developed from the slightly more efficient absorption provided by the acidic domain [Cornell University, 2009]. Possible explanations as to why it didn’t produce a significent difference and support the hypothesis could result from the acidic solution being to strong; in other words, the pH was too low to cultivate a shoot to shoot ratio that was expected by preventing optimum nutrients absorption. It could also relate back to the initial days where watering was taking place. There was a slight flaw due to environmental issues that prevented the buckwheat plants from receiving water and acidic solutions for up to two days. In the future, it would be beneficial to provide an addition subject that’s exposed to a pH between the two chosen, approximately pH 3 and pH 7, to allow insight as to if the solution was truly too acidic to allow optimum nutrient absorption and result in a lower root to shoot ratio.
