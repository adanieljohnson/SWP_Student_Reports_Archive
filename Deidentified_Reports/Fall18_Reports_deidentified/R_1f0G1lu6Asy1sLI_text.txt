Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Oilseed Radish Root:Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of light on oilseed radishes, also known as raphanus sativus, root:shoot ratios were tested. It was hypothesized that the radishes grown in sunlight would have smaller root:shoot ratios than those of radishes grown in shade. The hypothesis was based on a past experiment that confirmed that the root:shoot ratio would be higher than in plants that received less nutrients. 40 radish seeds were planted, with half exposed to sunlight and the other half constantly under shade. The mean difference was significent for the weight of radishes (t_test=1.93, d.f.=22, p=0.03), and the mean difference was not significent for the length of radishes (t_stat=1.33, d.f.=22, p=0.010). The hypothesis was rejected, as the mean difference of weight and length for the radishes grown in the light was larger than of radishes grown in the shade.

Introduction:
Plants need various resources, like sunlight and water, to create a product, whether it be a leaf or a root system [Bloom: 1985]. The plants take the resources and allocate them to either the roots, the leaves, and the roots [Weiner: 2004]. This action is better known as resource allocation. The amount of resources in a particular area, like sunlight or soil, affects where the plant decides to allocate its resources. In a previous lab it was discovered that a lack of nutrients causes a larger root:shoot ratio in Buckwheat due to less resource allocation going to roots unless there was a significent amount of necessary resources in the soil. The purpose of root:shoot ratios is to measure the biomasses of vegetation and can be used for various plants, and so it was used on the radishes to best determine the effects of sunlight in weight and length [Mokany: 2005]. Radishes grow during the day, which is when they acquire resources from the sunlight necessary for them to do photosynthesis. When a plant does not receive enough sunlight the production of an enzyme vital to carbon fixation decreases, causing more of the plants resources to be dedicated towards the shoots [Bazzaz: 1997]. Sunlight is not the only source of carbon, but if there is any carbon deficiency than the plants will focus its recourses to the growth of shoots and leaves [Coleman: 1989]. Based on that information, it is hypothesized that radishes planted in sunlight will have smaller root:shoot ratios will be smaller than radishes grown in constant shade.

Materials and Method:
Forty radish seeds were acquired for the experiment, along with eight dishes with which to plant the radish seeds in. 5 radish seeds were planted in each plate and covered with soil, before being watered. Then the 8 plates were placed together on a tray. 4 dishes, or 20 radish seeds, were placed under a shade to prevent them from gaining sunlight, whilst the other 4 dishes were placed where the seeds would be able to receive sunlight. Each day, for two weeks, the radishes were watered. At the end of two weeks, 3 plants from each replicate, or dish, were harvested and their shoots and roots were separated at the beginning of the root. Then each individual root and shoot was then weighed, in grams, and measured, in centimeters. This was to determine the root:shoot ratio of the radishes. Two-tailed two-sample t_tests were used for the length and weight.

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio of the length of the radishes in the sunlight was 2.09 +/- 0.84 (figure 2). The mean root:shoot ratio of the length of the radishes in the shade was 1.65 +/- 0.81 (figure 1). The mean difference was not significent for the length (t_stat=1.33, d.f.=22, p=0.010). The mean root:shoot ratio of the weight of the radishes in the sunlight was 0.29 +/- 0.14. The mean of the root:shoot ratio of the weight of the radishes in the shade was 0.18 +/- 0.12. The mean difference was significent for the weight (t_test=1.93, d.f.=22, p=0.03). More radishes overall grew in the sunlight than they did in the shade. The standard deviation of weight was higher than that of length.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that radishes grown in sunlight would have a lower mean root:shoot  ratio was rejected. While I believed that the radishes in the shade would be taller than those in the sunlight, since lack of sunlight affects carbon fixation, it was rejected as the plants in the sunlight were taller than those not in the sunlight [Bazzaz: 1997]. The mean difference for length and weight for radishes grown in the sunlight was larger than those of radishes grown in the shade. A significent difference was in the weight but not the length of radishes, so sunlight did not affect the length but did affect the weight of radishes. A possible explanation is that the seed of a radish is grown underneath the soil, and the radishes allocate more resources to the roots regardless of nutrient availability. It is a part of the deep root growth system [Jacobs]. Also, the radishes were only planted for two weeks and likely were not able to reach maturity. To improve the experiment, radishes could be placed in constant shade and constant sunlight, as in the greenhouse the radishes able to retrieve sunlight did not have constant sunlight, but only partial. Also, the experiment could be more focused on the weight of radishes than the weight and length, as, the length was not significent, and I have learned that radishes that receive too much shade will allocate their resources to the leaves rather than their roots or their shoots. Another potential issue was the greenhouse may have been too hot for the radishes to efficiently grow.  Radishes are best grown in cooler temperatures. A final improvement upon the experiment would be to allow the radishes to grow for a longer period, as radishes are supposed to be planted four to six weeks before being harvested. In conclusion, the radishes growing in sunlight have larger root:shoot ratios for length and width than radishes grown in the shade.
