Title: Carbon dioxide does not affect the rate of the Hill reaction in the isolated chloroplasts of spinach leaves

Abstract:
The Hill reaction occurs in isolated chloroplasts where DCIP is reduced and oxygen formation occurs. This experiment aimed to analyze the effect of carbon dioxide on the Hill reaction. We hypothesized that an increase in carbon dioxide concentration would result in a faster rate of reaction in the Hill reaction. Using the isolated chloroplasts of spinach leaves, we compared the rate of the Hill reaction in three environments, distilled water, a 1:1 mixture of distilled and carbonated water, and carbonated water. Three one-sample ANOVA tests were performed, each of which had a p value of greater than 0.05. This supported the null hypothesis. It is important to continue research on photosynthetic reactions in plants under different environmental conditions. In the future researchers should continue to study the effect of carbon dioxide on chemical reactions and oxygen production in plants, as this is particularly relevant in relation to global warming.

Introduction:
In plants chloroplasts are the site of many photochemical reactions that result in the accumulation of sugars, ATP, and oxygen. Photosynthesis converts light, carbon dioxide, and water into chemical energy that can be stored in plant cells. This process occurs in two stages, the first of which takes place in photosystem I and photosystem II, which are membrane proteins made up of multiple subunits. Reactions at the photosystem II complex occur in the innermost membrane of the chloroplast, the thylakoid membrane [Barber: 1992]. Photons from sunlight trigger a series of chemical reactions that results in the splitting of water molecules. The products of this are molecular oxygen and protons that can be used to form an electrochemical gradient. In photosystem I photons excite electrons in chlorophyll which are used to produce NADPH and ATP [Adam: 2003]. The second stage of this process is light independent and is called the Calvin cycle where carbon dioxide fixation produces carbohydrates [Iwasa: 2016]]. Through experimentation researchers discovered that isolated chloroplasts in a laboratory can react with certain reagents, known as Hill reagents, to produce oxygen. Similar to photosynthesis in nature, the Hill reaction is light dependent and involves the transfer of electrons in water. However, the Hill reactions differs slightly from photosynthesis in that it involves the use of an artificial electron receptor, rather than NADP in photosynthesis. The Hill reagent DCIP acts as the electron acceptor, and it is especially useful in laboratory settings because of its blue color. Initially this reagent is blue, but as it is reduced it becomes clear in color, allowing researchers to track the rate of the reaction. Because the Hill reaction results in a color change, it can be measured using a spectrophotometer to find absorbance, where decreases in absorbance correspond to an increase in reduction, and therefore the rate of the Hill reaction [Miami University].  In this experiment we wanted to determine how the addition of carbon dioxide to this reaction affects the rate of the Hill reaction. The Hill reactions mimics the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in which electrons are transferred from water to oxygen. However, the process in which carbon dioxide is fixed to form sugars in light-independent. Prior studies indicate that carbon dioxide may increase the rate of reaction. In one study researchers found that an increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the Hill reaction increased the production of oxygen only slightly. However, under laboratory conditions this effect was observed consistently [Abeles: 1961]. They hypothesized that carbon dioxide could act as a catalyst in some of the photolytic reactions that occur during electron transfer.  A study performed by Norman E. Good also confirmed these results, however it was unclear if carbon dioxide plays a similar role in the Hill reaction and in photosynthesis [Good: 1963]. Carbon dioxide is necessary for the light-independent Calvin cycle, but this research could indicate that carbon dioxide also plays a role in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.  Due to the similarities between the Hill reaction and photosynthetic reactions and the results observed in previous studies, we predicted that an increase in carbon dioxide concentration would also increase the rate of the Hill reaction, resulting in a decrease in absorbance.

Materials and Methods:
We prepared isolated chloroplasts by removing the central veins of four spinach leaves, and then grinding those leaves into a paste with 10mL of grinding solution (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) in a mortar and pestle. After the paste was formed, we added an additional 10mL of grinding buffer and then strained the mixture through a cheese cloth. The filtrate was put into a centrifuge tube and spun in the centrifuge at 4°C and 200(G) for a total of 3 minutes. The liquid contents of that tube were poured into a second centrifuge tube. The second centrifuge tube was then spun in the centrifuge at 4°C and 1000(G) for 10 minutes. The solid portion of the mixture was collected and then mixed with 20mL of grinding solution. We then prepared the two experimental groups, control group, and blank for our experiment. Carbonated water was used as the source of carbon dioxide. We prepared a blank sample for the spectrophotometer, which contained 8mL of distilled water and 2mL of reaction buffer. We prepared three control group test tubes, which contained 6mL of distilled water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, and 2mL of reaction buffer. We also designed two experimental groups. The first group of three test tubes had 3mL of distilled water, 3mL of carbonated water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, and 2mL of reaction buffer. The second and final experimental group consisted on three test tubes, each containing 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 6mL of carbonated water.   100 μl of chloroplasts were added to each of the ten tubes. The absorbance of each test tube was measured at 600nm and recorded as “absorbance at T0.”  The ten cuvettes were placed on a rack in the windowsill so that they were exposed to sunlight. Then their absorbance was measured again after 10 minutes. This procedure was repeated until we had absorbance measurements at 20 minutes and 30 minutes. We then calculated % change between each ten-minute time interval (0-10 minutes, 10-20 minutes, and 20-30 minutes) for each test tube.   Three one sample ANOVA tests were performed to analyze this data. The first compared the percent change between each group at 0 and 10 minutes. The second compared percent change between 10 and 20 minutes. The third compared percent change between 20 and 30 minutes [Johnson: 2016].

Results:
The control group started with the highest absorbance, and experimental group one had the lowest absorbance (table 1). Over the course of 30 minutes each group showed an overall decrease in absorbance; however, each group had a slight increase in absorbance between 10 and 20 minutes. In general, the control group showed the highest average absorbance values, followed by experimental group 2 and then experimental group one, which had a slightly lower absorbance than that of experimental group 1.   In the first interval from 0 minutes to 10 minutes, every group had a negative percent change in absorbance, with experimental group 2 having the greatest decrease (Figure 1). However, during the second ten-minute interval from 10 minutes to 20 minutes, the experimental groups had a positive percent change in absorbance. Finally, in the third ten-minute interval from 20 minutes to 30 minutes, every group displayed a negative percent change in absorbance; however, the percent decrease was approximately equal in each group.   Four ANOVA tests were performed. One analyzed the percent change in absorbance between 0 and 10 minutes and had a p value of 0.503. The second analyzed the percent change in absorbance between 10 minutes and 20 minutes and had a p value of 0.313. The third analyzed the percent change in absorbance between 20 and 30 minutes and had a p value of 0.974.

Discussion:
The data collected in this experiment supported the null hypothesis, as the three p values were greater than 0.05, meaning the data was not significant. There are several possible explanations for this. When we performed the experiment, we noticed that the addition of carbonated water in the experimental tubes resulted in a color change from blue to purple. This could be because the carbon dioxide reduced the pH of the solution. This occurs because when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, it will form carbonic acid, which increases the acidity of that solution [Doney: 2009]. This color change could have impacted the absorbance measurements of those test tubes, as a spectrophotometer measures the absorbance of visible light at a particular wavelength, and this can change depending on color. However, this experimental flaw can be easily corrected. In one experiment regarding the effect of carbon dioxide on the Hill reaction, researchers introduced a 6.8 pH buffer to the reaction to control for potential changes in acidity due to the introduction of carbon dioxide. They continued to monitor pH throughout the entirety of the experiment to ensure it remained unchanged. The results of this experiment indicated that carbon dioxide did increase oxygen production in the Hill reaction even when pH was controlled [Stern: 1962].   A biological explanation for these results could be that carbon dioxide does not play the same role in the Hill reaction as it does in photosynthesis, and therefore is not necessary. The Hill reaction does not involve the fixation of carbon to form sugars, which is one role of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide may not influence the light-dependent portion of photosynthesis that is similar to the Hill reaction. In addition, the artificial electron acceptor used during the Hill reaction experiments could have an effect on the role of carbon dioxide. Further experimentation should be done with other artificial electron acceptors to determine if this influences the role of carbon dioxide in the rate of reaction.  It is also possible that other environmental conditions have a greater effect on the Hill reactions than carbon dioxide availability, including temperature, ion concentrations, pH, and availability of light. In one experiment, researchers found that an increased temperature lowers the activation energy of the Hill reaction, therefore increasing the rate of reduction of DCIP [Nolan: 1976]. In the future researchers must continue to study the effects of abiotic factors on Hill reactions in chloroplasts, including that of carbon dioxide. As the concentration of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, increases in the atmosphere the oceans are absorbing more carbon dioxide, resulting in a decrease in pH. This acidification of the ocean could affect the photosynthetic activities of marine autotrophs, such as algae. A better understanding of the impact of carbon dioxide on chemical reactions in chloroplasts could allow us to make predictions about the effect of global warming on plant life.
