Title: Effects of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction in a Rana pipiens Leg

Abstract:
In this experiment, lidocaine was injected into both the thigh and gastrocnemius muscles of three Rana pipiens legs. The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of lidocaine injections on the contractile function of the leg of a Rana pipiens, when the sciatic nerve was stimulated at various intensities. Lidocaine is known to inhibit the release of sodium ions in muscle fibers. It was thus predicted that in the absence of sodium ions, no depolarization or therefore action potential, would be produced in the muscle fiber, inhibiting the release of calcium ions that would otherwise initiate the muscle’s contractile mechanism. The treated Rana pipiens legs were observed to produce significantly smaller muscle responses to the same stimuli, as they did prior to their treatment of lidocaine. 


Introduction:
In an untreated muscle, sodium channels are opened in muscle fibers when nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine, ACh, which then binds to a receptor on the membrane. The sodium channels on the membrane then open, producing an action potential and causing it to spread throughout the muscle fiber. This action potential then stimulates the opening of calcium channels, activating the muscle fiber’s contractile mechanism. 
Lidocaine is substance, that when injected into the muscle, acts as a sodium channel blocker, inhibiting the release of sodium ions that would otherwise lead to the activation of a muscle fiber’s contractile mechanism. The inhibition of action potential propagation leads to the paralyzation of muscle function [Lee: 2008][Ruben: 2008]. We hypothesize that if sodium channels are blocked in the Rana pipiens leg by injections of lidocaine, the muscle contractile force will be reduced relative to that of an untreated muscle because if sodium channels are blocked, an action potential would not spread throughout the length of the muscle fiber, therefore calcium channels necessary for the activation of the contractile mechanism, will not be opened. 


Materials and Methods:
Three Rana pipiens legs were placed on a tray, then de-gloved and partially dissected, so as to reveal the sciatic nerve. Once exposed, the sciatic nerve was pulled away from the neighboring muscles. Gastrocnemius muscles were detached at the achilles tendon, leaving enough of the achilles tendon attached to the gastrocnemius, to tie a string. Using the string, the gastrocnemius was suspended from the transducer at a 90° angle, using metal pins to secure the leg against the tray. The leg was connected to the needle probe by draping the sciatic nerve across the needles. 
A stimulus was delivered to the nerve beginning at an amplitude of 0.0V and increasing in 0.1V increments until 0.5V, after which, increase stimulus in 1.0V increments up to 5.0V. Once this was done in all three of the untreated legs, 0.1ml of 25mm lidocaine was injected into various regions of the gastrocnemius muscle, as well as 0.1ml of 25mm lidocaine, into the thigh muscle. The process of preparing the leg for stimulus was repeated and the stimuli was delivered in the same amounts of voltage. All data was recorded, and a paired t-test was run to compare the responses of the treated and untreated groups.


Results:
With a stimulus amplitude of 0.0V, neither of the legs registered any muscle activity. As the intensity of the stimulus increased, the muscles of both the experimental and control groups responded. The  muscle responses of the untreated group increased drastically following the first application of the stimulus, meanwhile following the treatment of the legs with lidocaine, the muscles responded much less to the same stimulus intensities, as seen in Figure 2 above. Both leg 1 and 2 registered similar muscle responses, both while treated and untreated, however leg 3, registered a relatively lower muscle response prior to the treatment of lidocaine, as indicated by Figure 1. A paired t-test was run. The mean recorded muscle responses of the legs prior to and following an injection of lidocaine, were statistically significantly different (t-stat = 8.481, df = 9, P = 1.38x10^-5).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that if sodium channels are blocked in the Rana pipiens leg by injections of lidocaine, the muscle contractile force will be reduced relative to that of an untreated muscle, was supported. The determined P-value indicates a statistically significant difference, suggesting that the blocking of sodium channels leads to a decrease in the contractile force of a muscle. 
The untreated legs produced much larger muscle responses to the various amplitudes of stimuli, than the treated legs did. This is because when stimulated, the applied stimulus allows for the release of sodium ions through voltage gated sodium channels. This leads to a depolarization of the membrane, causing an action potential to spread the length of a muscle fiber. This action potential then leads to the opening of calcium channels that trigger the initiation of the muscle’s contractile mechanism. 
When treated with lidocaine, the legs are unable to produce the same muscle response. The contractile force of the muscle is reduced as the lidocaine inhibits the release of sodium ions, resulting in the significantly lower muscle responses shown above. The inhibition of action potential propagation leads to the paralyzation of muscle function [Lee: 2008][Ruben: 2008]. 
The next logical step for this experiment would be to inject differing amounts of lidocaine into the legs. By doing this, the significance of the sodium channel inhibition caused by the lidocaine injections, would become more clear.
