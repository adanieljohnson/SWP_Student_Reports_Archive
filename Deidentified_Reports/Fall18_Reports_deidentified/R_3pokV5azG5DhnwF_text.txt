Title: Extracellular Potassium Shows No Significance on Action Potential Threshold of Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is an extremely important topic in physiology because it helps to explain the movement and perception of many organisms.  I looked at the effect of extracellular potassium on the action potential threshold of the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle.  I thought that the added potassium into the frog’s leg would increase the threshold for action potential.  However, my paired t test showed that my results were not significent though there seemed to be a trend towards an increased threshold for my experimental trials.  This emphasizes that threshold is likely not affected by extracellular potassium and that the trend in the results was likely attributed to chance.  

Introduction:
Organisms use nerves and muscles to sense and respond to different internal and external environments.  The neuromuscular system is composed of millions of neurons and muscle fibers that can respond within milliseconds and are unique to animals.  Skeletal muscle consists of thousands of myofibers bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups.  Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, whose axons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions.  “During this process the extracellular calcium influx into terminal brings the acetylcholine vesicle to merge into the presynaptic membrane. In addition, the acetylcholine will bind to the nicotinic Ach receptors which increase the sodium entry into the muscle fiber and cause a graded depolarization.  The depolarization then can travel down to the muscle fiber and activate the ryanodine receptor. Because of opened ryanodine receptor, sarcoplasmic reticulum releases the calcium into the cytoplasm. Consequently, it increases intracellular calcium level, binds to troponin, removes the tropomyosin from blocking the actin-myosin binding site and allows for the contraction of the muscle. A single action potential or a direct stimulation elicits a twitch, small muscle contraction” (Sherwood, 2010).  The threshold of a nerve cell is the amount of stimulation(voltage) it takes to cause a positive feedback loop and send an action potential from the axon hillock to the axon terminal.  “Electrical nerve impulses at these junctions cause the opening of sodium channels that generate an action potential, another electrical impulse that spreads throughout the length of the fiber and stimulates the release of calcium; which then activates the contraction of a muscle fiber and shortens it” (Johnson 2016).  I dissected frog legs and isolated the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve to see how electrical pulses work in the muscle.  I chose to use a frog for its very developed gastrocnemus muscle.   Studying the neuromuscular system of the frog leg muscle is important because it helps us better understand how the neuromuscular system works in humans.  I tested whether adding potassium to the gastrocnemus muscle would have any effect in its ability to conduct action potentials.  I hypothesized that injecting potassium into the muscle would increase the action potential threshold.  



Materials and Method:
I was given three frog legs by my lab instructor which I kept moist through the entire experiment using a ringer solution.  With a scalpel, I first exposed the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemus muscle.  After exposing the muscle, I tied a piece of string around the muscle and suspended it, so it was hanging from the electrophysiological recorder.  I then added the electrode probe and placed it on the exposed sciatic nerve.  I used iworx software to conduct electrical currents to the nerve and to analyze the electromyograms created by the electrical stimulus.  We repeated these electrical currents to the nerve, lowering the power of the current each time until I found the point where the muscle did not respond to the stimulus.   That value was recorded for the threshold for action potentials to generate in the sciatic nerve.  This process served as our controll.  I then injected .5 Ml of potassium solution into each frog leg muscle and then repeated the process of electrical stimulations to find the threshold.  I then used a paired t test to analyze the results.  

Results:
My first frog leg had a threshold of .03 volts and after adding potassium had a threshold of .025 volts.  My second leg’s threshold was .075 volts and after adding the potassium was .082 volts.  My third leg had a threshold of .093 volts and after adding potassium was .13 volts.  The average before treatment threshold was .066 volts and the average threshold after potassium was injected was .079.  Two out of the three frog leg muscles had a higher action potential threshold value after the potassium was added to the muscle.  There seems to be a trend that the potassium I added increased the threshold of the nerve to send an action potential.  I conducted a paired t test where I found that the average difference in threshold before and after treatment was .016 volts (T= .933, d.f.= 1, P= .522).  At the p=.05 level this is not significent.



Discussion:
At the P=.05 level these results are not significent.  This means that the difference in my threshold value before and after potassium was injected was likely due to chance and not the potassium.  This does not support my hypothesis that adding potassium into the gastrocnemus muscle will increase the action potential threshold.  It is also important to note that our frog legs were extremely sensitive compared to prior experience and could have impacted my results.  One reason the thresholds could have increased is that the muscle had tired out slightly requiring a higher voltage to stimulate contraction.  According to Physiology of the Heart Muscle, “increased extracellular potassium levels result in depolarization of the membrane potentials of cells due to the increase in the equilibrium potential of potassium. This depolarization opens some voltage-gated sodium channels, but also increases the inactivation at the same time” (Katz 2001).  This explains why I didn’t see a large discrepancy in the threshold.  This experiment could be better by increasing the number of trials by adding more frog legs, however I was not able to given the limited resources in the lab. The next step for this experiment would be to test whether an increase extracellular sodium would increase the action potential threshold of the frog leg muscle.
