Title: Effects of Increased Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this Experiment, the Manduca Sexta caterpillar, which is considered a pest because of how they eat crops, was studied to see how Juvenile Hormone affected its development. We believed if the amount of Juvenile Hormone was increased, then the Manduca Sexta will gain weight. This was achieved by having a control group in which Manduca Sexta received only water with food and an experimental group in which Manduca Sexta received food with 5% Juvenile Hormone. Our data showed a significant difference in weight among the Manduca Sexta exposed to more Juvenile Hormone, and this shows that Juvenile Hormone has an impact on development of Manduca Sexta. 

Introduction:
Hormones are in charge of many specific things in living organisms, with one of those being growth. Along these lines, the amount of hormones available can change how an organism grows. One way that an insect’s growth is measured is through their molt. Molting allows insects to change their shape and achieve their adult stages [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment shows how hormones control molting in Manduca Sexta, or the tobacco hornworm [Johnson, 2018]. Manduca Sexta is used as a model organism for this experiment because they are considered pests for crops like tobacco, so understanding their hormone levels could help solve how to keep them from being pests. There are two hormones involved in the molting of Manduca Sexta, Ecdysterone effecting the timing of the molt and Juvenile Hormone effecting the type of molt [Johnson, 2018]. Both of these hormones play a key role in large role in development, mainly at different times in the life cycle of Manduca Sexta. This experiment changes the amount of Juvenile Hormone available to Manduca Sexta, as this should lead to a change in the relation to normal development. If the amount of Juvenile Hormone is increased, then the Manduca Sexta will gain weight. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment was performed by obtaining eight Manduca Sexta. Four were given 10g of food each with five drops of water added to food and placed into a container separating all four. The other four were given the same amount of food, but their food had five drops of 5% Juvenile Hormone added to it to see how this effected weight and were placed into a container separating all four. Both groups of the Manduca Sexta were placed into an incubator which kept them both at the same temperature with the same amount of light available. Each Manduca Sexta was weighed every day with a standard lab balance to see weight change over a period of fifteen days. Three days of measurements were missed due to weather. Pictures were taken daily as well to record the size change in the Manduca Sexta. A one-tail two sample t-test was performed to compare the mean change in weight of both groups of Manduca Sexta. 

Results:
The mean average change in the control group was 6.06 grams and for the experimental group was 13.7775 grams (Figure 1). The standard deviation of the control group was 4.089 and the experimental group standard deviation was 1.271. The one-tailed p-value was 0.005651 which is less than 0.05, meaning the results did not happen by chance. The weights of each Manduca Sexta was recorded daily (Figure 2). On the final day of observations, the experimental group showed a much whiter shade then the control group, which looked like a normal shade of green. The experimental group gained much more weight than the control group, as seen in figure two. Both groups of Manduca Sexta lost weight on days thirteen and fourteen. The control group had one Manduca Sexta die after three days and the remaining three pupated. None of the experimental group Manduca Sexta pupated. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that if the amount of Juvenile Hormone increased then the Manduca Sexta will gain weight was supported. The one tailed p-value was a statistically significant result, meaning that the results did not occur by chance. These results make sense because the presence of this hormone exerts a biochemical restraint on the cellular transformations responsible for the metamorphosis of the insect as a whole [Williams: 1956]. The results we achieved make sense as Juvenile Hormone does not allow Manduca Sexta to develop into an adult. This proves our hypothesis, as we increased the amount of Juvenile Hormone, and our Manduca Sexta in our experimental group gained weight. Due to this increase in Juvenile Hormone and weight gain, they were not able to molt. Also, since the Manduca Sexta in our control group were exposed to normal levels of Juvenile Hormone, they only gained the average amount of weight and did molt, further proving our hypothesis. Since it is known that Juvenile Hormone prohibits Manduca Sexta from becoming an adult, there is no need to find another way to perform this experiment. Also, the results can be used for application in life. Since Manduca Sexta is a pest, if there could be a way to decrease the amounts of Juvenile Hormone they obtain, whether that be through a pesticide or something else, then they would achieve adulthood sooner and would not be a pest to crops. Also, with the results we obtained, it shows that understanding the levels of hormones in Manduca Sexta could lead to a deeper knowledge of hormones in all insects, which could be a breakthrough in insect studies relating to development and the creation of new pesticides to treat crops and limit damage from insects.

Weights were measured daily on a standard lab scale. Each bar is mean of mean change in weight of four Manduca Sexta over 15 day period with a standard deviation of ±4.089 (control) and ±1.271 (experimental). Figure 2.
