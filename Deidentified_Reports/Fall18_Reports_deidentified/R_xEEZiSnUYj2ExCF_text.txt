Title: Implications of Decision Making of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum are acellular organisms that are capable of complex behaviors. We conducted this experiment in the hopes of further understanding the general biological basis of decision making using this lower level organism. To do so, the behaviors of chemotaxis and phototaxis were observed. We created an environment of complete darkness, but with light directly over a food source: glucose. This environment produced a situation where the organism had to make a decision between nutrition or darkness as light creates a hostile environment for the Physarum. We hypothesized that the slime mold would decide to travel toward the glucose despite the presence of light. Using a one-tailed two sample T-test to analyze the distance migrated by the Physarum, we found our results supported our hypothesis. We were successful in substantiating the ability of Physarum polycephalum to make decisions. Physarum is the model organism to view decision making. There is currently a general understanding that decision making occurs due to signal transduction pathways, but Physarum can be utilized to further study the basis of decision making in more complex organisms. 

Introduction:
	Signal transduction is the process by which organisms respond to their environment using chemical and physical signals. This process is incredibly diverse and essential to every living organism as it allows the organism to detect, amplify, and integrate a signal into its behavior. On a chemical level, a stimulus reaches a receptor of a cell and triggers a cascade of protein responses which ultimately cause the cell to change its behavior in order to respond to the initial stimulus. In order to further explore the implications of signal transduction, we observed the cellular behaviors of Physarum polycephalum as they are much like that of a human cell. In addition to being easy to cultivate, Physarum are the ideal model organism to use to observe cell-level processes without a microscope.
	Physarum polycephalum are unexpectedly complex organisms that thrive in dark, humid environments. These organisms are able to move in response to their environment despite their lack of nervous system. This species of slime mold is a multinucleate syncytium, meaning it is a mass of several nuclei or plasmodium within a single plasma membrane. All of the nuclei of the Physarum undergo mitosis in synchrony in order to respond to their environment [Alim: 2013]. Physarums’ behavior is regulated by two major receptors: G proteins and ions. In each case, an external stimulus activates the receptor. A cascade of proteins are activated, releasing a second messenger molecule. This molecule actually triggers the response pathway and binds to an effector which is a molecule that selectively binds to proteins and regulates activities including: enzymatic activity, gene expression, and cell signaling [Berg: 2002].
	One of the many behaviors Physarum displays is chemotaxis, meaning it responds to the concentration of certain molecules in its environment [Alim: 2013]. For example, if food is present the Physarum may display positive chemotaxis by extending the actin microfilaments of its leading edge and migrating toward the food source by expanding its network. This response is due to cytoplasmic streaming, cytoplasmic streaming is the bidirectional flow of ions, water, and protein resulting in the contraction and relaxation of actin microfilaments and subsequent movement of the organism’s network [Yoshiyama: 2010]. Physarum not only have the ability to respond to the concentration of molecules present in their environment, but they also have the ability to respond to the light conditions of their environment. Physarum prefer dark environments in order to avoid losing moisture and hardening into a hibernative structure called sclerotium. 
	In a study conducted on Physarum polycephalum, two different paths toward a food source were created: one dark and stable, yet far from a food source and one intermittently lit but far closer to a food source. It was found that the Physarum would in fact travel the intermittently lit route as they were capable of reaching the food source more efficiently. Given their extremely simple morphology, Physarum were able to navigate the dynamic environment by extending actin microfilaments and essentially were able to make a decision [Meyer: 2017]. This study inspired us to further explore the implications of signal transduction pathways of the Physarum in relation to decision making. 
	We tested the effect of light directly over a food source, glucose. We then hypothesized that the Physarum would migrate toward the food source, despite the presence of the light. Two controll groups of completely dark and completely lit environments were created to compare the migration of the Physarum in the experimental partially lit environment. The purpose of this experiment is to further understand the decision-making capabilities of the Physarum polycephalum as well as the basic mechanisms used by organisms to make decisions in general.

Materials and Method:
We first created nine water agar plates by melting 1% water agar in a microwave. Then, 20 Ml of melted agar was mixed with with 1 Ml of 20X compound. The mixture was allowed to cool to 50C and poured in a 100 mm petri plate to cool and harden. We then created a glucose plate by melting 1% water agar with 1 Ml of 20 mM glucose and mixing it with 20 Ml of agar. The mixture was allowed to cool to 50C and poured in a 100 mm petri plate to cool and harden. A plate with of Physarum polycephalum was provided. Using a sterilized spatula and forceps, two 1 cm x 1cm wells were cut out of each water agar plate. One well was then filled with a 1 cm square of glucose medium and the other was filled with a 1 cm square of Physarum. When cutting the Physarum square, we ensured to cut an area free of waste with dense yellow color, indicating the presence of the organism. Once all nine plates were prepared, three plates were covered in aluminum foil to mimic dark conditions. Three plates were not wrapped in aluminum foil and placed in an incubator with light to mimic bright conditions. The remaining three plates were our designated experimental plates. These were covered with aluminum foil, and using scissors a small hole was cut right above the well containing the glucose medium. The plates were then left to respond to the conditions for approximately 72 hours. We then measured the distance the Physarum travelled as well as the direction of the migration. To analyze the significance of the data, we performed a one-tailed two sample T-test between each group.

Results:
Our results support our hypothesis that the Physarum would migrate toward the glucose despite the presence of light directly over it. As shown by Figure 1, the slime mold in the controll dark environment moved an average distance very similar to that of the slime mold in the experimental environment and the slime mold in the controll light environment exhibited little to no movement. We obtained a large P-value of 0.471 between the controll dark and experimental plates meaning there was not a significent difference between the behaviors of the slime mold in each plate. We obtained significent P-values of 0.0141 and 0.0065 when comparing the controll light plates to both the dark and experimental plates, meaning there was a significent difference between the distance migrated from the controll light plate. 

Discussion:
	How organisms make decisions is largely unknown on a scientific level. According to a study researching cellular decision-making ranging from microbes to mammals, it was found that regulatory networks, more specifically signal transduction pathways, found in lower level organisms including viruses and yeasts underlie the most basic cellular processes of some of the most complex organisms [Balázsi: 2011]. The purpose of this experiment was to observe decision making in a lower level organism in the hopes of further understanding the cellular basis of decision making that encompasses all organisms. 
	To observe decision making we utilized the natural aversion to light and the instinct to forage of Physarum polycephalum. We created an experimental environment completely in the dark, but with light over a food source and compared the migration of the organism to two controll environments of complete dark and complete light. We hypothesized that despite the presence of light, the Physarum would make the decision to travel toward the food source. Our hypothesis was supported by our data as the Physarum travelled toward the glucose in the same fashion as the Physarum in the controll dark environment.
	We were able to substantiate Physarums’ ability to not only allocate its biomass in order to respond to nutrients in its environment through chemotaxis, but also its ability to weigh the risk involved in its foraging. In a study concentrated on the sophistication of the slime mold, it was confirmed that Physarum are capable of behaviors including: finding the most efficient path through a maze, solving computationally difficult puzzles, and even behaving irrationally. Given that the signal transduction pathways utilized by this organism are readily observable the slime mold is the ideal decision-making system [Beekerman: 2015]. Unlike in our experiment, the Physarum in this study were starved in order to further motivate them to perform. Perhaps if we had starved our slime mold we would have seen more distinct and consistent migration patterns resulting in smaller uncertainty values. 
Although our experiment was successful in that we obtained statistically significent results, we did experience discrepancies in the migration of the Physarum. This could be due to systematic errors in the cultures provided causing normal growth to shut down. Another source of error could have been inaccurate placement of light over the glucose as it was difficult to gauge where the glucose medium was placed once the plate was covered in aluminum foil. In the future, we could increase the number of replicates in each environment making our data more reliable and perhaps creating a more clear migration pattern. 
	The parallel in between the decision making process of slime mold and that of brains in more complex organisms is evident. In each case, separate interactions of proteins in cells through signal transduction pathways accumulate evidence for alternative choices. Once the population of a certain signal reaches a threshold, a decision is made toward whatever stimulus may be present [Marshall: 2009]. Even though morphology varies greatly from organism to organism, all of our decisions are cellularly derived. By studying Physarum polycephalum we can find answers to how information is propagated within the cell and how activities are coordinated in cell. Physarum have the potential to reveal how all organisms make decisions on a cellular level.
