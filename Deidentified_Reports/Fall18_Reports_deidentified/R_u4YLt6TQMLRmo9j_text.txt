Title: The Negative Effects of Azaguard on Manduca Sexta Growth

Abstract:
The aspect of the Manduca Sexta hormone system that we wanted to test was the levels of E20, the hormone that controlls molting in insects. We wanted to see if they were exposed to an E20 inhibitor, if they would go through thr 5th instar of development or not, due to the change of hormone levels. Azagaurd was chosen as the E20 inhibitor to be used in the experiment. The Manduca Sexta caterpillars selected to be treated with Azagaurd showed obvious signs of stunted growth compared to their non-treated counterparts; their masses did not increase as much as the controll group. The experimental group of caterpillars also all died before the final weigh-in, while three out of the four controll caterpillars pupated. The two-tailed t test containing our caterpillar weight data supported our hypothesis by having a t-value that was less than =0.05, displaying the fact that Azagaurd had a negative effect on the experimental caterpillars. 


Introduction:
Manduca sexta moths experience multiple phases of development before they reach their final adult state. They begin as eggs and then progress unto the larval stage, where they are most commonly referred to as caterpillars, and go through multiple instars (also known as growth phases) that are separated by molts [Johnson: 2016]. Up until the 4th larval instar, the Juvenile hormone levels have fluctuated but have been higher than the Ecdystone hormone majority of the time during the larval period of the Manduca Sexta. During the 5th larval instar, JH levels drops slightly and there is a slight increase in Ecdystone (E20) and this is called the commitment pulse [Johnson: 2016]. This increase in E20 is produced when the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients and has already gone through enough instars to pupate and develop into a normal sized moth. It has been found that changes in amounts of hormones regulating growth in the Manduca Sexta can have impacts on later developmental stages of the moth [Weirich: 1997]. This study was developed to monitor and discover the effects of hormone inhibitors on insects, in this specific case the Manduca Sexta, which are commonly used as pesticides against insects and other pests in the agricultural community. My hypothesis for the Manduca Sexta Caterpillars is if they are exposed to an E20 inhibitor, that the test group caterpillars will not exceed the 5th instar of development (will not pupate) due to the change in hormone levels.


Materials and Method:
We selected eight medium sized caterpillars and split them randoMly into two groups, one controll and one experimental. We prepared two containers, one for each group, that had four sections each in them. We punched holes in the containers so the caterpillars could breathe and prepared 10g of provided caterpillar food for each caterpillar. The controll group caterpillars had four drops of water added to each 10g serving while the experimental group had four drops pf Azagaurd, an E20 inhibitor, added to each serving. We then placed the lids on the containers and put our labelled controll and experimental containers in the incubator. We attempted to check on our caterpillars every other day, but my groupmates refused to go check on them and I was only able to check on them on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Caterpillar weight was initially gathered before they were placed in the containers and were measured again at the end and periodically throughout the duration of the two-week experiment. We also ran a two-tailed t_test (=0.05) to analyze the caterpillar’s changes in weight from the beginning to the end of the experiment. 


Results:
Our controll caterpillars pupated and our experimental caterpillars did not, all of them died before we collected our final round of data. The controll group also lost weight before they pupated while the experimental caterpillars didn’t really gain or lose a large amount of weight. The experimental caterpillars were lower in weight compared to their controll group counterparts once we had begun to feed them their treated food. Our results from our two-tailed t- test were (t-value: 3.55, d.f.= 6, P(2-tailed)= 0.012), as shown in Figure 1 with the corresponding standard deviations as the error bars. 


Discussion:
•	Our hypothesis was supported by our experiment; all of our experimental caterpillars treated with Azagaured did not reach the 5th instar of development; they died and did not make it to the pupation phase of development. 
•	The experimental caterpillars never molted into a pupa due to the increased amount of the E20 inhibitor that was applied to the food in the experimental group, which controllled their ability to molt into the next phase of development [Johnson: 2016]. 
•	Our controll caterpillars (three out of four) did surpass the 5th instar and did pupate by the end of the experiment [Weirich: 1997]. 
•	The mean weight of the controll group caterpillars was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group, since our chosen P value was less than our chosen  - value. 
•	Azagaurd proved to prevent the experimental caterpillars from molting and maturing into adults, which would make Azagaurd a good contender for an insecticide, since it caused major growth effects on the experimental group.
