Title: The exposure of Manduca sexta caterpillars to Azadirachtin through digestion does not significently affect weight gain

Abstract:
Hormones are responsible for the maturation process as well as the overall development of insects, such as the Manduca sexta caterpillar, which is the insect we studied in this experiment.  The effects of azadirachtin on the diets of the caterpillar larvae was studied.  We hypothesized that an experimental group of larvae that is given food with azadirachtin for 7 days will gain more weight than a controll group that is fed normal food over the same period of time. We split 8 caterpillars into 2 groups, giving the experimental group food with azadirachtin and the controll group normal food.  We measured their weight change over a period of 7 days.  However, the average difference in weights of the controll and experimental groups was not statistically significent, allowing us to accept the null hypothesis.  Our results led us to the conclusion that azadirachtin is linked to feeding inhibition in the caterpillars.  If further research is conducted on the effects of chemicals that influence the hormones linked to development of insects, we can maximize crop yields by restricting the maturation of insects into pests.



Introduction:
Hormones are an important part of the process of insects such as the Manduca sexta caterpillar, as they play a large role in the development and regulation of metamorphosis.  If there is too much or not enough of certain hormones, the molting process can be disrupted.  The ratio of the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) is a crucial part of maturation of insects.  20E is a steroid hormone secreted by the prothoracic gland that regulates the timing of the molting process for caterpillars.  Without 20E, the timing of the molt would be disrupted, and this could cause the caterpillar to remain in the juvenile stage [Johnson: 11].  In this lab we will use azadirachtin, a chemical compound that blocks the production of 20E, to test its effect on the weight gain in caterpillar larvae.  A better understanding of the effects of 20E inhibitors such as azadirachtin could help with pest controll by interrupting metamorphosis in a safe manner.  The chemical’s presence has been linked to molting inhibition in Locusta migratoria [Sieber 1983].  Will this relationship also be found with the Manduca sexta caterpillar being exposed to azadirachtin? How will this affect its change in weight? Larvae that are unable to pupate would remain in the same instar, but they will continue to eat.  In our experiment, the independent variable is the quantity of azadirachtin fed to the caterpillars and dependent variable is the weight gain of the caterpillars.  If an experimental group of larvae is given food with azadirachtin for 7 days, they they will gain more weight than the controll group that is fed normal food over the same period.

Materials and Method:
In order to test our hypothesis, 8 caterpillars were separated into two groups of 4.  The controll group was fed normal food while the experimental group was given food with 7 drops of AzaMax, which contains azadirachtin.  The two groups were placed into separate plastic bins, each caterpillar in its own cube with its own food.  Each caterpillar was given 10 grams of food.  The experimental group got 7 drops of AzaMax in their food while the controll group got 7 drops of water in their food.  Every day for 7 days, we recorded the mass of each caterpillar, made observations, and cleaned their bins.  The food was changed as necessary and mixed with a spoon to aid in food consumption.



Results:
Our results show that there was an initial increase in weight gain for both groups but eventually there was a continuous weight loss.  The decrease in weight was large for the experimental group but the controll group maintained its weight for a longer period of time.  Over the 7 days, the average change in weight for the experimental group was +1.5 grams while the average weight change for the controll group was +4.15 grams.  In the controll group, the lightest caterpillars at the start of the experiment gained the most weight while the heaviest caterpillars at the start of the experiment gained the least weight.  The experimental group showed similar results.  The only caterpillar to have an overall loss in weight was the heaviest at the start of the experiment.  On the fourth day, a black pulsing line along the back of the caterpillars in the controll group showed that they had reached the commitment pulse.  On the seventh day, the controll 3 caterpillar was the first to pupate.  We carried out a one-tailed p test and the calculated value was 0.054.  This shows that the results are not significent because the value was about the significance level of 0.05.

Discussion:
Our results of this lab showed that we can accept the null hypothesis that larvae given azadirachtin in their food over a period of 7 days will not gain more weight than a controll group given normal food.  Although the significance test didn’t give results allowing us to accept the alternate hypothesis, our data showed that the controll group did gain more weight on average than the experimental group that was given drops of AzaMax.  This could be because the overall lack of normal weight gain over the 7 days raises questions of how azadirachtin influences the feeding habits of the caterpillars.  In Rhodnius prolixus, azadirachtin has been linked to the interference of the endocrine system which causes an indirect effect of feeding inhibition [de Souza Garcia: 1984].  Azadirachtin changes the ratio of the juvenile hormone and ecdysterone which causes a chemical imbalance in the caterpillars that changes their diet by inhibiting their feeding process. This caused the caterpillars to eat less than the controll group, thus the experimental group did not gain as much weight.  Another result that we can conclude from our experiment is that the caterpillars in the experimental group did not pupate because the AzaMax compound inhibited the production of 20E.  20E is needed for the process of maturation in caterpillars and its restriction would cause the larvae to not be able to go through metamorphosis.  For future reference, more studies can be done with more than one experimental group with different amounts of azadirachtin in their diets so that we can better understand and interpret the effects based on the quantity of this compound.  A larger sample size than 4 caterpillars per each group should be utilized to increase the chances of showing statistically significent results and leaving less of the experiment up to chance.  On a broader scale, hormone inhibitors are important to the maturation process, and our understanding of their specific effects can help to manipulate the development of the insects.  If we are able to controll the maturation of certain insects into pests or vice versa, we can maximize crop production.
