Title: Salt Concentration decreases the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture sunlight energy. The amount of photosynthetic activity exhibited by autotrophs depends on the concentration of ions around chloroplasts in the cytoplasm of plant cells. This effect of salinity on the Spinacia oleracea, or more commonly known as Spinach, was determined by enriching the chloroplasts by differential centrifugation, as well as the quantification of photosynthetic activity reduction with the Hill Reaction at different sodium concentrations. There was a significent statistical difference between the average percent change of absorbance at 600nm over time between the 0.2M sodium concentration and 0.4M sodium concentration, as well as the 0.2M sodium concentration and 0.6M sodium concentration (Fs=3.63, d.f.=4, p_value=0.014). In the 0.4M and 0.6M sodium concentrations there was a significent decrease in photosynthetic activity, as seen in Figure 1. This can be explained by the interruption of thylakoid complexes by salt ions. The negative effects of salt ion concentration on thylakoid  complexes in plants are important to know when looking at how much nutrients to add to crop soil in regards to fertilizer, as well as how plants in the north are affected by snow runoff which contains high concentrations of salt ions.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through the utilization of light. Chloroplasts are the organelle in autotrophs responsible for the capture of sunlight and energy production; they contain chlorophyll, a pigment, that absorbs photons of light. The number and location of chloroplasts varies in different cells and tissues of autotrophs. The chloroplasts capture energy through the use of stomata, which have guard cells that controll the stomatal opening and closing. This conductance of the stomata is controllled by environmental conditions surrounding the autotroph. Ions, gases, and light enter the autotroph through the stomata opening. In a study, the presence of sodium-chloride in the water provided to Spinacia oleracea, more commonly known as Spinach, resulted in a decrease in photosynthetic activity.  The Spinacia oleracea grew thicker with less chlorophyll per unit area. This resulted in a decrease in the stomatal opening; thereby, decreasing the carbon dioxide levels in the tissue of Spinacia oleracea in order to increase water use efficiency. The stomatal closing is the result of the guard cells lose water in response to being surrounded in a high salt concentration environment [Downton: 1985]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea treated with a high concentration sodium will be lower than the Spinacia oleracea treated with no sodium. 

Materials and Method:
Four spinach leaves of about medium size were obtained. The leaves were washed. The central veins were removed. The remaining parts of the leaves were dried and placed in a mortar, along with 10Ml of grinding buffer, and ground up with a pestle. The grinding buffer contained 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer and had a pH 8.0. After the leaves were a thick paste, 10Ml of grinding buffer was added. Then, the mixture in the mortar was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a cold medium-sized beaker. Three cold 50Ml centrifuge tubes were obtained. The liquid in the beaker was transferred into one 50Ml centrifuge tube and spun. The tube was spun at two-hundred times the force of gravity, 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After, the supernatant, not the debris, was poured out of the centrifuge tube into another centrifuge tube and spun again. This tube was spun at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Finally, the supernatant in the previous centrifuge tube was poured out. Then, 2OMl of grinding buffer was added to the centrifuge tube where the supernatant was poured out; the pellet was stirred gently with a transfer pipet in order to suspend it. Thirteen large test tubes were numbered 0-12 and placed in a tube rack. The spectrophotometer was set it to read at 600nm. Test tube #0, the blank, contained 8 Ml of distilled water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Test tubes #1-9 contained 6 Ml of distilled water and 2 Ml of 130mM DCPIP. In test tubes #0-13, 2 Ml reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #4-6, 1 Ml 2M sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #7-9, 2 Ml of sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #10-12, 5 Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of 130mM DCPIP, and 3 Ml of sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. One hundred microliters of chloroplasts from the suspended pellet mixture were placed in each test tube #0-12 and the absorbance of each tube was taken at time 0, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The average percent change in absorbance between the first, second, and third ten minutes in relation to time zero was recorded. The one-way ANOVA test compared the different concentrations of sodium, 0M, 0.2M, 0.4M, and 0.4M to time. The Tukey-Kramer test was used in conjunction with the ANOVA test, with an alpha value of 2.15, to find which average percent change in treatments were significently different from each other.

Results:
The average percent change in absorbance at 600nm for 0M concentration of sodium was 11.44 +/- 4.27. The average percent change in absorbance at 600nm for 0.2M concentration of sodium was 14.87 +/- 9.3. The average percent change in absorbance at 600nm for 0.4M of sodium was 6.90 +/- 5.00. The average percent change in absorbance at 600nm for 0.6m of sodium 6.25 +/- 4.76. There was a significent statistical difference between the average percent change of absorbance at 600nm over time between the 0.2M sodium concentration and 0.4M sodium concentration, as well as the 0.2M sodium concentration and 0.6M sodium concentration (Fs=3.63, d.f.=4, p_value=0.014). There was a general increase in the average change in absorbance at 600nm over time for all concentrations, as seen in Figure 1. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported in regards to the average percent change in absorbance comparing 0.2M and 0.4M, as well as 0.2M and 0.6M sodium concentrations; the p_value was less than 0.05. In a study investigating the effects of NaCl Stress on the photosynthetic activity of Mangrove Bruguiera parviflora chloroplasts, it was found that NaCl induces oxidative stress in chloroplasts causing the stromal thylakoid conductance to decrease. The concentrations were only tested at 0.1M NaCl, 0.2M NaCl, and 0.4M NaCl and the absorption was recorded from 360-750nm [Parida:2003]. The investigation only measured the photosynthetic activity of concentrations of 0.2M, 0.4M, 0.6M NaCl at absorbance of 600nm. The samples treated with 0.4M NaCl had a significent structural decrease that resulted in less photons of light being absorbed. The inefficiency of the structure to absorb photons in chloroplasts of the mangrove Bruguiera parviflora plants in salt stressed environment can help explain the significent decrease photosynthetic activity of the plant Spinacia oleracea at 0.4M concentration sodium compared to 0.2M concentration sodium. However, the model organism for this investigations was a different species than the one used in our investigation. In another study investigating photosynthesis and ion content of leaves and isolated chloroplasts of salt-stressed Spinacia oleracea, plants subject to 0.025 to 0.2M NaCl concentrations did not decrease in any photosynthetic potential. It was found that the rates of electron transport by isolated intact chloroplasts and by thylakoids were only 10 to 20% below those plants that were not treated. In the study, the chloroplasts had been extracted by differential centrifugation, but instead of measuring the photosynthetic activity reduction through the Hills reaction, the investigation measured oxygen evolution was by polarographically with Hansatech oxygen electrode. This was discussed to be the result of damage to the chloroplast during the experiment, or the result of chloroplasts not being in the site of metabolic activity, the cytoplasm. This could explain why salt reaction buffer concentrations of 0M and 0.2M were not statistically significent in our investigation.  Even though, the study did not find that the photosynthetic activity was decreased significently, the addition of NaCl to the nutrient solution did result in a significent decrease in biomass, as well as stomatal conductance [Robinson: 1983].  In another study investigating effects of salts and electron transport on the conformation of isolated chloroplasts, salt caused the chloroplasts to shrink in response to modification of the organization of chloroplasts [Izawa: 1966]. The study investigated the chloroplasts by looking at the optical density over time where the concentration of NaCl subjected to the chloroplast was only 0.5M [Izawa: 1966]. The interference by concentrations of NaCl in the presence of chloroplast explain the decrease in photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea. The effects of salt stress on chloroplast photosynthetic activity is crucial to understanding how nutrients in crop fields, or subject to salt runoff after snow storms biologically interact with their environment. This investigation can help prevent the degradation of plant life in urban areas that are subject to salt runoff from salting the roads during the winter.
