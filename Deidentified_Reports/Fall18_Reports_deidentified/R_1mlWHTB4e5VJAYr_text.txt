Title: High Salinity Inhibits Photosynthetic Activity in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
We sought to understand the effect of increasing salinity upon the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts of the common spinach, Spinacia oleracea. We proposed that increasing the salinity of the solution in which spinach chloroplasts were immersed would decrease the rate of photosynthetic activity of those chloroplasts. We tested our hypothesis by immersing the chloroplasts in solutions of 0M, 0.2M, 0.4M, and 0.6M salinities. The experiment ran for thirty minutes, with absorbances tested at the start and at ten-minute intervals. Our hypothesis was supported by the data, showing significance between our 0.2M-treated chloroplasts and the 0.4M and 0.6M-treated chloroplasts. Future experiments should focus on finding an “ideal” concentration for photosynthetic activity to occur. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a process performed by plants and some protists and bacteria in which energy from the sun is captured and stored. The chloroplasts of photosynthetic cells absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules, with the energy exciting electrons; this triggers hydrolysis, releasing electrons and generating a proton gradient [Johnson: 2016]. This proton gradient powers ATP synthesis, and the high energy electrons are stored as NADPH. The electrons on ATP and NADPH are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water molecules.
	The salinity of a cell’s environment can have a great impact upon the cell. The semipermeable membrane of most cells, such as plant cells, freely allows for osmosis, the movement of water from an area of higher to an area of lower concentration. In pure water, a cell has more solutes and therefore a lower concentration of water than its environment; the cell will therefore take up water due to osmosis until the concentrations are equal or until the cell can take up no more water and either: in the case of animal cells, the cell membrane bursts, a condition called “osmotic lysis”; or, in the case of plant cells, the cell becomes “turgid,” meaning swollen and rigid. A highly saline cell environment will have the opposite effect. If the concentration of water outside of an animal cell is significantly lower because of salt solute, water will exit the cell until the concentrations are equalized, causing the cell to shrivel and die [Lodish: 2000]. A plant cell’s rigid cell wall prevents this shriveling. Research also suggests that some organisms have tissue-specific responses to changes in salinity [Neufeld: 1996]. While Neufeld’s study focused on the effect of salinity upon the various tissues of the mussel Geukensia demissa, it is nevertheless interesting to consider the possible variations in response to salinity observed in different cell types.
	While plant cells do not face the risk of osmotic lysis, they are still greatly affected by environmental salinity. In order for photosynthesis to occur, a certain water pressure must be maintained: the opening of stomata that enables the gas exchange necessary for photosynthesis to occur is driven by osmosis into the stomata’s “guard cells.” If more water leaves the cells through the stomata than enter through the roots, the stomata close and photosynthesis stops [Lodish: 2000]. Therefore, “salt stress” in plants can greatly impact the ability of a plant to perform the functions necessary for survival. If the water available to the plant is saline enough to match or exceed the concentration of solute in the plant’s root cells, then water will not enter the plant and photosynthesis will be unable to occur. In the long-term, sodium ions can also build up to toxic levels, particularly in older leaves, potentially leading to premature leaf senescence and, in some cases, even plant death [Negrao: 2017]. Looking at chloroplasts specifically, it has been observed that water deficit, an effect of salt stress, can lead to the formation of highly reactive oxygen species such as superoxide (O2¬¬.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (.OH) [Halliwell: 1985]. Because O2 concentrations are high in the chloroplasts during photosynthesis, they are particularly susceptible to the formation of the cytotoxic species superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. [Asada: 1987]. 
	When considering our experimental design, we considered what saline concentrations plants would likely face in the wild and came upon the concentration of 0.6M NaCl. This is the average concentration of the world’s seawater, making it the saline concentration experienced by the world’s coastal and tidal plant species [McGill]. The effects of salinity on plants are therefore most relevant in the context of seawater, and so the effects of seawater-level upon photosynthesis should be studied and understood. They will become increasingly important if the trend towards increasing salinity in seawater continues and jeopardizes tidal plantlife. 
	Spinacia oleracea was a good model organism for this test because it is a very common agricultural crop and is important for the Western diet. Soil salinity is also an increasingly prevalent issue facing agriculturists as a result of long-term irrigation practices. Therefore, the response of spinach and other crops to increasing salinity is very relevant going forward. 
	We hypothesized that if the salinity of the water in spinach chloroplasts’ environment were increased, photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts would be reduced.	


Materials and Methods:
We began the experiment by deveining four leaves of spinach and adding them to a chilled mortar and pestle. We then added 10 mL of “grinding” buffer, a solution of 400 mM sucrose in pH 8.0 buffer. We proceeded to grind the spinach and solution into a thick paste. After a paste was formed, we added another 10 mL of grinding buffer and mixed it in. We strained the paste through a double-folded cheesecloth and discarded the removed solid. We transferred the strained liquid to a chilled centrifuge tube and centrifuged it at 200xG for three minutes at 4°C. We then transferred the supernatant to another centrifuge tube and centrifuged it at 1000xG for ten minutes at 4°C. We poured out the supernatant and discarded it, keeping the pellet from the second centrifugation. We then added 20 mL of grinding buffer to this pellet and resuspended it by stirring gently with a pipette. 
We prepared thirteen tubes according to the proportions listed in Table 1. We added 
100 µL of the resuspended chloroplast solutions to each of the non-blank tubes and mixed the solutions immediately. We then transferred the prepared solutions to cuvettes and took initial absorbances of all solutions at 600 nm wavelength using a photospectrometer; the blank served as a zero. We then placed all of the cuvettes in one rack in direct sunlight. After ten minutes, we measured absorbances, again using the blank as a zero; as the blank had no DCPIP, its absorbance did not change. We placed the cuvettes back into the direct sunlight in the same place; we measured again after twenty and thirty minutes from the start. 
	The absorbances for each solution at each time were averaged. Percent change was calculated as the difference in average absorbances across ten-minute intervals. We analyzed our data using a one-way ANOVA.  


Results:
Our ANOVA indicated significance within our data sets (p = 0.015, Fs = 4.023, df = 3). The Tukey-Kramer post-hoc indicated significance between the sets of 0.2M and 0.4M, as well as between 0.2M and 0.6M. 

Discussion:
Our data largely supported our hypothesis. We had predicted that increasing the salinity of water in the chloroplasts’ environment would decrease the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. We found that the data sets for chloroplasts between 0.2M and ether 0.4M or 0.6M were significant, and that photosynthetic activity was on average much lower in our high-salinity chloroplasts (0.4M, 0.6M) than in our low-salinity chloroplasts. Therefore, our data indicates that high saline concentrations do inhibit photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts.
	Our data supports previous research and biological thought that indicate that salinity has an adverse effect upon a plant’s ability to perform necessary biological functions. As stated in the introduction of this paper, biological cells are highly dependent upon osmosis in order to obtain the water necessary for life functions; this osmosis depends upon the environmental solution being roughly isotonic with the interior of the cell. When the salinity of that solution is increased, the solute concentration is increased, and osmosis will work against the cell, causing water to flow out of the cell and into the solution. While the rigid cell wall prevents a plant cell from shriveling and dying in this situation, a plant will still face dehydration: in the leaves, water will not be present in high enough quantities to perform photosynthesis; in the chloroplasts more specifically- and pertaining more directly to our experiment- highly reactive and cytotoxic oxygen species can be formed in quantities dangerous to the chloroplast, killing it and thereby preventing further photosynthesis. As we experimented directly with the chloroplasts rather than with entire spinach plants, this second dehydration symptom is what we most likely encountered. Because water is also directly required for photosynthesis as a reactant in the chemical formation of glucose, it is possible that enough water to form glucose was simply not present.
	An interesting finding to note from our data was that the inhibition of photosynthesis did not seem to scale directly with increasing salinity. 0.2M salinity actually yielded the highest rates of photosynthesis, higher than pure 0M water. This may have been an experimental idiosyncrasy, or it may indicate that a plant cell, like an animal cell, functions best in an isotonic solution. That being said, there was no significance between the two sets, so it may have been a one-off occurrence. At the high-salinity concentrations, we also found that there was no significance between the 0.4M and 0.6M chloroplasts, and the two lines overlapped significantly (Table 1). There was not a large difference in the average rates of photosynthesis between these two treatment groups; this may indicate that beyond a certain salinity, photosynthetic activity does not greatly decrease. This seems to lend more credence to the idea of cytotoxic oxygen species formation, indicating that the chloroplasts are being killed: dead chloroplasts in 0.4M solution will be no more photosynthetic than dead chloroplasts in 1M solution.
	Future experiments with more equipment available may focus more upon this oxygen species formation to see if formation rates scale with solute concentration. They may also focus more specifically on low-salinity solutions to observe whether or not there is an “ideal” solute concentration in a plant cell’s environment for photosynthesis to occur.
