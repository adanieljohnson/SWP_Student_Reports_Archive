Title: The Affect of IGR on the Growth of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) uses a hormone known as juvenile hormone (JH) to trigger growth in its larval form. This experiment was performed to test whether the addition of JH would cause larval M. sexta to have reduced growth. The analysis of the data collected show that there is a significent difference between the experimental and controll groups, showing that group given JH did not grow as much as the one that was not fed JH. This supports the hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta, also called the tobacco hornworm, a type of moth, use several different hormones to regulate their growth. The juvenile hormone (JH) is essential for starting a phase in development called the commitment pulse, which occurs when very low levels of JH are combined with rising levels of another hormone called Ecdysterone (Johnson 2016). The commitment pulse is the first step in pupation, which allows the larval M. sexta to grow into an adult moth. Our hypothesis is that giving larval M. sexta JH will prevent them from growing as large as they would otherwise. This is because they will be prevented from reaching their commitment pulse, which will cause them to grow abnormally. Similar experiments have found that other factors such as temperature difference can affect growth in this larval stage [Hayes et al. 2015], and alteration JH is known to affect growth of Bombyx mori, another moth species [Zhang et al. 2017]. 

Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were obtained and placed into individual compartments in two separate groups: the controll group, fed only standard caterpillar food; and the experimental group, fed standard caterpillar food with the addition of 5 drops IGR each, a chemical that mimics the effect of JH. The caterpillars were then placed in the same incubator at an optimal temperature for growth and left for 14 days. They were weighed daily and fed when necessary. After 14 days had passed, the data were compiled in a spreadsheet. Each caterpillar was assessed by averaging the growth they did each day, and this was totaled into a mean growth for each group. A two-sample t_test was performed on the data. 

Results:
The mean of the controll group was significently different from the mean of the experimental group (d.f. = 6, P = 0.903). The controll group grew rather consistently, and each individual was quite similar to each other in size. In addition, two of the controll group had pupated by day 12. The experimental group was very strange in that two caterpillars were markedly smaller than the others, shown in figure #2. These two smaller caterpillars also showed signs of health problems, such as shed moltings that were caught around the abdomen for the bulk of the experiment. 

Discussion:
According to these data, there is a significent difference between the experimental and controll groups. The controll group, on average, had a larger mean growth than the experimental group. This clearly supports the hypothesis that giving JH to larval M. sexta would lessen their growth compared to those given no extra JH. 
The two groups were quite different in some surprising ways. The experimental group was quite varied as compared to the controll group. Caterpillars #1 and #4 of the experimental group were stunted and much smaller than those of the controll group, but #2 and #3 of the experimental group were large, with #2 ending as the largest caterpillar. Granted, this is why statistical tests are done, to “iron out” these types of anomalies. However, the question remains: why did the JH only effect two caterpillars? Is it possible that experimental caterpillars #2 and #3 had mutation or trait that allowed them to thrive? Or, perhaps their reaction was the “normal” one, and the health issues noted by #1 and #4 are more anomalous. One  experiment on M. sexta found that the addition of JH did not affect the final size, only the rate of growth[Hatem et al. 2015]. This would match the two larger caterpillars from the experimental group, as they seemed to grow just as large as those in the controll group, only neither of them pupated before the experiment was concluded.  Ideally, the experiment should be repeated with a much larger sample size to help answer some of these questions. 
It is also interesting to note that the two smaller caterpillars shared the “collar” of shed exoskeleton around the abdomen. In both cases it seemed to cause some harm, discoloring the body behind it. Presumably it was blocking the flow of nutrients to that part of the abdomen. It seems that this binding was somehow caused by whatever made their growth stunted, or perhaps it was itself the cause. Again, further tests should be done to assess the cause and effect of this strange injury. 
Note that this experiment had a few potential points of error. Unfortunately, several days were unaccounted for. One day was left blank because a team member was temporarily unable to access the lab, and three more were unrecorded because the lab was closed due to Hurricane Florence.
