Title: The Effects of Glucose and Sucrose through Independent and Competitive Environments on Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum, commonly known as slime mold, utilizes actin, myosin microfilaments and pressure gradients to determine its oscillations which cause slime mold to either move forward or contract back if it no longer wants to move in a given direction. This movement is possible during its plasmodial stage. Slime mold is attracted to glucose and repelled from sucrose. This was tested through independent states and a competitive state and ultimately supported. However, strange, in which a large component for plants is sucrose. Therefore, the reasons for why this occurs is still unclear.

Introduction:
Slime mold (Physarum polycephalum) is normally a single plasma membrane with multicellular nuclei. It spends most of its life in the plasmodial stage. The plasmodial stage is thought of growth like phase. To move in search of necessary nutrients, it crawls by using its actin, myosin microfilaments and pressure gradients. It behaves in nonlinear oscillations. Attractants and repellants determine the frequency of the oscillations (Durham and Ridgway 1976).  The Physarum polycephalum is normally multicellular if in the appropriate conditions: dark and damp. Small pieces of the plasmodium can split off and form a new organism. Waste is then left behind in the plasmodium. However, if there is no to low humidity, and no food, then the plasmodium hardens and is then called sclerotium: a hibernation state. When other stresses are presented like starvation and light, it will reproduce. Prior to it undergoing meiosis it will form into a fruiting body. Then during the process of meiosis, sporangia will form into spore capsules which is where it will undergo meiosis. The spores created will germinate to either amoeboid (crawling) if the conditions are dry and starving, a flagellated (swimming) swarm cell if the conditions are flooded and a cyst if it presented with nutrients. They are all the same mating type. When fused it is called syngamy and they form a zygote (Guttes et.al 1961). 
Growing Physarum in its optimal state in the lab requires 2% agar in distilled water with oatmeal all in the dark. Oatmeal contains glucose. Glucose is an attractant while sucrose is a repellant (Carlile 1970). Sucrose being a repellant is interesting as it is a main component made by plants (Levine 2010). Chemotaxis: movement of the organism according to differentiating gradients was tested. Positive Chemotaxis is when the organism moves towards the gradient while negative is when it moves away. Therefore, it is expected that the slime mold will move towards glucose (positive chemotaxis) and away from sucrose (negative chemotaxis), and in competitive situations, it will move towards glucose over sucrose.

Materials and Method:
First, 12 stock plates were gathered. Two plates were made; one of glucose and another of sucrose. This was done by melting 2% water agar in the microwave in glass beaker, mixing 20Ml of the agar with 1Ml of 20X glucose then repeated separately with sucrose. Once each was mixed it was poured into separate petri dishes creating a final concentration of 25mM in 20Ml of solution. The petri dishes were then cooled in the fridge (50°C) until they solidified. Next, 9 more stock petri dishes were measured to create 3 evenly spaced squares and marked on the bottom with a sharpie. After, for 3 dishes, all three cubes outlined, agar was cut using a spatula. These three plates were the competitive plates; sucrose in one end and glucose on the other with the slime mold square placed in the middle. For the other 6 plates, only two of the three squares outlined were cut; 3 plates with one square of glucose and the other 3 with one square of sucrose while both had slime mold placed in the center. When cutting out the slime mold from the original growth plate it was important to cut a piece without oatmeal and mold. The last plate of the twelve only had one square cut in which the slime mold would be the only thing present the plate: the controll. Every plate and square were named appropriately with the location and name of the solution(s) present. After, each plate was taped closed, wrapped in tin foil then placed in a dark bag. The samples where then placed in a closed locker. The foil, dark bag and locker were to minimalize light factors, increasing the probability of growth. After 48 hours, the samples were collected, measured for growth distance and direction. A 1 tailed T test between each group will be used to determine the significance of growth. 

Results:
As portrayed in figure 1, the controll did not grow, the slime mold moved at an equal averaged distance with sucrose and glucose, however, it moved away from sucrose (negative direction) and moved toward glucose (positive). The slime mold placed in a competitive state, averaged, did not move as far as when only one solution was present. When observing at the average direction in which the slime mold moved, when presented with glucose it moved to the left (towards glucose), when there was sucrose it moved right (away from the sucrose). However, in the competitive state, only one sample clearly moved, but the direction it did move was towards glucose. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported because Physarum polycephalum moved towards glucose and away from sucrose, even in a competitive environment. This is supported through the significent P value of 0.045 when comparing the glucose and sucrose values in lone samples. It is significent because it has a P value &lt; 0.05. It is further supported through the competitive environment when the slime mold favors glucose. The standard deviation is very large (±4.0415) for sucrose expressing large range of error. However, the movement and direction in which the slime mold moved still proved significent. Therefore, there is a very low probability that the slime mold reacted this way by chance. In order to fix the large standard deviation in sucrose and perhaps have more overall growth within 48 hours, one could repeat the experiment multiples times with different samples of growths of slime molds to ensure that it did not behaved “abnormally.” In the experiment the controll did not grow, and sucrose large error range can be interpreted as abnormal. A biological explanation to why the Physarum did not grow appropriately for the controll may be due to starvation. The controll was not placed with food and after 3 days, the Physarum will begin the sporulation sequence. The Physarum was only observed for two days. Therefore, the lack of movement is explained as it could not move towards oatmeal as none was present and it was preparing for the sporulation sequence (Melera and Hession 1981). The large error range for the sucrose because plate number 3 was clear rather than blue, leading to believe that the percent agar was lower causing the Physarum not to grow. The percent of agar affects the signal transductions causing minimal oscillations, therefore explaining no growth in plate number 3(Whiting et. al. 2014). The lack of growth caused the large standard deviation. Repeating experiments assists with assuring accuracy of results. The reasons why sucrose is a repellant for slime mold are still unclear. When originally thinking, sucrose is a disaccharide while glucose is a monosaccharide. Therefore, it may be possible that it is easier for it to break down a monosaccharide and use it as energy. However, it would not explain why it moves in the opposite direction of sucrose. Also, upon further research, slime mold is attracted to maltose which is a disaccharide, therefore, further rejecting the previous statement (Knowles and Carlile 1978). For future research, finding a reason why slime mold is repelled by sucrose can be beneficial. Utilizing the simple knowledge that it is repelled can be potentially utilized in the future to redirect growth.

Figure Legends: 
Fig. 1: The average distance of how far the slime mold grew from its origin. Slime mold moved at an average of 3.667mm towards glucose, therefore is positive. It moved 3.667 mm away from sucrose, therefore, is reflected as negative. In a competitive state, it did not move away from either glucose or sucrose, it moved directly towards glucose. Therefore, because it moved directly toward a solution, it is recorded as positive. The controll did not move and is recorded with a value of 0. The average distance it moved toward glucose in the competitive dishes was 2 mm. The one-tailed T test between the separate glucose and sucrose presented a value of 2.92 and a P value of 0.045 (P&lt;0.05). The standard deviations are: for glucose ±0.57735, sucrose ±4.0415, and for the competitive plate with glucose and sucrose ±2. *************************************************************************
