Title: Resource allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum under red light

Abstract:
The main objective of this study was to determine if there were varying root to shoot ratios of the height and weight of Fagopyrum esculentum, also known as buckwheat, when grown under red light and natural right. It was hypothesized that the red plants would have a lower root to shoot ratio because they would allocate their resources more evenly among their roots and shoots than those grown in white or natural light. Four pots of buckwheat were planted and two were placed under a red-light tent while the other two were placed under natural light. After being watered every day for two weeks, the plants were uprooted and the roots were cut from the shoots in order to measure the length and weight of each. These measurements were used to calculate the root to shoot ratios for both weight and length of each of the groups. In the end of the experiment, it was concluded that there was not a statistically significant difference between the root to shoot ratios of weight and height between the two groups.

Introduction:
Plants tend to allocate their resources differently depending on the environmental conditions they are placed in. For example, plants may allocate resources to their leaves making them larger to capture more sunlight or they may increase the length of their roots if water is only available deep in the soil. Things such as nutrient level, rainfall, or amount of light can all have an effect on a plant’s resource allocation. This experiment specifically looked at how red light would affect the root to shoot ratio in buckwheat. Chlorophyll is able to absorb more light when it is placed in red light, contributing to more photosynthesis in the plant [Okamoto: 1996]. Due to this fact, it was hypothesized that the plants placed to grow under the red light would have a lower root to shoot ratio because they would grow better and therefore have little need to allocate their resources unevenly between roots and shoots.

Materials and Methods:
The buckwheat seeds were first soaked for thirty minutes prior to planting. Next, two pots were labeled treatment and two were labeled control. All of the pots were then filled with vermiculite, water, and miracle grow. For each pot, indentations were made and seeds were planted in each spot, then covered in vermiculite. All four pots were then placed in the greenhouse. The control plants were left in the natural sunlight and a red bag was placed over the treatment group. The plants were then watered every day for two weeks. To harvest and measure the plants, we cut the roots and shoots at the root shoot junction, making sure it was about the same level on each plant. Then each root and shoot was measured and weighed for both the experimental and control groups. These measurements were used to calculate the root to shoot ratio for the weight and length of each of the groups. A two tailed t test was used to test if there was a statistically significant difference in the mean proportions of the root to shoot ratios of the experimental and control groups.

Results:
Based on the data gathered, it did not appear as if there is any significant difference between the root to shoot ratios of either height or weight between the experimental and control groups, seeing as how there were not any tendencies for any measurement of a group to be significantly larger or smaller than that of the other group, as seen in figure 1.  A two tailed t test was run to confirm these observations (Weight: t=0.7131, df = 22, p=0.4833) (Length: t=0.0469, df=22, p=0.9630. After this test was run, it was concluded that there was not any statistically significant evidence to prove there was a difference between the mean proportions of the root to shoot ratios of weight and length of the control and experimental groups

Discussion:
After running a two tailed t-test, it was determined that there was not a statistically significant difference between the mean proportions of length root to shoot ratio and the weight root to shoot ratio. This does not support our hypothesis that red plants would have a lower root to shoot ratio for both weight and length. Based on this data, the null hypothesis was supported that there was no difference between the root to shoot ratios. This came as a surprise seeing as how red light is shown to increase absorption in chlorophyll [Okamoto: 1996]. The contrast between this experiment and other in the past may have been due to some other environmental factor affecting resource allocation that was unforeseen previous to experimentation and unable to be controlled.
