Title: The Behavioral Response of Betta splendins to Dark Isolation

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine whether Betta splendins exhibits increased agnostic behavior when isolated in a dark environment before encountering another fish and performing an intraspecific aggressive interaction. It was hypothesized that Betta fish kept in a dark environment 4 ½ hours prior to encountering another male, they will exhibit more aggressive behavior than if they had been kept in light conditions before the experiment. This was accomplished by isolating two pairs of fish in the dark before allowing them to encounter one another and comparing the display of aggressive events and “red mane” display time with fish who were kept in the light before an encounter with another fish. The results indicate that dark isolation does not increase the aggressive display of male Betta fish when comparing the number of aggressive events (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.501, p = 0.317) and the time that the “red mane” was displayed (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.520, p = 0.310). It was concluded that aggressive behavior is not increased by dark isolation in male Betta splendins. However, fish might have been somewhat habituated which would have decreased the display of aggressive behavior in all replicates.

Introduction:
Betta splendins or the Siamese fighting fish is a common aquarium fish originating from southeast Asia [Johnson: 2018]. Betta fish are known to display aggressive behavior when threatened, particularly in the presence of another male in an intraspecific interaction [Johnson: 2018]. These behaviors are well-documented and include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, pectoral fin erecting, spreading gill covers and finally, displaying the red mane [Johnson: 2018]. We are interested in determining whether no light conditions increase the aggressive behavior in male Bettas.  It was hypothesized that if Betta fish are kept in a dark environment 4 ½ hours prior to encountering another male, they will exhibit more aggressive behavior than if they had been kept in light conditions before the experiment. To the knowledge of this group, the present study is unique, and no study has yet to demonstrate the effect of light on Betta splendins behavior. It has been proposed that Betta fish display agnostic intensity proportional to the persistence of the opponent and inversely proportional to the distance between the two fish [Bronstein: 1981]. As a result, it was determined that fish given the same treatment should be paired because this prevents the possibility that the treatment of one fish does not confound the aggressive behavior displayed by the other since Bettas are known to display agnostic intensity in proportion to one another. This was accomplished by having pairs of Betta fish separated in tanks by a removable opaque wall. It was important that the fish could not see one another. A previous study indicates that male Betta fish react similarly towards familiar and stranger males [Alyan: 2010]. The opaque wall prevented them from interacting or becoming familiar before experimentation because if these interactions had occurred during the idle period of the experiment, the fish might have exhibited different behavior during observations than if they had not expelled energy displaying aggression before the observations were made. Since fish are separated prior to observation, the effect of social isolation must also be considered. One study indicates that social isolation depresses the readiness of Betta fish to display aggressive behavior but once they are primed for the behaviors they show an increased display [Halperin: 1992]. The removal of the wall allowed the males to encounter one another through a glass divider. The number of aggressive behaviors displayed and the length of time that the red mane was displayed was compared using a one-tailed two sample t_test.

Materials and Method:
Betta fish were obtained and placed in tanks divided by an opaque wall and transparent glass. Two of the pairs were placed in no light conditions 4 ½ hours before the observations were made. Immediately after Betta fish were returned to light conditions, the wall was removed and aggressive behaviors between the two Bettas separated by glass were observed. The number of aggressive behaviors displayed and the length of time that the red mane was displaced were recorded for each fish, totaling to 8 measurements for each value. One-tailed two-sample t_tests were performed between the average values of events and time for both the controll group and the no light treatment group. Observations of each pair were 5 minutes in length.

Results:
The average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by fish in the light was 17.25 ± 18.71 and for the dark treatment was 11.5 ± 13.3. The average time “red mane” was displayed for fish in light was 101.75 ± 97.34 s and for fish in the dark was 68.25 ± 84.26 s.  A one-tailed t_test performed between the number of aggressive behaviors for each treatment group indicates that there is no significent increase in aggressive behavior instances from the Bettas left in the dark before confrontation (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.501, p = 0.317). A one tailed t_test performed between the time of “red mane” display for each treatment group indicates that there is no significent increase in red mane display for fish kept in the dark leading up to confrontation (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.520, p = 0.310). 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, the hypothesis is rejected because statistical tests indicated that no increase in aggressiveness was present in the group kept in dark leading up to confrontation. As depicted in figures 1 and 2, the light controll group displayed more aggressive behavior on average. However, the first light group tested had included Betta fish that were much more aggressive than the other replicates. Perhaps this was due to their fighting colors phenotype. Yet, even with its exclusion, statistical tests still indicate that the dark treatment group did not display increased aggressiveness. It is possible, that some error is attributable to variation in counting ability between experimenters. This experiment could be improved if the fish were kept in dark conditions for a longer duration. Perhaps, future experiments might receive different results if fish are kept in the dark for 24-48 hours rather than 4 ½ hours. Another potential error in this experiment could be that the fish were tested multiple times by different sections at differing times. A previous study indicates that aggressive behavioral response is decreased once a fish has been encountered for the first time and that behavior level is never reached again once they have already encountered one another [Clayton: 1967]. It is possible that the fish used in this experiment were somewhat accustomed to one another and had a representative decrease in aggressive display when compared to their first encounter that might have happened within a short time frame. Additionally, another study indicated that daily exposures to an aggression eliciting stimulus is necessary to obtain habituation in Betta splendins [Peeke: 1970]. This demonstrates that the fish tested were probably not entirely habituated yet they probably were more habituated to one another than two wild fish might be. This experiment could be improved if wild caught Bettas were used instead of domesticated Bettas who might already be somewhat accustomed to on another.
