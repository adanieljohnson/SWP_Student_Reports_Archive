Title: A study of agonistic behavior in Betta splendens in response to hunger

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to discover if a correlation between hunger and agonistic behavior could be discovered in Betta splendens. Hungry betta fish were exposed to other well-fed betta fish through a glass wall and the behavior of the two fish, over a five-minute period, was observed. I hypothesized that the hungry betta fish would be significantly less aggressive than the well-fed betta fish, and this hypothesis was supported through statistical analysis of the data collected. The results of this experiment proved a correlation between hunger and the level of aggression (agonistic behavior) displayed by betta fish. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens, otherwise known as a Betta fish are commonly recognized as beautiful, brightly colored fish. Originally found in Thailand in small, shallow pools of water, such as rice paddies [ShortAdam;2013], they have rapidly spread around the world as domesticated fish. The male betta fish is very aggressive and territorial when in the presence of another male, even the sight of itself in the reflection of a tank or a mirror is enough for it to show signs of aggression [CozzaJohn;UniversityofMiami]. These signs of aggression, or agonistic behavior, is very discernable making the study of their behavior in different situations very easy. The betta fish uses two types of maneuvers, front facing and broadside, along with different body positions within these two categories to display their aggression. There are three types of front facing behaviors that the betta fish will display when being aggressive. For the purpose of this experiment they have ranked them from least to most aggressive and they are as follows: erect pectoral fins, spreading of the gill covers (opercula), and lastly protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes (creating a “red mane”). Likewise, there are three major broadside behaviors that betta fish display when being aggressive, they have also been ranked from least to most aggressive and are as follows: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. The goal of this experiment was to determine if hunger, or lack of food, would lower the level of aggression that a betta fish would display when another male is visible to it. I hypothesized that the hungry male betta fish would be less aggressive than a properly fed betta fish. My thought process in this hypothesis was that the hungry betta fish would not expend its resources to be aggressive towards the other male, rather would conserve them to stay alive until it finds more food. 

Materials and Methods:
	To test my hypothesis, I placed a male betta fish that had been properly fed in a fish tank with a glass and opaque barrier down the middle of the tank. In the other side I placed a betta fish that had not been fed for 24 hours. I gave the fish two minutes to get used to their new tanks and calm down. After those two minutes I removed the opaque barrier so that the fish could see each other but not touch each other, because the glass barrier still kept them from doing so. For five minutes I observed the behavior of the two fish tallying how many times they displayed each type of aggressive behavior. This process produced six data points for each fish, three for each front facing behavior and three for each broadside behavior. Each individual behavior was assigned a multiplier of one, two, or three based on how aggressive the behavior was (i.e. 1x for pelvic fin flickering, 2x for tail beating, and 3x for tail flashing, and likewise for facing behaviors). These numbers were added up to get an overall “aggression” score for the betta fish. I did three replicants for this procedure, getting a total of three “aggression” scores for well-fed betta fish and three scored for hungry betta fish. These scores were inputted into a paired T-test to test for significance. 

Results:
	The results of the experiment showed that there was a significant difference between the aggressiveness of the properly fed Betta splendens and the hungry Betta splendens. The average aggressiveness score for the properly fed fish was 97.66 (SD: 16.77) and the average aggressiveness score for the hungry fish was 22 (SD: 9.53), this data is depicted in figure one. When I put the results into a two sample t-test I discovered that the results were significant (One-tailed P-value:0.001227; T-value: 6.792025; DF: 4). The results of the t-test showed that my hypothesis was supported and that the null hypothesis (that there would be no difference in the aggression of the betta fish) was rejected. 

Discussion:
This experiment showed a defined correlation between the level of aggression displayed by Betta splendens and its hunger level. The hungry betta fish was clearly less aggressive than the well-fed betta fish. I believe that this is due to the fact that the hungry betta fish needed to allocate resources in a different manner than the well-fed betta fish. When placed in the presence of another male betta fish hungry betta fish were clearly less aggressive, leading me to believe that they were conserving their energy instead of expending it by being aggressive. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute did an experiment where they tested the decision making and perception of risk of fruit fly’s and found that when fruit fly’s became hungry enough they would take far more risks than they would have otherwise [Planck,Max;2013]. An interesting avenue for further study would be incorporating food into the environments of the two betta fish. This could lead to drastically different results as the hungry betta fish might be willing to expend more resources to gain access to the food and/or protect the food source from the other betta fish. Throughout the experiment I conducted both betta fish were kept separated from each other by a glass barrier, another interesting route for further investigation would be removing that barrier and seeing if the hungry betta fish would be forced to become aggressive or if it would still show passive behavior.
