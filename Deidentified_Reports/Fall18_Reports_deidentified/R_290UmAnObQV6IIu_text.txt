Title: Calcium chloride as an excitatory and inhibitory growth factor in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Slime molds, like Physarum polycephalum, are a species of amoeboid-like organisms that consume decaying matter in nature. Their role as detritivores allows them to survive off the nutrients found in microorganisms and dead plant matter. Their specific environment and nutrient uptake determine the life state that the Physarum will be in. Certain nutrients, such as calcium, have a role in the movement of the Physarum, producing either inhibitory or excitatory effects. In this experiment, the effects of calcium were tested to determine how the growth of the slime mold was affected. Specifically, two different concentrations of calcium chloride were tested over a period of 72 hours. Contrary to published literature, this experiment showed that the most inhibitory concentration of calcium chloride was not at the highest concentration tested. This experiment determined that at 2 mM of calcium chloride, there were excitatory growth rates observed during the first 24 hours of the experiment, followed by inhibition during the last 48 hours of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a yellow type of slime mold that is often found among decaying, organic matter. They are found all over the world, especially in cold, shady woodland regions, where there is little sunlight. Humidity plays a factor in their growth and, after periods of rainfall, they tend to appear in new areas. It’s main source of nutrients comes from microscopic particles found in their environment, including bacteria and decaying organisms [Sinha: 2011]. They can be successfully grown in agar plates with sterile oat flakes; however, the lifespan of the slime mold will be short. According to Abbot, there will be an increase in pH if the medium of growth is too rich in nutrients. This increase will ultimately shorten the life of the cultured P. polycephalum; this will be indicated by a color change in the mold (yellow to orange) [Abbott: 1945]. Therefore, the conditions for proper growth and longevity of the mold must be specific. For instance, certain mineral salts – such as calcium chloride – will stimulate growth, while specific sugars and nitrogenous sources will inhibit growth. In laboratory cultures, the proper combination of glucose, amino acids, and salt mixtures at the proper pH will lead to successful growth of P. polycephalum [Alexopoulos: 1963]. 
As long as food sources are viable, P. polycephalum will be in its plasmodium life stage. In this stage, the plasmodium will be an irregular, slimy mass with multiple diploid nuclei. As it locomotes in search of nutrients, the plasmodium will use its actin and myosin filaments as a basis for movement [Nachmias: 1972]. As it moves and digests dead matter, the slime mold will leave behind a trail of slime that contains all its waste products. Also, while it has access to food, the plasmodium will continue to grow until it adopts a “fan” shape produced by strands of cytoplasm (they resemble thick veins). These stands serve as networks for nutrient transport; they set up a process known as cytoplasmic streaming. Cytoplasmic streaming, like locomotion, is controlled by the actin and myosin filaments [Sinha: 2011]. This streaming lets nutrients in an out in cycles of two minutes or less; not all cytoplasmic strands perform the cycle at the same time or direction. 
If food sources become scarce, the plasmodium will enter a hibernation stage by changing from a plasmodium to a sclerotium. It will remain in the stage as long as the environmental conditions remain the same. Only when favorable conditions arise again will the sclerotium change back into a plasmodium. When this change occurs, the plasmodium will begin its reproductive cycle. The slime mold does this by changing from a plasmodium and dividing itself into tiny fragments called sporangia. In the sporangium, meiosis will occur, and the formation of haploid spores will soon follow. When the spores are mature, they are set free by any sort of environmental factor, such as wind and rain. These spores, like the sclerotium, can resist any harsh environmental conditions. However, germination of the spores will only occur under the favorable conditions that they thrive on. Upon germination, the spores will transform into swarm cells if the environment is humid enough, or it can transform into the amoeboid form if the environmental conditions are drier. Reproduction will occur when two sexually different cells meet by chance, and eventually, cellular division produces another plasmodium [Sinha: 2011].
There are external conditions that can alter all of the aforementioned processes in the life cycle of the plasmodium. As previously noted, for slime mold grown under laboratory conditions, there are set procedures for the Physarum to grow correctly. However, deviations from the standard procedure for growth are crucial in the understanding of how the Physarum grows in different conditions. One of the crucial nutrients for the laboratory growth of P. polycephalum is the salt, calcium chloride (CaCl2). Calcium plays a role in the motility of the mold through the actin and myosin filaments. However, there is an uncertainty on how different calcium ions and their concentrations affect the movement of the Physarum. According to Hader, calcium channels regulate the actomyosin system [Hader: 1985]. This means that there will be an optimal concentration where the Physarum calcium channels will allow for maximum movement and other concentrations where no effects will be observed. Therefore, if P. polycephalum is exposed to calcium chloride for 72 hours, the calcium will show an excitatory effect (on movement) during the first 24 hours of the experiment. During the final 24 hours, there should be an inhibition of growth. Also, an increase in the concentration of the calcium chloride will further show inhibitory effects.

Materials and Methods:
Nine potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates were chosen for this experiment due to their even nutrient distribution. In three of the plates, 5 mL of 2 mM CaCl2 were poured over the agar on the plates and were left to soak for 10 minutes. This same process was repeated for three other plates but with 5 mL of 5 mM CaCl2, and the remaining three were left as controls (no CaCl2 was added). After ten minutes, the excess calcium chloride was removed from the plates by pouring the solution into a waste bin. The calcium chloride fully saturated the plates during the allotted time.
The source of slime mold for this experiment came from a stock plate containing P. polycephalum and oatmeal flakes. From these plates, 1mmX1mm squares of slime mold were cut and placed in the fully saturated calcium chloride PDA plates. The squares chosen from the stock plate contained the highest surface area covered by the slime mold and an oatmeal piece. All the plates were then collected, taped on the sides, wrapped in foil, and then placed inside a black bag and stored in a dark environment for 24 hours. The initial procedure is summarized in Table 1.
Data was then collected for a period of 72 hours, checking the plates for growth every 24 hours. To collect data, the distance that the Physarum migrated was measured using a millimeter ruler. The migration was measured by following the growth of the Physarum from the center cube that it was placed on, to the farthest corner that it migrated to.

Results:
Overall, the Physarum was totally inhibited by the 2 mM calcium chloride. Figure 1. (and Figure 2.) shows how, over the span of 72 hours, the average distance traveled by the Physarum decreased until it regressed further into the original growth. This is also shown in Figure 3.; during the first 48 hours, a growth was seen. But, during the last 24 hours, the plasmodium traveled further back into the block where it started from. The 5 mM calcium chloride showed the greatest inhibition during the first 48 hours; however, there was a significant growth during the last 24 hours. Furthermore, the results between the 5 mM calcium chloride were not statistically different than those observed by the control group (t-stat = 0.53, df = 4, p = 0.310) 

Discussion:
According to Terry, calcium is meant to increase the growth of P. polycephalum during the first 48 hours and then inhibit the growth during the last 24 hours of a 72-hour experiment. Likewise, as the concentration of the calcium is increased, the inhibitory effect on the growth of the Physarum should also be the greatest. [Terry, Stefanski, & Eisemann: 2009]. The results of this experiment show that at the medium concentration tested, 2 mM calcium chloride, there were excitatory effects during the first 24 hours and then inhibition during the last 48 hours. The maximum concentration of 5 mM did not produce significant results from the controlled set. Also, it did not produce the highest rate of inhibition, as was seen in published literature. 
There are external factors that contributed to the altered results observed in this experiment. The stock plate that was used to culture the Physarum was not abundant in the mold itself. The samples that were cut from the stock plate barely contained any of the sample. That is why it was probable that the slime mold did not grow as expected because there was a lack in it from the start. Potato dextrose is also not the most optimal plate for the growth of Physarum, as it tends to grow better in fructose [Henney & Henney: 1968]. This difference in carbohydrate preference can be attributed to the four-carbon structure of fructose and how simpler it must be for the Physarum to metabolize it; thus, better growth.
	This experiment can be improved by adding other factors to initiate more locomotion of the Physarum. For instance, oatmeal flakes can be added to opposite sides of the stock plate in hopes that the Physarum will migrate to the food source. The PDA plate can also be changed to a fructose plate to create an environment in which the mold will thrive in.
