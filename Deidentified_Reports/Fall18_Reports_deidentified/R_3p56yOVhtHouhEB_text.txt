Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride on Muscle Contractions in a Gastrocnemius Muscle of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
Like hormone-systems, animals use nerves and muscles to sense and respond to internal and external environments. The chemical signals in these pathways allow for very fast response to stimuli. In many organisms, the time from the sensation of a stimuli to the response can take milliseconds. Also, in the neuromuscular pathways, motor neurons meet individual muscle fibers or myofibers at a point called the neuromuscular junction. Electrical signals from motor neurons reach the neuromuscular junction and prompt the release of further signals to activate a contraction in a muscle. This experiment tests the neuromuscular control in a frog leg, specifically the gastrocnemius or calf muscle and the effects of a calcium blocker on muscle contractions. After completing the experiment, we found that a calcium blocker, lanthanum chloride, did reduce a response in the frog legs muscles. These results did support our hypothesis, but the data shows that the difference in response from control and experimental is not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.187. This is possibly due to the data used for interpretation. 

Introduction:
In most vertebrates, including humans, there are not only hormone-based systems but also chemical-based electrical systems in the body. These chemical-based systems can have signals that travel at very fast speeds. In the neuromuscular system, nerves and muscles work together to allow an organism to sense and respond to stimuli. To be more specific, they allow an organism to carry out the processes of sensation and perception. Due to electrical signals, a response can happen within a second. Additionally, in the neuromuscular pathways, motor neurons meet individual muscle fibers or myofibers at a point called the neuromuscular junction. Electrical signals from motor neurons reach the neuromuscular junction and prompt the release of further signals to activate a contraction in a muscle. This experiment will test the neuromuscular control in a frog leg, specifically the gastrocnemius or calf muscle. Specifically, tension, contractions and length of a single twitch will be evaluated with and without the presence of a calcium channel blocker. I hypothesize that the chemical drug will decrease the power of the twitch compared to a muscle twitch without the chemical present in the neuromuscular pathways. 

Materials and Methods:
Prepare a frog leg in a dissecting pan by peeling back the skin from the thigh muscle and remove the skin by pulling it towards the toes (then all the way off). Split the thigh muscle with a dissection probe. Locate the sciatic nerve (the white cord in muscle) and delicately free the nerve from the muscle. Be careful handling the nerve. The less is it traumatized or comes in contact with metal, the better. Be sure to keep exposed tissues moist with Ringer’s solution, but don’t drown them. Set up the leg by watching the video provided. Set the probes up so they are directly touching the sciatic nerve. Set up the online software by clicking the stimulator preferences icon on the Labscribe tool bar to open the stimulator control panel on the Main Window. Check the values for the stimulus parameters that are listed in the simulator control panel on the Main Window: Pulse amplitude should be set at 0.000V, number of pulses to 1, Frequency to 1, and pulse width to 5 ms. The value for the stimulus perimeter can be changed by clicking the arrow buttons to the right of the window that displays the value of the parameter to increase or decrease the value. Type 0.000V in the Mark box to the right of the Mark button. Click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.0 00V and press the Mark button to attach the comment to the recording. Apply a light load to the muscle by raising the force transducer with the tension adjuster until the trace moves a few mV above the baseline. Once a light load is applied, click stop. Change the stimulus amp to 0.1V and click the apply button to effect the change in amp. Type 0.1V in the Mark box and click record to stimulate the nerve with 0.1V and press the mark button to attach the comment to the recording. Stop as soon as the muscle twitches or after a few seconds. Repeat for 0.2-0.5V and then 1.0-3.0V. Record the response from the leg at each interval. After the first leg is done, inject .2 ml lanthanum chloride into the leg using a syringe and wait 8 minutes for the solution to enter the muscle fibers. Repeat the same response process and record the results. Repeat for the other two legs and enter your results into a paired t-test to test for significance. 



Results:
The Frog legs all responded to the injection of lanthanum chloride when charged to force a muscle twitch as shown in Figure 1. All three of the control legs had a larger response than the experimental legs although leg 2 had very similar responses in both control and experimental. Leg 1 had the most noticeable change in response between the control and experimental but also had the largest response out of all three legs. Based on the data, there was a difference in response, but there wasn’t a statistically significant change in the response between control and experimental with a p-value of 0.05 (p=.187). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the chemical drug, lanthanum chloride, will decrease the twitch response compared to a muscle twitch without the chemical present in the neuromuscular pathways is supported. The data in Figure 1 shows a clear decrease in response when the drug was injected compared to the control responses. Though the hypothesis is supported, the change in response is not statistically significant because the p-value (0.187) is much larger than 0.05. This issue could be a result of the data used in the t-test. In this experiment, it was necessary to use a form of raw data to make a conclusion about the experiment. This raw data could be a bad representation of all the data collected from the frog leg responses. In another experiment, it would be best to find a way to represent the data in a more well-rounded approach. All Additionally, error might’ve been a part of this experiment because the difficulty in positioning the sciatic nerve across the probes, and the variable of repeated stimulation to a muscle with a limited supply of ATP. Since the ATP is limited, the leg can only twitch and respond to stimuli until the ATP is all used up. In a similar experiment, calcium inhibitors were used to test their effect on the vasodilation. The researchers found similar results to the experiment that we performed. These results concluded that calcium channel blockers inhibit the contraction by inhibiting some intracellular organelles. Their evidence supports that calcium inhibitors function to inhibit plasmalemmal calcium channel that are activated by depolarization [Cauvin: 1983]. In future research, there could be a combination of these two experiments to help further understand the role of calcium in muscle contractions and the vascular system.
