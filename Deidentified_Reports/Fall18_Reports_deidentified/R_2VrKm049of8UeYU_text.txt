Title: The Effects of Added Sodium on the Gastrocnemius Muscle Contraction of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system is vital for our bodies to communicate with the outside world and with other parts of our bodies. In the Rana pipiens frog, the neuromuscular system is vital in the gastrocnemius muscle for a quick response time to jump away from any predators coming its way. In this experiment, we studied the effects of injecting a sodium solution into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg. Our expectation was that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase. We expected this because an action potential is created by sodium rushing into the motor neuron. We measured the amplitude and the threshold of three frog legs before and after injecting them with a sodium solution. Our data showed that there was a trend at maximum amplitudes because the amplitude of the muscle of the three frogs before the injection was higher compared to the amplitude of the leg after the injection which proves that our hypothesis was not supported. 


Introduction:

The Rana pipiens or the northern leopard frog has long hindlegs to help it jump away from predators or catch prey. Its hindlegs need to have a very fast reaction time from the moment it sees predators. That is one reason the neuromuscular system is so important in the frogs hindlegs. The neuromuscular system can respond within milliseconds and unitizes nerves and muscles to respond to signals from the external and internal environment. Nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to the muscle fiber and triggers the opening of chemically gated sodium channels so sodium rushes into the motor neuron causing an action potential. The action potential causes the muscle fiber to shorten and causes the muscle to move. In frogs, the sciatic nerve controls the movement of the gastrocnemius muscle and the gastrocnemius muscle is very important for the frogs jumping ability, so it has a lot of neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. A study was done at the University of Utah College of Medicine by A. Takeuchi and N. Takeuchi on membrane potential and sodium-deficient injections in frog legs. The study was done by attaching electrodes to frog’s sartorius muscle and sciatic nerve and measuring the amplitude of end-plate potential after injecting solutions of Ringer’s solution with decreased sodium concentrations. They found that after sodium-deficient solution was injected, the equilibrium potential became more negative which means the solution was able to stop sodium movement [Takeuchi: 1960]. For our study, my belief was that injection a frog leg with an increased sodium concentration would have the opposite effect. My hypothesis is that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we measured the amplitude and threshold of three frog legs of roughly the same size and weight. We removed all the skin from the frog legs and periodically sprayed them with Ringer’s solution. Taking one frog, we then exposed the sciatic nerve and attached the gastrocnemius muscle to a string at 90 degrees to the rest of the leg. We attached a probe onto the gastrocnemius muscle as close to the base as possible. We then measured the amplitude in mV and threshold of the muscle at various stimulus amplitudes from 0.1 to 5.0 V. We took the measurements at one pulse, 50 Hz, and 5 W(ms). We then injected the muscle with 0.1 mL of a Ringer’s solution with 200 mM of sodium added and measured the amplitudes and threshold again. We repeated these steps with the two other frog legs to have comparable data. A paired t-test was used to find if the amplitude of the muscle at a stimulus amplitude of 5.0 V was significantly different before and after injection of sodium Ringer’s solution.

Results:
The amplitude of the frog muscle before and after the injection had mostly varied results. For two frogs, the threshold after the injection was a smaller amplitude compared to the threshold before the injection but for one frog the opposite was the case. We also had varied results over the three frog legs for low stimulus amplitudes (0.0 V – 2.0 V). We did however notice a trend across the three frog legs at maximum amplitudes such as 4.0 V and 5.0 V. As shown in Figure 1, each frog had a higher amplitude of the muscle before the injection compared to the amplitude of the muscle after the injection at a stimulus amplitude of 5.0 V. We ran a paired t-test and found that the mean of the amplitude at a stimulus amplitude of 5.0 V before the injection of sodium Ringer’s solution statistically significantly different than that of the mean of the amplitude before the infection (t-stat = 4.93, df = 2, P = 0.039).

Discussion:
My hypothesis that if we increase the amount of sodium in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle, then the amplitude of the muscle contraction will increase was not supported by our data. Adding excess sodium instead had a decreasing effect on the amplitude of each frog muscle contraction. At high stimulus amplitudes (4.0 and 5.0 V), the amplitude of the muscle was lower when the sodium Ringer’s solution was injected into the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle. A study was done by Fenn, Cobb, and Marsh on the effects of sodium and potassium on frog’s sartorius muscles. Frog’s sartorius muscles were soaked in sodium and potassium solutions and the results found that the sodium content of normal frog muscles is relatively not diffusible through the muscle fibers [Fenn: 1934]. These results could explain why our data had such varied results because the excess sodium could not diffuse into the muscle fibers and cause higher muscle contractions like we originally thought. Therefor excess sodium could not be used as a muscle stimulant. Muscle stimulants normally block enzymes that breakdown acetylcholine which is the neurotransmitter involved in action potentials. Although sodium is also vital in generating an action potential, increasing the sodium concentration would not also increase muscle stimulation.
