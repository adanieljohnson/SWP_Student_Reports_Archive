Title: Sciatic Nerve Response of Frog Legs in the Presence of Calcium Inhibitor

Abstract:
The human body, like many organisms, is full of complex systems that allow it to function and survive in its environment. One of these complex systems is the musculoskeletal system, which is responsible for movement. In order for this system to work properly, there are several ions that are needed, and calcium is one of these ions. Keeping this in mind, we decided to test the sciatic nerve response to a stimulus in the presence of calcium receptor inhibitor. We used frog legs in lieu of testing directly on humans because they have the same muscle contracting mechanisms as humans, and it is more ethically sound to test on frog legs than on humans. For the lab, we used three different frog legs and tested each leg with and without calcium receptor inhibitor. Because of this, a two-tailed paired t-test was used, and we found the results to be statistically insignificant.

Introduction:
All complex organisms have both a neuromuscular system. The neuromuscular system and is made up of neurons and muscles and works by using neurotransmitters. The neurons and muscles in the neuromuscular system respond to internal and external stimuli. There are specific ions that are vital to the neuromuscular system to make a response happen, one of which is calcium. Calcium is vital in making muscles contract; however, sufficient ATP must be present or else fatigue will occur in the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, a force transducer was used in order to measure the contractile force of the muscle when calcium was present and when it was inhibited. A force transducer is used because they can easily monitor the contractile activity of muscle fibers [Melzer: 1995]. With this is mind, we decided to look into how calcium inhibitors would affect the muscle’s ability to contract. Studies like this are important because we are able to observe how calcium inhibition works and affects muscles without having to test on humans. We hypothesize that if calcium is inhibited, then the neural response will change. 

Materials and Methods:
The hypothesis was tested by using 3 frog legs. Each leg that the experiment was performed on and acted as the control and experimental group. The frog leg was set up following the steps shown in the videos, then the response of the sciatic nerve was tested to stimuli of 0 volts, 0.5 volts, 0.75 volts, and 1 volt. Data was recorded, then the leg was injected with 0.2 mL of calcium receptor inhibitor. After waiting 8 minutes to allow the calcium inhibitor to bind with the receptors, the sciatic nerve response was tested to stimuli of 0 volts, 0.5 volts, 0.75 volts, and 1 volt again, and data was recorded. This process was repeated for the other two frog legs. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
When the leg was injected with the calcium inhibitor, it swelled up and looked bloated. After the inhibitor was injected and 8 minutes had past, the sciatic nerve was stimulated and there was a smaller but visible response. For the first two legs, the sciatic response decreased after being injected with the calcium inhibitor. The third leg had a higher response at every stimulus after it had been injected with calcium inhibitor. This leg reacted differently than the other legs. The sciatic response of each frog leg prior to being injected with calcium inhibitor and the sciatic response of each frog leg after being injected with calcium inhibitor is shown in  Figure 1. The data shown in the graph is the results of the sciatic nerve response in response to 0.75 volts of stimulus. A two-tailed paired t-test resulted in a p-value of 0.358.

Discussion:
Given that the p-value is greater than .05, the results are not statistically significant. The hypothesis that if calcium receptor inhibitor is injected into the leg than the neural response will change is not accepted. These findings seem to contradict the science behind them, which likely has something to do with the result obtained from the third leg. As shown in the figure 1, when injected with the calcium inhibitor, the leg had a high sciatic response than it had when it was not inhibited with calcium. It is possible that the third leg did not receive the full 0.2mL of calcium inhibitor, so calcium was still able to bind to their receptors and allow for a muscle response that was higher than expected. Calcium is one of the ions that is necessary for a muscle contraction to occur. It does not directly interact with myosin and actin, but instead interacts with troponin which prevents the interaction of myosin and actin [Ebashi: 1968]. Calcium allows for the troponin to expose the actin filament which will then bind with the myosin heads and allow for muscle contraction to occur. When calcium is inhibited this process should not occur because actin will not be exposed because it is still bound to troponin. This study is relevant to the real world because it is an ethically sound way to test the effects of ions like calcium and their importance in muscle contraction. By performing the study on a frog leg, observations that can be generalizes to humans, who similar musculoskeletal systems, without causing harm to them. In the future it would be interesting to test how potassium or sodium inhibitors would affect muscle contraction, or to redo this lab and see if our results would be statistically significant.

Figure Legends: 
The graph above shows the sciatic nerve response to .75 volts of stimulus to three separate frog legs with and without calcium receptor inhibitor. The orange line represents the sciatic response to stimulus after the leg was injected with calcium inhibitor. The blue line is sciatic response before the leg was injected with calcium inhibitor.*************************************************************************
