Title: Effect of Tamoxifen Citrate, a protein kinase c inhibitor, on Physarum Response and Movement

Abstract:
Tamoxifen Citrate is known to be a protein kinase c inhibitor affecting IP3 mediated signal transduction pathways. In this experiment, we looked at how the movement of Physarum polcephalum, an acellular mass grown on surface cultures, is impacted by tamoxifen citrate. However, the results did not turn out as expected due to complete shutdown of Physarum growth. The Physarum cultures simply shut down normal growth, possibly due to external environmental conditions or because the samples had abnormal behaviors. Based on other experiments studying the effect of an inhibitor on Physarum intracellular signal transduction pathways, the data was expected to show movement inhibited and slowed by tamoxifen citrate. Thus, the Physarum control group without Tamoxifen Citrate would have had both a longer average tendril grown and more tendrils grown than the group with added Tamoxifen Citrate.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we explored the IP3 mediated signal transduction pathway by analyzing its effect on the behaviors of Physarum polcephalum. Physarum is an acellular slime mold that is grown on agar surface cultures: a good model system for viewing plasmodial development and sporulation. [Rajan Iyyappan: 2014]. This mass gives the structure of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane. Unanimously, all the nuclei in one mass undergo mitosis. They have complex behaviors and directional movement towards or away environmental conditions. Physarum response is controlled by their intricate system of many intracellular signal transduction pathways. Many scientists established that Physarum organize signaling pathways based on food sources and cellular resources [Alim Karen: 2013].
Both inositol triphosphate (IP3) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are second messengers crucial in the receptor pathways in Physarum and involved in motility of Physarum network [Lee Jonghyn: 2018]. In this experiment, we tested how the movement of Physarum is impacted by introduction of tamoxifen citrate into IP3 pathways. The inhibitor Tamoxifen Citrate is a protein kinase c inhibitor that is typically used to inhibit the effect of hormones comprised in signal transduction pathways. [Zhang Yu-Jin: 2018].  The IP3 mediated pathway is a major signal transduction pathway in which IP3 binds to a receptor ion on the smooth ER. When IP3 binds to its receptor, a Calcium channel opens in the ER and Calcium binds to calcium regulated proteins which will either stimulate or inhibit the activity [Han Shengcheng: 2007]. Thus, the inhibitor will interfere the signal transduction pathway by targeting protein kinase c in the pathway. Our hypothesis was that the movement would be inhibited by tamoxifen citrate as it is a protein kinase c inhibitor. Thus, the migration towards nutrients in the Physarum polcephalum will slow down. The dependent variable is the movement and direction of the Physarum. The independent variable is the addition of the tamoxifen citrate into the cultures. So, the Physarum control group without Tamoxifen Citrate was hypothesized to have a longer average tendril grown and more tendrils grown than the control group with added Tamoxifen Citrate.

Materials and Methods:
The work stock plate was a 100 mm stock plate of Physarum growing on oatmeal-water agar. The oat agar cultures were prepared for viewing plasmodial development and sporulation. We used a purified spatula, flamed with fire and sterilized in 95% ethanol, to cut and transport agar blocks. We labeled the plates and drew three squares evenly spaced on the line. We cut a line through the middle of the Physarum stock plate and cut 1-cm blocks. Next, we removed one 1 cm x 1 cm square of Physarum culture, trying to choose a piece with oatmeal that is well colonized [Lee Jonghyn: 2018]. We placed the agar and oatmeal from the stock culture into the pits of the water agar plate. Then, we placed 5-6 oat flakes onto the water agar and put the cover back on the water- agar plate and taped the lid down. We covered each plate in foil and appropriately stored the plates for less than 24 hours. We then came back to observe the plates and see if the Physarum had grown in the direction of the oats. We did this for all 12 plates; however, for the treatment plates, we soaked the plates in Tamoxifen Citrate. To expose the Physarum to Tamoxifen Citrate, we soaked a plate in the compound. We diluted the stocks, poured the solution on a water agar plate, and let it saturated. We then transferred off the extra solution and added blocks of Physarum. The control plates without Tamoxifen Citrate demonstrated how Physarum grows under typical conditions. We then measured the tendril growth in all twelve cultures after about twenty-one hours [Lee Jonghyn: 2018]. To investigate the effect of Tamoxifen Citrate on Physarum growth and growth direction, we computed a two-tailed t-test. We treated six cultures without Tamoxifen Citrate as control groups and six cultures with Tamoxifen Citrate as treatment groups. We used a two-tailed T-test to explore the effect of the growth rate and direction with different culture conditions. We compared the growth and direction of the tendrils amongst the Physarum cultures by computing a two-tailed T-test. If the p-value was significant enough (p&lt;.05), we were able to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference amongst the control groups and the treatment groups.

Results:
When we measured the tendril growth in all twelve cultures after about twenty-one hours, we saw no growth in any of the treated groups and minimal growth in only half of the control group. Based on other experiments, we expected to find that the addition of Tamoxifen Citrate decreased the number of tendrils grown and the average length of the tendrils grown. The average tendril length grown in the control group should have been a higher average than the treatment group [Fig. 1]. We treated the samples without Tamoxifen Citrate as control groups and the samples with Tamoxifen Citrate as treatment groups. The number of tendrils grown should have been less in the treatment group when compared to the control group. In our results that did turn out, there were 4 total tendrils grown in the control group. We further explored the direction of the tendril growth, which showed a pattern of growing towards the food sources. If we compared the number of tendrils grown amongst the samples in the two different culture conditions, we would compute two, two-tailed T-test to compare the average length of the tendrils and the number of tendrils grown. A p-value less than .05 would be significant enough to support the hypothesis: Movement will be inhibited by tamoxifen citrate as it is a protein kinase c inhibitor.

Discussion:
Despite our unsuccessful results, the data was expected to show movement inhibited by tamoxifen citrate as it is a protein kinase c inhibitor. Tamoxifen is known to inhibit the effect of hormones in cancer cells by causing hydrogen oxide induced DNA damage [Zhang Yu: 2017]. Based on other experiments studying the effect of an inhibitor on Physarum intracellular signal transduction pathways, the data was expected  to show movement inhibited and slowed by an inhibitor. For example, in a study analyzing an inhibitor in Physarum cAMP-mediated pathway, the addition of a cyclic inhibitor decreased the rate of phosphorylation and ATP substrate activity. However, this experiment added a cAMP- protein kinase/ enzyme that defended the cAMP-mediated pathway against the inhibitory effects. This protein kinase showed mechanisms causing cell rupture to solubilize and be healed and restore normal growth [Kuehn Glenn 1971]. Thus, we expected to see inhibited plasmodial development and sporulation in the treated physarum cultures since we didn’t have a defensive enzyme. Tamoxifen citrate was expected to target protein kinase c that controls proteins in the IP3 mediated pathway that the Physarum uses to react to its environment [Farkas László: 2003]. The Physarum cultures simply shut down normal growth, possibly due to external environmental conditions. Physarum require precise environmental needs and culture methods in order for normal growth to occur. A few mistakes could have been from unsterile oat material to the agar plates, a harmful brand and concentration of agar, improper temperature ranges during culture, unfitting length of light and dark periods, and more [Haskins Edward: 2008]. Also, it has been documented in former experiments that some amoeba has a nature of selecting conditions with abnormal amounts of high DNA content making it difficult to induce growth. These changes in amoeba chromosome makeup could have shut down normal growth in the Physarum samples we used [Adler Paul: 1947]. Thus, we concluded that the results for our samples didn’t show normal growing patterns in Physarum due to changes in properties of Physarum during extended culturing. If the growth of the Physarum was normal, we would have expected to see inhibitory effects in the movement of the Tamoxifen Citrate treated Physarum cultures. If we were to repeat this experiment, we would assess the narrow specificity of Physarum more accurately to make sure the culturing process supports normal growth. We would investigate exactly how the IP3 and cAMP mediated signal transduction pathways influence the growth pattern and meroplasmodia growth of Physarum. In another experiments, the absence of glucose was essential for causing plasmodial growth stimulated by the complex network of signal transduction pathways [Lee Jonghyn: 2018]. Thus, we would continue this experiment by using glucose to evaluate the nutrient conditions in the culture environment that influence alternate signal transduction pathways involved in changing Physarum growth mode.
