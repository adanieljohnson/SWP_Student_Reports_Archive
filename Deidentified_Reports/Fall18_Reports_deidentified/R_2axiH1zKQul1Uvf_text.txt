Title: The effects of methoprene on the growth of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The use of pesticides has come under increasing scrutiny as ecological awareness increases amongst society. The effects of pesticides on the pests they are targeting, as well as the effects of pesticides on other aspects of the environment are being researched. In this experiment, we tested the effects of pesticides, specifically Martin’s IGR—insect growth regulator—on the Manduca sexta caterpillar. The expectation was that the caterpillars treated with methoprene (Martin’s IGR), mimicking juvenile hormone, would lengthen and gain weight at an increased rate. Our data showed no significent difference between the length (p_value = 0.146) and weight (p_value = 0.196) of the experimental group and the controll group; in fact, the controll group has larger average changes in weight and length over time than the experimental group. These results suggest that juvenile hormone, in preventing molting of caterpillars, requires less in terms of food and energy typically required to begin the molting process. Therefore, those left untreated by Martin’s IGR consumer more in preparation for pupation, thereby gaining weight and increasing in length faster than those treated with IGR.


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta (commonly known as the tobacco hornworm) belonging to the family Solanaceae, are noted for their posterior horn-like structure maintained in their juvenile state. In their adult state, the M. sexta is a heavy-bodied moth, known as the hawk moth [Byron: 2018]. The hornworm, as it provides an excellent example for insect physiology, has been used in experiments dealing with hormones and their effects. In this experiment, we test the effect of juvenile hormone, in the form of Martin’s IGR methoprene, on the length and weight of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Juvenile hormone regulates the timing of molting; presence of the hormone inhibits molting and the absence of juvenile hormone determines the type of molt, and serves as a prerequisite for pupation [Comparative Physiology: 2004]. In the lifecycle of the M. sexta, the stage before pupation is known as the fifth larval instar during which the presence of juvenile hormone dramatically decreases in preparation for transitioning [Comparative Physiology: 2004]. IGRs, or insect growth regulators, are substances commonly used as pesticides that interfere with the growth of an insect [Wright: 1976]. They disrupt the lifecycle of insects in various ways; in the case of this experiment, the IGR disrupts the lifecycle of the hornworm via the prolonged exposure to juvenile hormone. This exposure prevents the M. sexta from molting and pupating, in essence permanently restricting the hornworm to its juvenile state. If we are to continuously feed the Manduca sexta juvenile hormone, then the hornworms treated with the hormone will grow more in length and weight when compared to the hornworms left untreated. Similar experiments conducted on animals (cows, sheep, and rats) using methoprene illustrated no significent differences in growth—weight or length [Wright: 1976].


Materials and Method:
Four caterpillars were placed in each of four divided sections in a plastic container. These four caterpillars were each administered 10g of feed combined with 10 drops of Martin’s IGR. They were weighed and measured, and this data was recorded. This was the experimental box. Four other caterpillars were then placed in each of four divided sections in a plastic container and administered 10g of feed mixed with 10 drops of water, mimicking the consistency of the feed mixed with the IGR. They were weighed and measured, and this data was recorded. This was the controll box. Measurements for each caterpillar, length in centimeters and weight in grams, were recorded each day for nine days, with food and juvenile hormone being replenished as needed. The changes in weight and length, from the first and last measurements, for each caterpillar were calculated. The changes in weight and length from each caterpillar were averaged for the experimental group and the controll group to result in the average change in weight and in length for each group. Two one-tailed, two-sample t_test were run; one to account for the weight data, and the other to account for the length data. The results of the experimental group and the controll group were the compared.


Results:
Over the course of the experiment, the hornworms seemed to take on a bright green, slightly swollen appearance. They were firm to the touch. As a result of this experiment, there appeared to be no significent difference between the weight and length gained between M. sexta given juvenile hormone and M. sexta untreated. The average change in length and standard deviation of the controll group was 2.325 +/- 0.699 centimeters. The average change in length and standard deviation of the experimental group was less, at 1.1 +/- 2.005 centimeters. The average and standard deviation for change in weight for the controll group was 7.2225 +/- 2.569 grams. The average and standard deviation for change in weight for the experimental group was 5.045 +/- 3.963 grams. Again, the average weight gained by the controll group was greater than that gained by the experimental group. Upon using a two-sample t_test, the change in length of the experimental group was not statistically significently different than the change in length of the controll group (t_stat = 1.154, d.f. = 6, p_value = 0.146). Upon using a two-sample t_test, the change in weight of the experimental group was not statistically significently different than the change in weight of the controll group (t_stat = 0.922, d.f. = 6, p_value = 0.196). 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Manduca sexta treated with juvenile hormone would result in a higher change in length and weight, was not supported. Our data showed no increase in average weight and length grown by the hornworms treated with Martin’s IGR. In fact, the average weight and length gained by the experimental group was less than the weight and length gained by the controll group. At the 0.05 level, there appeared no statistically significent difference between the experimental and controll groups, implying that juvenile hormone does not cause hornworms to gain more weight and length at an above-average rate. This may be attributed to the decreased need to provide energy when exposed to juvenile hormone, as the M. sexta do not need this excess energy for pupation and therefore do not gain this excess weight and length [Tunaz: 2004]. Because juvenile hormone prevents the M. sexta from transitioning into the adult stage, the M. sexta may not need the extra energy, that comes from feeding, to begin pupating. This leads to a new hypothesis; if M. sexta are treated with juvenile hormone or methoprene, the they will consume less than M. sexta left untreated. If the hornworm treated with methoprene does in fact consume less, then a methoprene insecticide would be successful in preventing the deterioration of consumers’ flora as the M. sexta and, applicably, other insects experiencing similar lifecycles, would consume less of said flora. Better understanding these effects of juvenile hormone on Manduca sexta may provide for the creation of more efficient insect growth regulators and further improve pesticides in this manner.
