Title: Effects of decreased salinity on photosynthesis insignificant in Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
The rate of photosynthesis is controlled by a variety of factors, including the openness of the stomatal pores, which allow passage to carbon dioxide and water. When closed, photosynthesis significantly decreases.  Increased external salinity concentrations have been found to encourage the closing of the stomata. DCPIP is a molecule that becomes colorless when reduced.  As photosynthesis in Brassica oleracea proceeds, DCPIP is reduced and the change in absorption can be recorded using a photo spectrometer.  The rate of photosynthesis of Brassica oleracea, also known as kale, was observed in the presence of three different concentrations of sodium chloride solution.  It was hypothesized that decreased salinity would result in increased photosynthesis.  The results were found insignificant using a one way Anova test, indicating that salinity does not have an effect on the rate of photosynthesis.  There is, however, much evidence that increased salinity decreases photosynthesis.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis occurs in plants through three systems.  The first two, named Photosystem I and Photosystem II, are called the light dependent reactions.  At the end of these reactions, the cell contains NADPH, an electron carrier, which has tremendous energy potential.  A proton gradient is formed by transferring electrons between carriers, creating an electrical current that can create energy in the form of ATP.  The third component of photosynthesis is the light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle.  The primary component of this cycle is the enzyme called RUBISCO.  This protein uses ATP to create 6-carbon glucose by the addition of CO2 and a 5-carbon ribulose phosphate.  With these three components, plants take light wavelengths and CO2 to produce energy stores in the form of glucose and oxygen as a byproduct [Nelson, 2006].  This experiment tests the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts isolated from Brassica oleracea var. sabellica (commonly known as kale leaves) in the presence of three different concentrations of NaCl solution.  Two prevalent hypotheses persist to explain how salinity affects plant growth.  First, an increase of salt ions by the roots of the plant decrease the osmotic potential.  Simply, water is less likely to enter the plant because of a decreased concentration gradient.  Secondly, specific ion effects can be exerted onto the leaf structure, decreasing the surface area, and, therefore, photosynthetic activity. world contains regions of varying salinity concentrations [Terry, 1984].  In the midst of an increasingly warmer global climate, ice caps are melting, lowering the average concentration of salinity due to the added water to the larger ocean system.  By conducting an experiment to find the best salinity for kale chloroplast function, insights into the evolutionary history of the plant can be discovered as well as finding useful information for farmers about the ideal salinity conditions in which to grow kale.  It is hypothesized that chloroplasts from kale will functional at optimal levels in a 0M NaCl solution.

Materials and Methods:
Four kale leaves were stripped of their large veins and placed into a chilled mortar along with 10 milliliters of cold grinding buffer.  The buffer solution had a pH of 8 and consisted of 400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer.  A chilled pestle was used to grind the two components into a slurry.  Once no more chunks of kale remained, 10 more milliliters of chilled grinding buffer was added and again ground into a homogenous mixture using the pestle.  Then, the mixture was strained through a tri-folded cheese cloth into a chilled beaker.    The strained product was poured into a 50 milliliter conical tube and placed into a centrifuge along with a second 50 milliliter conical tube containing the same volume of liquid in order to balance the machine.  The liquid was spun in the centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4oC and 1200rpm.  Once complete, the supernatant was poured into a second conical tube, leaving the debris on the bottom of the initial tube.  This supernatant was then spun for 10 minutes at 4oC and 2800rpm, again with a conical tube with the same volume for balance.  Once done, the supernatant was discarded, but the formed pellet was kept in the tube.  20 milliliters of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and carefully mixed with a pipet.  Ten tubes were labeled with number 1-10.  100μl of grinding buffer and pellet mixture was added to each one.  Tube #1 was a blank and contained, 8mL of deionized water and 2mL of reaction buffer.  Tubes #2-4, created to be a 0 molar concentration of NaCl, contained 6mL of deionized water, 2mL of DCPIP and 2mL of reaction buffer.  Tubes #5-7, created to be a 0.3 molar concentration of 2M NaCl, 4.5mL of deionized water, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 1.5mL of NaCl.  Tubes #8-10, created to be a 0.6 molar concentration, contained 3mL of deionized water, 2mL of DCPIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 3mL of 2M NaCl.  
Once the tubes held the appropriate contents, an initial reading was taken with the photo spectrometer at 600nm and recorded.  Then, the reaction tubes were placed in the light for 10 minutes.  A second absorbance reading was recorded using the photo spectrometer.  Two more series of 10 minute light exposure were completed, and an absorption reading was taken after each period, for a total of four absorption reading on each sample.  The statistical test Anova One Way was utilized to determine the significance of results.  The alpha value of 0.05 was used to compare the p-value of the experiment. 


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, photosynthetic activity was highest in 0M concentrations of NaCl solution.  Over 30 minutes, chloroplasts in 0M concentration resulted in a 59.9% change of absorbance in DCPIP.  Chloroplasts in 0.3M solution showed an average change of 58.6% change in DCPIP absorption.  Chloroplasts in 0.6M solution had a 41.1% change in DCPIP absorption.  The one way Anova test found the results insignificant with a p-value of 0.067.  The alpha value used was 0.05.  Any number greater is insignificant, while any number lower is significant.  Among the groups, 2 degrees of freedom among the groups were present and 6 degrees of freedom within the groups were present.  The F-statistic value was 4.404. 

Discussion:
The One Way Anova statistical results of this experiment, detailed in Table 1 determined this experiment to be insignificant, as the p-value is 0.067.  The hypothesis is therefore neither supported nor denied.  Though it is relevant to observe the trends of photosynthetic activity in relation to the three different molarities tested.  The chloroplasts from kale had the lowest activity in 0.6M NaCl solution and the highest recorded activity in a 0M NaCl solution.   Charts 1 and 2 are representing the change in absorbance of DCPIP, a molecule that changes from blue to colorless when reduced.  This is a valuable way to measure photosynthetic activity, as the processes produce a reducing agent.  As photosynthesis occurs, a reducing agent is produced and turns DCPIP colorless [Noorudeen, 1982].  As the absorbance reading of DCPIP on the spectrophotometer decreases, photosynthetic activity increases.  
 In a study lead by Dr. Koyro in 2002, it was found that salinity does have a significant effect on the rate of photosynthesis.  Plant leaves contain stoma, which are the channels for energy intake of primarily CO2 and water.  The stoma must be open for photosynthesis to continuously occur.  Without them being open, the organism cannot take in water or CO2, central components to photosynthesis.  External salinity concentrations can effect the status of the stoma.  In too high or too low salinity concentrations, they may not be open and cannot function at optimal photosynthetic levels [Koyro, 2002].  
Salinity effects photosynthesis, as well as protein synthesis and metabolism.  In 2005, Dr. Parida concluded that high salinity has a negative effect on the growth of a plant and explored the mechanisms behind this finding.  Plants have vacuolar hydrogen pumps, which create a concentration gradient to sequester sodium ions into vacuoles, out of the cytoplasm, as plants do not tolerate high salt concentrations here.  As the vacuoles now have a very high concentration of salt, the cytoplasm imports molecules called compatible solutes.  They account for the molar difference across membranes, yet do not interact with cytoplasmic activity [Parida, 2005].
Plants constantly fight to maintain homeostasis in the presence of a changing external environment.  The stomata on the leaves of the plant are the first defense and regulator of the internal environment.  The stomata can open or close.  When opened, transpiration can occur, which perpetuates the travel of water through the xylem.  Additionally, the stomata can take in carbon dioxide when open.  If closed, the plant can slow water loss, but cannot take in necessary components of photosynthesis.  In the presence of salt, the stomata become less open to protect the homeostasis inside the plant.  This action prevents the intake of carbon dioxide and slows the transfer of water, therefore slowing photosynthetic rates [Rahnama, 2010].
Salinity concentrations are largely determined by how much water is available in the environment.  If more water is present, the salt will be diluted and have a lesser concentration.  During this time of global climate shift, the equilibrium of water is changing rapidly.  A worldwide five year oceanic salinity trend line was published, headed by Timothy Boyer.  Most of the oceans are freshening, while the subtropical South Pacific and the Indian Ocean are increasing in salinity [Boyer, 2005].  The slightest change in ocean salinity creates massive implications for the entire world.  The response of plants to these changes will become more and more prevalent as time continues and salinity concentrations change.
