Title: Ecdysone Inhibitor in Manduca sexta yields lower growth rates and lack of pupation

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillar’s growth and development rely on a balance of hormones, similar to most other organisms. The hormone ecdysone promotes the pupation of the caterpillar as it transitions through each instar. Juvenile hormone prevents molting and encourages natural growth between each instar. The balance of these two hormones is crucial for the proper growth and development of the caterpillar. Ecdysone inhibitor can be added to the diet of the treatment group of these caterpillars to determine the effect of low levels of ecdysone present. This is done by providing a treatment group of Manduca sexta a diet with ecdysone inhibiter added and comparing these to a controll group with a diet with no hormones added. The controll group’s weight increased quickly as ecdysone levels naturally rose to prepare for pupation. The treatment group’s weight increased very slowly and left caterpillars lethargic. This shows that juvenile hormone remained higher than ecdysone levels, promoting regular growth and preventing pupation. This unbalanced level of hormones also proved to be unhealthy for the caterpillars as seen with the lethargy. This also supports the idea of manipulating hormones to be used as a natural pesticide.

Hormones in an organism’s body work together and serve many important functions. When these hormone concentrations are varied, they produce different effects in the organism, activating or inhibiting natural sequences and reactions. This can be studied in the Manduca sexta, a caterpillar that has a well-illustrated molting process, by varying its hormones. It’s changes between larvae phases are called instars, each characterized by a molt. The timing of this molt is controllled primarily by two hormones, ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone. While the effects of these hormones are known, variations of the level of hormones present can manipulate growth and molting phases. This leads to the observation of controllling the growth and development of these caterpillars into moths for uses such as natural pesticides. Similar research has been done that was recorded in a scientific article that studied the effects of Manduca sexta when administered a molting hormone. The results concluded that individuals were unable to develop any further, even after forming a complete molt (Leonard CL. 1985.). In this experiment, the level of the hormone ecdysone will be manipulated by introducing an ecdysone inhibitor to the caterpillar’s diet. It is then hypothesized that the group of caterpillars given an ecdysone inhibitor infused diet will possess incorrect hormones levels, leading to an inability to pupate and result in uncontrollled growth.

Materials and Method:
In this lab, environments were set up for the caterpillars with controll or treatment diets provided. The caterpillar’s growth was observed daily, as well as its weight recorded daily. First the environments for the caterpillars were made. Two four-celled plastic containers, with a lid, were used. Respiration was possible inside the environments by using the “hole” tool to create three holes near the top of each cell. The sharpie was used to label the controll and treatment environment and then label the individual caterpillar cells. The diet was then prepared. 10g of food was measured out for each caterpillar, rolled into a ball, and placed into the cell. If the food was too dry to form a ball, a few drops of water were used to moisten it. Using the transfer pipet, 4 drops of ecdysone inhibitor were then added to the balls of food of the treatment group, remixed and replaced into the cell. Next, each caterpillar was weighed, recorded and placed into its appropriate cell to begin eating and developing. The environments were placed into an incubator and only removed during further daily observations and measurements. Every 24 hours the caterpillars were weighed and observed, and data was recorded. When food levels were low, an additional 10g of food was provided. The extra food did not include ecdysone inhibitor for the controll or the treatment group. The data was recorded daily in a chart depicting the weight of each caterpillar. This data was then used to calculate the maximum weights of both the controll and treatment group and depicted into a bar graph including error bars. Also, the data was statically analyzed in a Sample t Test.

Results:
In the experiment, the treatment group did produce a different growth pattern than that of the controll group. The controll group followed natural growth patterns while the treatment group, in comparison, showed slower growth rates. Also, the treatment group reached a lower maximum average weight compared to the average maximum weight of the controll group being. Another important observation is the length of time it took for each group to begin pupation. The controll group began pupating days before the treatment group showed any signs of pupation. One other important observation is the observation of color and movement. The treatment group lost its teal color and transitioned into a brown color and had very little movement before the pupation began. In this chart, the maximum weights of both the controll group and treatment groups are illustrated. The controll group reached a higher mass with a small margin in the error bars. The treatment group grew to a lower maximum average weight with a slightly larger margin in the error bars. After statistically analyzing the data it yielded a t-value: 6.852, 6 degrees of freedom, and p_value: 2.38x10-4. 

Discussion:
These results did not fully support the hypothesis. The ecdysone inhibitor did have effects on the hormone levels and did slow or prevent pupation in the caterpillars of the treatment group. However, uncontrollled growth did not occur in the treatment group. Juvenile hormone levels remained higher than ecdysone levels in the treatment group resulting in no commitment phase to cause pupation. Juvenile hormone kept the treatment group of caterpillars at a much more consistent and lower weight than that of the controll group. This is because ecdysone prepares the caterpillars for pupation while juvenile hormone prevents pupation. Weight is gained prior to pupation in preparation and this weight gain can be linked to high levels of ecdysone. The controll group gained more weight faster than the treatment group because ecdysone levels continued to rise naturally and weight gain in preparation for pupation was instituted. Also, the observation of discoloration and lethargic movement in the treatment group can show the lethal effects the hormone can have on the organisms in unbalanced quantities. These lethal effects can be related back to the scientific journal where an injection of hormones into the worm can be used as a natural insecticide, inhibiting proper development and inducing lethal effects (Leonard CL. 1985.) From the statistical tests, it can be concluded that with a p_value of 2.38x10-4, the data is significent and is not likely caused by chance.
