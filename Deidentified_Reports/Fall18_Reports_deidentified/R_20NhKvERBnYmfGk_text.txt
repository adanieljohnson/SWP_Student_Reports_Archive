Title: The decreasing effect of lower temperatures on intraspecific agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins

Abstract:
Recently, many questions have arisen regarding the effects that global climate changes will have on animal behavior. For this experiment, we used Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese Fighting Fish, and their intraspecific agnostic behaviors to determine changes in activity levels. One of the most common signs of aggression from a male Betta occurs when it extends its branchiostegal membrane from under the operculum, also called a “red mane.” Six Betta fish were paired up for two different trials (one in room temperature water and the other in cold temperature water) in a clear divided tank. The amount of red mane appearances were then counted over a five minute period for each trial and then compared. There was a significently higher red mane average in the room temperature trials compared to cold water (t=3.24, d.f.=5, p=0.023). Our results showed that even one to two degree changes can lead to significent activity changes in the fish. This will halt their reproduction processes as Bettas will instead dedicate their resources to its own metabolism and vitality instead of producing future generations, causing significent population drops.

Introduction:
During a time of rapidly fluctuating water temperatures, many questions have arisen regarding the effects that these changes will have on animal behavior. For oceanic and other underwater creatures, decreasing temperatures result in an increased dissolved oxygen concentration in water, whereas increasing temperatures result in a lower dissolved oxygen concentration [Boucek: 2017]. As animals undergo cellular respiration in these waters, they should, in theory, use more of the available oxygen to increase energy stores. This addition of energy storage would also increase the activity of the animal. However, most oceanic and underwater creatures are ectotherms, and therefore rely on environmental temperatures to regulate their internal temperatures and energy metabolism [Paital: 2014]. If temperatures drop too drastically, there is a chance that fish and other creatures will put more focus into their metabolism instead of activity.
	Aggressive behavior is very common in and across animal species as organisms compete for limited resources. Betta Splendins, also known as Siamese Fighting Fish, are freshwater fish that engage in intraspecific agnostic behaviors. They are often found in slow-moving and shallow bodies of water in Thailand [Justus: 2018]. Male B. splendins will engage in these aggressive behaviors when coming into contact with other males because they are in competition for a mate. One of the most common signs of aggression from a male Betta occurs when it extends its branchiostegal membrane from under the operculum, also called a “red mane” [Romano: 2017]. This response of aggression to another male can be counted over a total experiment time to find an average rate. It is hypothesized that two male bettas in a significently colder environment will have a lower rate of red mane appearances than two in room temperature water.


Materials and Method:
For this experiment, six male betta fish were obtained and placed in their own separated tank with room temperature water (ten to eleven degrees Celsius). Each fish was given at least five minutes to acclimate to its new environment. At that point, the fish were separated into pairs and named. Fish A was paired with Fish B, Fish C with Fish D, and Fish E with Fish F. Starting with the first pair of fish (A and B), the opaque divider was lifted (but not the clear divider) and the amount of red mane appearances were counted over a five minute period. At the conclusion of five minutes, the divider was returned and the fish were allowed to rest while the other two trials occurred. The next trial with fish C and D is completed using the procedure above, followed by the trial between fish E and F.
	The fish were then moved into their new pairings. Fish A was paired with Fish E, Fish C with Fish B, and Fish D with Fish E. Three cups of ice were added to the water and the temperature dropped to nine degrees Celsius. All fish were given at least ten minutes to acclimate to the temperature change. The opaque divider was removed between the first pairing and the number of red mane appearances were counted over five minutes. At that time, the divider was replaced and the next trial occurred. At the end of this trial, the final cold water trial was completed as well. To analyze our results, we ran a paired two sample test with a critical value of p=0.05.


Results:
There was a significently higher red mane average in the fish in room temperature compared to cold water (t=3.24, d.f.=5, p=0.023). The room temperature trials had an average of 10.333 +/- 7.81 appearances per five minutes. The cold temperature trials had an average of 0 +/- 0 appearances over five minutes. A comparison of these averages can be seen in Figure 1.

Discussion:
In conclusion, our hypothesis is supported by our data. When the temperature of the water is colder, bettas allocate more their resources to maintaining their metabolism rather than engaging in agnostic behaviors [Paital: 2014]. Therefore the beta devotes more resources to survival then it's reproduction. This is important because of the weather trend fluctuations that are creating warmer summers and colder winters. Even one to two degree changes can lead to activity changes in the fish and halt its reproduction. It will instead dedicate its resources to its own metabolism and vitality instead of producing future generations, which will cause significent population drops. Unfortunately, we went too far past the tolerable temperature range of the Betta. In the future, a more specific time range could be found to optimize the maximal activity levels.
