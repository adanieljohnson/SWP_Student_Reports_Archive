Title: Presence of food or female fish may serve as distraction for Betta splendins male fish aggression

Abstract:
In order to understand how and why certain behaviors evolve over time, we explored the aggressive actions of Betta splendins fish in an intraspecific environment. There is a survival and a reproductive aspect to an organism’s fitness. We placed Betta males in an environment where each of these was threatened, predicting the fish to be more aggressive in the presence of a female than in the presence of food. Betta splendins fish are an effective model for assessing aggression because their aggressive behaviors are visible, in the form of broadside or facing movements. Aggression was measured by time to identify each other, time to show aggressive behaviors, and time to make physical contact. Overall, the fish were the most aggressive when it was just the two males, indicating the food and female may have served as a distraction rather than a facilitator for competition. However, the ANOVA tests conducted indicated our results were not significent, and there was significent difference between the treatments. Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn from this study regarding fitness. Further testing would be necessary to indicate how organisms react to different components of fitness being threatened. 

Introduction:
In the study of ethology, understanding why behaviors have evolved in response to speciation and competition is crucial. Most often, the behaviors we witness are a result of fitness. An organism’s fitness is its ability to contribute alleles to the next generation’s gene pool. Two important components of fitness are survival and reproduction. Organisms often have to prioritize one of these components over the other. Most often, competition is the catalyst for these behaviors. For example, when the food source of German yellowjackets is threatened by the presence of other yellowjackets, attacks are much more likely, especially if the food source is fresh [Pusceddu: 2018]. Without the competition for food, the aggression would not occur. We want to know, in an intraspecific environment, if organisms will display more aggressive behavior when their survival or their reproductive success is at stake. By knowing this, we can better predict how organisms will interact in ecosystems, especially ones we can controll like breeding. 
This experiment will explore how fish respond when a component of their fitness is threatened. We will observe the behaviors of Betta splendins fish, more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. This species of fish exhibits very visible responses in intraspecific environments. This can be exhibited through broadside movements (where a fish turns its side toward its opponent), facing movements, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. A fairly common response is the “red mane,” where the branchiostegal membrane extends from the operculum to make a “mane” around the face of the fish. A fish can ignore, match, flee, or escalate in response to an opponent’s behavior.
Every behavior made by an organism has a cost and/or benefit. In most cases the cost is energy use, but it can also be exposure to predators, which can be life-threatening. Benefits can be obtaining food, shelter, protection, or attracting a mate. In some instances, the cost is more than the benefit (either requires more energy or is riskier to attack) causing the organism retreat or back down. In other instances, the energy cost is worth the reward, either food or a mate. For white-tailed deer, the cost of looking for a mate is a loss of body mass — a cost they are willing to take on [Foley: 2018].  By analyzing organisms’ responses, we can more easily understand this cost/benefit relationship, and better understand why organisms behave the way they do.
By introducing different stimuli to two Betta males, we will be able to determine if survival or reproduction is the major component of fitness for this species. This can help us better understand why these aggressive behaviors have evolved and map out the ecological life histories of these animals, as well as predict the cost/benefit relationship in these situations. In this experiment, the presence food will represent the survival component of fitness, while the presence of a female will represent the reproductive component of fitness. In a study conducted on guppies, researchers found that the rate of aggression for the fish was three times greater in the presence of food [Chuard: 2018]. We predict that Betta splendins males will be even more threatened, and therefore display more aggressive behavior to each other quicker, in the presence of a female compared to the presence of food, because in most environments it is easier to find food than it is to find a mate.  


Materials and Method:
First, we obtained a small aquarium with opaque dividers to make three compartments. In each of the first two compartments, we placed a Betta splendins male, and a female in the third compartment for later in the experiment. To create a baseline for aggression, we removed the barrier between the two males and observed their interactions and behaviors for five minutes, then they rested for five minutes to return to a calm state. Next, we removed the barrier between the two males, this time adding a pinch of fish food to the tank, once again recorded behaviors for five minutes followed by five minutes of rest. Finally, the barrier between the two males was removed and a female Betta was added, and behaviors were recorded. This process was repeated twice more with a different set of fish each time. 
During the observation time, we recorded how many seconds it took for the two fish to identify each other, how many seconds it took for the fish to show aggressive behavior toward each other, and how many seconds it took for the fish to make physical contact. After physical contact was made, the fish were immediately separated to prevent the fish from seriously harming or killing each other, even if five minutes had not passed. We considered the fish to identify each other when the two fish were facing each other and seemed engaged or made eye contact. Also, if the fish did not make contact before the five minutes passes, the contact time was recorded as 300 seconds. 
After all measurements were collected, we conducted three separate ANOVA tests to determine if the differences in each treatment were significent. The tests were conducted at the alpha level 0.05 and used the three trial times for each treatment. The three ANOVA tests were for the times to identify, to show aggressive behavior, and to make contact. (Method are adapted from the WFU Biological Principles Laboratory Manual.) 


Results:
Overall, the average times recorded for the two males with no food or female were shorter than the other two treatments, with the exception of the time to make contact, which was the longest of the three treatments (6 sec. ± 6.0277 identify, 8 sec. ± 8.6216 aggressive, 212 sec. ± 151.8431). The average times for the two males with food treatment were the next shortest (8 sec. ± 5.2915 identify, 42 sec. ± 50.0899 aggressive, 148 sec. ± 142.5213 contact). Finally, the two males with a female treatment had the longest average times (46 sec. ± 34.9332 identify, 73 sec. ± 59.6574 aggressive, 163 sec. ± 138.5364 contact). The figures above show a comparison of each measurement for the different treatments. 
Three separate ANOVA tests were conducted, one comparing the average identify times, one comparing the average aggressive times, and one comparing the average contact times. No significent results were produced for all three ANOVA tests, therefore a Tukey-Kramer test was not needed. 


Discussion:
We predicted that Betta fish males would display aggressive behavior quicker in the presence of a female compared to in the presence of food because in most environments, food is easier to find than a mate. After analyzing our data, we cannot support a hypothesis. 
In the presence of a female, the Betta males took longer to identify each other, display aggressive behavior, and make contact. This is the opposite of what we expected. In terms of identifying and showing aggressive behavior, the males were the quickest to do this without food or a female present. When the female was present, the males would often show aggressive behavior to her rather than to the other male. Additionally, when food was present, the males would often identify the food first before the other male. A possible explanation for this was that the food and female served as distractions for the males, rather than act as an initiator for aggression. In some cases, when the female was present, there was some leftover food. The males seemed more occupied with the food then with the female. This is a major limitation, along with small sample size and tank size. 
The ANOVA tests conducted, however, indicate that our results are insignificent. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about how Betta males trade-off costs and benefits in terms of survival and reproduction. The fish, overall, were not as aggressive as we expected. This may be because a large amount of food was given so there was less competition for resources between males. In the previously mentioned guppy study, the fish were much more aggressive when food was present [Chuard: 2018]. This might have been observed if the food was in more of a limited amount. Further testing would need to be done to make any conclusions about fitness components in Betta fish, due to our insignificent results.  
In future studies, the tank size might be considered. In some cases, the fish were too distracted to interact with each other. It might be more beneficial to repeat these tests in a smaller tank size, so the fish are forced to interact with each other. Additionally, smaller food amounts would spark more competition, and could produce more results. 
Overall, we can assume that Betta splendins fish behave in the least confrontational way possible, and when aggressive behaviors are unnecessary, they are not performed. This indicates that the cost of competing and performing these aggressive behaviors is greater than the benefit or obtaining food or a mate. These behaviors most likely evolved over time to benefit the species in terms of successful fitness and surviving selection events.
