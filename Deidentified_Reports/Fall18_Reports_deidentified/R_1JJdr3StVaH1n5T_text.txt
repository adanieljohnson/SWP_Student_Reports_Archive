Title: The Effects of Increased Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta Producing Statistically Insignificent Increase in Growth

Abstract:
This study focused on the role of hormones in growth and development of Manduca sexta. 3 hormones generally impact Manduca growth. These include juvenile hormone that is known to decrease as the larvae moves towards pupation.  It was investigated how increased levels of juvenile hormone (JH) in Manduca larvae impact growth and development as measure by weight change. It was hypothesized that if JH increased, then growth and development would slow. One controll was group given food with no JH and one experimental group was given 2 drops of 5% JH per 10 grams of food. Caterpillar weights were recorded on days 0-14. The results of calculated differences between initial weight and maximum weight showed a larger average weight gain in the experimental group than the controll group and slightly more consistent growth, but the one-tailed two-sample t_test proved the results to be statistically insignificent. Thus, the null hypothesis that increased JH at this ratio does not have any effect on growth must be accepted. 

Introduction:
This lab explored impacts on the growth and development of Manduca sexta larvae. They are known as tobacco hornworm caterpillars and are pests. M. sexta has a holometabolous life cycle that lasts about 48 days [Johnson: 2018]. Development in the caterpillars is greatly controllled by the relative levels of brain hormone, juvenile hormone, and ecdysterone. The interaction of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E) is particularly significent in development. Until the 4th larval instar, JH levels are very high, but they then fall intensely during the 5th instar. When this coincides with a small raise in 20E, it is said that the commitment pulse is reached and pupation is imminent. 20E level will then remain higher than JH levels [Johnson: 2018]. Prior research has been done on hormone manipulation and effects on development in Manduca.  “Juvenile hormone delayed or prevented the onset of metamorphosis by neck-ligated fourth-instar tobacco hornworm larvae and by fifth instars neck-ligated prior to the cessation of feeding…After the onset of the wandering period J H had precisely the opposite effects in that it accelerated the onset of metamorphosis…These findings point to a previously unsuspected shifting role of JH in the controll of metamorphosis” [Safranek: 1980]. The wandering period is a preparation for pupation that is determined by an inner circadian timer [Dominick: 1984]. With all this information in mind, an experiment was designed to answer the question: how does an increase in juvenile hormone levels impact M. sexta growth and development?
Data on ways various hormone levels stall or accelerate Manduca development between being a larval pest and a procreating adult moth can be used to develop treatments for the pest problem. Based on knowledge of JH levels throughout the larval instars, the alternate hypothesis states that if it JH levels are increased, caterpillar growth will slow down. The alternate hypothesis is that it will not impact growth in any way. The dependent variable of growth will be defined by weight change. 


Materials and Method:
On day 0, 8 Manduca caterpillars of approximately the same age [insert instar] were divided evenly into a controll group and experimental group. Initial weights were recorded. Each caterpillar was put in a separate well in an aerated plastic container. Each caterpillar was given an initial 10 grams of food (insert food name) in its well. The experimental group was administered 2 drops of 5% JH hormone in each 10 gram dose of food. The controll group had their food wet with 2 drops of water per each 10 gram dose of food. The caterpillars inside their containers were kept in an incubator at  [insert temp]__°C. Every day for the 14 following days, the weight of every caterpillar was measured and recorded. Food (with or without hormone) was appropriately replenished as it ran out or dried out. At the end of 14 days, a one-tailed two-sample t_test was conducted on weight changes.

Results:

Overall, there was quite a wide spread of weight change for both groups with standard deviations between 5 and 7 grams, but many of the caterpillars in the 5% JH group saw greater weight change between their day 0 weight and their maximum weight than their 0% JH counterparts as seen in Table 1.  It is shown in Figure 1 how the average growth for the experimental group (8.6725 g) is larger than that of the controll (6.13 g). However, the 1 tailed 2 sample t_test produced a p value of 0.28798 which is greater than the alpha value 0.05, suggesting that the differences are statistically insignificent. The specific trial of caterpillar 1 in the experimental group produced a unique value of 0 g weight change because it died within 1 day. In Figure 2 and Figure 3, one can see the most dramatic growth generally happened between days 5 and 11 (although data was not able to be collected during several days in this interval), but the experimental group showed more consistent, rapid growth for all living caterpillars (Figure 3). Several of the controll caterpillars showed extremely little growth during this period still.  After day 11, all caterpillars saw a decline in weight, but the controll group had more dramatic, fast drops in weight. Qualitatively, one of the smaller controll group caterpillars was the only one to show signs of turning brown on one side and molting. In the last 4 days, the experimental group caterpillars had a very noticeable pulsing blue line down their bodies.


Discussion:
The results did not support the hypothesis. The null hypothesis that increased levels in JH have no effect on caterpillar growth must be accepted at the end of this experiment. Not only were results were seen to be statistically insignificent in general, but the trends show that the rate of growth and general size increase for the experimental group was more dramatic than in the controll group. Considering none in the experimental group showed as little weight gain as the two smallest controll caterpillars, increased JH levels may ensure some degree of appetite increase and growth. The fact it was a controll caterpillar that showed signs of molting, does however suggest that while JH could be connected to size increase, it might inhibit the caterpillar from moving towards pupation as expected. It is possible that the results of this experiment are in accordance with the findings mentioned prior that JH has unsuspected shifting roles in development around the normal time for the commitment pulse [Safranek: 1980]. The experiment could be redone with many larvae in quite different instars to see how a sudden increase in JH affects caterpillars at each stage of development. It is possible that only putting in 2 drops of JH per 10 grams of food was not enough to show cause dramatic and easily distinguishable effects, and the experiment could be redone with generally more samples and more experimental groups including those administered a larger dose of JH.  
Error and limitations in this experiment also include the inability to monitor and feed caterpillars daily for 3 days due to weather. Rates of growth are thus unknown for this period when growth seemed to be the my dynamic. The experiment should be redone with more consistent measurement.
In real world application, it can be concluded that treating tobacco hornworm with this degree of JH will not be beneficial to plant owners. The accepted hypothesis is that it will have no effect. The caterpillars will possibly even have increased appetites and grow rapidly in size and thus be more detrimental to plants. The results of this experiment do not suggest that they will necessarily be kept from reproducing either.
