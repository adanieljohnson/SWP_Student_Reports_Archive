Title: Effect of pH on photosynthetic rate on the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
In this lab we studied the effects of varying pH on the photosynthetic rate of the chloroplasts derived from Spinacia oleracea. We hypothesized that if the chloroplasts are placed in an acidic environment at a pH of 5, then the primary productivity will decrease over time and if they are placed in a basic environment of pH 10 then primary production will decrease. We grinded the chloroplasts up and made four assays of no chloroplasts, neutral chloroplasts, basic chloroplasts, and acidic chloroplasts, which we put in the spectrophotometer  to measure absorbance as a function of photosynthetic rate. We found that our results were insignificant as our p value was 0.704 at three degrees of freedom which was larger than our alpha value of 0.05. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported most likely because of the confounding variable of light intensity on the cuvettes. We will repeat the experiment in order to correct for this and eventually test other factors that affect photosynthetic rate.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants use light energy in order to produce glucose through the light dependent reactions and the light independent reactions. [Sudhir: 2004] The plants use light to reduce electrons to help convert CO2, which they get from their stomata absorbing it from the air, and water, which plants use phloem to transport from soil to the rest of it [Sudhir: 2004]. They then use these reactants in order to produce glucose and the waste product of oxygen. The overall formula for this process is 6CO2+6H2O+ light energy C6H12O6+ 6O2 [Sudhir: 2004]. The plant`s chloroplasts are responsible for the absorption of light through the presence of the chlorophyll pigment within them [Sudhir: 2004]. Photosynthesis takes place in the plant-specific organelle chloroplast, with the light dependent reactions taking place within the thylakoids and the light independent reaction taking place within the stroma [Scheibe: 2005]. In the light-dependent reactions the water is split into electrons which help reduce NADP+ to NADPH [Scheibe: 2005]. From there non-cyclic photophosphorylation uses a proton gradient between the thylakoid lumen and stroma to help power ATP synthase which phosphorylates ADP to ATP [Scheibe: 2005]. In cyclic photophosphorylation the electrons` energy is used to create more ATP and produce NADPH [Sudhir: 2004]. Followed by this is the Calvin Cycle or light-independent reactions in which carbon dioxide is fixed, ATP and NADPH are used as reducing agents and to produce sugar [Sudhir: 2004]. In this experiment we will be using spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea, as their chloroplasts will be easily isolated and are easily torn in order to remove the veins. Photosynthesis is a process central to many organisms due to its products of glucose and oxygen, which aerobic organisms need [Scheibe: 2005]. However, there are many different factors that may affect photosynthetic rates of a plant from the temperature, the salt concentration of the soil, and the accessibility of light/water [Scheibe: 2005]. We are most interested in how the pH of the soil affects the chloroplasts` rate of photosynthesis or primary productivity as we already know that a neutral pH of about 6-7 is ideal for plants [Xu: 2017]. We will be using the amount of light absorbed by the chloroplasts to determine the rate of photosynthesis as the greater the absorbance the greater the rate of photosynthesis. We predict that if the chloroplasts are placed in an acidic environment at a pH of 5, then the primary productivity will decrease over time and if they are placed in a basic environment of pH 10 then primary production will decrease.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we split our methods into two exercises. For our first one we started by cooling a mortar and pestle, acquiring a medium beaker (150-250 mL), and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes in crushed ice. While the mortar and pestle was cooling we removed the large central veins from four medium sized spinach leaves. We threw the veins away and rinsed the rest of the spinach with water. We then blotted the leaves and put them into the mortar and pestle. After this we added 10 mL of cold grinding puffer and grinded it until a thick paste was formed. We once again added 10 mL of grinding buffer and strained it through three layers of cheesecloth in to the medium breaker. From this we transferred 200 uL into a microtube labeled sample of A and stored it on ice. With the remaining green paste, we placed it in a chilled 50 mL centrifuge marked “A” and spun it at 1200 rpm for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. After it was centrifuged we poured the supernatant out of the tube into a second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. We then removed 200 uL of the liquid from the 50 mL tube marked “B” and placed it in a microtube labeled “sample of B” and stored on it on ice. WE then centrifuged the 50 mL. tube “B” at 2800 rpm for 10 min. at 4 degrees Celsius. After it was spun we poured the supernatant into a 50 mL tube marked “C” and placed tube “B” on ice. We added 15 m: grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We transferred this resuspended pellet in to three 5 mL. volumes and put these volumes into three conical tubes. We then added 5 mL of pH buffer to each tube and spun again at 2800 rpm at 10 min. at four degrees Celsius and resuspended the pellets in 3 mL of grinding buffer after spinning. For the last part of this exercise we removed 200 uL from tube C and placed it in a microtube labeled sample of C and stored it on ice.
For exercise two we first labeled thirteen large test tubes and placed them in a tube rack. In one tube we made a blank which just had 8 mL. of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. We then made three tubes which had no chloroplasts, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. We made three tubes of neutral chloroplasts with 6 mL. of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. We made three tubes of acidic chloroplasts with 5 mL. of water, 2 mL. of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL. of reaction buffer, and 1 mL. pH buffer 5. Lastly, we made three tubes of basic chloroplasts with 5 mL. of water, 2 mL. of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 1 mL. of pH buffer 10. We started the assay by adding 100 uL of enriched chloroplasts to the blank tube and tubes 4-12 (everyone except the no chloroplasts group). We then mixed them and transferred them to spec. cuvettes. We immediately blanked spec at tube 0 and measured absorbances of all samples followed by placing them under grow light. After ten minutes we blanked the spectrophotometer and recorded all absorbances at 600 nm. We then placed our samples under grow light again and repeated this process after twenty minutes (cumulatively) and thirty minutes (cumulatively).
We then used an ANOVA test for our statistical tests.


Results:
The negative control of no chloroplasts did not have a lot of variance in terms of its percent change between the time intervals. The positive control of neutral chloroplasts did started with a rather high % change but then decreased as the time progressed. The treatment groups of acidic had a similar trend as the neutral but started higher and went down much faster than the neutral. The basic chloroplasts had started pretty high and then exhibited the same trend as acidic and neutral chloroplasts but at a slower rate. We used an ANOVA test to determine that at 3 degrees of freedom we had a p-value of 0.704 which was over our alpha-value of 0.05 so our results were not significant.

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis as our results were not significant and therefore there was not a large enough difference between our results of the four groups to determine whether one pH elicited a greater or less effect on primary productivity. It is already established that the most efficient pH to place plants in is neutral conditions and that putting them under acidic and basic conditions would eventually lead to plant death [Xu: 2017]. However according to figure 1, acidic had the greatest percent change and neutral was in between acidic and basic in terms of its percent change. According to the article, the percent change should be greatest in neutral and should steadily increase as the more time that elapses the more time the leaf has to photosynthesize and therefore absorb [Xu: 2017]. While the basic and acidic should have a steady decrease in absorbance and not have as great a change between the first two time intervals [Xu: 2017]. Potential reasons for this could be the positioning of the grow light over our cuvette holder as the light intensity and accessibility would be higher on those cuvettes that were right underneath it while the ones on the periphery of the light would not experience as much light from the lamp. For the ones that were placed right under the lamp the intensity was the greatest which meant the heat and light energy the cuvettes got was also the greatest. This would definitely affect our results because, as mentioned in the introduction, this would means they could split the water more readily than those chloroplasts placed in the cuvettes on the perimeter of the lamp [Inamato: 2015]. The faster the electrons can be obtained the faster the ADP and NAD+ can be reduced and therefore the quicker the rest of photosynthesis can occur allowing for more absorption to occur [Inamoto: 2015]. The opposite occurred for those cuvettes that did not get as much light energy as they took longer to cleave water, acquire the high energy electrons, and reduce the ADP/NAD+ so they were not able to express as great a change in absorption [Inamoto: 2015]. This deficit in absorption was not due to the pH but rather the confounding variable of light intensity or accessibility on the cuvettes containing the various pH`s. If performed again we would make sure to give all the cuvettes adequate and the same light by splitting them up amongst more racks and using more grow lights. If we repeat the experiment and eliminate the confounding variables then we can test other factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis such as salt, temperature, soil mineral composition to see how we can maximize plant photosynthesis as much of the organisms are aerobic and rely on plants ability to produce oxygen.

Three tubes for each group were measured in terms of absorbance and the percent change from 0-10 min, 10 min-20 min, and 20 min-30 min. The percentages were averaged amongst the three tubes of each group for the three time intervals and plotted. Negative percent changes were changed to positive with the no chloroplasts being the negative control and the neutral chloroplasts as being the positive control. The acidic and basic chloroplasts were the experimental.*************************************************************************
