Title: The Effect on Spinacia Oleracea Isolated Chloroplasts Photosynthesis with Addition of Carbonated Water 

Abstract:
Chloroplasts were isolated from Spinach Oleracera leaves to investigate the potential effect of carbonated water on photosynthesis. A carbonated enviornment has been shown to increase the production of photosynthesis, however, the direct effect of carbonated water on isolated chloroplasts could be further investigated. CO2 is a reactant that combines with light and water to form glucose in a multi-step reaction inside Chloroplasts and therefore, should increase the production of glucose and photosynthesis. A reaction monitor 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) an alternative electron acceptor was used to monitor the reaction of photosynthesis by spectrophotometry. A one-tailed T-test with equal variance concluded the percent difference in photosynthesis between water and carbonated water was not statistically significant (P-value = 0.17). Possibilities of inconclusive results may be due to centrifugation effecting the thylakoid membrane resulting in CO2 entering the thylakoid membrane space. CO2 would react with water and the alkaline pH would become more acidic.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a mechanism by which plants produce and store energy. Sunlight is transformed and stored into multiple types of energy; chemical energy, an oxidative reduction potential, and electric or chemical energy.  This process occurs across a lipid bilayer membrane, which processes then stores sugar molecules known as amylopectin and amylose (starch). Plants break down starch into glucose, which can be processed by the Krebs Cycle to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy output molecule of oxidative respiration. Plant photosynthesis to the production of energy can be broken down into multiple different components way beyond the general background above. 
A light independent reaction is the most important component for this experiment. The light independent reaction uses a byproduct from the light dependent reaction, NADPH, which is reduced by adding electrons to its aromatic ring, shown in Figure. 1. Reduced NADPH interacts with an enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and CO2. This holoenzyme complex can now interact with ribulose, a five-carbon sugar, to produce glucose. The overall reaction of photosynthesis is displayed in the equation 1. Our experiment was designed to alter the environmental conditions of chloroplasts by testing the effects of carbonated water on photosynthesis. Plant cells have been shown to successfully photosynthesize in carbonated water due to an enriched reactant atmosphere [Moore: 1999], [Jolliffe].  However, how does adding a CO2 gas effect the chloroplasts ability of photosynthesis?  We hypothesized that photosynthesis would increase because carbon dioxide is a reactant in the mechanism of photosynthesis. Gibbs free energy is a measurement of equilibrium due to different conditions imposed on a reaction. When there is an increase in reactants, according to Le’Chateliers principle, Gibbs Free energy will shift to favor equilibrium based on the new conditions. If an increase in carbon dioxide occurs the reaction equilibrium will shift to cause for an increase in the product, glucose [Buelens: 2-16]. Adding carbonated water to chloroplasts will provide chloroplasts with an enriched CO2 atmosphere increasing photosynthesis. 


Materials and Methods:
Spinach leaves were ground into solution using Grinding Buffer (400mM sucrose and Tricine Buffer, pH 8.0) in order to extract chloroplasts. Centrifugation was utilized in order to lyse plant cells and separate proteins from debris and form a pallet that was resuspended. Protocol was of two centrifugation steps were changed to three due to a mistake in execution of the methods, an extra centrifugation step was applied and though to be the best solution for the mistake. The pellet was resuspended with Grinding Buffer and separated into two vails of equal volume. Distilled water was added to one vail, while Seltzer (Carbonated) Water of equal volume was added to the other. Chloroplasts were then added to 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), 100mM phosphate (reaction buffer), and distilled water. DCIP is a blue indicator for photosynthesis becoming more translucent with an increase in photosynthesis by being an alternative electron acceptor. Therefore, spectrophotometry at 600 nm was used to determine the translucency (concentration) of active chloroplasts in each system.  Absorbance measurements were recorded in triplicate at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. Percent Change was plotted and used to determine the difference between carbonated and distilled water. It is important to point out that with an increase in percent change, there is a decrease in blue color that correlates with an increase in photosynthesis. 
A one tailed paired T-test with equal variance and 95% confidence intervals was performed for statistical analysis. 

Results:
Carbonated water had a reduced effected on photosynthesis when compared to distilled water (T-stat = 1.065, df = 4, P = 0.17) The mean percent difference and standard deviation for distilled water at 10, 20, and 30 minutes was 16.39%  0.11, 31.44%   0.17, 45.15%    0.23. The mean percent difference and standard deviations for carbonated water at 10, 20, and 30 minutes were 11.53%    0.06, 22.77%    0.05, and 27.95%  0.06. 

Figure 2. Displays the effects of Distilled Water and Carbonated Water on the percent change of DCIP relative to time.  Carbonated water decreased the percent change and therefore decreased photosynthesis when compared to distilled water at times 10, 20, and 30 minutes. This difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). 

Discussion:
Our results demonstrated that carbonated water decreased photosynthesis compared to distilled water.  This difference was apparent at time 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes, with carbonated water always having a lower percent change. This goes against the majority of the literature which suggests that chloroplasts increase photosynthesis when CO2 (i.e. carbonated water) is present [Jolliffe: 1968], [Cao: 2017], [Makino]. However, prolonged exposure to CO2 has been shown to have drastic effects on growth, reproduction, and energy production in multiple plant types [Haskett: 1997], [Griffin: 1999]. This detrimental effect is unlikely in this experiment due to the low exposure time to CO2. Other explanations that may have produced a lower percent change for carbonated water could be due to a change in pH. Mixed reviews have been published on whether CO2 effects the Hill Reaction. Babette at al. were unable to show an effect of CO2 on the Hill Reaction, however, many other publications have stated otherwise [Babette: 1962], [Fredrick: 1961].  An alternative explanation could be a reaction between Tricine Buffer and carbonated water resulting in a shift in pH. This, however, is unlikely because Tricine Buffer, a common buffer for photosynthesis and chloroplast experiments, was used to minimize pH changes. Carbonated water may have contained additional substances (i.e. contaminants) that we were unaware of and did not determine that could have altered our results. Finally, the reduction in percent change could be attributed to the difference in pH associated with the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplasts.  Chloroplasts normally have in insoluble cell wall, however during cell lysing and centrifugation, the reagents used damage the cell wall. Damaging the cell wall allows CO2 and water to enter the thylakoid intermembrane, a high pH solution of 8. Water will react with CO2 forming carbonic acid or bicarbonate H2CO3 or H+ and HCO3- affecting the desired pH of the thylakoid intermembrane and decreasing photosynthesis. The following data should be tested again with a more specific method for analyzing the percent change at a smaller time interval and with multiple different types of Buffer solutions. Future experiments aim to increase validity of results.
