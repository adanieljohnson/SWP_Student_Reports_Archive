Title: The Effects of Water Color and the Presence of Glass Dividers on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta Fish

Abstract:
In this study, we were able to observe how Betta splendens behavior changed when introduced to another male of the same species in different colored water and with and without a physical but transparent barrier. We predicted that when placed in clear, red, and green colored water, the behavior of Betta males would not differ between treatments. Our data did not show a significant difference in behavior of Betta males in different colored water conditions and with the presence of a glass divider. Our results suggest that water color does not have an effect on behavior, as the males were similarly aggressive in all three conditions. This helps explain how Betta males react when in the presence of another male, which is not affected by water color or glass. This study also helps to demonstrate how Betta fish use their physiology and fitness to compete with other males for female attention and to ensure their survival.

Introduction:
This experiment examines the effects of water color and the presence of glass on the behavior of two pairs of Betta Splendens. In order to measure and examine intraspecific, aggressive behavior, we used Betta fish because of their tendency to demonstrate aggressive reactions when they come in contact with one another. It is important to study aggressive behavior in Betta males in order to understand how aggressive behavior affects their fitness, giving them an advantage over other males in terms of survival and competition for females. However, displaying aggressive behavior can be costly in terms of oxygen consumption, energy use, and long-term physiological repercussions of winning or losing a fight [Castro: 2006]. When in contact with other males, which they view as opponents, Betta fish will display varying levels of aggressive behavior, such as broadside movements, facing movements, and agonistic behavior. Broadside movements are when a Betta turns its side toward its opponent and include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. Facing movements occur when a Betta male directly faces its opponent and include erect pectoral fins, spreading of the gill covers (opercula), and producing a red “mane” caused by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane below the opercula [Johnson: 2018]. Other agonistic or aggressive behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, darting, biting, and nipping [Johnson: 2018]. We plan to test the effect of different water color on the aggressive behavior between two Betta males with and without a glass divider. We predict that there will be no significant difference in behavior when in clear water compared with green and red water. The independent variable is the color of the water and the dependent variable is the aggressiveness of the Bettas

Materials and Methods:
Two tanks separated into three sections by a glass divider were filled with water. The first tank was clear and the second tank was dyed red. Two different pairs of male Bettas were placed in both tanks and each pair was tested in all three conditions of water color (clear, red, and green). For each trial, the Betta’s behavior was examined with the glass divider and then without the glass divider. Each trial was conducted for five minutes and then the Bettas were given five minutes of rest. After the trials with the clear water were complete, the Bettas were transferred to a temporary tank while the first tank was dyed green. After one pair had finished both trials for one water color, they were transferred to another tank with a different water color. Each pair of Bettas underwent two trials per treatment in three water colors with and without the glass divider in each. Behavior of each male under each condition was recorded on a scale of 1-5, one showing no aggressive behavior and five showing the most aggressive and agonistic behavior. An ANOVA test was used to test if there was a significant difference in behavior of Betta males in different water colors with and without a glass divider.

Results:
As seen in figure 1, for the trials in the three different water colors, which served as the independent variable, we tested the affect on behavior with the glass divider and found that the males’ behavior was consistently aggressive when placed in different colored water and with presence of a glass divider. The results were not statistically significant (F (11) = 0.842, P=0.462). For the trials in the three different water colors, when we tested the affect on behavior without the glass divider, we also found that the males were equally as aggressive regardless of water color and the presence of a glass divider. The results were also not statistically significant (F (11) = 0.206, P=0.818). Although the highest average level of aggression was seen in the green water without the glass divider (4.00 +/- 2.00), this result was not significant enough to determine that water color and the presence of glass affects the aggressive behavior of Betta males. Through this study, we also found that the smaller male can make himself seem larger by spreading his fins in order to compensate for his smaller body size and can dominate the larger male.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis for the level of aggression in Betta males was supported, as there was no significant difference in behavior due to water color or due to the presence of a glass divider. Although the glass divider physically separated the males so they could not attack each other, they still displayed similar amount of aggression with and without the divider. We also found that the color of the water did not affect the behavior of the individuals when in the presence of another male. However, through our observations, we did find that the group of two blue males displayed very different levels of aggression, as one proved to be more dominant than the other. This pair also seemed to display the most aggressive behavior when in the clear water, yet one was still inferior to the dominant Betta. As the experiment continued, we found that the fish were not displaying the same degree of aggressive behavior, even after five minutes of rest between each trial, suggesting that they were fatigued or had begun to familiarize themselves with their opponent. In another study where two groups of Bettas, one that was provided with a visual of other Bettas for ten days and another that was visually isolated from other Bettas for ten days, found that previous social experience may have an effect on the intensity of Betta behavior, as the isolated Bettas displayed aggressive behavior more often when introduced to another male Betta compared to the visually experienced Bettas [Miley: 1977]. Another study, which examined the effect of Betta behavior in different colored environments using colored wallpaper to surround the tank also found that there was no significant difference in aggressive Betta behavior when placed in different colored environments [Irawan]. If we were to further investigate this experiment, we would switch the pairs so that the same males were not together for every trial in order to test if behavior changes when introduced to a new male. The red and blue pair displayed similar levels of aggression under each condition, showing how Bettas typically mimic the other male’s movements and match their level of aggression. Understanding how Betta males react to one another under different conditions helps explain animal behavior and physiology, as well as how different behaviors affect a species’ fitness.
