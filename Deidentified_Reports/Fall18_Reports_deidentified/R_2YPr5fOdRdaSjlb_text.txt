Title: Energy Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
This experiment examined the effect energy allocation on Fagopyrum esculentum in both warm and cool environments. Through analysis of this experiment, the energy allocation is less in warmer environments than in cooler environments because of the role that temperature plays in the longevity of a plant. Thirty-six seeds were planted, watered and maintained for a total of two weeks. All seeds did not survive, making only ten available to be tested from the warmer climate, and twelve available from the cooler climate. Results show that there were no significant differences in data between the cooler and warmer environments, however, plants grown in warmer conditions did show a higher amount of allocation. An observation was made, identifying that the warmer climate plants displayed a red coloring near the root of each plant.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to identify the difference in energy allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum in both cool and warm settings. The measurements of the Fagopyrum esculentum plants were taken from the two different environments. The energy allocation of the samples was shown through the root-shoot​ values of each plant because of a phenotypical change. Each subject planted outside showed a physical difference in length, and this was not due to a change in genetic makeup, but instead, the differentiation in setting. High temperatures are unfavorable for the growth of many plant species because the rate of photosynthesis (the basic process plants used to make sugar) begins to decline rapidly after a critical high temperature is reached [IlesJeff: 1995]. If the plants are placed in a cooler environment, then the root to shoot values will be higher than those in a warmer environment. The ideal growing temperature of this plant is usually around 21⁰ C [BjörkmanThomas: 2009].

Materials and Methods:
First, thirty-six seeds and four black planters were collected, and soil was placed into each planter. Then soil was placed into each planter, and nine evenly spaced holes were created by finger. Then, 200 mL of water was poured into each planter, followed by 100 mL of Miracle Grow. Each hole was then covered with soil and planted. Then, two of the four black planters were placed in a larger tray and taken to the greenhouse where the temperature was set to 28⁰ C. The other two black planters were placed in another larger sized tray and placed close to the lab window for sunlight, and this temperature was fixed at 20⁰ C. Each plant was watered every day for two weeks with 100 mL of water to each planter. After two weeks, each root was removed from each plant and weighed. The roots and plants were also measured. The statistical t-test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
The average root shoot ratio for length did not differ significantly between the cooler and warmer environments. However, the plants grown in the classroom did show a lower root shoot ratio 0.472 +/- 0.173 (Fig. 1). For the warmer environment, the root shoot ratio for length was 0.567 +/- 0.239 (t-stat = 1.08, df= 20, p = 0.146). The average root shoot ratio for weight in the cooler environment was 0.128 +/- 0.031. This was similar to the average of root shoot weight of buckwheat in warm temperatures 0.118 +/- 0.044 (t-stat = 0.63, df = 20, p = 0.268) (Fig. 2). The plants grown in warmer temperatures had red coloring near their roots.

Discussion:
Overall the results did not show significant differences between length in cold and warm temperatures (Fig. 1). This can be due to a low difference between the temperatures of both environments. The 8o C in difference can explain the small difference in root shoot weight as well (Fig. 2). Flooding before the first true leaves expand is detrimental to the growth of the plant as well [BjörkmanThomas: 2009]. Due to inclement weather, the plants were over watered the first day, and this could not be avoided. Buckwheat tends to live in conditions from 10o C to 21o C. If another experiment is conducted, the temperature of both locations should be a larger focus, and more time should be allowed to explore the changes in length and weight. Because the data barely differed, the null hypothesis was accepted, which means our hypothesis was rejected. Another difference is the number of plants that survived outside. There were only ten available for the warmer climate, and twelve for the cooler climate.
