Title: Effect of Light and Food on Physarum Polycephalum Migration

Abstract:
How organisms deal with conflicting demands is an important aspect of life; even the simplest organisms are shown to make decisions when it comes to their survival. This experiment examined the effect of light and food on the movement of Physarum polycephalum. Physarum stay multicellular plasmodium in dark, humid conditions; when stresses like light are present, physarum respond by ceasing movement and starting their reproductive cycle. I hypothesize that in dark and light on food conditions the physarum will grow toward the food while in light conditions the physarum will not grow toward the food. Physarum and glucose were placed in water agar, and placed in total light, light only on the glucose, or total darkness. The distance traveled by the physarum was measured. A paired Two Sample t-Test was performed. The hypothesis was inconclusive; in dark conditions two of three physarum dishes grew toward the food, in light conditions, physarum didn’t grow toward the food, and in light on food conditions physarum grew toward the food only to an extent. There are numerous explanations to this result; the physarum could have been in different life cycle stages, had different nutrition levels, or even used their ability to sense and adapt to the light periods within the dark environment.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a flat, yellow, gooey mass up to 30 cm in diameter that lives in damp ground debris; physarum remains a multicellular plasmodium as long as it is in dark, humid conditions [Guttes: 1961]. If food becomes unavailable, or humidity drops, the plasmodium hardens to form a suspended stage called a sclerotium; the sclerotium is known as a physarum’s hibernation stage, [Guttes: 1961]. While the plasmodium can stay viable for years, sclerotium will break open again when food becomes available. When additional stresses like light or heat are present, along with lack of food, physarum respond by starting their reproductive cycle; the plasmodium breaks into small pieces known as sporangia that, together, form spore capsules, [Guttes: 1961]. Inside these spore capsules, the cells undergo meiosis to form spores of haploid gametes that spread to new locations via wind and runoff. In an experiment done by Tanya Latty on the effects of light exposure and food quality on the directional decision of Physarum polycephalum, physarum were shown to migrate toward the lower quality food source compared to a higher quality food source when it was in shaded conditions [Latty: 2010]. In this experiment we will test the effect of the presence of light on physarum phototaxis and whether or not the physarum values food over light. I hypothesize that in dark conditions and in light on food conditions the physarum will grow toward the food, while in light conditions, the physarum will not grow toward the food.

Materials and Method:
First, we made the glucose plate by melting 1% water agar in the microwave. We added 1 Ml of 20x glucose compound into the water agar and mixed. We let it cool to 50℃ and poured the mixture into a 100 mm petri plate to cool and harden. We then obtained 9 water agar plates and labeled them with our name and our class period. We labeled three water agar plates “dark,” three water agar plates “light,” and three water agar plates “light on food.” We then drew two 1cm by 1cm squares on the bottom of each of the nine plates and divided the plates in half. We opened the lid of the water agar plates and, using an ethanol sterilized pair of forceps and spatula, cut the two squares out of the water agar and set the squares aside. We sterilized the spatula and forceps after each cut and removal of agar. We then took the physarum stock plate and, using the sterilized spatula and forceps, cut out nine 1cm by 1cm blocks. After all nine blocks of physarum were cut, we used the sterilized spatula and forceps to remove one block of physarum and placed it into the right square of each of the water agar plates, sterilizing the equipment after each addition. We then gathered the glucose plate and, using the sterilized forceps and spatula, cut nine 1cm by 1cm squares out of the glucose plate. After resterlizing the tools, we then carefully transferred one 1cm by 1cm block into each of the left squares in the water agar plates, sterilizing the equipment after each addition. After all water agar squares were filled with the appropriate agar block, we put the lids back onto the water agar plates and secured them with clear scotch tape. We took the plates labeled “dark” and wrapped them completely in foil. We took the plates labeled “dark on food” and wrapped them completely in foil, but cut out a small 1cm by 1cm hole directly above the glucose food square; we ensured that only light was getting on the glucose and nowhere else on the water agar. We then took all nine water agar plates and placed them face up in an incubator in the light. We came back seventy-two hours later and checked the physarum and took measurements. We ran a two tailed t_test to test significance. 


Results:
There was a significent difference between the “light” controll group and the “light on glucose” experimental group. This can be shown in table one as there is significent difference between the average distance traveled for “light” conditions compared to “light on glucose” conditions. There was also significent difference between the “light” controll group and the “dark” controll group. This can also be shown in table one as there is significent difference between the average distance traveled for “light” conditions compared to “dark” conditions. Figure 1 shows the values of the average distances traveled between the three groups; the significent differences can be seen in this graph between the three groups. The 2, two sample T tests were used to compare the average distance traveled by the “light” controll group to the average distance traveled by the “dark” controll group and the average distance traveled by the “light” controll group to the average distance traveled by the “light on glucose” test group. Comparing the “light” group to the “dark” group, the p value was 0.0141, the d.f. was 4, and the t value was 1.24. Comparing the “light” group to the “light on glucose” group, the p value was 0.0065, the d.f. was 4, and the t value was 4.29. 

Discussion:
My hypothesis was inconclusive based on this experiment; I stated that in dark conditions and in light on food conditions the physarum will grow toward the food, while in light conditions, the physarum will not grow toward the food. This experiment posed many conflicting ideas for us, and while we were able to see some trends, we do not know for sure why the physarum groups did what we witnessed. Initially, we as a group were going to starve the original physarum for four days before starting the experiment described above. We were hoping to see a trend of whether the physarum prioritized food over light or light over food. When we came in to set up our experiment however, we were unable to obtain the physarum, as it was still growing in the incubators, therefore, we could not successfully perform the starvation section of the experiment. Regardless of the inability to perform the starvation, we continued on with the experiment as planned. In the dark conditions, two of the three physarum groups moved toward and made contact with the glucose, while the other physarum group did not grow in the direction of the glucose. The two physarum groups that did grow toward the glucose in the dark conditions were exhibiting expected physarum behavior, as this organism thrives in damp, dark conditions. The third physarum dish moved in the complete opposite direction as expected, and while we cannot be completely sure why, we do have some ideas. During different stages of their life cycles, physarum have different preferences of everyday life choices such as light over dark environments, or even one type of food over another. For example, when a physarum is ready to form spores, the slime will switch from avoiding light and wanting food, to avoiding food and seeking light, [Kanejagler: 2018]. This third dish of physarum could have been in a different life cycle stage than the other two dark conditioned physarum dishes, and therefore was not attracted to the glucose as the other physarum were. While this is just one possibility, another explanation could have been that the physarum that did not migrate toward the glucose had more nutrients stored compared to the other dark conditioned physarum dishes, and therefore, it wasn’t attracted to the glucose as strongly as the other two nutrient deficient physarum dishes were. While this explanation is unlikely due to the small sample of physarum we started with, the singular physarum dish could have been looking for a higher quality food source over the glucose by moving away from the initial source. While these are just two possible explanations, there are multiple other possibilities for the discrepancy between the three physarum groups in the dark conditions and we cannot know for sure which is displayed in this experiment. For the physarum in the light on glucose conditions, we do have a better idea on why they traveled how and where they did. Each of the physarum traveled toward the glucose, but did not make contact with the block, due to light being present. In an experiment done by Bernd Meyer on the effects of illuminating light on slime mold migration, slime molds reached food sources more efficiently in an intermittently illuminated route, [Meyer: 2017]. In the wild, slime molds prefer dark, moist places and move away from sunlight when it is present. In his experiment, Meyer replicated real world conditions for the molds by exposing them to the sort of intermittent light burst they would normally encounter during the day; sunrise to sunset, cloudy vs sunny days, and even occasional shade from a shadow. In his experiment, the slime molds were given two pathways to food sources, one dark environment (controll) and one with intermittently illuminated lights (real world replication), [Meyer: 2017]. In real world conditions, physarum are able to use their collective operating system to sense certain disruptions such as light or lack of food. When in a dark environment, physarum will move toward a food source they can sense, however, the minute the environment changes from dark to light, the physarum will stay put and either wait for the environment to change again, or, if the environment stays light for a significent amount of time, will start their reproductive cycle. Once the environment changes back to dark from light, the physarum senses the change and is more efficient in getting to is destination (whether that be to a darker, more moist area, or to another food source) because it doesn’t want to get caught in the light again, [Meyer: 2017]. In our experiment, the physarum in “light on glucose” conditions migrated toward the food while also sensing the light and was able to move as close as possible to the glucose, without actually coming into contact with the light. The physarum in the “light on glucose” wells were preparing for the light to move away from the food so it could migrate to its final destination. The physarum in the “light” conditions were able to sense the light present as well, and were also waiting for the light to migrate away; because of the prolonged exposure to light during the seventy two hour period, the physarum in the “light” conditions valued staying in place and conserving energy over putting stress on its body by migrating toward a food source while in light, stressful conditions. If we were to run this experiment again, I would change a few more variables to more accurately distinguish between these possible explanations. For example, I would starve the physarum for three days total before the experiment, and later place it into agar with two blocks of glucose in the dish; one glucose block with light on it and one glucose block in complete darkness in each dish, to see if physarum truly does have a preference over food or light. In any environment, learning more about how organisms deal with conflicting demands is an important aspect of life; even the simplest neurological organisms are shown to make different decisions when it comes to their survival. We as humans can not only learn more about other, more simple organisms through this inherited survival technique, but can also learn more and better understand why we humans make some choices over others [Latty: 2010].
