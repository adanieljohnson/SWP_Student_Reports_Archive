Title: Increased Muscle Contractions in the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Frog Leg After Calcium Injection

Abstract:
The depolarization of a muscle fiber ultimately leads to the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm of the cell. Calcium binds with tropomyosin, and initiates the actin and myosin interactions that allow for muscle contractions. In this lab, a myogram is used to measure the muscle contractions in the leg of three separate frog. The data for the frog legs is recorded once, and then a 50 mmolar concentration of calcium is injected into the frog legs. The tests are then run again. Our hypothesis was that by injecting calcium into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog legs, the contractions would increase and occur at a more rapid rate. Results supported this hypothesis as the reaction times between contractions decreased after the frogs were injected with calcium, helping to elucidate the significant role that calcium plays in the process of muscle contractions.

Introduction:
Neuromuscular junctions serve as the chemical synapses that separate neurons and skeletal muscle cells, otherwise known as myofibers. When depolarized, the axons of the presynaptic cell release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. Once ACh bind to the motor end plate, sodium channels open. Consequently the muscle fiber is depolarized, and an action potential is formed. The action potential ultimately causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm. Calcium is exigent in the process of muscle contractions of vertebrates, as it binds to troponin, exposing the actin and myosin binding site. The myosin head then binds to an actin filament, thus allowing the filaments to contract. A single muscle contraction is known as a twitch. However, summation occurs when, “a force generated by multiple motor units is added together (summed) to produce muscle tension” [Bio114 Lab:2018]. In this lab, calcium is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog. My hypothesis is that an increase in calcium will lead to quicker and longer muscle contractions in the frog leg. 

Materials and Methods:
To perform this experiment, the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of three separate frog legs were isolated. A device known as a myogram was used to record the muscle twitches. Two probes are inserted into the muscle, delivering it a voltage that ultimately stimulates the contractions. Each frog leg is tested once before being injected with Ca++. The threshold of the leg is found, and using this number, the stimulus amplitude is chosen. The stimulus amplitude is the voltage, measured in mV, applied directly to the muscle in order to record the reaction time of the twitches. After obtaining these results, the frog legs will then be injected with a 50 mmolar concentration of calcium. The legs will once again be tested using the myogram. A solution of frog ringer is used to ensure that the legs remain moist throughout the experiment. It is important to clean the pad using ethanol in between each test to prevent the legs from receiving excess calcium that might have fallen onto the pad. Results will be recorded and compared using a pair T- test. 


Results:
The results indicate that after the calcium injections, the reaction time of the frog legs decreases significantly. As seen in figure one, For all three legs before the injection, the stimulus amplitude applied is that of 0.3 mV.  Frog leg #1 has an average reaction time of 15 ms, frog leg #2 has an average reaction time of 26.67 ms, and Frog leg #3 has an average reaction time of 20 ms. In figure two, once the 50 mmolar concentration of calcium is injected into the frog legs, frog legs #1 and #3 have a stimulus amplitude of 0.3 while frog leg #2 has stimulus amplitude of 0.5. Frog legs #1 and #3 have a reaction time of 11.67 ms, and frog leg #2 has a reaction time of 13.33. In all cases, the reaction times decrease after the calcium injection. The results are consistent. Figure three shows that the P value is 0.10 making the results statistically significant as it is greater than 0.05.  


Discussion:
The results support the hypothesis that injecting calcium into the frog legs will cause an increase in contractions. Some variation is noticeable between the frog legs. This can be explained due to the volume of liquid in the muscle after the injection, which would increase tension. When conducting experiments, there is also room for human error. After the calcium was injected into the frog legs, the reaction time measured on the myogram between the twitches decreased significantly, indicating that contraction were happening at a quicker rate. The p value for the results is twice as greater than the threshold , .05, indicating that the results were significant. Calcium is imperative in the process of muscle contractions as it, “triggers contraction by reaction with regulatory proteins that in the absence of calcium prevent interaction of actin and myosin” [Szent-Györgyi: 1975]. An influx of calcium would activate more actin and myosin binding sites, allowing for the filaments to contract more often. During the relaxation phase, “calcium is actively transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum using ATP” [Learning: 2018]. However, with injected calcium in the sarcoplasm, the relaxation phase is shorter. This in turn would cause quicker twitches, resulting in a decrease in reaction times, as seen in the results. The results are significant, and help grasp a larger understanding towards the role that calcium plays in the process of muscle contraction, twitch, and tension. To further test this hypothesis, one could inject the muscle with a solution that would inhibit calcium, and measure the effects this has on muscle contractions.
