Title: Shorter Latent Period in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens After Calcium Injection

Abstract:
Calcium is essential to the human body, as it initiates filament interactions that allow for muscle contractions. Our hypothesis was that by injecting calcium into the gastrocnemus muscle of the legs of Rania pipiens, the legs would react faster after a stimulus, resulting in a decreased latent period. In this lab, a force conductor is used to measure the muscle contractions in the leg of three separate frog. The data for the frog legs is recorded once, and then a 50 mmolar concentration of calcium is injected into the frog legs. The tests are then run again. Results supported this hypothesis as the reaction times between contractions decreased after the frogs were injected with calcium, helping to elucidate the significent role that calcium plays in the process of muscle contractions.


Introduction:
Muscle contractions in vertebrates are required to sustain life. Neuromuscular junctions serve as the chemical synapses that separate neurons and skeletal muscle cells, otherwise known as myofibers. When depolarized, the axons of the presynaptic cell release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. Once ACh bind to the motor end plate, sodium channels open. Consequently the muscle fiber is depolarized, and an action potential is formed. The action potential ultimately causes the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm. Calcium is exigent in the process of muscle contractions of vertebrates, as it binds to troponin, exposing the actin and myosin binding site. The myosin head then binds to an actin filament, thus allowing the filaments to contract [Johann Rüegg: 1992]. A single muscle contraction is known as a twitch. However, summation occurs when multiple twitches occur at the same time, and are added together, creating muscle tension [Dean Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, calcium is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens. Rania Pipiens is selected as the model organism, as due to their necessity for jumping, their gastrocnemus muscle does not tire easily, and the sciatic nerve can be isolated easily. My hypothesis is that an increase in calcium will lead to quicker and stronger muscle contractions in the frog leg. 

Materials and Method:
To perform this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of three separate frog legs of Rania pipiens were isolated. A device known as a force conductor was used to record the muscle twitches. Two probes were inserted into the muscle, delivering it a voltage that ultimately stimulated the contractions. The threshold of the leg was found, and using this number, the stimulus amplitude was chosen. The stimulus amplitude is the voltage, measured in mV, applied directly to the muscle in order to record the latent period of the twitches.  Each frog leg was tested once before being injected with Ca++. After obtaining these results, the frog legs were injected with a 50 mmolar concentration of calcium. The legs were once again tested using the force conductor. A solution of frog ringer was used to ensure that the legs remained moist throughout the experiment. It was important to clean the pad using ethanol in between each test to prevent the legs from receiving excess calcium that might have fallen onto the pad. Results were recorded and compared using a two-tailed pair T- test. 

Results:
The results indicate that after the calcium injections, the reaction time of the frog legs decreases significently. As seen in figure one, for all three legs before the injection, the threshold is that of 0.3 mV.  Frog leg #1 has an average reaction time of 15 ms, frog leg #2 has an average reaction time of 26.67 ms, and Frog leg #3 has an average reaction time of 20 ms. In figure two, once the 50 mmolar concentration of calcium is injected into the frog legs, frog legs #1 and #3 have a threshold of 0.3 while frog leg #2 has threshold of 0.5. Frog legs #1 and #3 have a reaction time of 11.67 ms, and frog leg #2 has a reaction time of 13.33. In all cases, the reaction times decrease after the calcium injection. The results are consistent. The results were statistically insignificent (P value = 0.1, d.f. value = 2, t value = 2.9).

Discussion:
The results support the hypothesis that injecting calcium into the legs of Rania pipiens will cause an increase in contractions. Some variation is noticeable between the frog legs. This can be explained due to the volume of liquid in the muscle after the injection, which would increase tension. When conducting experiments, there is also room for human error. After the calcium was injected into the frog legs, the reaction time measured on the force conductor between the twitches decreased significently, indicating that contraction were happening at a quicker rate. The p value for the results is twice as greater than the threshold, .05, indicating that the results were insignificent. This could be explained by multiple factors. Since only three frog legs were tested, the statistical test did not incorporate numerous trials. Also, the three frog legs, though each supported the hypothesis, behaved differently. While the first leg had a reaction time change of 3.33 ms, the second had a change of 13.34 ms and the third a change of 8.33 ms. These factors combined could explain the results of our statistical analysis. Although the paired T-test did not support our results, we visually observed that our results support the hypothesis. Calcium is imperative in the process of muscle contractions as it interacts with regulatory proteins to trigger contractions by enabling actin and myosin interactions [Szent-Györgyi: 1975]. An influx of calcium would activate more actin and myosin binding sites, allowing for the filaments to contract more often. ATP is responsible for re-uptaking calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during the relaxation phase [Muscle Twitch and Control: 2018]. However, with injected calcium in the sarcoplasm, the relaxation phase is shorter. This in turn would cause quicker twitches, resulting in a decrease in reaction times, as seen in the results. The results are significent, and help grasp a larger understanding towards the role that calcium plays in the process of muscle contraction, twitch, and tension. To further test this hypothesis, one could inject the muscle with a solution that would inhibit calcium, and measure the effects this has on muscle contractions.
