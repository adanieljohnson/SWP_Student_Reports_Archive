Title: The effects of Ecdysterone in Manduca Sexta in preventing pupating

Abstract:
Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that feeds on plants in the Solanaceae family which include tobacco, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. They are a common pest in their larval stage causing significant defoliation of economically important crops, until they pupate and become adult moths. Manduca Sexta go through a commitment pulse during their larval stage and is controlled by two hormones. Juvenile hormone and Ecdysterone are the two hormones that regulate the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse causes the 20E, also known as Ecdysterone, levels to rise and the JH levels to fall. The 20E steroid regulates timing of molting during insect development along with additional functions in adults. The objective of this study is to identify if adding a 20E blocker to Manduca Sexta food will result in the Manduca Sexta to not pupate. We had two groups of 4 caterpillars each and added 6 drops of ecdysterone, or 20E, to every 10 grams of food that we served to the treatment group of the caterpillars. We replaced the food every other day for a 13-day period. In our results, we discovered that the 20E blocker slowed the growth of the growth and prevented them from pupating and not eat as much which in result, causes them to be more of a pest.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is an insect that feeds on plants in the Solanaceae family which include tobacco, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and potatoes. Manduca Sexta go through a commitment pulse during their larval stage which causes JH levels to fall and the 20E, also known as Ecdysterone, levels to rise each time it molts. Juvenile Hormone, also known as JH, is a hormone that prevents pupation. Ecdysterone is a steroid that regulates timing of molting during insect development along with additional functions in adults. Manduca Sexta are pests and an agricultural problem when they are juvenile. They are a common pest in their larval stage causing significant defoliation of economically important crops, until they pupate and become adult moths and are hard to prevent. There was an experiment that was posted by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. This experiment was for insect pest control in use of insect growth regulators, or IGR. They found that the paper towels used in the rearing jars resulting in low egg hatch rates for the Pyrrhocoris apterus L. They contained juvabione, an IGR compound produced by balsam fir trees, which were the primary pulp tree used in the United States paper industry at the time (Tunaz,2004). They concluded that the IGR found in the paper towels did cause the insects to have lower egg hatch rates than their controlled group. The IGR found in the paper towels blocked Ecysterone which effected the egg hatch rate of the Pyrrhocoris apterus L. In our test, we gave the Manduca Sexta a 20E blocker with 6 drops of 20E per 10 grams of food.  Ecdysterone, or 20E, is a steroid hormone that regulates timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects. The hypothesis is that when we give the treatment group of caterpillars more ecdysterone, the caterpillar will never develop past the larva stage and will have a larger body mass than the controlled group.

Materials and Methods:
We will use 2 groups of 4 caterpillars each. One is a control group with no 20E blocker and there is a treatment group with the 20E blocker containing 6 drops of 20E per 10 grams of food. We used a baseline of 10 grams of food per caterpillar, which we changed every other day for a 13-day period. We weighed the caterpillars every day to see if the 20E blocker would affect the growth of the Manduca Sexta. We ran a two-sample t-test to compare the results of the control and the treatment group to see if there was a noticeable difference.

Results:
In our results, we noticed that the treatment group did not grow as much as the controlled did. The controlled group began to pupate, but the treatment group did not and was much smaller. The treatment group gained weight the first 2-3 days then gradually lost weight and then they started to lose a significant amount of weight towards the end of the experiment. The two-sample t-test shows that we fail to reject the null hypothesis because the p-value is greater than .01. (t-value: 3.35569, dof: 6, p-value: 0.015311)

Discussion:
The 20E blocker prevented the treatment group from pupating and caused them to lose weight. They were smaller than the controlled group because the 20E blocker effected the timing of molting during their development. The 20E levels never rose so the JH levels never reduced causing the caterpillars to never pupate. Tunaz stated that these "insect growth regulators" affect Physiological regulatory processes essential to normal development of insects or their offspring. He later stated that these IGR's lead to abnormalities that reduce insect survival.  In the hypothesis, we stated that the body mass would be bigger than the controlled group and that they would never develop past the larva stage. The treated group of caterpillars never did pupate, but they didn't end up bigger than the controlled group. The two-sample t-test shows that the 20E effected the growth of the caterpillars. The statistical test showed that it caused a delay in the developmental process. The treated group started out growing and getting bigger the first 2-3 days, then they started to lose their weight and even dropping below their starting weight.
