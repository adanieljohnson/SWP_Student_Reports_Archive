Title: The Effects of IGR Based Ecdysterone Inhibition on Growth and Development in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Manduca sexta is a holometabolous insect that experiences several larval instars throughout its developmental process, which are largely governed by the balance of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). Ecdysterone, the focus of this paper, controlls molt behaviors/ability and is especially important in a developmental period known as the “commitment pulse”. The objective of this experiment is to determine the effect of 20E inhibition in the Manduca sexta caterpillar. We hypothesized that with the inhibition of 20E, the caterpillars would be unable to properly grow and develop, and never enter their pupal stage. To study this, we exposed the caterpillars to constant environmental conditions, with our independent variable being the addition of AzaGuard (a 20E inhibitor IGR) to the food of the experimental group. Our results found that over the course of 15 days, the experimental group of caterpillars exposed to 20E inhibitors were unable to pupate and develop at the rate of the uncontaminated controll group. Our experiment further supported the strong existing evidence that inhibition of the 20E hormone interrupts normal development in larval Manduca sexta caterpillars.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar (tobacco hornworm) is a garden pest threatening much of the continental US, feeding on common plants such as tomato, eggplant, peppers, and as its common name suggests, tobacco plants [Byron: 2018]. 
The tobacco hornworm is a holometabolous insect, experiencing five characteristic larval growth stages called instars, which lead to eclosion and then to a reproductively fit adult [Johnson: 2018]. During Manduca sexta’s development, two major hormones play a key role in their growth and development: juvenile hormone (JH), and ecdysterone (20E) [Johnson: 2018]. JH (produced in the corpus allata) mainly regulates type of molt during development, while 20E (produced in the prothoracic glands) regulates the timing of molt in larvae  [Johnson: 2018]. Throughout development, these hormones alternate in bodily dominance and determine vital milestones in developmental processes. When the caterpillar reaches the 5th larval instar in its development, for the first time, the bodily levels of 20E slightly rise above JH levels, causing what is known as the “commitment pulse” [ Johnson: 2018]. After the commitment pulse occurs, the caterpillar enters a stage known as wandering, where they stop searching for food and eating, and begin to become more sedentary, preparing them for pupation [Levine: 1990]. Once they begin eclosion, they form an outer cuticle known as a pupa, and begin their transformation into an adult moth.
Since Manduca sexta is such a harmful force in North American agriculture, insect growth regulators (“IGR”) are commonly used as a form of pesticide. IGRs function by mimicking or inhibiting hormones in larval insects, preventing them from developing into adults and yielding new generations of equally harmful offspring [NPIC: 2015]. 
The IGR we focused on during this experiment was azadirachtin, or “AzaGuard”, a chemical that is believed the halt the production of 20E during Manduca sexta development. AzaGuard is a commercially used IGR that has been found successful in killing Manduca sexta larvae because it inhibits the secretion of 20E in Manduca [BioSafe Systems LLC, 2011]. Since the rise of 20E levels over JH during the commitment pulse is imperative in allowing the body to begin pupal development and grow into an adult [Bollenbacher: 1981], we hypothesized that using AzaGuard would render the affected caterpillars unable to grow, develop, and eventually pupate to the extent of non-affected caterpillars. By interrupting the necessary ratio of JH to 20E, pupation should never occur due to the inability to time a molt and therefore grow.


Materials and Method:
First we gathered two containers each with four quadrants, and lids for the whole container. When closed, these containers would provide individual environments for each caterpillar (controll or experimental). We then poked holes in each quadrant to allow for air exchange so the caterpillars could breathe. Then we collected 80 grams of general caterpillar feed and weighed out 10 grams for each quadrant across both containers. To introduce our main independent variable of the experiment, we pipetted 7 drops of 1: 1250 AzaGuard solution into the four quadrants of the experimental group container. To create equal levels of moisture in both experimental and controll group containers, we then pipetted 7 drops of distilled water into each quadrant of the controll group container. After this we used metal spoons to mix and then condense the moistened food into a corner of each quadrant so there would be living space for Manduca sexta. 
Once the food was prepared, we randoMly selected 8 Manduca sexta of varying weights, all within their 4th or 5th larval instar, but before their commitment pulse. We then determined initial masses of our caterpillars in a weigh boat on a zeroed balance (in grams). We decided to record their masses instead of any other measurement (like length) because that was a precise and accurate means to determine any differences in growth and development. After this we placed them in a 25ºC incubator, in which they would spend the rest of the experiment (other than when we measure and observe their progress). We continued to monitor our caterpillars over the next 14 days, making sure to refresh their food supply, complete with their added liquids, and remove any excrement.  
After our data collection period, we disposed of the remaining caterpillars (alive, dead, or pupae) according to IACUC guidelines. After organizing our group’s data, we calculated each caterpillar’s maximum change in weight. We then entered those numbers into a single tailed two sample T test, and also took the standard deviation of our values to determine statistical significance between the controll and experimental groups. 
To make this easier to conceptualize and possibly reproduce, please reference Figure 1 which maps out our experiment’s general layout.  


Results:
In days 1-2 of this experiment, both caterpillar groups developed with a similar upward trend. However, by days 4-5, the experimental caterpillars began to steadily decrease in body mass. The controll caterpillars experienced a spike in body mass and then a gradual decrease (Figure 3).
 	The maximum change in body mass was much greater in the controll group than the experimental group. (5.14g +/- 0.083 for the controll and 2.86g +/- 1.134 for the experimental) (Figure 4). These values are statistically significent as the error bars in Figure 5 do not overlap, and the single tail two sample T test value is p=0.0086. 
	The controll caterpillars also pupated at a higher rate than the experimental group. Figure 2 expresses that ¾ controll caterpillars pupated while none of the experimental caterpillars did. In fact, ¾ experimental caterpillars died. 
Qualitatively, each experimental caterpillar appeared discoloured, stiff, and even juvenile. Most controll caterpillars formed a normal pupae but one looked discoloured and similar to those of the experimental group (Figure 6).


Discussion:
The results of this experiment support our initial hypothesis that the inhibition of 20E in Manduca sexta will result in less successful growth and the inability to pupate. 
Regarding the first part of our hypothesis which predicted lesser growth and development in the caterpillars, please reference Figures 3 and 4. The maximum change in weight of the caterpillars refers to the difference in body mass they experienced from the point at which they were the smallest, to the point at which they were the largest. The average maximum change in body mass for the controll group was much higher than that of the experimental group.  In Figure 3, the main difference between the growth patterns of the two testing groups is the controll group’s spike in body mass occuring at around days 4-5 of the experiment. With all controlllable environmental factors being constant between the two testing groups, it is clear that the variable most likely responsible for these differences is the AzaGuard solution mixed in with the food of the experimental group.  Ecdysterone has been found to increase in Manduca sexta immediately before molt, suggesting that it is responsible for the timing of molt [Bollenbacher: 1981]. With the inhibition of 20E caused by the IGR, the experimental caterpillars are thusly unable to molt, and therefore grow and develop body masses like that of the controll group. The spike in the body mass of the controll is most likely due to their increased consumption of food, and subsequent loss of water stored in the body, all to prepare for pupation [Bollenbacher: 1981]. With reference to the single tail two sample T test mentioned earlier in this report, the p value much smaller than 0. This suggests that the difference in body mass between groups is highly unlikely to occur under a null hypothesis. Figure 5 further supports the claim that AzaGuard has a measurable and significent effect on the growth of Manduca sexta.  With all other factors being constant between groups besides the introduction of AzaGuard into the food, it is most likely the inhibition of the 20E that is responsible for this disparity in body mass. 
The second part of our hypothesis stating that the 20E inhibitor most likely had an
impact on the pupation of the caterpillars is also supported. Figure 2 indicates pupation success in the controll group while showing pupation failure in the experimental group. Since 20E is responsible for molt timing, and therefore the molt into a hard cuticle pupae, ecdysterone is imperative for pupation [Bollenbacher: 1981]. Then of course, without 20E, since it was inhibited by the Azaguard, pupation would be especially difficult to occur for the experimental group. In reference to purely qualitative evidence, please look at Figure 6. As discussed in the results section, all experimental caterpillars appeared sickly and juvenile, while most controll caterpillars entered their pupae stage, exhibiting normal growth and development. This further supports that the inhibition of 20E has holistic impacts on the health and development of Manduca larvae.  
	Even though the statistical evidence and qualitative evidence to support the hypothesis is grounded, there were still some errors in our experimental processes. The relatively small sample size of both experimental and controll groups left us with the minimum N value (4) for a statistically accurate T test. Also, the occurrence of caterpillar death for reasons unrelated to the experiment is prevalent, so the addition of more caterpillars into each group would diffuse the significance of this unpredictable event.  In future experiments, possibly increasing the caterpillar sample sizes in each group to at least 6 would create even more statistically firm results. During our data collection period, Hurricane Florence prevented us from entering the lab and collecting daily results for days 10-12, so repeating this experiment with purely daily data recordings could be beneficial.    
	With the results of this experiment still strongly supporting the theory that inhibition of 20E in Manduca sexta renders the organism unable to develop properly and pupate, there are many possible applications of this knowledge. IGRs are used as pesticides to target specific species that damage crops [Siddall: 1976]. As mentioned earlier, the invasiveness of Manduca sexta is a problem that could more surely be alleviated. With this experiment supporting the already strong foundation of knowledge regarding IGRs and their effect on insects, there is now more confidence that these chemicals work in disabling growth mechanisms in harmful insects like this. Even though this experiment is simply another reinforcement of the effects of 20E inhibition in Manduca sexta, this contributes to a broad scientific understanding of the impacts of IGRs on this pest’s life cycle.
