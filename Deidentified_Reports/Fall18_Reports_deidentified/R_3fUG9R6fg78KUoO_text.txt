Title: JH analog caused Manduca sexta caterpillars to grow less than the control group

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied how juvenile hormone (JH) affected the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesized that the caterpillars would grow in weight and length less than the control group on average. After feeding one group food with methoprene, a JH analog, we found that the JH seemed to inhibit the growth of the larvae, as they weighed less and were shorter than the control group. We suspect that while JH seems to keep the caterpillars in larval form, high levels of the hormone cause the caterpillars to have stunted development.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a species of insect that has a holometabolous life cycle. Many hormones play a part in regulating this life cycle, and one of them is juvenile hormone (JH). It is known that juvenile hormone can be used as an insect growth regulator (IGR) in place of traditional pesticides because it interferes with the normal life cycle of the caterpillar and prevents them from becoming adults [1]. In our experiment, we are seeking to observe the effects a JH analog will have on the maturation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. We will give one experimental group 10 droplets of Martin's brand methoprene and observe how the weight and length of the experimental group compares with the weight and length of the control group. The results of our experiment will give information on the effectiveness of this specific analog and concentration as an IGR. We expect our experimental group to be, on average, smaller and lighter than the control group because the JH should impair the experimental group's growth and development.

Materials and Methods:
We used two containers to separate the control and experimental groups. Each container had 4 caterpillars, and each caterpillar had its own walled-off compartment in the container. Every day, a group member cleaned the containers and gave each caterpillar 10g of food. The control group was given 10 drops of water with their food, and the experimental group was given 10 drops of methoprene. Every day for 9 days (when the first caterpillar began to pupate), the caterpillars were weighed and measured, and the data was recorded in a table. The caterpillars were kept at a constant temperature and light for the entire experiment. At the end of the experiment, we compared the average length and weight of the two groups using a 2-sample T-test.

Results:
Besides length and weight, there were some physical differences that we observed in the caterpillars. Over the course of the experiment, all control group individuals were firm, bright green, and quite active when touched. By contrast, the experimental group individuals were generally lighter in coloration and less active. One individual, #3, began to exhibit sluggish behavior by Day 3. At Day 6, the individual turned brown, lost weight, and never pupated. The caterpillars in the control group had an average growth of 2.325 cm with a standard deviation of +/- 0.699 g, while the experimental group only had an average growth of 1.1 cm with a standard deviation of +/- 2.005 g. The control group also gained more weight on average than the experimental group, gaining on average 7.2225 g with a standard deviation of +/- 2.569 g. The experimental group only gained on average 5.045 g with a standard deviation of +/- 3.963 g. Using a two-sample t-test, we found that the change in length between the experimental and control group was not statistically significant (t-value = .9221, p-value = .8012, df = 6). Using the same test, we also found that the change in weight between the experimental and control group was not statistically significant (t-value = 1.154, p-value = .8413, df = 6).

Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not confirm our hypothesis; instead, the opposite of what we predicted occurred. It has been proven that juvenile hormone supplements have caused various insects, not just Manduca sexta, to remain in larval form for their entire lives [Slama and Williams, 1965]. It is known that juvenile hormone is an IGR, which eventually kills the larva that is treated with it [Staal, 1975]. Because it is an IGR, we can infer that too much JH was toxic to the caterpillars and could have altered other functions in the body that caused the them to grow less. It is possible that by adding less JH, we could have achieved results that would have supported our hypothesis. It is also possible that if we ran the experiment again, we would get results that supported our hypothesis, given what we know about JH. The caterpillars that we treated with JH did not pupate, which is consistent with the knowledge gathered about JH. However, the fact that they did not grow as much as the control group suggests that there may be more to learn about how JH negatively affects the growth and development of insects.
