Title: The Effect of herbivores on Radish R:S Ratio

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine whether herbivores decrease the length and weight Root to Shoot (R:S) ratios of radishes. It was hypothesized that plants treated with herbivores will have significently lower length and weight R:S ratios than plants not affected by herbivores. The experiment was performed by growing radishes from seeds and clipping their leaves periodically over a span of two weeks to simulate herbivore consumption. The results indicate that herbivores do not decrease the R:S ratio of radishes (weight R:S p=0.059; length p=0.26). It was concluded that radish development is not significently affected by leaf-consuming herbivores. However, a longer study that provided the plants with more time to grow might have yielded different results.

Introduction:
Plants are known to allocate their resources in different ways depending on their environment [Johnson: 2018]. This is a property known as phenotypic plasticity and it defines how plants can change the way they allocate resources for new growth based on environmental conditions [Johnson: 2018]. Biotic factors are part of what conditions the environement and they are defined as environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms [Johnson: 2018]. Herbivores are one type of biotic factor and they relevant in affecting how plants allocate their resources because they consume important organs of the plant for food [Pradeep: 2006]. In this experiment, we will be analyzing the allocative response of Rahanus sativus or the oilseed radish to leaf tissue loss. More specifically, the removal of tissue will represent an herbivore consuming part of the leaf. Herbivores limit the amount of energy a plant can synthesize because they commonly consume the leaves and the leaves are necessary for photosynthesis [Viswanathan: 2007]. Plants need photosynthesis to synthesize energy from sunlight and they use it to grow and develop [Johnson: 2016]. Consequently, plants with less leaf tissue should have less energy available for growth. It was hypothesized that plants treated with herbivores will have significently lower length and weight R:S ratios than plants not affected by herbivores. 

Materials and Method:
Radishes were grown from seeds. First, the seeds were soaked in water for thirty minutes to promote growth. Finger sized indentations were made in all the pots and the seeds were placed in these indentations. Approximately five seeds were placed in each ten different pots of vermiculite. Equal amounts of a miracle grow solution were added to each pot. There were five pots that contained plants treated with herbivores and five pots that were grown normally for a controll group. Plants were watered everyday and as soon as the plants had three or more leaves, nail clippers were used to remove leaf mass and simulate an herbivore consuming them. One clipping of just less than half the total leaf size was taken from each replicate of the treatment group. Five plants from each replicate pot were measured for a total of twenty plants from the controll and twenty plants that were clipped. After two weeks, the plants were harvested and measured for their length and weight R:S ratios. A one-tailed two sample t_test was performed to see whether the plants of the treatment group had lower R:S ratios than the controll.

Results:
As depicted by figure 1, the herbivore group had a greater mean weight R:S ratio than the controll group (controll: 0.188±0.07g; herbivore: 0.220±0.05g). As shown in figure 2, the controll group had a greater mean length R:S ratio than the herbivore group (controll: 1.20±0.27cm; herbivore: 1.42±0.25cm). The t_test performed between the weight R:S ratios indicated that there is no significent difference between the R:S weights of the controll and the treatment group (t_stat=-1.59, d.f.=38, p=0.059). A t_test performed between the length R:S ratios also displayed no significent difference between the herbivore and controll groups (t_stat=0.638, d.f.=38, p=0.26). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that radishes treated with herbivores will have lower R:S ratios is rejected because the statistical tests indicate that herbivores do not decrease the R:S ratios of plants. No significent difference was found between the length and weight R:S ratios of radishes treated with herbivores and radishes given no treatment. These results are surprising because leaves are necessary for photosynthesis and photosynthesis is necessary for synthesizing the energy that allows growth [Viswanathan: 2007]. It was expected that the partial loss of a photosynthetic organ would decrease growth since the plant would have less energy to allot, but this was not the case. Though surprising, these results are not unique. A previous study showed that plants will undergo compensatory growth when damaged by herbivores and that overall plant yield is rarely proportional to the damage the plants receive from the herbivores [McNaughton: 1983]. It is possible that the plants in this study and the radishes in the present study did not lose enough energy to have an affect on the R:S ratios. Yet, a more recent study indicates that native herbivores do decrease overall plant growth, seed set and survival capability [Maron: 2003]. Even though the present study indicates that leaf-eating herbivores have no effect on the R:S ratios of radishes, some error may have contributed to the results. A potential source of error could be that an insufficient amount of time was allotted for growth. Perhaps no significent difference in the plants could have been observed until they were more mature or unless they had been eaten by herbivores for a longer period. Some error might also be attributable to harvesting. It is possible that some root mass was lost during the process. This only had a minor effect on the results because it was present in all replicates. This experiment could be improved if more time was allotted for plant growth. Allowing the radishes to grow for one month rather than two weeks might have provided enough time for plant growth to be significently affected by herbivores.
