Title: The Effect of Acid Rain on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Pea Plants

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment performed was to investigate how the supplementation of a lower pH, and thus more acidic water effected the growth and development of pea plants. Acid water dissolves the nutrients and necessary minerals normally found in soil and also releases toxic waste in the process. It was hypothesized that the plants watered with acid rain would result in a significently higher root to shoot ratio being that the roots would have to be much longer in order to obtain enough nutrients from the soil in order to sustain life and growth. Pea plant seeds were prepared and planted in identical procedures as to eliminate any outside stimulants or contributors. The plants were grown under one of two assigned treatment plans, acid rain or tap water, and the roots and shoots of each plant were measured and weighed after two weeks of growth. A two-sample t_test was performed to determine statistical difference between the root to shoot ratios. The hypothesis was supported by statistical analysis as a result of the biological manipulation of the acidity of water administered to each plant its impact on the root to shoot ratio. This study was conducted to test and explain how certain water samples influence the allocation of resources, and thus, the growth and development of

Introduction:
The subject manipulated in this study was the Pisum Satiums, commonly known as field pea plants. Ecosystems are composed of both biotic and abiotic factors, which interact with each other in various ways. Biotic factors are living organisms [Johnson: 2018]. Conversely, abiotic factors can be defined as non-living components of an ecosystem, like sunlight, nutrients, and shade. Based on the biotic and abiotic factors present in an environment, organisms must utilize allocation strategies in order to ensure the proper use of energy and nutrients [Crecco and Savoy: 1985]. Resource allocation strategies are centered around crucial resources required for growth, function, reproduction, and overall development. Essential resources are sometimes limited based on environments, which ultimately impact subsequent species that reside in said ecological community. To cope with issues imposed by limitations on resources, tradeoffs and resource allocation strategies are used in conjunction to obtain nutrients and resources in the most effective manner [Soule and Werner: 1981]. A fundamental and vital activity of plants is the uptake, processing, and allocation or resources, such as carbon dioxide water, and nutrients, from the environment. Shifts in allocation patterns under varying environmental conditions are proven to maximize plant growth [Bazzazz and Grace: 1997]. One way in which plants allocate their resources is through root to shoot ratios, defined as dry weight, or length, of root biomass divided by weight, or length, of dry shoot biomass [Rogers, Prior, Runion, and Mitchell: 1995]. Plants growing in low nutrient soil will have a higher root to shoot ratio than plants grown in healthy soil because they will need a more extensive root system to obtain enough water and nutrients from its surroundings. Moreover, their stems will not be as long due to the fact that they will have to allocate energy and resources to the development of the root systems as opposed to the stems. One way in which soil is depleted of its nutrients is through the addition of acid water, which lowers the pH of the soil, therefore making it more acidic and dissolving the nutrients and necessary minerals normally found in soil [Krug and Frink: 1983]. Thus, it was hypothesized that field pea plants grown in acidic conditions will have higher root to shoot ratios than plants given normal tap water because they will need extensive root systems to obtain the nutrients remaining in the acid rain for proper growth and development.

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, field pea seeds were soaked in water for 30 minutes. Then, eighty seeds were randoMly selected for the experiment. Eight black planter boxes were obtained and filled with Vermicite, 50Ml of Miracle-Gro, and a pretreatment of either tap water or acid rain, which had a pH of 3.5. Next, 10 seeds were placed into 5 1-inch impressions made in each of the planters and were covered with soil. The containers were then set in a greenhouse. Every day for two weeks, the plants were watered with their assigned treatment. At the end of the experiment, each plant was carefully removed from its respective container. The soil was washed away exposing the root systems, and the plants were separated. Each plant was then measured, in centimeters, for two data points. The first measurement was taken from the tip of the longest root to the root to shoot junction. The second measurement was taken from the same root to shoot junction to the tip of the plants stem. The plants were then cut at the root to shoot junction and each root system and stem was weighed in grams. The means for each group were then calculated as well as the root to shoot ratio values. The collected data was then plotted onto two graphs with respective standard deviations. A two-sample t_test was run using the values derived from the experiment to determine the chance that the results of the experiment did not occur coincidentally. 

Results:
In Figure 1, the controll group, Tap Water, is comprised of the calculated ratios of the plants grown in tap water. The experimental group, Acid Rain, contains the average root to shoot ratios of the plants grown in acid water with a pH of 3.5. The average root to shoot ratio based off of the weight of the controll group was found to be 1.0286±0.1864g, while the average root to shoot ratio of weight of the experimental group was 1.5898±0.2923g. These results had a low probability of occurring by chance seeing that the two-sample t_test provided a p_value of 6.69E-8. In regard to Figure 2, the controll and experimental groups were again comprised of the same plants. The average root to shoot ratio based off of length of the controll group was found to be 0.6062±0.0677cm, while the average root to shoot ratio of length of the experimental group was 0.9297±0.1535cm. These results also had a low probability of occurring by chance seeing that the two-sample t_test provided a p_value of 1.52E-9. Thus, the R:S ratios for both length and weight were higher for the plants grown with Acid Rain.

Discussion:
According to the resulting data, it can be inferred that the supplementation of the more acidic water significently increased the root to shoot ratio of the field pea plants. The results of the experiment performed in class reflected a similar result as seen in a study performed by Peter B. Reich, Anna W. Schoettle, Hans F. Stroo, John Troiano, and Robert G. Amundson in which the effects of ozone and acid rain on white pine seedlings were observed. This study produced the same results in that the seeds treated with ozone and acid rain did not grow as tall, yet grew more extensive root systems [Reich, Schoettle, Stroo, Troiano, and Amundson: 1987]. Thus, they too concluded that the presence of acid rain impacted the growth and development of the seedlings in that they had to allocate energy and resources to growing longer roots to obtain nutrients from the soil to support further life. Statistically speaking, the two-sample t_test supported our hypothesis that the plants treated with acid rain were going to have higher root to shoot ratios than the pea plants watered with normal tap water. The low p_value derived from the t_tests determined that there was far below a five percent chance that our data occurred purely by chance. Therefore, it can be concluded that the manipulation of water acidity forces plants to allocate resources. The study of how acidity effects the growth and development of plants is important because the environment is always changing, and it is important to know how soil depletion and atmospheric conditions, or other abiotic factors, will impact forest growth, crop growth, and overall ecosystems in the future. Therefore, the interactions of acid rain, and thus acid soil, need to be carefully examined in assessing the future changes in land use and consequent vegetative success. Moving forward, if this experiment were to be repeated, different abiotic factors should be manipulated to compare how certain deficiencies effect plants comparatively. Furthermore, being that this method and procedure produces a valid outcome, different plant species, or growth factors could be tested, and other substances that cause resource allocation could be examined. Regardless of outcome, experimental error could have been from mis measuring or recording weights and lengths of the stems and roots of each plant.
