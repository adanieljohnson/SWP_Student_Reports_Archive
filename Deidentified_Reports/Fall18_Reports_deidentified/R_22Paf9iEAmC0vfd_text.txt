Title: The Positive Correlation between Size and Aggression in Beta splendens

Abstract:
Aggression is often harmful social interaction between one organism inflicting damage or some other unpleasant acts upon another organism. The type of organism, intraspecific vs. interspecific interaction, level of territoriality, time or mating season, and an array of other factors contribute to the overall level of aggression exhibited. The purpose was to determine if there was a correlation between the size of Beta splendens and the level of aggression exhibited in order to analyze the costs and benefit of such behavior better. We hypothesized that Beta splendens of similar size would show higher levels of aggression toward one another than those of larger Beta splendens due to the cost of higher energy expenditure. Behavior was observed for the following interactions between Beta spendins: large-large, medium-medium, small-small, large-medium, large-small, and medium-small. Following experimentation, both ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests showed a significant difference, meaning there was a positive correlation between the size and level of aggression in fish. Thus, having a basic knowledge of the relationship between size and display of aggressive behavior provide a better understanding of such behaviors, and could lead to research giving a greater insight of both feeding and rep

Introduction:
Aggression is a readiness to attack or confront another organism; often a harmful social interaction between one organism inflicting damage or some other unpleasant act upon another organism. Studying aggression aids in understanding the relationship between different social and biological factors, and ultimately how they affect the organism overall. 
Beta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are the model organism for this experiment due to their array of intraspecific behaviors. The two types of intraspecific behaviors are broadside and facing movements; which can each be broken down further into three movements categorized by level of aggression. Aggressive behavior is most commonly occurring over territory, competition for a mate, and competition for food; the loss could be detrimental to the survival of an organism. Without territory, a male cannot reliably find the resources needed to provide shelter or food and risks greater competition for such resources. If aggression reflects competition for resources, the benefits revolve around the characteristics of the resource, meaning the controllability of the territory, the spatial distribution of schools of fish, and abundance of food are all impacted [Georgiev et al: 2013].
Meanwhile, the costs are organism-specific and are determined by how they fight; risking physical injury, death, energy depletion, exposure to predators, or damage to relationships with the organisms around it are all costs regarding aggressive behavior[Georgiev et al: 2013]. While aggression may seem like a choice behavior, it can also be heightened by hormone production and hormone receptor activity [Jonsson et al: 1997]. There are also costs and benefits of the display of aggression such as energy exerted and success in maintaining ownership of territory. Without any alterations to the hormone levels in the Beta splendens, we hypothesize that they will show greater aggression toward fish of their own size than larger fish due to the cost of expending greater amounts of energy toward larger fish. 


Materials and Methods:
The behavior of isolated Beta splendens was observed and recorded. Then, the control, a single fish of each size (small, medium, large), was exposed to their reflection in order for self-habituation to be observed. The fish of each size category was placed with another of the same size and observed for five minutes. Lastly, each will be observed in the presence of both of the other size categories. The categories were large-large, medium-medium, small-small, large-medium, large-small, and medium-small. For each set, behavior /level of aggression was noted every thirty seconds for a total of five minutes using the following scale of aggression: 0- no reaction, 1- pelvic fin flickering, 2-dorsal fin, 3- tail beating, 4-tail flashing, 5- red mane, and 6-attacking the glass to get to the competition. Finally, an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests were conducted to determine whether the difference in our datasets was significant or insignificant; allowing us to conclude the costs and benefits of the display of aggression in Beta splendens.

Results:
The ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests showed a significant difference between large-large and medium-small, large-medium and medium-small, and large-small and medium-small groups; thus, there is a positive correlation between the size of competitor and level of aggression (p-value: 0.000144). 

Discussion:
Our data showed a significant difference in size and level of aggression in Beta splendens. This can be explained because of metabolism and the costs/benefits of energy use with aggressive behavior. While there was a significant difference between the level of aggression displayed and the size, in specific categories, our hypothesis was not supported as the levels of aggression were higher in the presence of fish of greater size difference. Thus, aggression increased as the relative size of the fish increased; meaning that the fish were more likely to expend more energy in situations where they were likely to reap the benefits of doing so[Georgiev et al: 2013]. A better understanding of such behaviors could give a greater insight into both feeding and reproductive behaviors in fish, as well as territoriality. Past research has shown that owners of territory have won 85% of contests with opponents of equal size and that size advantage is needed to balance the size advantage in fish of different sizes [Johnsson et al: 1998]. Further research with larger sample sizes would be needed in order to draw more general conclusions; data regarding aggression and size of the organism would give insight as to whether or not other factors affect the display of aggression. For example, if more data were gathered and showed no significance, then we could go on to study how the presence of a possible mate or the presence of food affects the display of aggressive behavior between Beta splendens. Comparing various perspectives of behavior and aggression in Siamese fighting fish will also provide a better understanding of adaptations within the species.
