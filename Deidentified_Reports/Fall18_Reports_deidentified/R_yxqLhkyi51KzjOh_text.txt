Title: How Color Affects the Intraspecific Behavior of Betta Fish

Abstract:
Bettas (Betta splendins) are common aquarium fish that are native to Thailand. Male Bettas are known for being very aggressive with each other and, in pet stores, people are often encouraged to keep them separated due to how often they fight. Before fighting, Bettas exhibit aggressive (or "agnostic") behaviors to try to ward off mating competition.  Another additional key feature of male Bettas is that they are very colorful compared to their female counterparts.  To test how color affects the agnostic behavior of Bettas, I used two red males, two blue males and two foam fish cutouts (one red and one blue). First, the blue cutout was lowered into each tank, one at a time, to observe the Bettas behavior. The same was done with the red cutout. Their behavior was ranked on a scale of 0-3 with increasing intensity and a two-tailed, two-sampled t_test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the data. Based on information from a previous experiment, I hypothesized that Bettas will react stronger towards a red cutout. The data showed this to be true however, the t_test deemed the data insignificent, so the hypothesis was rejected.

Introduction:
Betta spledens (simply known as “Bettas” or “Siamese fighting fish”) are a common aquarium fish that are native to Thailand. Male Bettas are notorious for being aggressive with each other because they see each other as competition in terms of mating. [Johnson: 2018] In many pet stores, you are advised to keep male Bettas separated because their aggressive behaviors could lead to death. These aggressive (or “agnostic”) behaviors are called Intraspecific behaviors because they happen between members of the same species. Some examples of these behaviors include tail beating, fin flicking or flashing. These behaviors are called facing behaviors. More intense behaviors such as gill expansion, darting at or biting an opponent and the exposure of a “red mane” are called broadside behaviors. In response to these behaviors, male Bettas can either flee, submit to their opponent or match/raise their opponents’ behavior. [Johnson: 2018] If the situation escalates too much, it could lead to a fight. Fights in male Bettas can last up to an hour but usually last 30-45 minutes. Fights only end either when both males stop displaying agnostic behaviors or when they fight to the death. [M.J.A. Simpson: 1968] A fight to the death is not ideal for either fish and it is most beneficial for them to raise the intensity of the altercation to almost fighting but not actually fighting. This is because fighting requires a lot of energy and could have more costs than benefits. [Nídia Castro: 2006] Betta fish fight anyway because there is a reproductive advantage that allows them to fend off male competition and attract mates. [Paul M. Bronstein: 1981] Aside from fighting, male Bettas are also known for being brightly colored. In the wild, Bettas were originally dull colored and turned bright when they were provoked. However, due to commercial value, they have been bred to stay brightly colored. [Johnson: 2018] In this lab, I will be looking at how color affects the intensity of male behaviors using fake Betta foam cutouts. In a previous (unpublished) experiment, I observed the behavior of male Bettas under varying conditions. Generally, it seemed as though red Bettas were more aggressive than blue Bettas. Based on this information, I hypothesize that Bettas will react stronger to red foam cutouts than blue cutouts.

Materials and Method:
I began this experiment with four male Bettas held separately in a tank. There were two blue males and two red males. To test the Bettas’ responses to colored stimuli, a blue foam cutout was lowered into a blue Betta’s tank compartment for five minutes. After observing the Betta’s behavior, it was allowed to rest whilst the other fish’s behavior was tested. The process of lowering a blue cutout was performed on the other three fish. Next, the same procedure was performed with a red Betta cutout. To quantify the Betta’s behavior, a scale of 0-3 was used. 0 was reserved for Bettas who did not exhibit any response, 1 was used for facing behaviors, 2 was used for broadside behaviors and 3 was used for the presence of a red mane. In addition to determining the intensity of their behaviors, I also counted how often each behavior occurred and added all of the values together to get and average response intensity rating for each scenario. Statistically, a two-tailed, two-sampled t_test was performed to determine the significance of the data.

Results:
Overall, average aggressiveness was more intense with the red foam fish than with the blue foam fish. Aggressive towards the red cutout was, on average, 8.75 (+/- 5.74) whilst aggressiveness towards the blue cutout was 7.25 (+/- 2.65) on average. (Figure 1) Based on the raw data, it can be determined that the overall reaction to the red cutout was 35 whilst the reaction to the blue cutout was only 29. The difference between the two means is statistically insignificent based on the results from the two-tailed t_test (d.f. =6, t_stat = 0.479361, p_value = 0.648653).

Discussion:
The hypothesis that male Bettas would respond more intensely towards red cutouts was supported by the data but was ultimately deemed statistically insignificent. This hypothesis must be rejected because there were too many underlying factors that could have affected Betta aggressiveness that were not accounted for. The experiment appeared to be going similarly to other experiments performed on the agnostic behavior of Bettas. For example, in a study done on how fast Bettas can habituate stimuli, it was shown that the resident Bettas usually began by rushing at its “opponent” and then it’s behaviors gradually became less intense over time. [Harman V.S. Peeke: 1969] This pattern was observed in about 6 out of 8 trials of the experiment. However, overall, the Bettas’ response was very little. This could be because intrasexual competitive behaviors are very costly because they cost a lot of energy and resources to perform. [Nídia Castro: 2006] Additionally, fighting could end in death which is why many animals are selective when fighting. [Paul M. Bronstein: 1981] The Bettas used could have simply not recognized the cutouts as actual Bettas and therefore decided to be selective and not overly instigate conflict. Another reason the data was deemed insignificent could be the fact that the tanks used to house the Bettas had mirrors on their floors. This could have distracted the fish or even accounted for some of their aggressive behavior. Finally, the statistical insignificance could have been a consequence of underlying biology. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for regulating aggressive behavior in vertebrates among other things. A more aggressive fish will have more serotonergic nerve endings compared to a non-aggressive Betta. [Sharon E. Lynn: 2007] It is possible that some of the fish used simply had a lack of serotonin and therefore, didn’t respond as aggressively as others. This could also account for the generally high deviation in the data. If this study were to be replicated, I would advise using either very realistic cutouts or real-life Bettas as a stimulus to prevent selective fighting. Additionally, I would advise using tanks that have opaque flooring to prevent any aggressive reactions towards the Betta’s reflection.
