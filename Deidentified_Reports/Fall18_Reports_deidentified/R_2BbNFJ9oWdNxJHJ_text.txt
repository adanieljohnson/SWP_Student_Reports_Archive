Title: Difference in aggression levels of male Betta splendins when competing for food and females

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to investigate any difference in the levels of aggression shown when Betta spendens are competing for food and females. This experiment was conducted by running several trials in which two males were placed together in the presence of a female and other trials where they were in the presence of food. These trials were compared to a controll trial were the two males were just left to interact with each other, with no extra stimuli. The aggressive behaviors that the fish regularly exhibit were ranked and each B. splendins was given points every time they exhibited one of the behaviors. In the end, it was concluded that there was not a statistically significent difference in the in the average value of aggressive behaviors shown when the males were competing for food, females, or without stimuli. 

Introduction:
Intraspecific competition is competition between members of the same species. This type of competition is especially present among the species Betta splendins, a type of Siamese fighting fish.  When faced with another male of the species, B. splenden will present a series of agnostic or aggressive behaviors. These behaviors include broadside movements such as pelvic fin flicking, tail flashing, and tail beating. Facing movements such as erecting the pectoral fins, spreading the gill covers, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes are other agnostic behaviors the fish exhibit. For this experiment, it was investigated whether or not the B. splendins would exhibit more aggressive behavior when competing for a female or competing for food, in comparison to the behavior shown when the fish were placed together with no stimuli. Previous studies have shown that these fish tend to be aggressive and territorial when faced with other males [Bronstein: 1981]. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the two males would act more aggressively when faced with competition to obtain food.

Materials and Method:
In order to analyze if there were any differences in the aggressive behaviors between stimuli, a controll was first gathered. This was done by observing the behavior of two male B. splendins without any stimuli. The glass partitions between the fish were removed and observations were recorded for a five-minute period. In order to quantify the data, a ranking system of the aggressive behaviors was set as follows: Broadside movements 1 point - pelvic fin flicking 2 points - tail beating 3 points - tail flashing facing movements 1 point - erect pectoral fins 2 points - spread gill covers 3 points - protrude branchiostegal membranes. The numbers were recorded each time the fish exhibited one of these behaviors. A five-minute period of rest was taken and then the behavior of the two males in the presence of the female was recorded using the same ranking system, for a five-minute period.  Another five-minute period of rest was taken before the behavior of the males of the presence of food was recorded for a five-minute period All of these trials were then done with another pair of fish.

Results:
Overall, it seemed as if there was a difference among the different stimuli, as seen in figure 1, but a statistical test was run to determine the significance of this observation. An anova test was run to compare the aggressive behaviors exhibited between the two stimulant conditions and the controll trial. It yielded statistically non-significent results (Fs= 0.749, d.f.= 2, p=0.560).   

Discussion:
After completing the experiment, it was concluded that there was not a significent difference among the number of aggressive behaviors shown between the B. splendins when competing for food and competing for females. This result came as a surprise due to the fact that previous studies showing that these fish tended to be extremely territorial, especially in the presence of food [Bronstein: 1981]. These results may have been affected by some kind of confounding variable, such as how many times the fish were used in the experiments before this, which may have tired them out. Although this variable set did not affect the interspecific interactions among the fish, there are likely other variables that will that are able to researched in the future
