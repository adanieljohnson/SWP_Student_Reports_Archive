Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta is a type of caterpillar which in it’s young stages of life is a pest. One of the key hormones which keeps the caterpillar in its early life stages is the juvenile hormone. This lab is meant to test whether or not Precor(contains the juvenile hormone) actually had an effect on the growth of the caterpillar. The experiment was done with a controll group and an experimental group that was given the same diet as the controll, but with Precor.  The hypothesis at the start of the lab was that the group that was treated with Precor would not gain as much mass due to Juvenile Hormone limiting growth. The results showed that there was a statistical difference between the two groups and that the group without Precor gained more mass than the group that was treated with Precor.

Introduction:
This experiment tested caterpillars specifically Manduca Sexta, also known as a tobacco hornworm. Manduca Sexta before it’s fifth instar is a pest as it can destroy crops (Reinecke 1980). In order to prevent the damage an experiment was set up to see if the Juvenile Hormone directly affects the Manduca Sexta’s growth. In this lab, the goal is to see how Precor(contains the Juvenile Hormone) affects the growth of the Manduca Sexta. As a result, the procedure involves a process observing caterpillars with a base diet and comparing their growth with the Caterpillars that have Precor in their diet. The Juvenile Hormone inhibits the growth of caterpillars. Consequently, before the lab started the expectation was that the caterpillars that ate food treated with Precor would gain weight at a noticeably slower rate.

Materials and Method:
Two groups of four Manduca Sexta were given the same diet of caterpillar food, but one was soaked in 10 drops of water and one was soaked in Precor(contains JH). Everyday two people from our lab group would go into the laboratory to measure the weight of the caterpillars and observe them. These two people would then record this data on a google spreadsheet in order for it to be accessible to all members of the group.

Results:
Table 1. Caterpillars with a diet soaked in water

Total mean weight of controll=7.0165 g

Table 2. Caterpillars with a diet soaked in Precor

Total mean weight of controll=5.06475 g


After all of the data was collected a two sample t_test was used with a p_value of 1.57 x 10-5 Since the p_value is less than 0.05 which means that there is a significent difference in the data.



Discussion:
The Juvenile Hormone had been found in previous studies to have played a direct part in an insects growth and metamorphosis (Evans 1996). In this lab, the two sample t_test proved that  there was a significent difference between the weights of the two groups. As a result, the data supported our hypothesis as it showed a trend of the Precor group gaining weight at a slower rate than the controll group. Furthermore, the controll group also entered the next stage of development, hence solidifying the idea of the Juvenile Hormone playing a direct role in the growth of Manduca Sexta. All in all, the hypothesis was supported by the data and the experiment lead to the conclusion that the Juvenile Hormone does inhibit growth.
