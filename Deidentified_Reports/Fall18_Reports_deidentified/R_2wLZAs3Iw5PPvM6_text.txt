Title: Root to Shoot Ratio Comparison of Pisum sativun arvense Grown in Sunlight and Darkness

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation in plants as a result of changes to the environment is a very important aspect of evolutionary biology. Learning how and why this variation occurs may lead to a better understanding of the environment in which we live and how these changes may benefit the ecosystem in the future. Here we look at the phenotypic variation of field pea plants (Pisum sativun arvense) grown in full sunlight and complete darkness by measuring and comparing their average root to shoot (R:S) ratios. It was anticipated that the R:S ratio for both the weights and lengths of plants grown in sunlight would be smaller than the ratio for those grown in darkness in response to the search for lacking light. Our data displayed that there was a significent difference in the lengths of those grown in each condition, yet one large root skewed the data for the R:S weight differences between the conditions and showed no significent difference between the two. This significent difference in the R:S ratios for length suggests that, when deprived of light, plants tend to allocate their resources to seeking out the sunlight they need for photosynthesis. This adaptation shows that the P. sativun arvense plant is willing to change its appearance in order to survive in different environments. 


Introduction:
This experiment analyzes the effect of sunlight on the Root to Shoot ratio of field peas (Pisum sativun arvense). Photosynthesis is an organism’s (primarily plant’s) ability to use the energy from available sunlight to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H20) into food for its growth and development. This process can be found in the leaves of the plant as this is the area that captures solar energy when sunlight is present. Studies have shown that, after cutting the root from the shoot of P. sativun arvense plants and attempting to re-grow roots on their severed ends, a lack of sunlight and therefore photosynthesis resulted in the inability of a shoot to grow new roots [Eliasson: 1978]. Furthermore, when sunlight is available, plants have a higher growth rate due to this increase in resource allocation [Johnson: 2018]. This plays a vital factor in the sustainability of an organism’s life and we wanted to see the outcomes of depriving a plant of sunlight as compared to those provided full sunlight during development. For this experiment, I hypothesize that the average root to shoot ratio will increase for field pea plants grown in darkness in an attempt to seek out the lacking sunlight. In addition, the root to shoot ratio for field pea plants grown in the sunlight-available greenhouse will be smaller because they have no need to seek out the readily-present sunlight. 


Materials and Method:
To conduct this experiment, the field pea seeds were first soaked in water for at least 30 minutes and planted in four different pots of vermiculite. Then the soil was dampened with 100 Ml of water and 50 Ml of Miracle Grow and the seeds were covered with a thin layer of vermiculite. Next, two pots were placed in the well-lit greenhouse and the other two pots in an area with no sunlight- a cabinet in the laboratory. All four pots were watered with 100 Ml of water daily for two weeks. After this period of time, the developed field pea plants were carefully separated from the vermiculite, dried off, and cut at the base of the seed to separate the roots from the shoots. These roots and shoots were separated by their condition of growth, either sunlight or darkness and their weights (grams) and lengths (cm) recorded. Each root and shoot was weighed in a standard lab balance by the same team member and the lengths factored from the end of the cut side to the tip of the shoot stem. A one-tailed, two sample t_test was used to determine if there was any variation in the R:S ratios, the lengths, and the weights of the field pea plants grown in the greenhouse (sunlight) and in the cabinet (darkness). 


Results:
After conducting a two-sample T-test for the root to shoot ratios of the weight and length of plants grown in both conditions, we discovered a statistically significent difference for the R:S length ratio of each condition (T-value=6.9; d.f.=18; P-value=0.00). However, the mean R:S ratio for weight proved not to contain a statistically significent difference between those grown in sunlight and those grown darkness (T-value=1.9; d.f.=18; P-value=0.07). These findings can be seen in Figure 1-provided below- which displays the trend that plants grown in the light condition had larger R:S ratios for both weight and length.  


Discussion:
The hypothesis for this experiment is accepted in regards to the prediction that the root to shoot ratio of the plants’ lengths would increase for the plants grown in darkness. This can be shown by the significent difference in the p_values of the length of plants grown in both conditions. On the other hand, our hypothesis is rejected for the R:S ratios for the weights of plants grown in both conditions because there was no statistical significance for this data set. This can be contributed to an outlier in our sample of the field pea plants grown in sunlit conditions where two seeds fused into one and weighed nearly twice the amount of its shoot. This shifted the overall mean R:S ratio for this sample group and thus may have impacted the statistics yielded from the research. On this topic of root cuttings and their interaction with sunlight, Eliasson’s research revealed that cuttings of the P. sativun plants were more inclined to grow new roots when exposed to sunlight than when they are left in darkness [Eliasson: 1978]. Eliasson’s research parallels that of my group’s study on these plants in that it proves a correlation between available sunlight and phenotypic variation. It further confirms the results that we gathered which conclude that the average R:S ratios of plants grown in sunlight were larger than those grown in darkness. This research on the P. sativun arvense plants’ root to shoot ratios could provide necessary information on how phenotypic variation in the presence of adverse conditions can be beneficial to a species’ survival.
