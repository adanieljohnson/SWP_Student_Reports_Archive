Title: The effect of Insect Growth Regulator methroprene on Manduca sexta weight

Abstract:
Metamorphosis, or the entry into the adult stage of an insect, is an important topic in biology. It is important to understand the different hormones affecting the brains in insects and how they produce growth, but also can inhibit pupation. This is relevant because different insect growth regulators, or IGR’s, are substances used for pest control. In this experiment, the IGR methroprene is looked at to see how it mimics the function of juvenile hormone, a hormone important for the growth of larvae, while inhibiting pupation. It was hypothesized that the experimental caterpillars given the IGR methroprene would weight more than the control caterpillars, because the methroprene would improve the larvae growth. The data proved to be significant and the difference between the mean weight change for the control caterpillars versus the experimental caterpillars was not due to chance. This significance proves that juvenile hormone does aid in caterpillar growth, while preventing pupation. This effect of the IGR methroprene mimicking juvenile hormone is important because it can be used for pest population control, since juvenile hormone does not allow for metamorphosis. 


Introduction:
Manduca sexta are insects that undergo holometabolous development. This means there are four major life stages from egg to larvae to pupa to adult. The Manduca sexta molts in between every life stage where outer layer of skin, known as the cuticle, is shed. The transition from the larvae to the pupa stage is known as metamorphosis, which proceeds to transition to the adult stage of life. Many hormones secreted from the brain, including juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, are needed for development and affect the type and timing of an insect’s molt. Insect Growth Regulators are substances used for insect pest control. They affect processes essential for normal development, which leads to reduced insect survival and population decreases. Juvenile hormone is a hormone needed to help the larvae grow, but does not allow them to pupate and develop into their adult stage of life. Once there are low amounts of juvenile hormone, the insect can pupate into the adult form. However, in the larvae life stage, there is a special binding protein for juvenile hormone and the hormone is given protection from enzymes that would destroy it [Sanburg: 1975]. Methroprene is an IGR used to mimic the functions of juvenile hormone. It helps the larvae grow, but does not allow it to progress to the pupal stage. In this experiment, methroprene was combined with food to test the effects of this IGR on caterpillar growth. It is hypothesized that if the Manduca sexta is exposed to the methroprene as a part of its diet, they will weigh more than caterpillars not exposed to the IGR, because this IGR mimics juvenile hormone, aiding the growth of larvae.


Materials and Methods:
Eight Mandusca sexta caterpillars, weighing 0.80 to 3.51 grams were selected. The 8 caterpillars were split up into 2 containers with 4 caterpillars, each with their own section of the container. Two holes were poked into each section of the containers. One container was the control container and the other was the experimental container. The 4 control caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food plus 10 drops of deionized water each. The experimental caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food plus 5 drops of methroprene each. All the caterpillars were kept in the same incubator in a 12-hour dark, 12-hour light cycle. Each day, for 2 weeks, caterpillars weight was recorded. Averages for control and experimental change in weight was recorded. Only data from the first 10 days is used in averages, because on the eleventh day one of the caterpillars pupated. A one sample t test was used to determine differences in the average weight change of the caterpillars that were fed the control versus experimental diet.


Results:
The mean change in weight for the control caterpillars was 4.615 grams and the mean change in weight for the experimental caterpillars was 11.61 grams (Fig 1). The standard deviation for the weight change in the control caterpillars was 0.339 grams, and the standard deviation for the weight change in the experimental caterpillars was 1.56 grams (Fig 1). A one sample t test was used to analyze the results. The P value was 6.31 E -5, with degrees of freedom = 6, and the t statistic = 8.715. When observing the caterpillars on one of the final days of the experiment, the control caterpillars seemed to be losing weight and starting their commitment pulse, while the experimental caterpillars were getting much larger, brighter blue, and lively. When compared to the alpha value of 0.05, a p value of 6.31 E -5 shows that the results were significant and the difference between the weight in the control versus the experimental caterpillars was not by chance.


Discussion:
The hypothesis, that if the IGR methroprene was added to caterpillar’s diets, they would weigh more than caterpillars who were not exposed to the methroprene, because methroprene is an IGR that mimics juvenile hormone which aids in larvae growth, was supported. Since the p-value of 6.31 E -5 is smaller than the alpha level of 0.05, the results were significant, and the change in weight was not due to chance. This demonstrates that that IGR methroprene does have an effect on caterpillar weight. Methroprene mimics juvenile hormone, which aids in larvae growth of caterpillars, allowing them to get bigger, however it does not allow the caterpillars to enter pupation. Therefore, the methroprene enhanced the growth of the experimental caterpillars, while the control caterpillars lost weight after a certain point and entered pupation. When juvenile hormone is present in the larvae stage, the caterpillar cannot progress to pupation and start metamorphosis; however, juvenile hormone does not restrict the molting process, so the larvae continues to get bigger. [Zhou: 2002] In one study, it was proved that when juvenile hormone is eliminated from the larvae, the brain can release PTTH, which is a hormone that releases molting hormone and allows for pupation [Nijhout: 1974]. An understanding of how hormones and IGR’s work for insects could further our understanding in pest control in species that are pests as adults. If given an IGR, such as methroprene, insects could not develop out of their larvae stage and would never enter their adult stage of life as pests. Knowledge like this could aid our ability in pest control in the future.
