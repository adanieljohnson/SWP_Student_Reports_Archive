Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Trichloride on Physarum polycephalum Movement 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that has no nervous system. Therefore, the mold operates according to its environmentally based signal transduction pathways. The calcium-mediated signal transduction pathway is responsible for the movement of Physarum. This experiment examined the movement of Physarum in the presence of a calcium inhibitor. It was hypothesized that the introduction of the calcium inhibitor, lanthanum trichloride, would decrease movement in the Physarum as calcium is responsible for actin and myosin movement in Physarum. Water-agar plates were soaked with lanthanum trichloride and an equal number of Physarum were placed on all test and control plates. These control and treatment groups were examined 48 hours after incubation and measured for distance moved. The recorded results were inconclusive because the majority of the Physarum did not move. Results were not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.75. The inconclusive nature of the Physarum movement was most likely due to the environmental factors that the Physarum were subjected to during their 48 hour growth period.                               

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate slime mold. Physarum have no nervous system and they behave according to their environmental stimuli. The slime mold responds to factors from the environment by signal transduction pathways. One specific signaling pathway that it responds to is the calcium-mediated pathway. When physarum use this signaling pathway, calcium enters the cytoplasm and then gets triggered to be released from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. From the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, calcium binds to a specialized receptor, known as a ryanodine receptor. These ryanodine receptors are responsible for movement, similar to the IP3 receptors used by Physarum in their IP3-mediated pathway, because of their involvement with actin and myosin [Johnson: 2016]. Previous research shows that the inhibition of calcium led to a lack of movement in a specific Physarum population [Zhang et. al: 2014]. Calcium is responsible for the movement of actin and myosin in Physarum [Kohama: 2016]. Since calcium is responsible for the activation of the ryanodine receptors and the ryanodine receptors are responsible for the activation of actin and myosin microfilaments, calcium is essential for Physarum movement. We hypothesized that the usage of the calcium inhibitor lanthanum trichloride would hinder calcium from entering into the cytoplasm, which would inhibit the movement of the Physarum by blocking calcium from ultimately stimulating actin and myosin.

Materials and Methods:
Lanthanum trichloride was diluted to a 1X stock solution by taking 1 milliliter of lanthanum trichloride and adding it to 19 milliliters of water. Then the lanthanum trichloride 1X solution was poured onto 3 water-agar plates. The lanthanum trichloride was then left to soak on the plates for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the excess solution was poured or blotted off. 1 square was removed with sterilized forceps from each of the 6 plates. Then 6 1X1 Physarum blocks were cut out of a culture dish containing Physarum and then placed into the 3 control and 3 experimental plates. Then 5-6 oat flakes were placed in one corner of the all of the stock plates. The plates were then taped down and wrapped in foil. The wrapped plates were placed in a dark bag within an incubator for two nights that was set at 27 Celsius. After 48 hours, the distance moved by the Physarum was measured in millimeters and recorded. A two-sample t-test was conducted on the data obtained from the experiment. 

Results:
Average distance moved was larger in the experimental group than the control group (Figure 1). The control group had an average value of 2.67 millimeters traveled and the experimental group had an average of 4 millimeters traveled (Figure 1). According to figure 1, the standard deviation of the control group was 3.77 and the standard deviation of the experimental group was 4.32. The results from the two-sample t-test were not statistically significant (t-value=0.329, df=4,p-value=0.75).  The average movement from the expected control group was 10.33 millimeters while the average movement from the expected experimental group was 1.67 millimeters (Figure 2). The standard deviation of the control group was 1.00 and the standard deviation of the experimental group was 0.5 (Figure 2). 

Discussion:
Physarum do not have nervous systems or hormones, meaning that intracellular communication occurs through signaling pathways. One signal transduction pathway that is used by Physarum is the calcium-mediated pathway, which stimulates movement in the slime mold. Prior to conducting the experiment, it was hypothesized that the physarum would move less in the experimental group compared to the control group. The results from this experiment do not support the hypothesis made earlier. There was more overall average movement in the experimental group compared to the control group (Figure 1). Additionally, according to the statistical test that was run, the results were not statistically significant. The p-value that was obtained was 0.75, indicating that there was a 75% chance that our results were due to chance. 
	In the expected results from Figure 2, it was shown that the Physarum moved more, on average, in the controlled setting compared to the experimental setting. The controlled setting Physarum had no hinderance and moved toward the oat flakes food source as the Physarum were expected to. In the experimental setting, the Physarum’s movement was inhibited by the lanthanum trichloride and they moved less than the . In this experiment, lanthanum trichloride was used to inhibit calcium release in the Physarum because lanthanum trichloride blocks calcium from entering into the cell. Calcium propagates a wave of movement within the Physarum’s cytoplasm, which translates into a single motion to the endomembrane system [Yoshiyama et al.: 2010]. The propagated wave leads to the release of calcium into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. After, the calcium is released into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, it attaches to ryanodine receptors to facilitate the movement of actin and myosin microfilaments. Thus, this propagated wave acts as an signal for actin-myosin contraction. In other previous studies, the inhibition of calcium was seen to inhibit myosin movement; therefore, decreasing movement in Physarum [Kohama: 2016]. Therefore, calcium is essential for actin-myosin contraction and Physarum movement. The release of calcium into the cytoplasm triggers the Physarum to move its myosin and actin microfilaments. The inhibition of calcium would mean that calcium would not have been released into the cytoplasm and would not propagate a wave, which indicates that there would be no calcium in the endomembrane system. The absence of calcium into the cytoplasm follows with no calcium binding to the ryanodine receptors. When the ryanodine receptors are not activated by calcium, there is no stimulation of actin and myosin. Thus, there is no movement from the Physarum. 
		Moreover, potential errors include the physical displacement of the physarum wedge. When plates were checked on after 48 hours, the plates had been completely altered. The food seemed to have moved from its original location and on two of the plates the physarum block was completely displaced and located on top of a different area of the plate. The Physarum were placed back into their original cut holes; however, there was a sizeable distance between the edge of the Physarum block and the edge of the water-agar plate. Additionally, the stock solutions of the Physarum were marked in different ways, indicating that the plates were not uniform or properly prepared. After the experiment, it was noted that these plates often moved in and out of the light, which forced the Physarum to move in and out of its resting structure. The resting structure gives the Physarum time for recharge and Physarum do not move during this period. In moving Physarum, the visible light will induce a resting structure response and will also inhibit Physarum movement [Schreckenbach: 1984]. This switch between rest structure and active phase indicates that the Physarum did not have enough time to properly move around because they were either being inhibited by the change in the phototactic setting. Thus, the Physarum did not have a controlled environment and were hindered from moving within a specific time frame due to disruption of the plates sometime during incubation. Future studies could examine these same conditions with more tested groups and a more controlled environment. More experimental and control groups would eliminate the potential of one outlier, who did not move or moved more than expected, to skew the results and produce inaccurate average values and large standard deviations. A controlled phototactic environment would get rid of the potential lack of movement due to the change into resting structure induced by shifting light sources. Additionally, a controlled environment would rid the groups of potentially being disturbed by external forces that disrupt the movement of Physarum.
