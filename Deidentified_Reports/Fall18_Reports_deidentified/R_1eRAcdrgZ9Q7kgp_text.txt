Title: The Effect of Light on the Chloroplast Activity in C3 and C4 Plants

Abstract:
The majority of energy used by all organisms originates from plants. Plants are able to create and store energy through the process known as photosynthesis. In basic terms, this process is completed by using specific organic materials along with energy from sunlight to produce six carbon glucose molecules. The process of photosynthesis is carried out differently in different types of plants, as C4 plants have an extra step in their photosynthetic process that allows them to be more efficient than C3 plants. In this experiment, the types of plants that were tested were a C3 plant, Spinacia oleracea, and a C4 plant, Chrysanthemum idicum. To test the photosynthetic rates of these plants, four trials were run: light C3, light C4, dark C3, and dark C4. The photosynthetic rates were measured using spectrophotometry and DCIP and a two way ANOVA test was used to analyze the results. Ultimately, no significant difference was discovered between any of the trials, suggesting that light and type of plant have no effect on photosynthetic rate.

Introduction:
In order to survive, all living organisms require energy in order to live and carry out all of the biological processes that are required to sustain life. The way in which different organisms obtain this energy depends on what type of organism they are. Plants as well as some protists and certain bacteria carry out photosynthesis in order to capture and store energy from the sun. The process of photosynthesis can be simplified to the equation 6 carbon dioxide molecules plus 12 water molecules plus light yields one glucose molecule, 6 oxygen molecules, and 6 water molecules [Johnson, 2016]. More specifically, chlorophyll molecules within the cells of plants absorb the solar energy which results in high energy electrons triggering a series of chemical reactions that ultimately results in the production of glucose. This glucose can then be broken down and used to create ATP, the energy currency of the cell, via cellular respiration. Photosynthesis can be broken down into two different stages, light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light dependent reactions generate a proton gradient through a series of redox reactions, resulting in ATP synthesis. The light-independent reactions take the ATP and the enzyme complex RUBISCO and use the reducing power of NADPH to produce glucose molecules.
	Within the plant family, there are multiple types of plants, including C3 and C4 plants. C3 plants are the most common type of plant and they execute photosynthesis in accordance to the general mechanism above. C4 plants, on the other hand, have an extra step in the photosynthetic pathway before the light independent reactions that results in less carbons being used and lost throughout the entire process [Wang, et al., 2012]. This is important because unlike C3 plants, such as trees and wheats, C4 plants, like cacti and corn, often live in hotter, drier, and overall more difficult habitats. By being more efficient with the limited resources that they have, the C4 plants are able to survive in more difficult situations.
	For this lab, we wanted to test the differences in photosynthetic activity between the chloroplasts of C3 and C4 plants. Our C3 plant was Spinacia oleracea, also known as spinach, and our C4 plant was Chrysanthemum idicum, better known as chrysanthemum. We used spectrophotometry to determine the percent change in absorbance. To test the photosynthetic ability of the chloroplasts of these two plants, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) was used as an electron acceptor to simulate photosynthesis. Prior to being reduced, DCIP is a dark blue color, but as photosynthesis proceeds, the DCIP becomes a clear color [Ernster, 1967]. The difference in the absorbance before and after photosynthesis can then be related to photosynthetic rate. We hypothesized that because sunlight is required in order for photosynthesis to proceed, the chloroplasts in the light would have a greater percent change in absorbance than in the dark [Sorek, et al., 2012]. In addition, we hypothesized that the Chrysanthemum idicum chloroplasts would have a greater percent change in absorbance than the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts because C4 plants are more efficient than C3 plants at photosynthesizing.

Materials and Methods:
First, four Spinacia oleracea leaves and about a dozen Chrysanthemum idicum leaves were collected. The Spinacia oleracea leaves were washed, deveined, and crushed in a cold mortar and pestle along with 10 mL of grinding buffer. The Chrysanthemum idicum leaves were also crushed in a cold mortar and pestle with 10 mL of grinding buffer. The leaves were ground into a thick paste and then 10 mL of grinding buffer was added to both pastes. The Spinacia oleracea mixture was strained through cheesecloth into a beaker, and the same was done with the Chrysanthemum idicum mixture into a separate beaker. The mixtures were then poured into two centrifuge tubes, one labeled “Spinach 1” and the other labeled “C4 1”. The tubes were then placed in the centrifuge and were spun for three minutes at 4 degrees celsius and 200xG. After centrifuging the tubes, the supernatants were poured into new centrifuge tubes labeled “Spinach 2” and “C4 2” and the pellets were discarded. The new tubes were then placed in the centrifuge and spun for ten minutes at 4 degrees celsius and 1000xG. After, the supernatants were then discarded and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellets and mixed with a micropipet. 
	Next, 14 test tubes were obtained and divided up into two sets and labeled 1-7. The test tubes labeled 1 were control tubes and had 8 mL of water added. All 14 tubes then had 2 mL of reaction buffer added. Every tube except for the control received 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP. The tubes labeled 2-7 for the first set had 100 microliters of Spinacia oleracea chloroplast mixture added to them and the test tubes labeled 2-7 for the second set had 100 microliters of Chysanthemum idicum chloroplast mixture added. The absorbances of all 14 tubes were measured with a spectrophotometer set to read at 600 nm. This values served as the time zero value. Test tubes 2-4 for both sets were placed by a window to be the light group and tubes 5-7 for both sets were placed in a drawer to be the dark group. After 30 minutes, the absorbances of all of the tubes was measured again, and the percent change was calculated. The results were then analyzed using a two-way anova test.

Results:
A two way ANOVA test was used in order to analyze the data collected from this experiment. The results of the ANOVA test were insignificant for the light v. dark test (df=1, p=0.587) and for the C3 v. C4 test (df=5, p=0.613) with a p value of p≤0.05. This means that there was no significant difference in photosynthetic rate when comparing plants in light conditions or dark conditions as well as comparing Spinacia oleracea and Chrysanthemum idicum.

Discussion:
According to the data collected, we found that there was no significant difference with regard to photosynthetic rate between light and dark environments. Similarly, we found that there was no significant difference between the photosynthetic rates of our C3 plant, Spinacia oleracea, and our C4 plant, Chrysanthemum idicum. This means that there was not enough evidence provided to prove that any of our conditions (light v. dark, C3 v. C4) had a non-random effect on the photosynthetic rates that we collected. As a result, the data rejects our hypotheses as there was no correlation between the different types of light exposure or type of photosynthetic routes used by the chloroplasts.
	Although our data did not reflect it, we know that photosynthetic rates should be greater in light than in dark conditions. This is due to light being a necessary component of the photosynthetic process in order to create the ATP needed to run the light-independent reactions. Without light, we would expect the light-independent reactions to still occur, thus some photosynthesis occurs, though the rate would be much slower due to much lower input from the light-dependent reactions. This is backed by prior research and was backed by our experiments that we ran previously. As for there being no significant difference between C3 and C4 plants in photosynthetic rate, we had not previously tested this so we have no data to support this hypothesis, however prior studies have been able to prove that C4 plants are more efficient than C3 plants in terms of photosynthesis [Wang, et al., 2012]. We understand our obtained results are not significant, nor accurate according to current knowledge from previous experiments and understandings about photosynthetic rates.
	Due to the results not reflecting what is accepted to be true, we must analyze our experiment for potential errors that may have caused the inaccurate results we obtained. One potential error in this lab was that the trial was not allowed to run for very long, nor were many trials used. Although we could not control all of these factors in the exact manner we would like to, such as letting the chloroplasts photosynthesize for a much greater period of time. In the future, this lab should be done for a longer period of time and with more trials so that more accurate results regarding photosynthetic rates can be obtained. Another potential source of error was that although we attempted to grind up the same amount of leaves from the Spinacia oleracea as the Chrysanthemum idicum, we may have not had an equal amount, thus not an equal amount of chloroplasts were tested. This would affect the photosynthetic rates as the more chloroplasts that the tubes have, the more photosynthesis will be able to be carried out. In the future, more time should be spent making sure that the amount of leaves used is very similar so that we can be more sure that the tubes all roughly have the same amount of chloroplasts.
	Further research with C3 and C4 plants could be conducted with regards to the changing climate on earth. Due to climate change and global warming, it is understood that temperatures are rising at a rapid rate and that carbon dioxide levels are increasing as well. One study found that higher temperatures result in C4 plants having a greater photosynthetic rate [Sage, et al., 2007]. The significance of this study is that C4 plants may be more fit to survive in the hotter environments being caused by climate change than C3 plants. Another study found that increased carbon dioxide levels result in greater photosynthetic rate in C3 plants, but not in C4 species [Pajajaran, 2005]. As such, these results run contrary to the temperature theory in that C3 plants may in fact be more fit than C4 plants to survive and thrive in the changing environments being created by climate change. 
	Ultimately, our experiment was not successful in proving that photosynthesis occurs at a greater rate in light than in dark conditions, and in C4 plants than in C3 plants. Our results run contrary to the knowledge and prior research we have studied up until this point. In the future, this type of experiment can be used to bring about a better understanding of how plants and photosynthetic rates may be affected by a climate change and the effects of global warming.
