Title: EFFECTS OF JUVENILE HORMONE ON MANDUCA SEXTA

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) plays a major role in the development of an adult Manduca sexta. During the larval and developmental phases of the insect, it relies heavily upon fluctuation in JH and ecdysteroids. In this experiment, we administered a compound which mimics JH to Manduca sexta caterpillars. After 14 days of administration every other day, we discovered that treatment by JH did not have a significent effect on size, but did affect the rate in which the caterpillars entered the pupal stage. 


Introduction:
Substances used to limit or affect insect development are called “insect growth regulators” (IGR’s) [Tunaz, 2004]. These compounds act as or mimic growth hormones which naturally occur within the insect’s life cycle [3, Johnson, 2018]. In a study on linden bugs (Pyrrhocoris apterus L.), researchers observed that bugs reared in the lab had low egg hatch rates and a significent many failed to mature into adults. Investigation indicated that these effects were caused by an IGR compound called Juviabone, which had been used in the production of the paper towels the researchers used in rearing jars [3]. IGR compounds produce varied results across species, so JH pesticides can only target certain insects that are affected by the hormone. In particular, there is a demand for pesticides which prevent caterpillars from destroying crops. In a recent study, researchers investigated links between levels on juvenile hormone (JH) in food given to Manduca sexta caterpillars (popularly referred to as “hornworms”). Flossflower was used to imitate JH. Researchers found that within a week, varying amounts of JH had produced predictable variations in development among test subjects [3].  Large amounts of JH (≥5%) inhibited growth and motor function, while any amount of JH appeared to slow the process of pupation in the fifth instar. Research has shown that melanization of the cuticle in the fifth instar indicates incipient pupation [2,3]. Therefore, observance of color variation between samples would offer evidence of the larva’s readiness to pupate.  In this experiment, we further investigated the correlation between administered JH and abnormal development. Diets consisting of JH levels around 3% were administered to treatment caterpillars every other day. We predicted that if these Manduca sexta were treated with an IGR that simulates JH, we would observe generally smaller masses and an inability to pupate within the treatment group.


Materials and Method:
To begin the lab, we prepared two holding containers for the sample Manduca sexta. One container was marked for controll, and the other for treatment. Each container had four individual pools, each labelled with a number one through four for identification of the caterpillars. 

We then selected 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars around the 4th instar period from a generation of lab-reared insects. Selected caterpillars were then sorted into a controll group and a treatment group; each with four caterpillars of varying initial sizes (observed visually) and mostly identical features. These caterpillars were weighed by electric scale, then each placed within a pool. For the purpose of this experiment, we defined 10 grams of food to be a daily portion. The controll received plain portions placed within each pool each day. However, the treatment caterpillars were fed portions containing small amounts (around 3% JH solution administered by pipette) of an IGR that simulates JH (G-regulator with 1: 1250 concentration). In order to ensure that the process of switching food remained controllled, every pool was thoroughly cleaned each day before a new portion was introduced.
During cleaning, the caterpillars were massed by electronic scale, then allocated to a clear, clean temporary holding container. In order to maintain their identity was individual experimental subjects, measures were taken to ensure the Manduca sexta were returned to the correct pool after cleaning and reintroducing food sources. A photo was also taken of each container after this process for observational purposes. 

After 15 days, we examined traits of each caterpillar to determine instar stage and the visual effects of the hormone. We were looking in particular for differences in coloration between the groups of caterpillars (those that have not pupated), for a yellowish brown color is an indication of an incipient pupal stage. In addition, data from the masses recorded were compared by a one-tailed, two-sample T-Test to determine if there was significent evidence that the treatment group had generally smaller masses than the controll group due to JH.


Results:
Using graphical summary, we observed that both groups of Manduca sexta followed a similar trend in steady, curved growth. However, the controll group seemed to undergo growth more quickly, peaked, then generally decreased in mass. Comparatively, the treatment group appeared to grow more slowly, and we did not observe a definite peak or a subsequent decrease in mass after 15 days. Due to hurricane complications, we were unable to record data for days 10-12, so we might have missed part of the trend. However, the data surrounding the gap seems to adhere to the observed trend. The sudden drop in average mass of the controll caterpillars on day 9 does not appear to follow the progression of gained mass. 
Visual observation allowed us to perceive obvious changes in the physical appearance of the organisms. As a whole, the controll group seemed to advance further in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta, adopting a yellow-brown tint indicative of an incipient pupal phase. Specimen One (1) fully pupated. Comparably, the treatment group remains the bright blue color of larvae in the fourth or fifth instar, before the commitment pulse.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis stated that we believed that caterpillars treated every other day with a JH-mimicking IGR compound would fail to pupate and would be smaller in mass than untreated caterpillars. Observation proved that the controll caterpillars were further along in expected lifespan, and one did pupate. The yellow-brown color of the three controll specimens that did not pupate provides evidence of cuticular melanization, a process which is inhibited by JH in Manduca sexta [2]. This indicates that the compound mimicked JH throughout the fifth instar, delaying or perhaps stopping the rise of Ecdysteroid (20E) levels to significently enough above the JH level to cause the commitment pulse. The insect relies on high levels of JV throughout its lifespan before dropping at the end of the fourth instar and remaining low throughout the rest of the existence while 20E causes significent development throughout the fifth larval phase and the pupal stage [1]. By administering a compound that mimics JH, we raised the level to which 20E must rise to create the commitment pulse that triggers the pupal stage. Therefore, the treatment caterpillars were not able to reach pupation or begin pupating within the same time-frame of the controll group. 

Our predictions of size difference were not proven. We were unable to reject the null hypothesis that there was no significent disparity in weight between treated and untreated Manduca sexta. In a Two-Sample T-Test, P-values were far above the 5% value that would indicate a significent difference between the sizes of the groups. 

It appears that while JH amounts of 1% or greater, administered daily, may significently affect size of the caterpillars [3], our experiment’s quantity (3%) and frequency (treatment administered every two days) did not produce size disparity among Manduca sexta. However, our experiment corroborates that administration of excess JH via IGR has an effect on the rate at which Manduca sexta caterpillars pupate and develop [2,3].
