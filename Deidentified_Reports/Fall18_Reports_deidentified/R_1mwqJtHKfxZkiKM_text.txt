Title: The Amount of Photosynthetic Activity of Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica Chloroplasts in Light and Dark Conditions

Abstract:
In this lab Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica isolated chloroplasts were tested for their amount of photosynthetic activity in light and dark conditions. We hypothesized that the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts would have the highest amount of photosynthetic activity. The photosynthetic activity was measured through adding DCPIP to the isolated chloroplasts and finding the absorbance with a spectrophotometer. DCPIP was used, because it blocks the transfer of electrons from photosystem II to plastoquinone. These two protein complexes are key components in the electron transport chain in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis happens through the oxidation and reduction of molecules to transfer electrons and harvest sunlight energy to produce glucose. Because Spinacia oleracea has chlorophyll b, which is a more efficient type of chlorophyll used in shade plants, it had a significently higher amount of photosynthetic activity in both light and dark conditions.   


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the way in which autotrophs use the energy from sunlight to produce glucose. This production of glucose allows the plant to harvest the energy from glucose and produce ATP in a process called cellular respiration. Plants undergo this process through multiple oxidation and reduction reactions as well as an electron chain in which the electrons stored from the multitude of oxidation and reduction reactions are transported through protein complexes. Photosynthesis happens in three stages. The first two are called the light dependent reactions in  which the electrons used in the electron transport chain are generated. The first occurs in photosystem II in which the absorbed light energy causes excited electrons to move from chlorophyll to plastoquinone. Plastoquinone then transfers its electrons to cytochrome f, reduced cytochrome f then transfers its electrons to plastocyanin [Gorman: 1965]. Plastocyanin then transfers its electrons to photosystem I which uses light energy to transfer electrons from chlorophyll to make NADPH from NADP+. These oxidation and reduction reactions allow for the movement of free protons across the thylakoid membrane. This proton gradient allows for the powering of ATP synthase to bond ADP and inorganic phosphate. From knowing this process, we can measure photosynthetic activity by inhibiting the movement of electrons from photosystem II to plastoquinone. This inhibition is caused by a reagent called DCPIP [Noorudeen: 1982]. The goal of the experiment was to test whether different species of plants one that grows best in the light, and one that grows best in the shade, have different amounts of photosynthetic activity in light and dark conditions. In this lab we used Spinach or (Spinacia oleracea) and kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellica). We used these species because they are similar in most aspects beside the fact that spinach prefers to grow in the dark and kale prefers to grow in the sunlight. We hypothesize that if isolated spinach chloroplasts are placed in both light and dark conditions, then they will have a higher amount of photosynthetic activity than the kale chloroplasts. 


Materials and Method:
To begin we cooled a mortar and pestle, beaker, and 6 50 Ml centrifuge tubes. Then we removed the large veins from our provided kale and spinach leaves and we rinsed the remaining parts with water and dried the excess water. Then we ground the spinach leaves and added 10 Ml of grinding buffer. We then added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer and strained the paste with cheesecloth. We then transferred the liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200XG for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. Then we spun this liquid at 1000XG for 10 minutes at 10 degrees celsius.  We discarded the liquid and added 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and mixed it with a transfer pipette. We then did this same procedure for the kale leaves. Then we placed 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer in test tube 1 (blank). Then in test tube 2 we placed 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml and Reaction Buffer. Then in tubes 3-6 we added 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 0.1 Ml of enriched spinach chloroplasts. In tubes 7-10 we placed 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 0.1 Ml of kale enriched chloroplasts. We then blanked the spectrophotometer using the contents of test tube 1. Then we found the absorbances of all other test tubes. The we placed all test tubes in full sunlight for ten minutes. Then we found the absorbances of test tubes 2-10 after using test tube 1 to blank. We then placed all tubes in a dark cabinet for ten minutes. Then after the incubation we found the absorbances of all samples after blanking with test tube 1. We then conducted a t_test to test the significance of our results. 


Results:
In order to find whether different species of plants one that grows best in the sunlight, and one that grows best in the shade, have different amount of photosynthetic activity in light and dark conditions, we found the absorbances of each test tube as averaged them. The general trend  we found was that the spinach chloroplasts has a statistically significent lower absorbance than the kale chloroplasts in the light (Figure 1) (p- value 0.050) and dark conditions (Figure 2)(p_value 0.036). Figure 1 shows that the spinach chloroplasts had an average absorbance of 0.011nm which correlates which a high amount of photosynthetic activity. While the kale chloroplasts had a much higher average absorbance at 0.256 nm, which correlates to a low amount of photosynthetic activity compared to the spinach chloroplasts. Figure 2 shows that is dark conditions a similar trend followed meaning that the spinach chloroplasts had a statistically significent lower average absorbance than the kale chloroplasts meaning that spinach had a higher amount of photosynthetic activity in dark conditions. 


Discussion:
Based on the statistical analysis conducted, the alternate hypothesis was accepted due to the low p values of 0.036 and 0.050. Because the p_values were lower than 0.05, we can conclude that the results were due to the change in the species of chloroplasts used in the experiment. Our biological hypothesis is also supported by this data.  Spinach had the highest amount of photosynthetic activity in both conditions due to the higher concentration of chlorophyll b in its chloroplasts. Chlorophyll b is a type of chlorophyll that shade plants have as a adaptation for capturing low intensity light or blue light [ Kitajima: 2003]. This type of chlorophyll leads to more photosynthetic activity due to the increased synthesis of not only light capturing chlorophyll but also proteins that aid in the electron transport chain. This leads to increased electron transport rates in the electron transport chain [Biswal: 2012]. This increased movement of electrons in the electron transport chain explains the significently low absorbances of the spinach chloroplasts, because the DCPIP was reduced by the high amount of electron flow and therefore decolorized. To further this study, one could artificially synthesize chlorophyll b in a lab and inject high intensity light plants and test the change in photosynthetic activity and photosynthetic rate. Another route would be to test the carbon dioxide output of the chloroplasts and instead of finding the absorbance. This would measure overall photosynthetic activity not just the electron movement. Further study should be done on this subject due to its importance to the agriculture industry. Chlorophyll b could potentially help farmers increase their yield and help the food deserts around the world.
