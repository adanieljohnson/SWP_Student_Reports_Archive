Title: Effects of 2% Sevin Solution on Contractions in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Frogs 

Abstract:
Muscle contraction is primarily caused by the release of acetylcholine and the subsequent release of Ca+2 into the actin-myosin complex. Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyses acetylcholine in order to stop muscle contraction. This experiment examines the effect of 2% sevin solution (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) on the time in between peak contractions in frog legs. We hypothesized that the sevin solution would decrease the amount of time between contractions as the inhibited acetylcholinesterase would be unable to hydrolyze the acetylcholine and therefore prevent the muscle from relaxing. We tested this by stimulating the gastrocnemus muscle with different frequencies, injecting the legs with sevin and then stimulating the muscle with the same frequencies. The data showed no significent difference in the times between contractions. This is likely due to a fault in the experimental set up, however, another experiment would be required to test if our unexpected results are replicable.  

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are made up of thousands of myofibers, cylindrical, multinuclear, fused aggregates of cells [Johnson: 2018]. Contraction in skeletal muscles begins with nerve impulses that arrive at the neuromuscular junctions in individual myofibers, causing a release of Acetylcholine [Johnson: 2018]. The Acetylcholine binds to receptors in the muscles which open sodium channels that create action potentials ultimately leading to the release of Ca+2 [Johnson: 2018]. Ca+2 causes a conformational change in the actin-myosin complex which allows myosin heads to bind to actin which allows for muscle contraction [Sadava: 2017]. Contraction continues while ATP and Calcium ions are present. In order for contraction to stop, acetylcholinesterase removes acetylcholine from its binding site and hydrolyses it, closing the sodium channels [Soreq: 2001]. The closing of the sodium channels then leads to Ca+2 leaving the system, which causes contraction to stop [Soreq: 2001]. In this experiment, three frog legs are given multiple stimuli of varying frequencies before and after receiving an injection of sevin solution which blocks acetylcholinesterase. We have hypothesized that injecting the frog leg with sevin will cause a shorter lapse of time between muscle contractions when the leg is stimulated.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were placed into a dissecting pan. The skin was removed, and the Gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the rest of the leg. Then the sciatic nerve was freed from its connecting tissue and attached to the electrodes. The Gastrocnemius muscle was then hung from the force transducer by a string. The legs were given stimuli with frequencies of 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 Hz and a myogram was recorded for each. After the data was recorded, a 2% sevin solution was injected into each of the Gastrocnemius muscles. The legs were then given stimuli with frequencies of 2, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 Hz and a myogram was recorded for each. A paired T-test was used for the statistical analysis of all three of the frog legs.

Results:
A paired T-test showed that there was no significent difference of contraction time before and after an injection of sevin solution. The averages for the controll were 500ms, 250ms, 193.33ms, 88.33ms, 63.33ms, 0ms, 0ms, for 2Hz, 4Hz, 5Hz, 10Hz, 15Hz, 20Hz, 25Hz respectively. The averages for the experimental were 501.67ms, 250ms, 196.67ms, 91.67ms, 65ms, 15ms, 0ms, for 2Hz, 4Hz, 5Hz, 10Hz, 15Hz, 20Hz, and 25Hz respectively [figure 1]. This resulted in a p_value of .12

Discussion:
We hypothesized that after the frog legs were injected with sevin solution, there would be a decrease in the amount of time between peak contractions when a stimulus was added. This is because sevin is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which means that it prevents acetylcholinesterase from hydrolyzing acetylcholine [Soreq: 2001]. If acetylcholine remains bound to its receptor, sodium channels will remain open and the muscle will continue contracting [Soreq: 2001]. However, our results showed that there was no significent difference before and after the injection. There are several possibilities as to why the sevin solution had no effect. The sevin could have been denatured in some way before it was injected, it could have been injected into the wrong place. There is also the chance that we did not wait long enough before injecting the solution, which means the sevin solution may not have had enough time to act in the muscle before out testing. Other people in earlier labs ran similar experiments to ours and saw a difference in the time between contractions (the legs would reach tetany at lower Hertz after sevin injection). Therefore, the next step would be to repeat the same experiment to determine whether or not there was a mistake made while testing.
