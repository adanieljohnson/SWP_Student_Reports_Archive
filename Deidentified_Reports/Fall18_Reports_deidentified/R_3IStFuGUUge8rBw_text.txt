Title: Aggression levels of the Betta splendins compared to size of potential competitor 

Abstract:
Male Betta splendins are known for the aggression towards others of their species. This is due to their need to maintain their territories to ensure reproductive success. my group hypothesized that the size of the Betta splendins will affect the aggression levels displayed by each betta fish being observed when they feel a threat within their territories. This meaning the Betta splendins of similar size will display more aggression than if they were to be one large and small fish competing. To test this, we obtained six male bettas and for five minutes had each fish exposed to a fish of similar size and then of a fish of a different size (either smaller, larger or average size). The observations were recorded in thirty second intervals and later quantified in rankings of 0-6 to differentiate levels of aggression. the results showed to have significance. This meaning our hypothesis was supported, there is a correlation between the size of the betta fish competitor and of the level of aggression that will be displayed. This can be essential information to have a better understanding on what characteristics are needing to be passed down in the betta species in order for the betta obtain fitness and reproductive success within the species. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendins are known for their color changing displays along with their facing and broadside movements and other levels of aggression. This being due to the threat of competitors within their territory. Their intraspecific behavior is to ensure their reproductive success and maintain the territory to do so [Johnson:2016]. It is essential for the male betta fish to establish their territory where females can lay their eggs in, and to do so they need to be more aggressive and pass on that trait to their offspring to ensure their success. this propensity towards aggression led to artificial selection and sexual selection to have the most aggressive and more successful betta in the end [Snekser:2006]. Based on this my group wanted to see if there was anything in specific, like size or another physical trait that could potentially trigger various levels of aggression for a betta fish. Therefore, we hypothesized that the size of the Betta splendins will affect the aggression levels displayed by each betta fish being observed when they feel a threat within their territories. This meaning the Betta splendins of similar size will display more aggression than if they were to be one large and small fish competing. 

Materials and Method:
My group obtained 6 male Betta splendins. Two are relatively large, two were average sizes, and two were relatively small. First, we observed each fish’s behavior while being separated from each other with glass and with a white plastic to prevent them from seeing each other in the beginning. We then removed the white plastic from in between the two large fish but still leaving the glass barrier and for five minutes their behaviors were recorded in thirty-second intervals. Afterwards they were allowed a resting period of five minutes and the same process was done for the two average size fishes and the two small fishes. After allowing all the fish to have a resting period they were then observed how they would behave with different size fish. First, we removed the white plastic from in between the large and small fish and observed for five minutes and behavior recorded for thirty second intervals, afterwards allowing a rest period. The same process was done for the large and average sizes, and average and small. The levels of aggression were recorded based on levels that my group categorized; 0= no reaction and normal behavior, 1= pelvic fin flickering, 2= dorsal fin, 3= tail beating, 4=tail flashing, 5= red mane exposed, 6= red mane and taping on the glass indicating the desire to attack. After quantifying the levels of aggression an Anova test was conducted to verify if there was a significance in the results.

Results:
The results are shown to be significent (p value= 0.000144). there was a correlation between size of the betta and the levels of aggression. Based on the data shown in figure 1., there seems to be more aggression towards the betta fish that is of similar size than if it is much larger or smaller. 

Discussion:
	The hypothesis was supported. The results showed to be significent (p value= 0.000144), meaning that the size of the betta did have an effect their levels of aggression displayed.  As shown on figure 1., there seemed to be more aggression towards the betta fishes of similar size meaning there was more threat to them and need for competition than if it were a small fish and large fish were together. Peeke, et. Al [1970] seemed to have similar results in that the fish they observed distributed groups and the total display measure, and the results were that responses habituate more rapidly in the distributed group [Peeke: 1970]. Meaning that the groups with a larger difference overtime habituate and do not find harm in those smaller or larger fish and don’t display aggression as often, this potentially supporting our hypothesis. Some places of error that could have affected our results are with the selection in the size variation the betta fish, there were no drastically larger or smaller fish when choosing them for the experiment. Meaning they were all relatively similar in size and the results could have been more obvious or different had the sized been evidently different. The experiment helped display the betta fish’s natural intraspecific agnostic behavior and how they are territorial in order to help ensure reproductive success. this is due to the need for male betta fish to establish territories where they can build nests for the females to lay their eggs in [Snekser:2006]. Paternal care by the males is essential for the eggs, if male is removed, the eggs fail to develop or hatch [Johnson:2016]. This experiment is essential in explaining how reproductive success is achieved among the species of Betta splendins as well as what characteristics are favored for a betta to have in order to be considered fit and successful within the betta species. It also can help explain the evolutionary success of the aggression traits. In previous studies it has been shown that the aggressive displays in B. splendins are an honest indicator of male condition and/or motivation [Doutrelant: 2001]. More experiments testing levels of aggression can help further explain their intraspecific behavior.
