Title: Prolonged Juvenile State in Manduca Sexta due to methoprene in IGR 

Abstract:
Development in Eukaryotic Organisms is purely hormone driven. The release and inhibition of hormones determines the difference between a juvenile and an adult. In this experiment, the organism studied was the Tobacco Hornworm, also known as the Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta is a caterpillar that relies on the release of a hormone, called Juvenile Hormone(JH) in order to develop from the first instar all the way through pupation. In our experiment we were able to separate eight caterpillars into two groups of four: one Control and one Experimental. Over the span of eight days we were able to observe the larva, which spanned from 0.9g to 4.3g in initial weight, and then record their reaction to being fed with food that either contained diluted water or an Insect Growth Regulator. The controll group was fed with ten grams of food infused with six drops of diluted water. The experimental group was fed ten grams of food infused with the IGR called Martin’s IGR, which has a dilution of 1: 1250. The one-tailed T-Test did not yield statistical significance due to a p_value lower than 0.05, the p_value of the one-tailed T-test for weight was 0.003438. At the conclusion of the experiment, the null hypothesis was refuted but the Martin’s IGR treatment actually prolonged JH secretion which 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is caterpillar that is the focus of this experiment. During this experiment, we were able to identify the Manduca Sexta’s dependence on hormones during development. Manduca sexta caterpillars rely on both Ecdysterone which affects timing of each molt and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which affects the type of molt into which the caterpillar will develop. The Manduca sexta’s dependence on the secretion of both Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone makes it the perfect model organism because their growth, our dependent variable, is directly affected due to their dependence on these hormones. Our experiment focused on the JH as we used an Insect Growth Regulator called Martin’s IGR, which contained the chemical methoprene which is a Juvenile Hormone analog. As a result, consumption of Martin’s IGR by the insects is expected to increase the secretion of JH. We observed both an experimental group and a controll group and tried to determine what effect the IGR would have on the Manduca sexta larvae’s growth. This biological question becomes important because the effect of the IGR on the JH impacts when and if the Manduca sexta will leave the larval stage and pupate which is an important question especially when considering insecticides. K.H Hoffman and M.W. Lorenz wrote an article about the advances in using Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) as insecticides, mentioning that they contain JH analogs that mimic the properties of naturally synthesized JH and as a result these JH analogs force the insects to maintain a high level of JH which prevents them from pupating and leaving the larval stage [Hoffman: 1998]. As similarly seen in our experimental results, high levels of JH forces the pest to maintain its juvenile state until their bodies become so large they can no longer support the juvenile stage and this results in death. Consequentially, we hypothesized that when the caterpillars were exposed to Martin’s IGR that they would continue to grow without pupating until they reached death as their body could no longer support the juvenile stage.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups of four similarly sized larva, placed in isolated quarters and stored in an incubator at 25 degrees celsius with a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle.  Our experiment was completed by having two groups: one controll group and one experimental group, both composed of four Manduca sexta Caterpillars per group. Each group was fed 10g of food. The Experimental group was fed 10g of food containing 6 drops of Martins IGR, which had a dilution of 1: 1250.  The controll group was fed 10g of food containing 6 drops of diluted water. The larva were only fed again with 10g of food with diluted water or Martin’s IGR, respectively, when they ran out of food. Every day for nine days, each group was weighed, observations were recorded and then they were placed back in the incubator. The statistical tests used was a two sample one tailed t_test in order to compare the change in weight of the experimental and controll groups. The change in weight of each group was used as a measure of growth in order to compare the development of the two groups.

Results:
Throughout this experiment, the general trend in weight of the Experimental group was steadily increasing. The general trend in weight change in the Control group was also steadily increasing until around Day 5 when their weights decreased. Overall, many of the larva remained a blue and green color, throughout the experiment.  Between days 4 and 7 we started to notice that the Experimental group started to become very swollen. We also observed that by the end of the experiment, the experimental group weighed more than the controll group. The experimental group larva were much larger than the Control group by the end of the experiment. By the ninth day recording their weights, the controll group had one subject that had pupated. As shown in Figure 1, throughout the entire span of the experiment, the experimental group had an average change in weight of 7.365 +/-1.76 grams. Also shown in Figure 1, throughout the entire span of the experiment, the controll group had an average change in weight of 2.49 +/- 1.66g. The average change in weight of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group as the p_value was less than 0.05 (t_stat = 4.030, d.f. = 6, P = 0.003438).

Discussion:
Based on the data displayed in Figure 1, the trends of the experimental group and the controll group can be explained through biological statements.  Our null hypothesis was be refuted due to the data being statistically significently different and our hypothesis was supported as the results did match our predictions . As a result, the observations and data suggested that the Experimental group, which was fed with Martin’s IGR, were much larger than the Control group and they became more swollen towards the end of the experiment. The Experimental group also remained in the juvenile larval stage while the Control group commitment pulsed and pupated on or before day nine, as predicted. This can be explained by the fact that the Experimental group’s exposure to Martin’s IGR had to increase and prolong the elevated levels of JH in the experimental group as they remained in the larval stage, while the controll group pupated. The fact that the controll group pupated while the Experimental group remained in the larval stage, confirms that the JH analog methoprene in Martin’s IGR prolonged the high levels of JH, seen in juvenile pests. Our hypothesis was supported because we predicted that the exposure to and consumption of Martin’s IGR would maintain the high levels of JH hormone and the Manduca sexta larva would not ever pupate. Due to our hypothesis being supported and the data being statistically significent  allows for us to make conclusions using biological explanation for the observed results. The published review of IGR’s being used in insecticides by Hoffman, support our evidence as Hoffman described how JH analogs are being used in insecticides and how the JH analogs have the same functions as typical Juvenile Hormone [Hoffman 1998]. When exposed to these JH analogs, the insects experience prolonged and constant levels of JH which forces them to remain in the Juvenile stage as the elevated and prolonged JH hormone levels prevent them from commitment pulsing for pupation. Similarly, Martin’s IGR, which contains the JH analog methoprene,  functions the same way and prolongs the high levels of JH hormone in insects which prevents the pests from developing past the larval stage. This result is important in the world because the effect of the JH analogs in IGRs has the ability to completely disrupt the developmental process , a very important process in life.
