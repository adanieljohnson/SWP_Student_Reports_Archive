Title: Effects of Calcium on Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
In animals and most organisms, muscle contraction permits movement. This contraction occurs due to electrical stimulation via the nervous system. Within muscle, calcium ions permit contraction as a direct result of the electrical charge. In this experiment we tested the effect of additional calcium in a frog leg’s gastrocnemius muscle to determine if it resulted in a more intense contraction. Based on the results of the experiment, the calcium created a statistically significant effect on the intensity of contraction in the muscle. The hypothesis was supported through a paired t-test having p values of less than 0.05.

Introduction:
Most forms of movement by animals is done by the contraction of muscles . The contraction of the muscles is done by stimulating these muscles with an electrical charge. When this contraction occurs, movement occurs. In a lab, a muscle can be stimulated by placing metal electrodes into the muscles fiber and applying a charge. A force transducer can then be used to measure the force exerted by the muscle contracting. Using the data from the transducer, a myogram is produced[Johnson,2016]. In this process of contraction, calcium is necessary to stimulate the muscle. Calcium ions are generally considered to be the activator of the contractile system[ S. Ebashi, M. Endo. 2003]. Meaning, without calcium the muscle cannot produce a contractile response. This is a physiological fact about the muscle system, but what factor does concentration of calcium ions play in muscle contraction? It has been found that tension is related to the Ca ion concentration within plants[ S. Ebashi, M. Endo. 2003]. That essentially means that the concentration of the calcium in muscle directly correlates to the intensity of a contraction. Based on this knowledge of the importance of calcium on contraction, we speculate that an increased presence of calcium will allow for a more intense contraction that occurs more quickly when stimulated. In order to test this assumption, we will experiment on the gastrocnemius muscle of frog legs. This would make an optimal vessel for the experiment as the legs are relatively easy to acquire and are easy to manipulate. Using the frog legs, we will test on the abundance of calcium and its contraction by testing an unchanged leg then injecting the same leg with excess calcium ions. We hypothesize that the increase in calcium will result in an increase in contraction intensity in the frog leg.

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the experiment in testing the effects of calcium, two frog legs will be used. Each leg will be tested on its initial strength of contraction, then each will be injected with the calcium ions and tested again. The initial test of contraction will act as the control while the same leg injected will be the treatment. First the legs were degloved(removed skin) as to expose the Gastrocnemius muscle and the Sciatic nerve; the muscle and nerve that are being stimulated. With scissors, the muscle is severed on one side from the leg. Using pins, the leg is laid down and the severed end of the muscle is tied to the hook of the transducer. Next, the electrodes from the unit controlled by LabScribe are placed in contact with the Sciatic nerve, which is responsible for muscle stimulation. Using the LabScribe software, the muscle is then stimulated with a charge and the data is recorded. After recording 5 trials of contraction for each leg, the muscle is injected with calcium and the procedure is repeated. This data will be used to conduct a paired T-Test to determine if the calcium injection created a significant difference in contraction. We will test with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
Through the experiment, the control group of the first leg exhibited an average contraction of 1.026 while after the treatment the leg had an average of 2.7; an average more than double the control. The second leg underwent the same procedure, however with different values due to the uniqueness of each leg. The second leg had a control and treatment average of 0.0926 and 0.212, respectively. In figure 1, the average contraction of both legs’ control and treatment measurement have been displayed. Numbers 1 and 2 represent the first legs control and treatment contraction, respectively; as well as the second legs control and treatment contraction as 3 and 4, respectively. Leg 1’s test yielded a t-value of 8.695 and a p value of 0.0010. Leg 2 yielded a t-value of 24.147 and a p-value of ˂0.0001. 

Discussion:
The purpose in this experiment was to determine whether the increase in calcium in a frog leg’s muscle would make it contract with more force. This is a valuable experiment because it allows us to observe the significance of the presence of calcium in muscular structures as well as the effects of increased concentrations of calcium ions. Based on our paired t-tests for leg 1 and 2,we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence suggesting that the presence of additional calcium made the Gastrocnemius muscle contract more intensely. The data shown in Figure 1 also supports this conclusion as the additional calcium more than doubled the average contraction of both legs. Through these results, it is fair to conclude that increased presence of calcium in a muscular system will increase the intensity of contraction. This is likely because calcium ions act as a trigger of contraction, thus makes logical sense that an increase in calcium concentration would increase the intensity of contraction[ S. Ebashi, M. Endo, 2003]. Although the experiment was statistically successful, continuous experimentation with frog legs under a more specific hypothesis could further increase the accuracy and strength of the experiment and its results.
