Title: Effect of temperature on Spinacia oleracea chloroplast light dependent reactions activity 

Abstract:
In this experiment we tested the effects of temperature on the photosynthetic ability of chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea. Photosynthesis occurs in two distinct stages, the light dependent process and the light independent process. The light dependent process provides energy for the light independent process to produce sugars for respiration. By measuring the activity of the light dependent process the rate of photosynthesis for chloroplasts, activity in different environments can be compared. In this experiment, we compared the photosynthetic activity of samples in a warm environment (36oC), at room temperature (23oC), and in a cold environment (-2oC) to test temperature’s effect on the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesized that at higher temperatures the electron transport chain and its integral photosystems will be more active resulting in more proton transport and reduction at the end of the chain due to an increase likelihood of collisions of reactant molecules within the sample. In colder conditions, molecules move around at a slower rate resulting in fewer collisions and a slower rate of reaction. If more photosynthesis took place, more reduction of our marker molecule DCPIP to DCPIPH2 would occur indicating photosynthesis. this hypothesis was rejected

Introduction:
In this lab, we will be testing the activity of the light dependent reactions in chloroplasts obtained from Spinacia oleracea or spinach leaves at both warm and cool temperatures. The structures necessary for photosynthesis begin breaking down around 40oC and will be destroyed by freezing, so temperatures in this experiment will be kept below 40oC, however the test tubes will not be left in the cold bath long enough to destroy chloroplasts by freezing [Berry:1980]. Chloroplasts undergo photosynthesis, the process by which water and CO2 are converted to sugar and O2 in the presence of light. The light in the reaction drives photosystems I and II by exciting electrons allowing them to move on in the electron transport chain, activating a proton pump after being excited in photosystem II then moving on to photosystem I to reduce NADP to NADPH. These systems usually provide energy for the light independent reaction to function by creating a proton gradient to drive ATP synthase and carrying electrons in NADPH [Sakai]. We can study how active the light dependent reactions are in a chloroplast by measuring how actively photosystem I is at adding protons to a target molecule. This activity can be compared to the activity of other samples of isolated photosynthetic material to determine what conditions may affect the activity of these systems. The activity of these light dependent reactions is important to study because these processes can affect the rate photosynthesis as a whole. To study how actively photosystem I is reducing molecules, DCPIP is introduced. DCPIP is a molecule that will also accept protons from Photosystem I just as NADP does, however, DCPIP is a blue molecule that absorbs maximally at 600 nanometers while its reduced form, DCPIPH2, is clear [Sakai]. By measuring the absorbance of the sample at 600 nm, it can be observed how much DCPIP has changed DCPIPH2. This means that as chloroplast activity occurs, DCPIP will change to DCPIPH2 which will cause absorbance to decrease. With more activity in the electron transport chain, less absorbance will occur. Higher absorbance signals less activity in the light dependent systems of the sample. A spectrophotometer will be used to measure the absorbance in each sample by shining monochromatic light at a set wavelength through a sample then recording how much of this light is able to penetrate to the other side of the sample. This can be related to the relative quantity of DCPIP molecules in the solution absorbing the light on its way through. We believe that at higher temperatures the electron transport chain will be more active due to more collisions with water to steal electrons from at the beginning of the chain and increased frequency of collisions with DCPIP at the end of the chain to give these electrons too. This will lead to DCPIP more frequently being converted to DCPIPH2 due to an increase in available electrons at the end of the chain and DCPIP to pick them up. The enzymes that oxidize and reduce these molecules at the beginning and end of the electron transport chain and the enzymes within the chain will also have increased reaction rate in hotter environments [Parker]. In colder conditions, molecules move around at a slower rate resulting in fewer collisions and a slower rate of reaction, slowing the photosynthetic process. We hypothesize that absorbance will be lower for samples kept in a warmer environment due to DCPIPH2 being synthesized at a quicker rate by the light dependent reactions in the heat and a slower in the cold. 


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we obtained 5 spinach leaves from which we removed the stem and large veins. We then washed the leaves under tap water and dried them. We then ground the leaves with 10 mL of 400 mM sucrose in tricine buffer (pH 8), also known as grinding buffer, in a mortar and pestle that had been packed on ice to cool. When only a paste was left we mixed in 10 more mL of grinding buffer then strained the paste through 3 layers of cheesecloth. We then added this solution to a 50 ml centrifuge tube which we rotated in a centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4oC, making sure the centrifuge was balanced. When this run was finished, we transferred the liquid from the centrifuge tube to a second, identical, tube, making sure not to transfer the solid pellet that formed at the bottom of the first tube. We then rotated the second centrifuge tube at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4oC. We saved the pellet at the bottom of this second centrifuge tube while discarding the liquid on top. After this we added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet to rehydrate it and mixed them together. We then obtained and labeled 13 test tubes 1-13. We then grouped these tubes into four groups and a blank. Tube 1 is the blank, tubes 2-4 are group 1, tubes 5-7 are group 2, tubes 8-10 are group 3, and tubes 11-13 are group 4. We made the blank tube with 8 mL of water, 2 mL of reaction buffer. Next, we created the rest of the groups by adding 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCPIP (130 mM), and 2 mL of reaction buffer to every tube that wasn’t the blank. We then prepared a hot bath at 36oC and an ice bath at -2oC. We monitored these with a thermometer until they reached the appropriate temperature. We put these bathes in locations where we could situate a heat lamp directly above the bath. We created a third area where we could put the groups 1 and 2 at room temperature (23oC) in a rack with a lamp above them. We then set the spectrophotometer to 600 nm. Finally, we added 100 ul of fluid from the centrifuge tube we rehydrated the pellet in into every tube except those of group 1. We then placed some of mixture from the blank into a spectrophotometry tube then used it to set the blank. 1 by 1 we placed the samples into spectrophotometry tubes and ran spectrophotometry on them and record their absorbance. We then placed the blank and groups 1 and 2 on the rack in open air, starting a timer for 10 minutes. We then placed group 3 in the hot bath and started a 10-minute timer. Then we placed group 4 in an ice bath and started a 10-minute timer. When each timer finished we checked absorbance of each tube again in spectrophotometer, recorded results, then return the groups to the proper environment and restarted the timer. The blank does not need to be reset if it is still set from the first run. We repeated this process until 30 minutes total had passed, taking last spectrophotometry reading at the 30-minute mark. We recorded all the data then ran an ANOVA test on results, comparing the difference between the means of each of our runs. The alpha value is .05 and there are three degrees of freedom. We then furthered our statistical analysis by using a Tukey Kramer Post-Hoc Analysis to find if there was any deviation in the means of the groups.



Results:
From an ANOVA test with three degrees of freedom and an alpha of .05 we find that the f-ratio value is 0.80486 and The p-value is 0.514973. this p is above the alpha of .05 making these results not significant. 
	Standard deviation of the mean is used to create the error bars on figure 1 to represent the area in which the results for the data deviated showing the accuracy of the representation.

Tukey Kramer Post-Hoc analysis found no difference in the means of the groups


Discussion:
We hypothesized that at higher temperature more activity would occur in the light dependent reaction process allowing for more DCPIP to be reduced indicating that more photosynthetic activity occurred. However, with our P value of .514973 our data is considered statistically insignificant meaning our hypothesis was rejected. The P value must be below .05 for data to be considered significant. Our data measuring the light absorption of DCPIP at 600 nm. When DCPIP is converted to DCPIPH2 less DCPIP is available to absorb light, lowering absorbance. We expected to see lower absorbance in the conditions we thought would favor light dependent reaction activity however this was not the case. As is displayed in figure 1 all the samples that had both chloroplast and DCPIP added had near identical mean absorbances at each time interval, following a similar path on the chart. We can see in the figure there was activity in the light dependent reaction because the sample with no chloroplasts added had a significantly higher mean absorbance at every time interval then the other groups. While this control’s mean absorbance did go down over time this is most likely due to the DCPIP spontaneously forming DCPIPH2 on its own heading towards equilibrium, it was nowhere near the enzyme catalyzed reactions occurring in the other samples. While reactions usually occur at a slower rate in colder conditions, our data does not show this to be the case in the light dependent reactions in the chloroplast. Some studies find temperature has an effect on photosynthetic rate, with increased temperature to a point causing greater photosynthesis [Gaastra:1959][Jones:1973]. However, these studies were conducted on the whole plant, not just the light dependent portion of the photosynthetic process. Other sources suggest that the light dependent reaction is not affected by temperature [Rechitt]. This can be explained by the light dependent reaction having to wait on electrons to be moved through the electron transport chain. The reduced molecule is acquired faster than an electron is moved to the next electron carrier at the temperatures we are testing so the speed of this acquisition, what temperature would be mainly affecting, doesn’t matter. While in our experiment temperature did not affect photosynthetic rate in the light dependent reaction, if light became abundant, moving the electron along faster than the DCPIP can be bound, temperature could affect the reaction by changing the fluidity of the chloroplasts lipid membrane inhibiting access to the site of reduction [Nolan:1980]. In future studies this experiment should be repeated but put under a much more intense light for the duration to cause a scenario where temperature could be limiting. The absorbance of our cold samples may have been affected by the samples fogging up during the spectrophotometer run, this can be avoided by keeping the cold samples above 0oC.
