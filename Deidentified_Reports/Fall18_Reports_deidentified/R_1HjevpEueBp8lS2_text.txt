Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Signaling in Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleated slime mold that undergoes positive or negative chemotaxis in response to signals in its environment. In this experiment,  Physarum was induced with caffeine to determine if the additive would increase Physarum growth. Oatmeal-water agar plates were used as the controllled environment for experimentation. A two-tailed t_test was used to analyze data. Results indicated that caffeine did not increase Physarum growth. Due to defects in Physarum samples it is unclear whether results are conclusive to the true behavior of Physarum in the presence of caffeine. Further testing should be conducted to determine if results of this experiment reflect the accurate behavior of Physarum  in the presence of caffeine. 


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleate syncytium meaning it is a mass of multiple nuclei collectively known as plasmodium.  Plasmodium either undergoes positive or negative chemotaxis in response to signals in its environment. [Durham: 1976] The goal of this experiment is to identify how caffeine will affect chemotaxis in Physarum. In smooth muscle, caffeine inhibits the uptake or stimulating release of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Caffeine was found to cause similar characteristics in Physarum polycephalum. [Kukulies: 1983] Caffeine is a stimulant that inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) which is responsible for breaking down the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  [Smatresk: 1999] In normal conditions, PDE would inhibit the inactivation of cAMP, but in the presence of caffeine, PDE is is inhibited from breaking down cAMP--causing amplified effects in organisms. [Smatresk: 1999]  Plasmodial cAMP determines the rate of motor response of Physarum. [Block: 1998] We hypothesized that by adding caffeine to the Physarum, its growth would  increase and it would be more active in obtaining its food. This is due to the caffeine not allowing the cAMP to be broken down, and ultimately resulting to an increase in stimulation to the environment. 


Materials and Method:
Water-Agar Plates, Oatmeal, and 2 Ml of Caffeine were used to complete this experiment. Water-Agar Plates were soaked in an agonist and antagonist compound. Dilute 20x caffeine to 1x. 1 cm squares were drawn on top of the water agar plates. Then, 5 Ml of 1x caffeine was added to the 3 experimental water agar plates.3 squares were cut out of the controll petri dish ,using a spatula, and placed with the Physarum with oatmeal in a petri dish.  After 10 minutes,  excess solution (1x) was poured out of the 3 experimental petri-dishes and blotted with kimwipes to absorb the excess solution. One 1cm X 1cm square was cut into the 3 experimental petri dish using a spatula. Physarum was then placed into the square. 5-6 oats were added to the controll and experimental petri dishes. Then, the sides of the petri dishes were tapped and were places in a light resistant bag. Agar plates were checked 48 hours later to record growth. A two-tailed t_test was used for statistical analysis.


Results:
Although results were recorded, normal growth was defective. Trends indicate that data was not statistically significent. It was hypothesized that the experiment group would show accelerated growth in the presence of caffeine. Both groups failed to show significent growth. Statistical values are as follows: p_value: 0.472, t-value: 0.074, d.f. 4.

Discussion:
Physarum growth in the controll and experimental groups were statistically insignificent based on analysis from the two-tailed t_test. (Figure 1) Likewise, the controll group grew more than the experimental group refuting our hypothesis that caffeine-induced Physarum would result in an increase in mold growth. 

Due to the there being a defect in the Physarum sampled, it is possible that all samples were subject to limited growth. Therefore, results from this experiment would not reflect the true nature of Physarum in the presence of caffeine. Age Physarum samples would be an uncontrollled variable in this experiment--the age of Physarum samples at the time of experimentation could have generated abnormal results.

Previous experimentation determined that the the age of specific DNA strains of Physarum determines how well it is suited for laboratory experimentation. The strain of DNA specifies the mating type, plasmodial fusion, drug resistance, and temperature sensitivity can be affected. [Adler: 1974] Amoebae with aged strains of DNA resulted in poor germination and malfunction in spore formation. [Adler: 1974]  Another experiment found that with increasing age, the degree of synchrony between the nuclei of different plasmodia as well as among those within one plasmodium declined, and various stages of mitosis were often found within the same plasmodium. The intermitotic period increased as the cultures aged. [Guttes: 1961] 

Ideally, to determine the true effects of caffeine-induced Physarum this experiment would be replicated using younger Physarum samples.
