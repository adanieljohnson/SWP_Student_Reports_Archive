Title: Caffeine induced tetanus in gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The gastrocnemius muscle from the Rana pipiens, Northern Leopard Frog, was isolated to examine the impact of caffeine on calcium channels, neuromuscular control, and muscle contraction in skeletal muscles. Rana pipiens is a species native to the North Eastern United States and Eastern regions of Canada which was used successfully in this experiment due to its large gastrocnemius muscle. In this study, muscle contractions where recorded and analyzed through a relative change in amplitude (V) between two different scenarios. First the muscle was stimulated without the addition of caffeine and then the muscle was stimulated with the addition of a caffeine injection directly to the muscle. Caffeine was selected for this study because it is a stimulatory chemical which is known to interact with calcium channels and impact muscles. The change in amplitude was recorded using a Lab Works force transducer with pin electrodes. When the gastrocnemius muscle was stimulated after the addition of caffeine, the amplitude (V) was shown to have increased significantly. This can be seen in the p-values p-1.34E-9, p-1.25E-10, and p-6.33E-7 for the legs used.

Introduction:
Neuromuscular control is unique to the animal kingdom. Animals have nerves called motor neurons which carry electrical signals across their body and control movement along with other bodily functions. In order for the electrical signals carried by the motor neurons to reach the muscle and cause a contraction the motor neuron must release specific chemical including Calcium (Ca2+) into the neuromuscular junction; the connection between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell. The neuromuscular junction allows electrical impulses from the nervous system to create muscle contractions in animals. These muscle contractions are important for the survival of organisms because it allows them to escape danger, find food and water, reproduce, and perform other activities necessary for survival. In order to better understand muscle contraction, the skeletal muscles of Rana pipiens where studied by injecting the muscle with caffeine and stimulating contraction in the leg using electrical stimulus. Caffeine is a stimulatory chemical which causes calcium channels to open depolarizing the sarcoplasmic reticulum which then allows muscles to contract. This process was also studied in another paper which examined the effect of caffeine on Ca2+ channels and the muscle contractions in Rana pipiens [Shirokova: 1996]. We hypothesized that by injecting the muscle with caffeine, we would observe a significant increase in amplitude of the muscle contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs where prepared by first removing the skin and dissecting out the sciatic nerve. Then the tissue connecting the gastrocnemius muscle to the bone was separated and the Achilles tendon was cut. Finally, the Achilles tendon was tied to the Lab Works force transducer, the leg was pinned down to the dissecting plate, and pin electrodes where inserted into the gastrocnemius. Once the legs where prepared, the recording software was set up. The legs where then stimulated to find their twitch threshold by increasing the voltage until the recording software registered a contraction. Once the threshold was found, the voltage was increased by half a volt from the determined threshold to ensure that the threshold was met, 0.1ml of caffeine was injected into the muscle, and the muscle was stimulated again. Once all of the data was collected, the data was analyzed using a two-paired t-test.

Results:
When a change in amplitude occurred due to electrical stimulus after the caffeine injection, the muscles where observed to become hard and inflexible. Also, in this experiment it was found that when caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens the amplitude of the muscle contraction increases. In the first leg the difference between the pre and post injection amplitude was 0.3016V with a p-value of 1.34E-9, in the second leg the difference in amplitude was 0.9748V with a p-value of 1.25E-10, and in the third led the difference in amplitude was 0.6496 with a p-value of 6.33E-7 and this can be seen in figure 1. This data indicated that there was a significant increase in amplitude between the leg before it was injected with caffeine and after it was injected with caffeine. 

Discussion:
As the results indicated, there was a significant increase in the amplitude of muscle contractions in the legs after caffeine was injected. Thus, the null hypothesis can be rejected. This is likely due the fact that caffeine opens calcium channels in the skeletal muscle and increases the ability of a muscle to contract [Shirokova: 1996]. After the caffeine injection this contraction caused tetany, a maintained state of contraction. The article mentioned above examines this effect of caffeine on the Ca2+ channels [Shirokova: 1996]. When caffeine is introduced into the muscle tissue it causes a release of Ca2+. The Ca2+ floods the cells and causes depolarization of the sarcoplasmic reticulum which then causes muscle contraction. When caffeine is used the Ca2+ channels are activated and then forced to remain open thus preventing repolarization of the cell and creating a state permanent state of tetany [Shirokova: 1996]. The effect of caffeine on muscle contractions is significant because of the potential health implications this has for humans. The consumption of caffeinated drinks can have a negative impact on human health by altering the amount of Ca2+ available. Each time a muscle contracts Ca2+ is necessary, and by consuming large amounts of caffeine it is possible that blood calcium levels could be decreased as the Ca2+ channels are forced to stay open longer during contraction. This alters normal muscle contractions, other necessary biological functions, and can cause tetany. Studying Ca2+ channels helps us understand the importance of calcium and calcium channels in animals as well as the relationship between the motor neuron, neuromuscular junction, and the skeletal muscle cell. This information can be applied to humans and be used to improve health with respect to caffeine intake.
