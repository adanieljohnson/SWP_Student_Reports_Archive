Title: The Effect Shade Has on the Root to Shoot Ratio of Pisum sativun 

Abstract:
Root to shoot ratio is way to look at energy allocation in plants because in different environments plants grow differently. Pea plants, Pisum sativun, were looked at to see if shade had an effect on a plant's root to shoot ratio. Sunlight is a main source of energy plants use to grow. We hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of field peas will be different if they are grown in the sunlight versus shade. Two groups of three pots of 16 seeds were planted. One group was placed in the sun while the other was placed under a shading tarp. After two weeks the roots and shoots, for 12 plants from each group, were weighed (grams) and measured (centimeters). A two-tailed t_test on the average weights and lengths was used to determine the validity of our hypothesis. The T-tests showed that the average root to shoot ratio of weight and length were statistically significent, meaning that the root to shoot ratios for shaded and sun plants were different. The average weight and length root to shoot ratio was higher for plants grown in the sun versus the shade. These results lead to conclusions that the amount of sunlight does have an effect on the root to shoot ratio of field peas. 

Introduction:
Many factors contribute to the way that plants grow and how they express their phenotype, the expressed gene that you can see. Some of these factors are the nutrients in the soil, competing species in the area and energy sources. The main source of energy in plants is sunlight. Sunlight provides energy and food for the plant, which enables it to grow most successfully. In this experiment field peas, Pisum sativun, will be looked at to see the effect that sunlight has on the root to shoot ratio. The roots of a plant are the stringy parts under the ground and the shoots are characterized by the stems and leafs above the ground [Johnson: 2018]. Root to shoot ratios are good for analyzing the way that a plant grows because under different environments the same plant can grow differently. For example when the soil has a low nutrient content then the roots grow out farther trying to obtain the proper nutrients. A root to shoot ratio in a plant like this would have the roots being higher in length and weight than the roots in the plants with shorter roots that grew in nutrient rich soil. This experiment keeps all the soils the same, but alters a different aspect of growth, sunlight. Sunlight was chosen because past research shows that plants grow towards sunlight with hopes of increasing the allocation of resources. The average root to shoot ratio of field pea plants that grow in the sunlight versus the shade will be analyzed. It is supported in other literature that plants grow larger in the sun and their shoots tend to grow larger towards the sun [Harshbarger: 1971]. The root to shoot ratio is hypothesized to be different for the plants that grow in shade versus the plants that grow in the sun. 

Materials and Method:
Field peas were obtained and soaked. Then six pots with soil saturated with 100Ml of miracle grow fertilizer and water were obtained. All six pots were planted with sixteen field pea seeds that were soaked in water prior to lab. The seeds were then covered with soil and placed in the green house. Three were set under a shade tarp that was pre-existing in the greenhouse and three were set in direct sunlight. Each plant was watered with 100Ml of water every day. After two weeks, the plants were taken out of the green house and root to shoot ratios were taken. Each root was cut below the seed and each shoot was everything above it. The weights of roots and shoots were obtained in grams and the length of roots and shoots was obtained in centimeters. These ratios were then compared and analyzed using a two-tailed t_test and graphs.

Results:
Generally it was seen that the plants that were grown in the sun had a higher average root to shoot ratio than the plants grown in the shade, which can be found in both table and graphs one and two. The root to shoot ratio for weight was significently different in field pea plants that were shaded (d.f.=22; t=2.75; p=0.0120).The root to shoot ratio for weight was significently different in field pea plants that were grown in an area of shade 9d.f.=22; t=3.83; p=0.0092).

Discussion:
The root to shoot ratio in field pea plants that were grown in the shade versus plants that were grown in the sun was hypothesized to be different. This hypothesis was supported by our data and a two-tailed t_test. The data showed that the pea plants grown in the shade had a lower average root to shoot ratio in both weight and length than the plants grown in the sun (graph one and two). The data did show the two different environments of sunlight to be statistically different (p=0.012 for weight; p=0.0092). However, the data provided that the plants that grew in the shade had a lower root to shoot ratio which is not what is expected. It was seen in literature that the plants grown in the shade would have a higher average root to shoot ratio than the plants grown in the sun [Ammer: 2003]. This difference in our data could be due to the way that the shade was situated compared to the plants in the sun. In the green house, when the sun set it still shone on the plants that were in the shade box but not on the plants that were in the sun. This means that the plants in the shade experiment group were exposed to sunlight for longer hours in the day than the plants in the sun experiment group. Another problem that was faced was a hurricane that came and the plants could not get watered for three days. Not watering the plants could affect the growth rate as well [Harshbarger: 1971]. Over all this lab was successful in supporting our hypothesis that the two groups of field pea plants, ones grown in shade and ones grown in sunlight would have different average root to shoot ratios for both weight and length.

Figure Legends: 
Table one shows the data for the root to shoot ratio of shaded plants and sunlight plant's weight. 
Table two shows the data for the root to shoot ratio of shaded plants and sunlight plant's length. 
Graph one is a graph of the average root to shoot ratio for the length of field peas that were grown in the shade versus the run. It reflects that the average root to shoot ratio for plants grown in the sun light was higher than the peas grown in the sun. 
Graph two is a graph of the average root to shoot ratio of weight for pea plants grown in the sun and shade. It reflects that the average root to shoot ratio for the controll plant, sunlight, was higher than that of the treatment plant, shaded.
