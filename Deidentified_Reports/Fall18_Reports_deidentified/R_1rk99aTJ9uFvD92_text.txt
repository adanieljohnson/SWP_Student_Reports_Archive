Title: Effects of 20E Blockers on the Weight of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to introduce Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) to the diet of Manduca Sexta caterpillars and record how it comes into play with other hormones to affect their weight. One of the caterpillar’s main hormones is Ecdysterone (20E). It is part of the family of steroid hormones which is in charge of regulating the timing of molting during insect development. We hypothesize that if a 20E blocker is introduced to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet, then the Manduca will spend a longer time in it’s caterpillar stage and increase in weight. Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were chosen and divided into two groups of four each. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets. The caterpillars were monitored every other day for two weeks in order to record the weight (in grams) of each caterpillar and to replenish their food as needed. The group of caterpillars that had a control diet without the 20E blocked displayed a significant increase in weight while the treatment group of caterpillars who had the 20E blocker added to their diet showed a decrease in weight. Given the results, our hypothesis was not supported and we cannot infer that the 20E blocker causes an increase in weight by extending the Manduca Sexta’s caterpillar phase.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to introduce Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) to the diet of Manduca Sexta caterpillars and record how it comes into play with other hormones to affect their weight. One of the caterpillar’s main hormones is Ecdysterone (20E). It is part of the family of steroid hormones which is in charge of regulating the timing of molting during insect development. Before the commitment pulse, which indicates that the caterpillar is large enough to pupate and form a normal sized moth, there is a small rise in the 20E level. What would happen to the caterpillar’s weight if we could delay their commitment pulse? Since the “first step in the moulting process… is initiated by ecdysterone” [Jenkin and Hinton: 1996] [Wigglesworth: 1973], we will introduce an IGR that acts as a 20E blocker to the diet of these caterpillars. We hypothesize that if a 20E blocker is introduced to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet, then the Manduca will spend a longer time in it’s caterpillar stage and increase in weight. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were chosen and divided into two groups of four each. Each caterpillar was then placed into its own separate container. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets. Diet 1 was composed of 10 grams each of unaltered Manduca diet with five drops of water. Diet 2 was composed of 10 grams each of Manduca diet with five drops of the 20E blocker. The treatment caterpillars were all labeled with the numbers 1,2,3, and 4 while the control group caterpillars were labeled 1c,2c,3c, and 4c. Caterpillars 1c through 4c were the control group which were fed ‘Diet 1’ while caterpillars 1 through 4 were part of the experimental group and were fed ‘Diet 2’. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator in a 12 light:12 dark cycle. The caterpillars were monitored every other day for two weeks in order to record the weight (in grams) of each caterpillar and to replenish their food as needed. We computed the average initial and final weights for the caterpillars as well as standard deviation, mean change in weight and completed the one-tailed T test.


Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable pattern seen within both groups of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The group of caterpillars that had a control diet without the 20E blocked displayed a significant increase in weight as they started with a mean weight of 2.40g and ended with a mean weight of 8.28g. This means that there was a 245.82% increase in the weight of the control group. There was a standard deviation of P=0.03, which means that the data is relevant.On the other hand, the treatment group of caterpillars who had the 20E blocker added to their diet showed a decrease in weight. They started with an average 5.13g and ended with an average 4.37g. These results are significant because P=0.02. The one sample test resulted in a p-value of 1.52E-5.    

Discussion:
Given the results, our hypothesis has not been supported by the data and we cannot infer that the 20E blocker causes an increase in weight by extending the Manduca Sexta’s caterpillar phase. We did observe within the other groups that whenever the caterpillar got closer to the commitment pulse, their weight tended to decrease. We believed our results may have been skewed because our caterpillars in the treatment group were noticeably larger than the caterpillars in the control group. Previous experiments have shown that when a larva grows up to 5g, then it begins to decide when to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. Multiple caterpillars in our treatment group had a starting weight higher than 5g, which could have affected our results. Additionally, the treatment group caterpillars were of a dull earthy color (brown and green) while the control group caterpillars were of a bright green color. This leads us to believe that the treatment group caterpillars were in a more advanced larva stage than the caterpillars in the control group. With further testing, our results could potentially demonstrate that the 20E blocker led to a prolonged caterpillar phase after a decrease in weight.
