Title: Effects of dibutyryl-cAMP and Curcumin on Cell Signaling in  Physarum Polycephalum  

Abstract:

Physarum Polycephalum, commonly known as slime mold, is a multinucleate organism that is found in wet and dark environments and has similar intracellular signaling pathways as humans. An important G-protein pathway allows for activation of protein kinase A (PKA) which is involved in cell movement. Since dibutyryl-cAMP is an activator of PKA, and curcumin is an inhibitor of PKA, we predicted that Physarum tested in the presence of dibutyryl-cAMP would move further than the control while curcumin tested Physarum would move less than the control. All plates tested were predicted to move towards a light source, as the test organisms were expected to be well fed. The organisms were placed on potato water agar plates, covered in tin foil, and placed under a direct light source for observation. The hypothesis was tested over a period of 22 hours. The results compare the means of the experimental groups to the control conditions in order to determine if there is a key difference between the two conditions. Overall, the data show there is no difference in the means great enough to show significant statistical differences to the control. However, these results are due to procedural error and the faulty organism stock provided. 

Introduction:
Physarum Polycephalum, or slime mold, is a multinucleate syncytium that lives the majority of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage, as a yellow flat mass. It is often found in wet and dark environments such as decomposing leaves (Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual). When a stressor such as light is introduced, the organism begins its reproductive cycle which allows for the production of a mature organism called a plasmodium. Physarum responds to stimuli similarly to multicellular organisms, as their responses are controlled by an intracellular signal transduction pathway. Typically, a stimulus activates a protein receptor which causes the release of a second messenger. A second messenger is a molecule inside of the organism that binds to an effector to cause the organism to respond to the stimulus (Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual). The protein interaction in this experiment is through the G-protein complex which has two major pathways. This experiment focused on the cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediated pathway, or cAMP - mediated pathway, because of its utilization of the cAMP protein as a second messenger. In this pathway, a G-protein activates an effector enzyme called adenylate cyclase. This effector enzyme converts ATP into cAMP and allows for the diffusion of cAMP through the cell. cAMP often activates protein kinase A (PKA) which can then activate or inhibit other enzymes (Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual). Curcumin is an inhibitor of PKA which means that it slows or stops its function, while dibutyryl-cAMP activates PKA and can increase or hasten its functions.
The purpose of this experiment was to test how the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin would affect the motility of the Physarum. Physarum was used in this experiment because of its affordability and its large conglomerate size. It is favorable for observation because many cells are acting as one massive cell which allows for easier manipulation and observation. Furthermore, Physarum moves through the utilization of actin filaments, similar to how humans operate, which allows for comparison to the effects of this experiment on movement in humans. 
A study found that the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP affects certain cellular functions depending on the specific cell type and biological responses to the signal (Mei et al.). Physarum was tested under phototaxis because of its preference for darkness, under normal conditions, a small portion of the plasmodium will most likely move away from the light which is negative phototaxis. The remaining plasmodium, may move towards the light which is considered positive phototaxis. We determined whether the addition of PKA inhibitors or activators would yield positive or negative phototaxis by measuring the distance and direction of  Physarum migration toward or away from a light source, allowing the overall effects of the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin on the movement of Physarum to be determined. 
A study suggested that the addition of dibutyryl-cAMP shows correlation with an increased ciliary movement in rabbit hairs (Tamaoki et al. 1989), something vital in the consideration of the effect of dibutyryl-cAMP on the movement of Physarum. Two studies lead to the consideration of the effect of curcumin on the movement of Physarum, one of which found that the addition of curcumin can cause decreased migration in lung cancer cells (Lin et al. 2009). The other study found that the addition of curcumin can inhibit signal transduction pathways similar to the cAMP-mediated pathway mentioned above (Beevers et al. 2006). It was hypothesized that the addition of a PKA activation such as dibutyryl-cAMP would increase the distance of Physarum migration away from a light source while the addition of curcumin, an inhibitor of PKA, would decrease movement in all directions. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, nine potato water agar plates were obtained. All nine plates were labeled by test condition or control condition and a 2x2 cm square was drawn in the middle of the bottom side of the plate. This square acted as the starting point for measurement of distance travelled towards or away from light. To prepare the plates under the desired test conditions, a 20x stock solution of either Curcumin or dibutyryl-cAmp was diluted with 19 mL of water to make a 1x chemical solution. Approximately 3 mL of the respective 1x dilutions were poured onto a total of six potato water agar plates, 3 of which were Curcumin and the remaining 3, dibutyryl-cAMP. 
Nine 1x1 cm blocks of physarum were cut from their original agar plates, making sure not to include any pieces of oatmeal, and placed, roughly, in the center of the each of the nine plates, three on control, three on curcumin treated plates, and three on dibutyryl-cAMP treated plates. In between each use of the spatula to cut and place the organism, the spatula was cleaned with ethanol to prevent cross contamination. All nine plates were then tightly wrapped in tin foil, completely. At the top of each of the nine plates, a 3x3 cm square was cut out of the tin foil to allow for light to shine through the plates. All nine plates were placed in a light box for 22 hours. 
22 hours after the plates were placed in a light box, each plate was unwrapped and the distance of migration of physarum was measured. The direction of migration, either towards or away from light, was also noted, along with any shift of the actual square that was taken from the original physarum plate. 
The statistical tests used to analyze the significance of the results were two, two sample t-tests because they means of the two chemical conditions, dibutyryl cAMP and curcumin, were compared to the control condition. The test was completed by documenting the average distance of migration and in what direction and then the test was ran with average values. 



Results:
The mean value for the dibutyryl-cAMP condition’s influence on Physarum movement was not significantly different than that of the control condition (t-stat = 0.43853, df = 3.3739, P = 0.6870). The mean value for the curcumin condition’s influence on Physarum movement was not statistically significantly different than that of the control condition (t-stat = 0.21693, df = 3.9431, P = 0.839). 
	On average, the Physarum being tested under dibutyryl-cAMP conditions moved further than the control condition, by 1 mm, but the three plates did not share a common direction of migration (Fig. 1). Physarum tested under curcumin conditions moved a shorter distance, 0.67 mm,  than the control condition but the three plates did not share a common migration direction (Fig.1).  
	The expected results for Physarum movement under dibutyryl-cAMP conditions are increased movement in comparison to the control condition, for example 2 mm, and movement towards the light source (Fig. 2). The expected results for Physarum movement under curcumin conditions are decreased movement in comparison to the control condition, for example 2 mm, and movement towards the light source (Fig. 2). Control conditions are expected to move towards the light source. 


Discussion:
The results of the two sample t-tests lead us to deem this experiment inconclusive. As observed in this experiment, the control group moved in the opposite direction of light, which was unexpected, and the test groups showed no correlation of movement in any direction, as one plate of each moved towards the light, one moved away, and one did not move. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, there is no correlation between PKA inhibitors and activators on Physarum movement. However, there was evidence of procedural error that could have affected the results of this experiment. When preparing the potato water agar plates, a 1 x 1 cm square should have been cut so that the square of Physarum could be placed within the potato agar. However, this step was disregarded and the Physarum square was found to have slid in multiple directions when researchers returned to record movement 22 hours after preparation. This could have led to the inconclusive results. Furthermore, it is likely that the stock organism had gone into resting phase when the plates were prepared. The stock plates were found  under direct light and in a warmer temperature condition than favorable, both of which can attribute to Physarum transitioning into the resting phase where movement is not observed. The resting phase is a major part of the developmental cycle of Physarum in movement ceases due to its vegetative state in response to unfavorable environmental conditions such as direct light and heat (Dove and Rusch 2017). The room in which the experiment was carried out is much colder than the incubator where the stock were kept, and also the tin foil used in the experiment made the plate much darker than the organism had experienced prior to experimentation. This change in temperature and intensity of light most likely led to the transition of Physarum into its resting phase, causing our results to be inconclusive. 
Much like the findings of a similar study, the expected migration distance and direction of Physarum under dibutyryl-cAMP test conditions were increased movement, in comparison to the control, and towards the light (Tamaoki et al. 1989). Since dibutyryl-cAMP is an activator of PKA, there should have been a greater distance of migration than the control organism. Since the stock organism was expected to be well fed, an increased movement towards the light source should have been observed because Physarum find their food in dark and damp conditions. 
Much like the findings of a similar study, the expected migration distance and direction of Physarum under curcumin test conditions were decreased movement, in comparison to the control, and still towards the light ( Lin et. al. 2009). Since curcumin is an inhibitor of PKA, there should have been a lesser distance of migration than the control organism. Since the stock organisms was expected to be well fed, movement towards the light source should have been observed. 
The study should be completely redone to confirm the status of the initial hypothesis. With the evidence of multiple studies confirming the initial hypothesis, this experiment was deemed inconclusive due to experimental error and faulty stock plates.
