Title: The Effect of Precor on Manduca sexta Growth

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a type of caterpillar which in it’s young stages of life is a pest. The experiment was done with a controll group and an experimental group that was given the same diet as the controll, but instead of water it was mixed with Precor. The results showed that there was a statistical difference(p_value of 1.57 x 10-5 ) between the two groups and that the group without Precor gained more mass on average than the group that was treated with Precor. One group gaining more means that our hypothesis was proven correct as the group that was treated with Precor gained less mass as the JH imitator slowed the growth of the caterpillars. The hypothesis at the start of the lab was that the group that was treated with Precor would not gain as much mass due to Juvenile Hormone limiting growth.


Introduction:
This experiment tested the growth of caterpillars specifically Manduca sexta, also known as a tobacco hornworm. Manduca sexta before it’s fifth instar is a pest that destroys crops [Reinecke: 1980]. In order to prevent the damage an experiment was set up to see if the Juvenile Hormone directly affects the Manduca sexta’s growth. This brings the question about whether or not this damage can be limited. One of the key hormones which keeps the caterpillar in its early life stages is the juvenile hormone. This begs the question as to whether or not an imitator could take the role of the JH hormone and what effect will it have on these two groups of caterpillars growth. The experiment observes caterpillars with a base diet and compares their growth with the Manduca sexta that have Precor in their diet. These caterpillar’s masses will be observed which will show a significent difference between the two groups or not. The Juvenile Hormone controlls the growth of caterpillars. This lab is meant to test whether or not Precor(imitates the juvenile hormone) actually had an effect on the growth by mass of the caterpillar. Consequently, the hypothesis is that the caterpillars that ate food treated with Precor would gain weight at a noticeably slower rate.

Materials and Method:
Two groups of four Manduca sexta were given the same diet of caterpillar food, but one was soaked in 10 drops of water and one was soaked in 10 drops of Precor. Each caterpillar was given its own cell within small containers broken up into four cells. Each cell then had holes poked through them in order for the Manduca sexta to grow. Each cell was an empty space in a plastic container where we placed food for each caterpillar. They were then placed in an incubator in order to encourage growth. The caterpillars were then measured everyday on a balance. The results were then analyzed through a two sample t_test.

Results:
The data was initially a large variety of masses of each caterpillar for everyday, but to summarize this data an average of each caterpillar’s mass from the start was used. These masses were used to represent the overall trend in changing masses for these caterpillars. After all of the data was collected a two sample t_test was used with a p_value of 1.57 x 10-5. Since the p_value is less than 0.05 there is a significent difference in the two groups of data. The significent difference being that the controll group gained more mass than the Precor group.


Discussion:
The Juvenile Hormone had been found in previous studies to have played a direct part in an insects growth and metamorphosis [Evans: 1996]. In this lab, the two sample t_test showed that  there was a significent difference between the weight of the two groups as the found p_value was 1.57 x 10-5   which is less than 0.05.  As a result, the data supported our hypothesis as it showed a trend of the Precor group gaining weight at a slower rate than the controll group. Furthermore, the controll group also entered the next stage of development, hence solidifying the idea of Precor playing a direct role in the growth of Manduca sexta. All in all, the hypothesis was supported by the data and the experiment lead to the conclusion that the Juvenile Hormone does inhibit growth. To further improve this experiment we could have used more samples and also recorded more about the stage changes that the caterpillars went through in order to provide a bigger picture. The results now allow people to work towards controllling Manduca sexta through the Juvenile Hormone because the lab proved that the Juvenile Hormone had a distinct effect on the mass of the caterpillars.
