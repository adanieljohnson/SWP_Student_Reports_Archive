Title: The Effect of a Potassium Solution Injection on the Neuromuscular Connections in Roma pipleus

Abstract:
Our experiment attempted to explore the effect of a potassium injection in the ability of the muscle being able to fire, specifically on the threshold voltage. In order to explore this effect, we used legs from Roma pipleus, specifically the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus system. Our results showed that the potassium injection did not significently change the threshold voltage, suggesting that a potassium injection into the muscle did not change the muscle’s ability to fire. This result, however, was from a sample with a very low sample size, and the legs were used as their own controll due to the high variability in frog leg properties. More research should be done in order to explore the true effect of a potassium injection into the muscle. 


Introduction:
One of the most well studied neuron systems is the neuromuscular junction in animals. The neuromuscular junction involves the passage of a signal between a motor neuron and a muscle cell. This signal is specifically past by the action potential of the neuron triggering a release of a neurotransmitter, which binds to receptors in the muscle cell and triggers an action potential that causes muscle contractions. This action potential is generated by the electrochemical gradient created by varying the electrochemical gradient of sodium (Na+) ions and potassium (K+) ions, with the Na+ being highly concentrated outside the cell and K+ ions being highly concentrated inside the cell [Hodgkin: 1950]. In this experiment, we will evaluate the effect of injecting the muscle with a K+ solution, increasing the extracellular concentration of K+. We will do this by using the neuromuscular system in Roma pipleus, specifically the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemus system. This system is one of the more well studied [Ceccarelli: 1973] [Juang: 1976] neuromuscular junctions in the animal kingdom, and this is because it is relatively easy to study. The sciatic nerve in frogs is fairly large relative to other nerves and the gastrocnemus muscle in frogs is very large thus this system is relatively easier to study. We plan to study this system, specifically the effect of injecting potassium into the extracellular fluid. Research on this subject has shown that potassium tends to negatively effect muscle function. One study on guinea pig neuromuscular junctions determines that impairing K+ channels impaired the muscle’s ability to appropriately fire [Cook: 1984]. While this is not the same thing as injecting potassium, it does suggest that manipulating the potassium concentration in the nerve will inhibit firing, and thus if we inject potassium into the extracellular, this might entirely mess up the system. We hypothesize that if we inject a potassium solution into the Roma pipelus gastrocnemus, the resting potential in the system will decrease, and the pulse necessary to make the frog muscle reach threshold will increase. However, we also think there is a real possibility that the muscle will fail to fire at all. 

Materials and Method:
We began with 3 separate frog legs. Because there is significent variation between different frog legs, these frog legs served as their own controll. This means that they began with no treatment and then will measure the threshold value, and we then injected them with 0.1 Ml’s of a 0.1 molar potassium solution. In order to prepare the frog leg, we removed the skin and then attached one side of the gastrocnemus to a force measurement device and the sciatic nerve to an electrical probe. We then measured how much electricity was required in order to cause the muscle to fire—meaning the threshold level of the nerve. We then repeated the same process for the remaining 2 legs. We than ran a paired t_test (alpha = 0.05) to compare the threshold values for the three legs in the experimental and controll group with the following form:

H_0=〖Threshold〗_Experimental-〖Threshold〗_Control=0
H_A=〖Threshold〗_Experimental- 〖Threshold〗_(Control )&gt;0


Results:
The paired t_test yielded the following values: t-value = 0.7482; p_value = 0.2662; degrees of freedom = 2. The three frog legs did not show a significent change in the threshold value, as shown in Figure 1. 

Discussion:
Because the p_value is greater than the alpha value, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Because we failed to reject the null hypothesis, we conclude that our data does not suggest that a potassium injection impairs the ability of the muscle to fire. This result is in contrast with what other studies found, finding that potassium impairs the muscles ability to fire [Cook: 1984]. This difference can be attributed to our small sample size. The frog legs we tested on tended to vary widely in their threshold values and thus because our population was only 3 legs, it is incredibly possible that with 1 outlier leg could greatly affect the results. Other previous studies likely had much higher sample sizes to study. Future research could be done to determine which of the two conclusions is the correct one. Because the frog legs varied so drastically in their properties we also used each leg as its own controll, meaning it was first tested without the potassium injection and then tested with it. This could impair our results, as the leg could conceivably have become weakened by having to be used in one full trial before being used again. A future research topic could be to explore this phenomena with more frog legs to more appropriately deal with the variation in the legs.
