Title: The Influence of Hunger on Aggressive Behaviors in Male Betta Splendens

Abstract:
The way that animals behave in an enclosed environment can tell a lot about how they may act in the wild. Keeping track of behavioral patterns of all types of animals is important to our understanding of the surrounding world and also for better understanding the animal in question. The fish known as Betta Splendens, is a species that originates from Thailand. They have specific male-to-male interactions characterized by a very territorial, agonistic behavior pattern when together. The focus of this experiment was to determine whether the factor of hunger would increase the amount of aggressive displays shown during the male fishs’ interactions. A set of seven fish were selected to be used in the experiment, where the number of aggressive behaviors displayed by each fish was recorded before and after they received food. The results show that the hunger factor does in fact show a change, more specifically that the fish are more aggressive toward each other when they are hungry. 

Introduction:
The Siamese Fighting fish, otherwise known as Betta Splendens or simply the Betta fish, are a  small species native to Thailand that dwell in shallow, slow flowing waters of streams and rice paddy fields [Sturgeon: 2001]. These waters they inhabit are usually low-oxygen content, so this species has adapted a method of extracting oxygen from the water’s surface by swimming up and gulping and therefore allowing them to tolerate such poor quality waters [Johnson: 2016]. As their name suggests, this species of fish is quite aggressive during their male-to-male interactions, and these agonistic behaviors can be divided into two classifications. The first being the facing movements which encompass facing an opponent with pectoral fins erect, spreading the opercula, and lastly protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. The second type is the broadside movement and these movements consist of pelvic flickering, tail flashing, and tail beating [Johnson: 2016]. The amount of energy the fish has plays a large role in how much effort they put into creating such displays of aggression, and it is known that when they are not well fed they become lethargic, which could have an effect on how they act [Miksen: 2016]. This purpose of this experiment is to quantify these types of behaviors by recording each time there is a display of aggression, while adding an outside factor to see if it has any further effects on the interaction between the sample fish. The factor that will be added to this experiment is hunger--more specifically how the fish will interact with one another while they are hungry, and then once again after they have been fed in order to see if there is any major difference in behavioral patterns. I hypothesize that the fish will behave more agonistically when they are not fed, but once they are fed this these aggressive behaviors will lessen. 

Materials and Methods:
The first thing that was done was selecting seven different male Betta fish to use in our trials, two of which were to be used as controls. The fish were kept separate after selection in order to make sure they would not show premature aggression and tire out before their trial. Next we picked out a tank with three sections separated by glass and a rectangular piece of plastic for the aforementioned reason. The two control fish, each on opposing sides of the tank, were kept in the tank for the duration of the experiment to act as behavioral controls for the reactions. The middle portion of the tank was used to test the reactions, and is where all of the other fish were cycled through during the trials. The two control fish were used one at a time--one fish was used in a trial while the other fish was taking a break from the previous trial. Each trial took place over the course of five minutes, so the breaks were always five minutes for each of the control fish. The first set of trial runs were used to test the reactions of the fish before they were fed so that their actions could be recorded for the hunger factor. The second round consisted of the same fish using the aforementioned methods, except the fish were fed and their actions were recorded to test this variable. Once the experimentation was finished all of the fish that were used were separated and the tank was returned. A paired t-test was conducted once the data was compiled in order to test for statistical significance of the effects of hunger on agonistic behavior in Betta Splendens.

Results:
After data analysis, the average number of agonistic behaviors while the fish were not fed was 5.4, while after they were fed this number dropped to an average of 2.4--both values can be seen in Figure 1. There was a difference, after every trial, of an averaged 3.75 less recorded aggressive behavior. All of the sample fish except for one, which did not show any aggressive behavior at all, showed a decrease in aggression after being fed versus when they were hungry and showed a larger number of aggressive behavior. A paired t-test was conducted and the data showed a significance between aggressive behavior and the factor of hunger in its results at the p=0.5 level (t=16.77, df=2, p=0.000462).

Discussion:
In accordance with the results, we support our hypothesis that the fish will behave more aggressively when they have not been fed, and will act more passively after they have been fed. This proves that the factor of hunger does have an effect on the way that the male fish interact with one another, and that hunger makes them more aggressive. Not only do male competitors show more aggression in the wild due to territorial issues when in close proximity to one another [Bronstein: 1981], but also that the amount of food present in the environment can have a profound effect on how aggressive the fish are toward one another [Miksen: 2016]. This experiment also may be created again to test other external factors, but there are a few different ways that it can be improved in the future. The first thing to do will be correcting any possible human errors that were made. Those mistakes could be feeding the fish different amounts which is fixable by measuring out food portions prior to running trials, the separation of the fish before running trials could have been more efficient by placing barriers between them, and lastly the two control fish may receive larger breaks to ensure peak performance. More trials could have been run over a larger amount of time as well, and a larger number of fish could have been used in order to provide more diverse results that could have affected the data differently. The key to a better experiment of the same kind in the future is to focus on creating more trials so that the data sets can be larger, and therefore even more, or less, significant in the end depending on the chosen factor.
