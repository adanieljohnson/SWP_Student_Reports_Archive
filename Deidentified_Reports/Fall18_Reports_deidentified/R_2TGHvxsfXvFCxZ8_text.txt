Title: Synthetic juvenile hormone added to Manduca sexta diet results in delayed development

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to isolate and observe the effects of increased levels of juvenile hormone on growth and development in Manduca sexta. This was done by observing and recording the weights of a controll group with no additional hormones added, and an experimental group to which a fixed amount of 5% synthetic juvenile hormone was added into their food to calculate a difference if any between the controll and the experimental groups. Since juvenile hormone is one of the key hormones in the controll of molting, it was predicted that if additional juvenile hormone was introduced to Manduca sexta larvae this would result in slower growth and development. The results of the experiment showed no statistical significance regarding the comparison of data. However, a comparison between the two groups based on observations shows that the controll group exhibited behaviors that precede pupation whereas the experimental group did not. The conclusion can be drawn that the increase in juvenile hormone increased weight but delayed development. 

Introduction:
This study focuses on the species of moth larvae known as the tobacco hornworm. The scientific name of this species is Manduca sexta. The hornworm is a common type of plant-eating pest commonly found throughout the United States. Its average life cycle spans from approximately 39 to 48 days through the life stages of egg, larvae, pupa, and adult. In the hornworms, growth and development are controllled by two hormones. The first being ecdysterone (20E) that regulates the timing of molting during development. The second is juvenile hormone (JH) that regulates the type of molting during development. These two hormones work together to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis. During the larval stage, the caterpillars rapidly grow to up to 10g [Reinecke: 1980]. Around the time of larval eclosion, the levels of juvenile hormone in the larvae begin to fall, then remaining relatively low throughout development. This poses the question of: if juvenile hormone levels were to remain high throughout development, would this cause a halt or delay in larval development? This experiment is to test our hypothesis: if additional juvenile hormone is introduced to Manduca sexta larvae to increase the amount present in their system, then this will result in slower growth and development.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we took eight caterpillars and separated them into two groups and placed in separate, divided containers. To prepare the containers for the caterpillars, we labeled them, as to keep measurements consistent, and punched breathing holes into the sides. Before placing the caterpillars into their respective containers, we prepared 10g of food per caterpillar. For the experimental group, we mixed in two drops of 5% synthetic juvenile hormone per 10g of food using a pipette and then divided the food between the four experimental caterpillars. For the controll group, we added two drops of water per 10g of food using a pipette as well and mixed in thoroughly to prevent the possible bias of a difference in food texture, then divided between the four controll caterpillars. We made sure to push all the food into one corner of all containers as to leave room for movement and growth. We measured and recorded the weight of all eight caterpillars, then proceeded to place them into their respective containers. We placed the caterpillars into a temperature-controllled refrigerator within the lab. We recorded weight and observations daily for approximately two weeks, making sure that containers were kept clean and they did not run out of food/food did not go bad. 
	After collecting the data for two weeks, we subtracted the starting weight of each caterpillar from the maximum weight they reached over the two weeks. With the weight differences, we took the average of each group to find the mean weight change. With these values, a one-tailed t_test was executed to analyze the statistics of the data and compare the mean change in weight between the controll and experimental group. 


Results:
The mean difference in weight for the controll group was 6.13g and the mean difference in weight for the experimental group was 8.67g (Fig.1). The standard deviation for the weight difference in the controll group was 5.86, and the standard deviation for the weight difference in the experimental group was 6.30 (Fig.1). To analyze our results, we used a one-tailed t_test. Upon the calculation of the data, the one tailed t_test showed the difference in the data held no statistical significance (t_stat= 0.5912, d.f.= 6, p_value= 0.2880). In the days nearing the end of observation, it was clear that quite a few of the caterpillars were beginning to lose weight, growth was stagnating, and activity continually decreased. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis predicted that the introduction of additional juvenile hormone would slow growth and development in the experimental caterpillars. Based on numerical data and the p_value produced by the one-tailed t_test alone, our hypothesis was not supported. The mean difference in weight in the experimental group was higher than that of the controll group, suggesting that the addition of the synthetic juvenile hormone increased the rate of growth and development. However, if we were to draw our conclusion from the observational results our hypothesis would be supported. In the last three days of observation, in two of the controll caterpillars, a blue pulsating line running along their dorsal sides became visible. This line is termed as the dorsal vessel. This exposure of this vessel is induced by the absence of juvenile hormone and is a precedent to pupation [Nijhout: 1975]. This means that two of the controll caterpillars were days within pupation and had we extended observation we most likely would have been able to observe this. Though the mean weight of the experimental caterpillars was greater than that of the controll, none of the experimental caterpillars had the exposed dorsal vessel, indicating that though their growth rate was increased, their development was slowed by the additional juvenile hormone. 
	The results of this experiment based on observational data could be of use to the agriculture industry. Since the tobacco hornworm is a common type of plant-eating pest, they feed on and invade several species of crops, rendering the crops unusable and creating a financial deficit for those in the agriculture industry. If we know that increased amounts of juvenile hormone extend the larval stage of life where the hornworms do the most damage, then we can inversely infer that using a pesticide that contains a juvenile hormone inhibitor, would thus speed up development. When the hornworms ingest the pesticide sprayed on the crops, they would begin pupation earlier than on their own or with the additional juvenile hormone.
