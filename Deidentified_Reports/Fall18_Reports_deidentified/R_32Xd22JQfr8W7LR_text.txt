Title: Sodium Inhibition on the threshold of Contraction Force in Raina Pippin

Abstract:
In this experiment, we were trying to identify whether or not putting a sodium inhibitor would affect the threshold of a muscle contraction. Sodium is used because of the prevalence of the sodium-potassium pumps. So, we believed that If sodium channels are inhibited, then there will be a change in the threshold for the contraction force. For the experiment, we need three frog legs, so we would be able to run through the experiment several times. We ran through each frog twice, just to see if there was a drastic difference. The p_value for the paired t_test was .4221. Being above 0.05, the data is not significent. Seeing how inhibition of this enzyme has worked previously, it should be able to work in future versions of this experiment.

Introduction:
The goal of this experiment was to see whether or not adding an external influence into a muscle will affect the contraction of a muscle. On its own, the contraction of a muscle is due to the generation of an action potential, going through neurons. An action potential is generated within the cell through a sodium potassium pump. This process starts off by the cell receiving a stimulus, which results in voltage gated sodium ion channels to open alongside the cell, resulting in depolarization. Once depolarization occurs, then the sodium channels close, and potassium leaves the cell through voltage gated potassium channels, in a process called hyperpolarization. After hyperpolarization, the cell has generated an action potential, and thus the charge is able to go through the nervous system to the muscle[Johnson: 2018]. For the lab, we used the raina pippin frog, as it was malleable, and was easy to access the sciatic nerve. When trying to figure out what would be able to affect the contraction of the muscle, we thought of the sodium-potassium pump, and pondered whether or not inhibiting one of these ions would result in a change in the threshold for contraction. Previously, studies have proven that inhibiting the sodium potassium pump can influence the physiological functionality of an organism [Cantly: 1977]. So we analyzed the following: If sodium channels are inhibited, then there will be a change in the threshold for the contraction force.


Materials and Method:
For the experiment, three frog legs were used as various trials. Some of the materials that were required were a sodium inhibitor, the electric stimulator, the voltage reader, and materials to stimulate conduction in the nerve. Initially, the frogsâ€™ legs were cleaned off to expose the muscle. Then, the electric stimulator was inserted alongside the sciatic nerve. As constants, the frequency of the stimulation was 2 Hz, and the voltage being released was 5 volts. Then, at various intervals, the frog was stimulated, at a range of amplitudes to test for the initial threshold before the sodium inhibitor was added. Once all the amplitudes were measured, one milliliter of sodium inhibitor was added to the nerve. After five minutes of allowing the sodium inhibitor to settle, then the same amplitudes were measured to see whether or not there was a difference in the amplitude. The steps were repeated two more times, once for each frog. A paired t_test was used to analyze the results. 

Results:
When we took the frequencies of the frogs, we got no difference for trials one and three, and a difference of 0.4 for frog two, leaving the average difference to be .1333 V. The average amplitude of a threshold in which a contraction occurred before adding the sodium inhibitor was 0.2666 V. After the inhibitor, the average was 0.4 V. The standard deviation before the inhibition was 0.11547005. The standard deviation after the inhibition was 0.34641016 (Fig. 1). The p_value for the paired t_test was .4221. Being above 0.05, the data is not significent.

Discussion:
Because our data was not significent, we are not able to accept the hypothesis. For the most part, our data showed the same threshold before and after adding the sodium inhibitor, yet one of the frogs followed the trace stated in our hypothesis. We can admit where we made faults in the lab, however. Going into the lab, the group did not work unanimously to plan out the experiment, and we ended up each having our own plans for the experiment. We did not even have a consensus of what we were measuring for in the first place. On top of that, we also left a large margin of error for where the threshold could be for the frog. We measured the amplitude in increments of .2 for the amplitude, which is a large gap. If we were to re-do the experiment, we would be clear about measuring the amplitude where the threshold occurs. We would also decrease the change of amplitude between trials to get a more specific value for the amplitude. Seeing how inhibition of this enzyme has worked previously, it should be able to work in future versions of this experiment [Cantly: 1977]. The data in this lab, however, shows promise to controll physiological functions in the body, and can eventually help people either limit or completely inhibit the functionality of insufficient organs, or inhibit cell function.
