Title: Effects of glucose and sucrose on growth patterns of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Glucose and sucrose, as sugar sources, have the capacity to act as external stimuli and affect the growth patterns and behavior of Physarum polycephalum, which sense and respond to stimuli via signal transduction pathways. Physarum were placed in petri dishes with either glucose, sucrose, or glucose and sucrose and compared to a controll group of chloroplasts in order to observe whether Physarum would exhibit positive or negative chemotaxis (be attracted or repelled by, respectively) to certain sugar substances. The experiment was designed to test our prediction that Physarum would, over the course of 2 days, respond to glucose as an attractant, sucrose as a repellant, and, in competitive environments with both present, would show stronger attraction towards glucose/repulsion from sucrose in comparison to the presence of just glucose or sucrose. In accordance with a previous study performed on cultured Physarum, the growth towards glucose was significently greater than the growth of the controll group, demonstrating an attraction towards glucose. Our results for sucrose and glucose+sucrose were inconclusive.

Introduction:
Signal transduction is the process by which an organism may respond to internal or external stimuli through a series of coordinated responses. Y Lee, S Choi, and C Hyeon published a 2014 study performed with the intention to map out one family of signal transduction pathways — g-protein coupled receptors. The researchers identify g-coupled protein receptors (GCPRs) as a major gatekeeper membrane-bound receptor on the cell surface that, in response to external stimuli, activates the coupled g-protein complex and triggers a cascade of subunit to enzyme interactions that results in the generation of a second messenger. The second messenger, as in most signaling events, is what triggers the intracellular response via allosteric pathways of signal flow [Lee: 2014]. In his 2007 research article exploring signaling involved in mammalian taste buds, S Roper discusses another major family of signal transduction pathways – ion-channel coupled. Whereas g-protein coupled receptors were stimulated by reception of external stimuli on membrane-bound receptors, ion-channel coupled pathways involve the diffusion of external ions across the plasma membrane and into the cell. The exact pathway relies on both the ion type and cell type, however, often the diffused ion will bind to an intracellular receptor to open a specific ion channel and allow the influx of a number of ions sufficient to affect ion-dependent enzymes [Roper: 2007]. One such organism that utilizes these signal transduction pathways in order to respond to external stimuli and, therefore, would be an ideal model organism to test is Physarum polycephalum, commonly referred to as slime mold. In their 2012 research article, V Bonifaci, K Mehlhorn, and G Varma explore the foraging behavior of Physarum dependent on the external stimulation of various signal transduction pathways. Typically found in moist and dark environments, Physarum is, in essence, composed of multiple nuclei contained within one plasma membrane known as the plasmodium, which forms a tubular network that reshapes and adapts in response to external stimuli encountered by the tube network. By using actin microfilaments to extend its leading edge, Physarum can “crawl” towards or away from external stimuli based on information sensed and transmitted through molecular signals and nutrient concentrations of signal transduction pathways [Bonifaci: 2012]. D Knowles and M Carlile found in their 1978 study demonstrated that Physarum were attracted by, i.e. showed positive chemotaxis to, glucose at 10 mM and repelled by, i.e. showed negative chemotaxis to, sucrose at 10 mM. At high sugar concentrations of 100 mM or more, they also found that compounds tested under certain conditions, even attractants, would result in repulsion [Knowles: 1978]. In a 1977 study performed by I Chet, A Naveh, and Y Henis, however, they found that out of 15 successful tests, Physarum exhibited a positive response towards 50 mM sucrose 4 times out of 15 and, while this was not significent enough to assume attraction, the data was strong enough to conclude Physarum to be generally nonresponsive to sucrose as opposed to repelled by [Chet: 1977]. In order to verify the results of these studies, we plan on testing glucose and sucrose in order to observe whether each functions as an attractant or repellant for Physarum. In the presence of glucose, we expect Physarum to exhibit positive chemotaxis and grow towards the attractant glucose source, whereas in the presence of sucrose, we expect Physarum to demonstrate negative chemotaxis and grow away from the repellant sucrose. Additionally, we are interested in seeing how growth of Physarum in which both the expected attractant—glucose—and the expected repellant—sucrose—are present. In competitive situations, we expect the simultaneous growth towards glucose and away from sucrose to be stronger in comparison to the presence of only the attractant or repellant.

Materials and Method:
Taking 12 water-agar 100 mm petri plates and setting aside 10, we labeled one of the remaining 2 empty 100 mm petri plates “glucose” and the other “sucrose.” To prepare the glucose-agar plate, 1% water agar from the “glucose” plate was melted in the microwave, 20 Ml of which was mixed with 0.09008 g glucose (final concentration of 25 mM in 20 Ml solution). After letting it cool to 50°C, the mixture was poured into plate labeled “glucose” and let cool until hardened. To prepare the sucrose-agar plate, 1% water agar from the “sucrose” plate was melted in the microwave, 20 Ml of which was mixed with 0. 17115 g sucrose (final concentration of 25 mM in 20 Ml solution). After letting it cool to 50°C, the mixture was poured into plate labeled “sucrose” and let cool until hardened. The remaining 10 plates were labeled—1 “controll,” 3 “glucose,” 3 “sucrose,” and 3 “glucose + sucrose.” Sterilizing the spatula in ethanol, we cut two 1 cm x 1 cm squares into agar in the “sucrose” and “glucose” experimental plates, three 1 cm x 1 cm squares into agar in “sucrose + glucose” experimental plates, and one 1 cm x 1 cm square into agar in “controll” plate. Agar blocks were removed and spatula was returned to ethanol to sterilize. Subsequently, six 1 cm x 1 cm square slabs were cut from the glucose solution agar plate. One slab was inserted into each of the “glucose” plates and in each of the “glucose + sucrose” plates, in correct labeled square. Spatula was re-sterilized and used to cut six 1 cm x 1 cm square slabs from sucrose solution agar plate. One slab was inserted into each of the “sucrose” plates and in each of the “glucose + sucrose” plates, in correct labeled square. Spatula was re-sterilized and used to cut ten squares of Physarum culture from stock plate. These were then transferred to center of 10 prepared plates—1 controll, 9 experimental. Plates were taped shut and wrapped completely in foil and placed in dark locker. After 48 hours elapsed, we checked on the growth of our plates using a mm ruler to measure distance that slime mold migrated from initial blocks added to center of each plate towards or away from test substance(s). We measured from edge of Physarum block from which the furthest migration occurred. Direction slime mold migrated in relation to block of test substance was recorded in addition to distance migrated. Time elapsed in hours was documented and plates were discarded. Since we predicted the Physarum would move towards glucose for the “glucose” plates and away from sucrose in the “sucrose” plates, i.e. unidirectionally in both instances, we utilized a one-tailed t_test in order to determine if the growth of Physarum was greater than the controll, no attractant or repellant, for both glucose, a predicted attractant, and sucrose, a predicted repellant.

Results:
In the case of glucose in Figure 1, with a positive mean value of 3.67±0.47 cm indicating leftwards growth over the course of 50 hours, the glucose experimental group Physarum exhibited an overall trend of positive chemotaxis towards glucose. Using a one-tailed t_test to measure whether or not the migration in the direction towards glucose was significent in comparison to the directional growth of the controll group, we found that the Physarum growth towards glucose was, in fact, statistically significent (t_stat = -11, d.f. = 2, P = 0.004). We know that the glucose treatment group Physarum growth was statistically significent in comparison to the controll group Physarum growth because our t_test resulted in a P-value less than the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05). In the case of sucrose in Figure 1, with a negative mean value of -3.67±3.29 cm indicating rightwards growth over the course of 50 hours, the sucrose experimental group Physarum exhibited an overall trend of negative chemotaxis away from sucrose. While the absolute value of the average was the same for both the glucose and sucrose groups (3.67 cm), the standard deviation for the sucrose group (±3.29) was much greater than the standard deviation for the glucose group (±0.47), or even the glucose+sucrose group (±1.63). Using a one-tailed t_test to measure whether or not the migration in the direction away from sucrose was significent in comparison to the directional growth of the controll group, we found that the Physarum growth away from sucrose was not statistically significent (t_stat = 1.57, d.f. = 2, P = 0.128). We know that the sucrose treatment group Physarum growth was not statistically significent in comparison to the controll group Physarum growth because our t_test resulted in a P-value that exceeded the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05). In the case of glucose+sucrose in Figure 1, with a positive mean value of 2.00±1.63 cm indicating leftwards growth over the course of 50 hours, the glucose+sucrose experimental group Physarum exhibited an overall trend of simultaneous positive chemotaxis towards glucose and negative chemotaxis away from sucrose. Based on absolute mean values, Physarum in competitive environments exhibited less net growth towards glucose/away from sucrose (2.00±1.63 cm) than the Physarum that exhibited growth in glucose-only (3.67±0.47 cm) or sucrose-only (-3.67±3.29 cm) environments. Using a one-tailed t_test to measure whether or not the migration in the direction towards glucose/away from sucrose was significent in comparison to the directional growth of the controll group, we found that the Physarum growth in the competitive environment was not statistically significent (t_stat = -1.73, d.f. = 2, P = 0.113). We know that the glucose+sucrose treatment group Physarum growth was not statistically significent in comparison to the controll group Physarum growth because our t_test resulted in a P-value that exceeded the common 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05).

Discussion:
The result data of this experiment simultaneously supports our initial hypothesis that (1) glucose does act as a chemoattractant for Physarum while also disproving the other facets of our hypothesis that (2) sucrose would act as a repellant, and (3) that glucose+sucrose competitive environments would induce a greater net growth towards glucose/away from sucrose. Because our results for (1) were statistically significent in that the P-value fell within the accepted 95% confidence interval (P &lt; 0.05), we know that the growth exhibited by the glucose treatment Physarum towards the glucose substance was not due to chance and, thus, we are able to reject the null hypothesis. It is this same confidence interval, however, that informs us that our results for (2) and (3) were not statistically significent due to the fact that their P-values exceeded 0.05, meaning that while there was growth exhibited away from sucrose as well as towards glucose/away from sucrose, the growth was not of enough statistical significance to be considered not due to chance; we are, therefore, unable to reject the null hypothesis. The standard deviations for the not statistically significent sucrose and glucose+sucrose experimental groups were observed to be much greater than the standard deviation for the statistically significent glucose experimental group, which leads us to believe that perhaps the Physarum organisms were not uniform in their growth/development in the stock plate and that, when they were transferred, perhaps some blocks began with Physarum more readily able to grow than other blocks, where Physarum culture may have been lacking or deficient. This may possibly explain why, despite having the same absolute mean value, the glucose and sucrose groups varied so widely in terms of standard deviation. We also noticed substantial differences in the standard agar plates given to us, namely that some were thicker than others while some were thinner than others. This shouldn’t have had an effect on Physarum growth rate, however, as we were measuring distance Physarum traveled from the edge of the Physarum block, perhaps there was unaccounted Physarum growth in its migration down the side of the block if the plate was thinner, or up onto the plane of the plate if the plate was thicker. Furthermore, perhaps some of the physarum had difficulties migrating up when the inserted culture agar block was at a lower elevation than the surrounding water-agar terrain. In terms of growth, our Physarum stock culture plate seemed to be lacking in Physarum growth in comparison to the stock culture plate we utilized in our previous lab. One biological explanation for lack of adequate Physarum growth on some of our plates could be explained in the 2016 analysis study performed by Schaap et. al, in which they identified the protein actin-fragmin kinase as a unique feature of Physarum that phosphorylates actin complexes, but only in a the configuration of 1: 1 actin-fragmin. This phosphorylated actin-fragmin complex is then utilized as a regulator of rapid changes in local viscoelasticities in Physarum F-actin network, which is a necessity for cytoplasmic streaming that Physarum use to detect its surroundings and receive sensory input from the environment [Schaap: 2016]. Should the protein be deficient or completely absent altogether, this could perhaps explain why Physarum growth was stunted in some cases, in which the organism is biologically unable to properly detect its surroundings. Based on our results, the 1977 study by Chet, Naveh, and Henis—in which they claim that Physarum is attracted to glucose while not significently repelled by sucrose (i.e. indifferent)—seems to hold higher veracity [Chet: 1977] than the 1978 Knowles and Carlile study—in which Physarum displayed negative chemotaxis in regards to sucrose [Knowles: 1978]. At least according to our results, Physarum responsiveness to sucrose is inconclusive as it was in the 1977 study. Even in competitive environments, the data of our experiment indicate that there does not seem to be a clear repulsion from sucrose based on the fact that the growth towards glucose was not any stronger in competitive environments than it was in glucose-only environments, nor was growth away from sucrose any stronger in competitive environments than it was in sucrose-only environments. In fact, contrary to our hypothesis that the competitive environment would yield higher net growth than the glucose-only or sucrose-only environments, we found that the glucose+sucrose treatment groups actually exhibited a smaller mean growth than the glucose and sucrose treatment groups and, while our results were not statistically significent, this could be an area in which further testing is necessary to determine significance. While taking into account the necessity for materials and stock culture standardization across all experimental and controll groups, another avenue for future experimentation could be testing sugar concentrations, as our sugar concentrations were 25 mM, whereas the 1978 study utilized 50 mM [Knowles: 1978] while the 1977 study utilized 10 mM and identified a 100 mM threshold [Chet: 1977].
