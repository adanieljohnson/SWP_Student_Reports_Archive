Title: Effects of Atrazine on photosynthesis of Spinacia oleracea under different light intensities

Abstract:
The efficiency of plant’s metabolic process, photosynthesis was measured by reduction rate of DCPIP. DCPIP functions as NADP, which is an electron acceptor molecule in the electron transfer chain of plant’s photosystems. The absorbance of DCPIP was measured by spectrophotometer at 600 nm. The samples were prepared with combinations of  addition or absence of herbicide Atrazine and light intensity of 0%, 50% and 100%. The results were tested by paired two sample t_tests between the pairs of controll groups (without Atrazine) and treatment groups (with Atrazine) under darkness, 50% light or 100% light. However, an increasing trend in absorbance of DCPIP was observed in all samples. The observation can be explained by change in the effectiveness of Atrazine and other protein interactions in the plant cells. 

Introduction:
All living organisms must obtain energy directly or indirectly from one or more external sources.  Organisms obtain energy and use the stored energy by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and respiration which occurs in mitochondria of both plant cells and animal cells. Plants are able to capture energy from sunlight by the process of photosynthesis. Overall, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two of the most important metabolic processes carried out by living organisms. Photosynthesis is processed by oxidation reduction reactions, by which electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to another. (Krause: 1991). To begin photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. Electrons are excited by the solar energy and leave carrier molecules. The electron excitement triggers the hydrolysis of water and generates a proton gradient across the membrane. (Krause: 1991). The high energy electrons are stored as NADPH, and the proton gradient fuels ATP synthesis. The electrons on NADPH and the ATP are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules and 5-carbon ribulose phosphate. During photosynthesis, the reactions that are light dependent generate most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. The mechanism of Spinacia oleracea’s photosynthesis was determined in previous study. The study determined that under steady state conditions, the oxidation of cytosolic NADH by the mitochondria in Spinacia oleracea cells does not contribute to mitochondrial respiration.(Hanning: 1993). In order to measure the electron transfer, DCPIP solution was applied,which is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600 nm. When DCPIP is reduced, its molecule will have conjugated C=C bonds which are colorless, and a decrease in its light absorbance at 600 nm will be observed.  In the lab, we performed experiment to test how light and a photosystem inhibitor, Atrazine affect the Spinacia oleracea’s photosynthesis process by measuring electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts of the leaves. During photosynthesis when the amount of light is reduced  or the electron transfer chain is interrupted, the reduction of DCPIP will decelerate and less percent change in its absorbance at 600 nm will be recorded. Light intensity varied from 0%, 50% to 100%. The herbicide Atrazine is a photosystem II (PS II) inhibitor, which inhibits the electron transport chain in PS II. Atrazine binds to the D1 protein, which is the PS II reaction center, as the result blocking electron transfer to plastoquinone. Inhibition of PS II electron transport prevents the conversion of absorbed light energy by chloroplasts into electrochemical energy. Triplet chlorophyll and singlet oxygen will be produced instead, which will cause the peroxidation of membrane lipids.Ccellular disorganization and phototoxicity will be induced as the membrane lipids are mutant. (Fuerst: 1991). White light was applied to all samples for photosynthesis. Though the quality of light was not shifted in the experiment, it is important that shifts in the regime of light can also affect photosynthesis process. Recent study on Dinoflagellates of the genus Dinophysis discovered that Dinophysis seemed to better adapt to grow under green and blue light rather than white light. Changes were observed in the photosynthetic light curves of D. acuminata cultures after shifting light conditions from low intensity-blue light to high intensity-white light. Toxin analyses in Dinophysis showed that the toxin per cell reached maximum under high light environment. (García: 2018). We hypothesize that under all light intensities, the addition of Atrazine will result in lower absorbance of DCPIP in Spinacia oleracea’s photosynthesis process.


Materials and Method:
19 large test tubes were labeled and placed in a tube rack. A blank sample was prepared with 8 Ml of water and  2 Ml of 100 mM phosphate at pH 6.5 as reaction buffer. Sample 1-9 were prepared with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of phosphate buffer and 2 Ml of  130 mM DCIP. Sample 10-18 were prepared with 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer and 2 Ml of  130 mM DCIP. Sample 10-18 were added 1 Ml of Atrazine. 0.1 Ml of centrifuged chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea leaves were added to sample 1-18. The reagents were mixed immediately after addition of chloroplasts. All samples were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was blanked with the blank sample and the absorbance of all samples were recorded as time zero absorbance. Sample 1-3 and 10-12 were placed in drawer. Sample 4-6 and 13-15 were placed under a lamp with the light source half covered, and sample 7-9 and 16-18 were placed under an unobscured light source. After 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm was read. Sample 1-3 and 10-12 were put back into a drawer after each measurement. After 10 minutes (20 minutes total), the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm was read.  After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total), the spectrophotometer was blanked and the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm was read. Percent changes in absorbance were calculated and graphed.


Results:
Paired t_tests were performed on controll and treatment groups of average absorbance. The pair of controll and treatment groups were under same light intensity, with the treatment group added by the inhibitor Atrazine. With samples under the condition of darkness, the test results in d.f.= 3, p_value = 2.611*10^-6 (p&lt;&lt;&lt;0.05), and t = 3.182. With samples under the condition of 50% light intensity, the test results in d.f.= 3, p_value = 3.138*10^-9 (p&lt;&lt;&lt;0.05), and t = 3.182. With samples under the condition of 100% light intensity, the test results in d.f.= 3, p_value = 8.283*10^-5 (p&lt;&lt;&lt;0.05), and t = 3.182. An increase trend in absorbance of DCPIP was observed in all samples.The pair t_test results show that there is significent difference between controll groups and treatment groups in the absorbance of DCPIP. However, in each controll and treatment pairs, samples with Atrazine were measured to have higher absorbance than samples without Atrazine. The result rejects the hypothesis that under all light intensities, the addition of Atrazine will result in lower absorbance of DCPIP in Spinacia oleracea’s photosynthesis process. 

Discussion:
The observation of increased photosynthesis rate can be explained by increased chlorophyll fluorescence. Recent study on herbicide-exposed periphyton discovered that periphytons showed some recovery potential with increasing chlorophyll concentrations and non-photochemical quenching. With application of stressors, such as the herbicide as inhibitor, phototrophs may have actively increased energy assimilation to cope with higher energy demands under the chemical stress. (Feckler: 2018)The result in our experiment can be alternatively explained by plants’ ability to resist external stressors and increase the efficiency of electron transport in response. The result shows similar trend in data of different light intensities. Researchers studied the growth rates of Nannochloris oculata Droop and Phaeodactylum tricornutum Bohlin by applying 27 combinations of temperature , light intensity and atrazine concentration. The result determined that atrazine's toxicity increasing with increased temperature and light intensity and its inhibitory effect on the growth of P. tricornutum was significently dependent on light intensity only. (Mayasich: 1986). In our experiment, the most significent difference between controll and treatment groups results in light intensity of 50%. This is the amount of light that maximized the effect of Atrazine in our experiment. Our hypothesis was rejected and further studies on other plant species are required to study the effect of the herbicide Atrazine on plants’ photosynthesis. SInce an increased absorbance of DCPIP was observed in our samples,  our future research will explore other factors that affect the photosynthesis rate of Spinacia oleracea, such as temperature. We will also study external conditions that improve or decrease the effect of Atrazine in order to understand its effect on blocking the electron transfer chain in photosystem  II.
