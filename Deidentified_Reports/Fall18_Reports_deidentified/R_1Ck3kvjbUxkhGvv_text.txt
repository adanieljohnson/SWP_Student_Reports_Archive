Title: The influence of space allowance on the agnostic behaviors of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behaviors, often referring to the responses of animals to stimuli. It aims to uncover the physiological and evolutionary purposes for these behaviors. Agonistic behaviors are one of the animal behaviors that ethologists study that help the animals secure resources and find mates. Intraspecific agnostic behavior is the agnostic behavior occurring between individuals within a species, and space allowance is one of the factors that affect it. In this experiment, the agnostic behavior of Betta splenden was examined, and the hypothesis was that the agnostic behaviors would decrease if two Betta splendins were in a larger water tank than in a smaller tank. The hypothesis was not supported. Past literature was studied and the reason why it was not supported was possibly due to the not-significent differences between the two tanks. Future study is required for supporting this hypothesis.


Introduction:
The study of ethology is the study of animal behaviors, often referring to the responses of the animals to stimuli. It involves the theories from ecology, genetics and evolutionary biology. Ethology is considered to be originated from Charles Darwin, and first came in sight worldwide with the work on the animal behavior of Niko Tinbergen, Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch in 1973 when they won the Nobel Prize. Ethologists try to understand the physiological purposes hidden behind behaviors, and how evolution and natural selection have shaped them. [Johnson:2016] Aggression, which is also called agnostic behaviors, is one of the animal behaviors that ethologists examine as it is related to the interaction and evolution of animals in natural settings. In the process of evolution, aggressive behaviors are often related to competition over resources and mates. [Barnett: 1993] Conflicts in aggression include darting and biting, but most of the time the animals display behaviors that exerts no physical harm such as the display of their size and weapons. [Huber:2011] Aggression is considered to help secure the territories and resources, and the aggression between male species for a mate resulting in the selection of a healthier and stronger animal. Aggression consists of interspecific and intraspecific aggression. Interspecific aggression is the aggression between different species whereas intraspecific aggression is the aggression in one species, which can be related to the competition of accessing resources (food, territory, etc.) and breed opportunities. In a study on juvenile chum salmon, a schooling fish, it was observed that some individuals abandoned schooling and showed agnostic behaviors against competitors with the presence of a limited amount of food. [Ryer: 1991] 
In this experiment, the intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendins are examined. The Siamese fighting fish, which is the Betta splenden, was originated in southeast Asia. The size of the male Betta fish is often larger than female, with male reaching 5cm and female reaching 4cm. Betta splendins are highly territorial and males of Betta fish tend to display agnostic behaviors against each other if kept in the same tank. [Brostein: 1981] The intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two types of movements: broadside movement and facing movements. Broadside movements involve, in an escalating level of aggression intensity, pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing while facing movements include facing an opponent with pelvic fins erect, spreading gill covers and protrude branchiostegal membranes. [Johnson:2016] There are lots of factors that affect the aggression of Betta splendins and other animals generally, and space allowance is one of them. In this experiment, I investigated the effect of space on the agnostic behavior of betta fish. In a previous study, it was discovered that the tendency of a coral fish (Dascyllus aruanus) to be aggressive were controllled by the degree to which it was crowded in the shelter provided for them. [Peter: 1972] The effect of the size of the space on the agnostic behaviors in Betta splenden has not been studied. I hypothesized that if two Betta splendins were put into a larger tank, their agnostic behaviors would decrease and become less intense compared to their behaviors in a smaller tank.


Materials and Method:
Two water tanks of different sizes filled with water were obtained. One tank had the volume of approximately 5L, and the other of 1L. Two Betta splendins were originally placed in the smaller tank, separated by plastic dividers preventing them from engaging. Then, the divider was removed and the two fish began interacting with each other for 1 minute. The agnostic behaviors were observed and recorded. The divider was restored and the two betta fish and was kept undisturbed for ten minutes. Next, the two fishes were transported from the smaller tank to the larger one. They were placed at two ends of the tank away from each other. The two fish began interacting with each other again for 1 minute and their agnostic behaviors were recorded. Numbers from 1-3 were assigned to each of the two groups of agnostic behaviors (broadside and facing) based on their intensity: pelvic fin flickering – 1, tail beating – 2, tail flashing – 3, pectoral fins erecting – 1, spreading gill covers – 2, showing red mane – 3. For each fish, the total number representing their agnostic behavior intensity was calculated. The procedure was repeated on another pair of betta fish. A one-tailed paired t_test was used in determining if the agnostic behavior in the smaller tank was significently more intense than that in the larger tank.


Results:
As figure one shows, there is a general trend that the observed agnostic behaviors in the smaller tank was more than that in the larger tank. The mean agnostic behavior number for the small tank was (6 +/- 1.41). The mean agnostic behavior number for the small tank was(4.75 +/- 2.5). (Figure 1) The results one-tailed paired t_test showed that there is no significent difference between the mean agnostic behavior number for the small tank vs. large tank. (t_stat = 1.67, d.f. = 3, P = 0.194)


Discussion:
According to our results, there was no significent difference between the mean agnostic behavior number between small and large tank. The hypothesis was not supported. The result was possibly due to that the environment of the tank was oversimple and differences between the two tanks were small that the fish was not able to be aware of the change in the environment. In a study on Midas cichlid, a common aquarium fish, it was discovered that time spent behaving aggressively, which was also agnostic behavior intensity, was not associated with small-scale differences in group size or available space. It was also discovered that agnostic behavior was significently lower in a large aquarium with a complex habitat. [Old.f.ield:2011] In the study on a reef fish mentioned in the introduction, the results supporting their hypothesis was obtained in a complex environment where plenty of coral shelters were provided. [Peter: 1972] In another study investigating the aggressive behavior of Oryzias latipes, it was discovered that under the laboratory setting, reducing the amount of space available Oryzia latipes from 1 to 1/16 liter per fish did not alter the consequences of competition as long as the accumulation of waste products was prevented and food was supplied in excess. [Magnuson: 1962] Though there was a general trend in our data indicating that betta fish in a smaller tank displayed more agnostic behaviors, it was observed that the fish did not show any significent difference between the behaviors in the two tanks. The time they took to encounter each other was longer than that they had taken in the smaller tank. I concluded that the differences between the small and large tank in the experiment were not significent enough for betta fish to detect. The experiment did have some weaknesses: the behaviors of betta fish was observed subjectively that could result in inaccurate data because some of the agnostic behaviors such as tail beating and spreading the gill cover was hard to observe. Also, because the bottom of the water tank was reflective, the betta fish sometimes displayed agnostic behaviors against its mirror image so that it might already be experiencing habituation during the 10-minute resting period. For study in the future, to obtain the best result, the tanks must not be reflective and should contain significent differences between each other in either size or the environment. Also, other fish species should be examined to determine whether space has influences on the agnostic behavior of fish.
