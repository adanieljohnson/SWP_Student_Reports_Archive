Title: Effect of Sunlight Allocation on Plant Growth in Pisum sativum

Abstract:
The effect of sunlight allocation on Pisum sativum, or field peas, was tested in order to see if the presence of sunlight will affect growth and development. To measure growth and development of the field peas, the length and weight of the shoots and roots of the plants were measured. If the field peas grow in shaded sunlight, then the field peas’ root to shoot ratio will be lower than the root to shoot ratio for plants grown in sunlight. The independent variable wass the varying amount of sunlight: not shaded is the control and shaded is the treatment. The dependent variable was the root to shoot ratio in the field peas. In order to verify the hypothesis, an experiment using twenty-four plants, twelve under a shaded treatment and the other twelve under a no shade control. The results showed that control group had higher root to shoot ratios for both length and weight in comparison to the root to shoot ratios for the treatment group. Thus, the experiment illustrated that field peas in shaded environments do have lower root to shoot ratios in comparison to field peas in full sunlight. This experiment can help farmers with timing of growing crops so that adequate sunlight is allocated to the crops. In future experiments, it is pertinent that the plants are watered everyday.

Introduction:
P. sativum, or more commonly known as field peas, were the main focus of this experiment, and were used because they are cheap, grow quickly, and have a short reproductive life span. Field peas are also annuals so they can grow throughout the year making them a good plant for study. Field peas, like all other plants, have roots and shoots. Roots are the part of the plant that absorb nutrients and water and anchor the plant into the ground [Johnson: 2018]. Shoots, on the other hand, include the stems and the leaves of the plant, and aid in light capture and competition through lifting the plant up [Johnson: 2018]. Photosynthetic reactions take place in the chloroplasts of the leaves and provide the energy and sugar necessary for growth and development to occur. If solar energy allocation is compromised, then the field peas will show the lack of sunlight phenotypically through shorter sizes and lighter masses. This process of changing the allocation of resources based on environmental conditions is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson:2018]. Another study conducted found that plants changed their phenotypic plasticity in the presence of increased light by either increasing or decreasing their root to shoot ratios [Sims, et al: 2012]. The purpose of this experiment is to see how field peas change their phenotypic plasticity when the allocation of sunlight changes. Phenotypic plasticity is measured through root to shoot ratios of both length and weight. More specifically, how does varying amounts of sunlight, shaded versus not shaded, affect the root to shoot ratio in field peas? The independent variable is varying amount of sunlight, not shaded versus shaded. The dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio for the lengths and weights of the shoots and roots. With less exposure to sunlight, it is expected that P. sativum will have lower root to shoot ratios due to less growth because of less photosynthetic activity.

Materials and Methods:
First, P. sativum seeds, twelve pods to grow the plants in, vermiculite, and Miracle Grow were obtained. Two groups were planted. In both groups, 12 pods, six for each group, were used to plant 16 seeds in each pod. The seeds were planted in the pods in vermiculite and Miracle Grow. This first group was the control group and was placed in full sunlight in the greenhouse. The second group, the treatment group, was placed in a shaded location using a black transparent cover in the greenhouse. Before the plants were placed in their respective conditions, each pod was watered with 100 mL of water. The plants were then watered with 100 mL of water in each pod everyday for two weeks. Data was then collected. First, the plants were removed from the vermiculite by placing them in a tub of water and then separating the vermiculite from the roots. Then, 12 plants from each group were cut to separate the root and shoot. Each plant was cut at the same place, right above the seed. Each root and shoot was measured for length and weight in each group. Using these measurements, the root to shoot ratios for length and weight were calculated. After the experiment was completed, a statistical analysis using a two tailed paired t-test for length and weight was conducted. 

Results:
In the data, it can be seen that the treatment group had significantly lower root to shoot ratios than the control group. Figure 1 reveals that the control group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.96 ± 0.12 and the treatment group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.84 ± 0.09 for ratios involving weight.  For length, the control group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.61 ± 0.11 and the treatment group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.45 ± 0.10, which is displayed in Figure 2. The results in both Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate that field peas tend to have lower root to shoot ratios for both length and weight in decreased sunlight exposure. Statistical testing supports this tendency present in the figures. The first paired two tailed t-test was conducted using the root to shoot ratios for weight in the control and treatment groups (t-stat= 2.75, df=22, P=0.012). Another paired two tailed t-test was done with the root to shoot ratios for length in the control and treatment groups (t-stat= 3.83, df=22. P=0.00092). General trends in the data showed that the control group had higher root to shoot ratios for both length and weight. 


Discussion:
The results support the hypothesis because the removal of sunlight in P. sativum led to a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length. The reason for this occurring biologically is that the removal of sunlight caused for there to be less photosynthesis occurring since the amount of light capture in the shoots decreased. Therefore, the plants in the treatment group would allocate less of their resources to growing their shoots and roots leading to a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length. The control group had full sunlight and was able to carry out normal light capture resulting in its higher root to shoot ratios. In conjunction with the experimental results, the statistical results support the conclusion that sunlight allocation does affect the root to shoot ratios in field peas. The root to shoot ratio for weight was significantly lower in field pea plants that were in an area that was shaded. The root to shoot ratio for length was significantly lower in field pea plants that were in an area that was shaded. Thus, there is a significant difference between the control group being not shaded and the treatment group being shaded. In this experiment, however, there is one error in the methods where the plants were not watered for a few days due to a hurricane. Access to the building was denied during this time so the plants were not watered and this resulted in less growth in both plants; therefore, resulting in slightly skewed data. In future experiments, the methods need to be altered in order to account for the error in watering. Despite the error, the results in the experiment and the statistical results confirm that the hypothesis is supported. Other published studies found that other species also display results similar to the root to shoot ratios found in this experiment. For example, one study revealed that 13 tropical tree species in Barro Colorado Island aslo have lower root to shoot ratios for trees that are grown in shade rather than in sunlight [Kitajima: 1994]. The experiment conducted using sunlight allocation is important because it can help farmers develop effective cropping and planting methods in order to ensure that plants that require plenty sunlight acquire that amount of sunlight. Thus, farmers can harvest crops that grow more. P. sativum root to shoot ratios for length and weight is affected by the allocation of sunlight as less sunlight results in fewer photosynthetic reactions leading to less growth and development.
