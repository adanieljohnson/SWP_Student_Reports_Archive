Title: The Effect of Lananthum Chloride on strength of Frog leg muscle contractions

Abstract:
In biology, it is important to understand how muscles contract and what inhibits or helps this process. The injection or addition of neurotransmitters commonly found in the neuromuscular junction and their blockers serve as a way of answering the question of how muscles contract. In this experiment, researchers observed how the injection of a well known calcium blocker in frog legs, lananthum chloride, affects the strength of muscle contractions of muscle contractions. We found that the injection of this calcium blocker did significently inhibit the muscle contraction strength of the frog leg muscle, therefore supporting our hypothesis that the effects of the calcium blocker would be inhibitory. The results gathered and analyzed by the paired T-test suggest also support the hypothesis.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles of both vertebrates and invertebrates are made up of multiple myofibers. These are connected by connective tissue, forming functional groups. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. When all of this occurs, it assists in the contraction of a muscle, as a contraction happens by action potentials being fired down a neuron in response to an external or internal stimulus. In addition, neurotransmitters are a crucial part of this process. Specifically calcium (Ca2+), flows in through voltage gated Ca2+ channels to the presynaptic membrane and helps the vesicles in the presynaptic cell fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine into the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [Yang et. al: 2013]. The substance Lanthanum chloride is known to block voltage-gated calcium channels. With this information, it is hypothesized that if Lanthanum chloride is applied or injected into a muscle, then it will block voltage gated calcium channels and inhibit the strength of contractions. 

Materials and Method:
Research began experimentation by collecting 3 previously prepared frog legs and placing them in the dissecting pan. Next dissecting procedure was performed on all three legs. The skin was grasped at the top of the legs and pulled down toward the foot, Then the skinned leg was laid down and moistened with frog ringer solution. The inner thigh muscles were then separated to reveal the white sciatic nerve accompanying blood vessels. The nerve was then freed from attached connective tissue. A string was tied to its respective and severe end of the Gastrocnemius muscle to hook on the direct stimulus apparatus. The direct stimulus apparatus was set up by connecting the end block to a wire that went through a apparatus computer unit and then was plugged into a computer, which then by pressing the apply stimulus button after setting it to a certain stimulus level, would apply an electrical stimulus, track the strength of the contractions, and then display them through charts and line peaks. The frog leg set of 3 were tested for these different stimulus levels initially without the injections, making them the controll group. Afterwards, each frog leg was injected with 0.2 Ml of Lanthanum chloride into the Gastrocnemius muscle, making it the experimental group. contraction strength was then tested again with the direct stimulation apparatus, then data was compiled and calculated for significance with a paired T-test.
 

Results:
The data presented supports the hypothesis that lanthanum chloride inhibits contractions in frog leg muscles. The mean for strength of contraction was for the controll group was 1.543 with a standard deviation of 0.863. The mean strength for experimental group of frog legs was 1.834 with a standard deviation of 0.125.  All data mentioned is rounded to the nearest 1000th place. We used a paired t_test to analyze our results. The paired t_test also revealed results of (d.f.=2, T = 3.18, P = 0.018). This results is statistically significent.

Discussion:
The statistical results calculated show the averages for the controll and experimental injection group being statistically significent. From figure one, researchers can see that there was a higher mean in the experimental group than in the controll group regarding strength of contractions. This can also be seen through the collected data trends and how in averages in the controll group frog legs do not respond to stimulus until a 0.3 level of stimulus is added, while in the experimental group response to stimulation is shown even at 0.2 applied stimulus level. These results not only support our hypothesis, but suggests that lanthanum chloride is an effective calcium blocker and that calcium inhibitors as a result reduce or inhibit the strength of contractions.
