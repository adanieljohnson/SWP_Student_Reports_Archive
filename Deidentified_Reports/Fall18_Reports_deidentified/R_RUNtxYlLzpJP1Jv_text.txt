Title: Measuring Gastrocnemius Contraction Before and After Caffeine Injection in Southern Leopard Frog

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system, consisting of an organism’s muscles and nerves, is one way that organisms respond to their internal and external environments. It is common knowledge that caffeine is a stimulant, leading one to wonder how in particular caffeine affects the neuromuscular system, in particular muscle contractions. This paper examines caffeine’s effect on the gastrocnemius muscle contractions in the Southern Leopard frog. It is hypothesized that if injected with caffeine, the muscle’s contraction will be greater than if not injected. In this experiment, three frog legs were skinned and the sciatic nerves were exposed. Using LabScribe, each leg was stimulated with one voltage for five pulses to cause muscle contractions. The resulting forces were recorded in the form of an electromyogram. The same three frog legs were then injected with 0.1mL of caffeine and the muscle was again stimulated with one voltage for five pulses. An electrogram recorded the resulting forces. The muscles’ responses were averaged in two groups: before and after caffeine injection. Using a two tailed paired t-test, it was determined that the results were significant, supporting our hypothesis: injecting the gastrocnemius muscle with caffeine causes greater muscle contractions.

Introduction:
One way that organisms respond to internal and external environments is through the neuromuscular system [Johnson: 2018], and the neuromuscular center consists of all of the muscles in the body, as well as the nerves around them. Bodily movements are controlled by messages from the brain that travel to the muscles, and the messages get to the muscles through the nervous system. [Neuromuscular system: 2018]. Caffeine is a stimulating drug that affects the central nervous system, heart, and blood. It is consumed widely today as it is found in many foods and drinks: coffee, sodas, energy drinks, cocoa, and the list continues [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica: 2017]. Because of its commonality, it is important to examine how caffeine affects the body; for example, many studies have been done on how caffeine affects different muscle contractions. As shown by Gubareff and Sleator, caffeine affects the strength of muscle contractions as well as increases the length of action potentials in the atria muscle of guinea-pigs [Gubareff: 1965]. A muscle contraction is one way that an organism responds to its internal or external environment [Johnson: 2018], and this experiment examines the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemius muscle contraction of Southern Leopard frogs. The Southern Leopard frog was chosen because frogs and humans have some bodily similarities: both frogs and humans have a gastrocnemius muscle in their legs, as well as a sciatic nerve near the muscle. The Southern Leopard frog was chosen because of its commonality and abundance in the Coastal Plain [Norman: 2015]. The independent variable is the presence or absence of caffeine and the dependent variable is the muscle contraction measured in volts, and it is hypothesized that if caffeine is injected into the muscle, then there will be a greater contraction than if caffeine was not injected. Caffeine is a stimulant, which means that increases alertness while raising blood pressure and heart rate [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica: 2017], which is why it is hypothesized that caffeine will increase the muscle contractions of the Southern Leopard frog.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were labeled L1, L2, and L3 and were placed into separate dissecting pans. We skinned each leg by pulling the skin down the leg with a pair of forceps and applied Ringer’s solution to keep the legs moist; Ringer’s solution was applied throughout the experiment. With a dissecting probe we separated the inner thigh muscles of L1 in order to expose the sciatic nerve; next with forceps and a dissecting needle we exposed the nerve from its tissues. We pinned the leg in order to keep the nerve exposed and to keep the leg from moving as we stimulate the nerve. The pins connecting the electric stimulus and the frog leg were placed directly on the sciatic nerve. Using LabScribe we set the stimulus mode to pulse, the number of pulses to five, and the stimulus amplitude to 1.0 V. After hitting record, electromyograms were generated, showing the voltage stimulated by the muscle for each pulse. We then injected the gastrocnemius muscle with 0.1 caffeine mL. With the LabScribe setting unchanged, we again recorded the voltage stimulated by the muscle. We repeated the process describe above for L2 and L3 and used a two tailed paired t-test to analyze our data.

Results:
The average voltage stimulated by the muscle contraction before caffeine was injected was 0.193 v with a standard deviation of 0.229 whereas the average voltage stimulated by the muscle contraction after caffeine was injected was 0.509 v with a standard deviation of 0.0439 (Table. 1). The p-value of the paired t-test was 0.00000263. A visual representation of the mean of the contraction stimulated in volts before and after caffeine was injected into the muscles is also shown. The error bars on Before Caffeine have a value of 0.229, and the error bars on After Caffeine have a value of 0.0439 (Graph 1).

Discussion:
Because our p-value was less than 0.05, our results are significant, and our hypothesis was supported. We know that caffeine does cause greater muscle contractions in the Southern Leopard frog gastrocnemius muscle, and the results did not happen by chance. Caffeine was hypothesized to cause great muscle contractions because Gubareff and Sleator previously showed that caffeine affects the strength of muscle contractions as well as increases the length of action potentials in the atria muscle of guinea-pigs [Gubareff: 1965]. Also, because caffeine is a stimulant, [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica: 2017], it makes sense that it would increase the muscle contractions in the gastrocnemius muscle. These results are important because despite the fact that caffeine is a stimulating drug, it is widely consumed today; for example, many popular drinks contain caffeine: soda, coffee (unless the coffee is decaffeinated) and energy drinks [The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica: 2018]. Even though both frogs and humans have gastrocnemius muscles and sciatic nerves, based on these results future studies should examine how caffeine impacts specifically human muscles. Also, this experiment examined its effect on the neuromuscular system, and it should be determined whether or not caffeine affects any other body systems. Because caffeine is so commonly consumed it is important to determine how it affects the rest of the human body.
