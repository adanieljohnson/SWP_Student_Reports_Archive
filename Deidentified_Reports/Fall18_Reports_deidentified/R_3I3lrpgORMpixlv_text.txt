Title:  The Comparison of Brassica oleracea’s Ability to Transfer Electrons to Spinacia oleracea’s Ability to Transfer Electrons

Abstract:
Plants obtain energy through photosynthesis and the transfer of electrons that is stimulated by this light reaction. Different types of plants go through different rates of electron movement based on the context of their leaves or prevalence of chloroplasts within their cells. This experiment tested the ability for kale and spinach leaves to transfer electrons during light and dark reactions. It was hypothesized that kale leaves would have a faster rate of electron transfer due to their denser chloroplast composition. Additionally, it was hypothesized that the light exposed chloroplasts would exhibit faster rates of electron transfer. Kale and spinach leaves were crushed and liquified into samples with concentrated chloroplast levels. These samples were then checked for absorbance levels and compared over 10 minute intervals for a total of 30 minutes. Average absorbance levels for spinach decreased gradually after each interval while the kale had no trends over the 30 minute light induced interval. Results were not statistically significant. The experimental hypothesis was rejected because there was not a faster rate of electron transfer for the kale leaves. 

Introduction:
All organisms obtain and use their energy in a variety of ways. Using photosynthesis, plants capture and store their energy from the sun. This stored energy goes directly into the mitochondria and is also released into the cytoplasm of the cell using glycolysis. All of this stored energy in the mitochondria will go through respiration. Photosynthesis and respiration are similar because both involve multiple redox reactions. The energy that is being used by both continues to generate a proton gradient that will then be used to synthesize ATP. During the entire process of photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation through their chlorophylls. Additionally, chloroplasts will pass electrons through different electron acceptors to yield the production of oxygen. This entire reaction is known as the Hill reaction. Chloroplasts are incredibly essential for plants during the process of photosynthesis because of their ability to generate ATP and electron movement throughout the cell [Johnson: 2016]. Due to the importance of the chloroplasts in photosynthesis, photosynthesis has been improved with alterations in chloroplast composition [Evans: 2013]. Even though chloroplasts and this mode of energy processing is used in all plants, different plants have other factors that may either increase or decrease their electron movement within the cell. Additionally, there are multiple environmental factors that effect a plant’s ability to undergo photosynthesis, such as increased light. In kale plants, increased rates of photosynthesis were correlated with increased light, following a regular biological circadian rhythm during the day [Edwards et. al: 2011]. In the upcoming reaction, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) will be used to test electron movement. As DCIP accepts electrons, it changes from dark blue to a lighter blue and even potentially clear. The lighter the color of the final solution, the more electrons have been transferred since the beginning of the experiment. Thus, DCIP reduction can be used to determine whether or not the electrons have transferred. We hypothesize that kale will have a higher rate of electron movement compared to spinach because kale has a thicker leaf because kale leaves has more intracellular space and more mesophyll cells that contain chloroplasts. The greater the number of chloroplasts, in the mesophyll cells, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. 

Materials and Methods:
2 mortar and pestles, 2 medium-sized beakers, 6 50 milliliter beakers, and 6 50 milliliter centrifuge tubes were cooled on crushed ice. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and 4 medium-sized kale leaves were removed. When the mortar and pestles became cold, the spinach and kale leaves were added to separate ones. Then 10 milliliters of grinding buffer were added to both the spinach and kale mortar and pestles. The separate solutions were then ground until they turned into a slurry. 
Then 10 ml of grinding buffer were added to the spinach, mixed with the spinach slurry, and then the entire volume of green slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker; the same process was followed for the kale leaves. The remaining green liquid were transferred to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. The remaining green liquid from the kale was transferred to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A - Kale”, and spin it at 200 x for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. The liquid was poured out of the tube marked “A - Spinach” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Spinach”. The liquid was poured out of the tube marked “A - Kale” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Kale”.  Then the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees. The 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 x for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. After, the supernatant was poured into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C - Spinach”. The liquid was poured into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C - Kale”. Then 20 ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and the pellet was broken. The spectrophotometer was turned on and set to 600 nm. 1 blank tube was prepared for the spinach and the kale with 8 milliliters of water and 2 milliliters of reaction buffer, 100 mM phosphate of pH 6.5, labeled 1 and 2 respectively. Then 3 test tubes were prepared with 6 milliliters of water, 2 milliliters of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 milliliters of reaction buffer and then labeled as 3, 4, and 5. 12 more test tubes were prepared with 6 milliliters of water, 2 milliliters of DCIP, 2 milliliters of reaction buffer and labeled as 6-15. Then 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts were added to blank 1 and 6 other test tubes, labeled 6-11. 100 uL of kale chloroplasts were added to blank 2 and 6 other test tubes, labeled 12-17. All test tubes were mixed immediately after the chloroplasts were added. Then the mixtures were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was blanked using blank 1 and blank 2 for the spinach and kale respectively. Then initial absorbance values were taken for all of the test tubes. Test tubes 1-8, and 12-14 were placed in lamp light. Test tubes 9-11 and 15-17 were placed in darkness. After 10 minutes, the spectrophotometer was blanked with spinach blank 1 and absorbances were recorded for spinach samples, test tubes 6-11. Then the spectrophotometer was blanked with kale blank 2 and absorbances were recorded for kale samples, test tubes 12-17. After 10 more minutes (20 min total) in light or dark, the spectrophotometer was blanked again with each sample and absorbances were recorded a second time. After 10 more minutes (30 min total) in light or dark, the spectrophotometer was blanked again with each sample and absorbances were recorded a second time. A two-tailed t-test was employed to compare the absorbance rates of kale and spinach. 


Results:
	Average light absorption levels for spinach leaves gradually decreased over the 30 minute interval (Figure 1). Kale leaves increased from initial absorbance level to the 10 minute absorbance level, decreased to the 20 minute absorbance level, and then increased again to the 30 minute absorbance level (Figure 1). The line of best fit shows the spinach leaves decreasing over the 30 minute interval and the kale leaves increasing over the 30 minute interval (Figure 1). Absorption levels were taken in A at 600 nm. The results from this the two-tailed t-test indicate that the data was not statistically significant (t-value=1.49, P=0.1855). 
	The average initial absorbance of the light induced chloroplasts of the spinach was 0.221 A, the 10 minute absorbance was 0.0307 A, the 20 minute absorbance was 0.012 A, and the 30 minute absorbance was 0.001 (Figure 2). The average initial absorbance of the light induced chloroplasts of the kale leaves was -0.0487 A, the 10 minute absorbance was 0.29 A, the 20 minute absorbance was 0.036 A, and the 30 minute absorbance was 0.075 A (Figure 2). In Figure 2, the standard deviations of the initial spinach, 10 minute spinach, 20 minute spinach, and 30 minute spinach were ± 0.0598, ±0.133, ±0.00386, ±0.00 respectively. Also, in figure 2, there the standard deviations of the initial kale, kale after 10 minutes, kale after 20 minutes, and the kale after 30 minutes were ±0.0539, ±0.0533, ±0.0412, ±0.099. 


Discussion:
Photosynthesis is a chemical reaction that uses chloroplasts to absorb sunlight and  will assist in converting light energy into chemical energy. Chloroplasts are organelles in plant cells that differ in multitude depending on the type of plant. The hypothesis of this experiment, as stated previously, was that kale would have a higher rate of electron transfer, meaning that it would have the largest difference in percent change and the lowest overall final absorbance level because of the higher density of chloroplasts in kale leaves compared to spinach leaves. The results from this experiment do not support the hypothesis. The spinach trends from this experiment followed expectations because higher electron movement should, theoretically, occur when the leaves enter light. The spinach leaves started at a high absorbance of 0.221 A and then ended at an average value of 0.001 A after 30 minutes of being induced in light (Figure 2). This decrease indicates that there was more electron transfer as the spinach leaves were absorbing more sunlight. Additionally, the large p-value of 0.1855 indicates that these results were not statistically significant. This p-value indicates that there was approximately an 18.55% chance that our results were solely based on chance. 
As light enters into a plant’s chloroplasts, there are light driven reactions in photosystem 1 and photosystem 2. When these light driven reactions, there is a driven reaction of protons that are pumped into the thylakoid lumen, which is then used to generate ATP within the cell. The dependency of light on photosystems 1 and 2 indicate that the plants would end up transferring more electrons into their systems in the presence of light [Rochaix: 2010]. Hypothetically, the kale leaves should have had lower absorbance levels as time went on. Since the kale leaves began at a negative absorbance level, the values from the leaves did not decrease.  
	Moreover, potential errors include the spectrophotomer used when obtaining absorbance values. The spectrophotomer in this experiment continued to fluctuate between positive and negative values after a certain point of data collection. At this point in the experiment, the same spectrophotometer was used in order to keep uniformity, but it seemed that the machine was malfunctioning. Additionally, another potential error could have occurred when grinding the kale leaves. The kale leaves were incredibly thick and large. Thus, the leaves took a lot more time to grind. When straining the leaves, it appeared that the leaves were not siphoning through the cheesecloth at the same level that the spinach leaves were. There may not have been enough kale that was actually strained, which may have accounted for the unaccounted for results for the kale leaves. The inability to grind the kale leaves resulted in less of the leaves being strained through the cheesecloth, which in turn effected the amount of chloroplasts that may have been strained from the solution. Future studies should have equal straining of both kale and spinach leaves in order to level the amount of chloroplasts in the experiment. The equal amount of strained liquid would allow for the number of chloroplasts from both the kale and spinach to be equivalent. Further studies can examine both of these leaves with a much larger sample size. With a lot of the data obtained from this experiment, specifically in the kale leaves, there was one outlier that skewed the average data and significantly affected the percent changes.
