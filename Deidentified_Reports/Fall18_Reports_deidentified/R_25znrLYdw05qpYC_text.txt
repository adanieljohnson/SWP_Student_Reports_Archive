Title: The Non-Effect of Potassium on the Threshold of an Action Potential in Roma pipleus. 

Abstract:
Nerves are used to quickly communicate between different parts of the body of an organism, and to illicit a reaction faster than hormones.  We hypothesized that adding potassium to the gastrocnemus muscle of a Roma pipleus, or frog, leg would increase the threshold for an action potential.  To find this out we took three frog legs and found the controll threshold and then added 0.1 Ml potassium to each of the legs and then found the new threshold for an action potential.  The results we saw indicated that there is no significent difference in the threshold size in the controll and with frog legs with potassium added.  

Introduction:
Nerves are cells in the body of an organism that are used for the transport of information and to illicit a reaction.  Nerves function rapidly to transport this information and get a response as quickly as possible, transporting information faster than hormones, another communication system used by organisms.  Muscles are one of the many parts of the body controllled by nerves.  Roma pipleus, or commonly known as a frog, are used to study nerve controll of muscle functions due to the pronounced gastrocnemus muscle, the large muscle in frog legs, and sciatic nerve, the main nerve that controlls frog legs.  An action potential can be achieved by stimulating both the gastrocnemus and the sciatic nerve externally and can be read using a myogram.  Potassium is one chemical used in the process of an action potential.  Other research has shown that muscle activity is associated with an increase in potassium ions outside the cells in muscles [Shushakov: 2007].  We hypothesize that injecting potassium into the gastrocnemus muscle will increase the action potential threshold, when stimulating the sciatic nerve.  

Materials and Method:
First, we took our three frog legs, each was a controll for itself, and removed the skin from the legs.  Then we took the legs and cut one end of the gastrocnemus muscle off the leg and made sure the muscle was not connected to the rest of the leg with any connective tissue.  We then located the sciatic nerve and bound the muscle around the sciatic nerve down to expose the nerve.  Next, we tied the cut end of the gastrocnemus to a force transducer, which measured the size of the action potentials in a myogram.  From there, we applied an electrical signal to the sciatic nerve and noted if we saw an action potential; if an action potential was seen we lowered the amplitude applied until we found the minimum amplitude needed to produce an action potential and raised the amplitude if necessary.  After finding the controll, we then injected each frog leg with 0.1 Ml of 20 micromolar potassium and found the threshold of each leg with the potassium added.  We then performed a paired t_test to see if the difference is significent.  

Results:
Our results showed that we had an average of 0.066, with a standard deviation of ± 0.026, for the controll threshold of the frog legs.  We had an average of 0.079, with a standard deviation of ± 0.043, for the threshold of the frog legs with potassium added.  The averages with standard deviation for both groups is shown in figure 1.  The trend we see is that the experimental group average was higher than the controll group, but had a larger standard deviation, meaning the values had a larger range than the controll group.  While we see this trend, our data showed there was no significent difference between the controll and experimental group (t_stat= 1.04, d.f.= 2, P= 0.407). 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis, that is adding potassium to the gastrocnemus muscle will increase the threshold for an action potential.  Two of our three frog legs did in fact have a higher threshold than their controll threshold, but we had one that had a lower threshold when potassium was added.  This would indicate that potassium does not have an effect on the threshold for an action potential.  Our results contradict previous research, which indicated that nerves were less excitable, less likely to produce an action potential, in the presence of higher potassium levels [Boërio: 2014].  Biologically, our results do not follow the precedent set by previous research, in that increasing potassium in the muscle would lead to decreased excitability, or higher threshold.  This could be due to the amount of potassium, or the concentration, we injected into the muscle, where previous research injected more, the amount we injected was not significent enough to make a difference in the threshold.  It would be needed to run the same experiment with a larger amount, or higher concentration, of potassium to determine if potassium truly has no effect on the threshold in frog legs.  Our only source of error would be if we accidently allowed some of the potassium to touch the legs during the controll testing of the legs.  This would be possible as we prepped each leg and laid them on the testing surface for the controll tests with no barrier over them while we did the potassium test in the leg.  It is unlikely as we injected potassium instead of coating the leg, but some potassium could have dripped out of the leg and was not wiped up after the test.  Our test is important as our results could have an effect on how medicines are prescribed to patients for muscle disorders.  Potentially, doctors could have prescribed medicine containing potassium in the hopes it would delay muscle contraction, however they would now know that potassium has no effect on threshold for an action potential.

Figure 1.  Effect of potassium on the action potential threshold in frog legs.  The frog legs are acting as their own controll.  The experimental group consists of the controll legs injected with 0.1 Ml of potassium.  Averages were found using a force transducer to show myograms of the action potential.  Each bar represents 3 frog legs and the error bars is the standard deviation.*************************************************************************
