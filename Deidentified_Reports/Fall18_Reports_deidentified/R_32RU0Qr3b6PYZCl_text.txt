Title: A protein kinase A inhibitor’s ability to degrade the locomotive activity of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
All organisms must respond to environmental stimulus to maintain homeostasis and provide themselves with essential nutrients. Many species do this through the use of intracellular messenger molecules such as cyclic AMP. Physarum polycephalum is one organism that relies on cAMP to behave as a second messenger molecule and interact with protein kinase A (PKA). PKA serves as the primary kinase in systems responsible for the phosphorylation of different enzymes to activate and deactivate certain pathways. The number of pathways influenced by PKA is large, one of which is movement and locomotion. The present study uses a potential inhibitor of PKA, curcumin, in order to test if the effects of PKA on the Physarum migratory system are significant. Physarum uses actin microfilaments to migrate towards potential food sources and respond appropriately to other environmental stimuli. Our results indicated no significant difference in migratory behavior for Physarum treated with curcumin against those not treated with curcumin. This implies that PKA might not be essential to the pathways involved in the migratory response, but it is a questionable result that runs counter to many other studies involving Physarum and even cells in cancer patients being studied for medicinal purposes.

Introduction:
Slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is an easily obtainable and incredibly hardy organism excellent for study as a model organism due to the plethora of physiological systems it demonstrates for a relatively simple species. It uses actin microfilaments in order to migrate towards potential food sources [Johnson: 2017]. These sources can include various types of organic materials such as debris, bacteria, fungus, microbes, and, in this study’s case, oats.  Physarum, as with any organism, relies on various feedback mechanisms in order to respond to different stimuli in the environment. One pathway in this system that allows Physarum to respond its environment employs the use of intracellular second messenger molecules. Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger leveraged by Physarum and other eukaryotes to coordinate responses to the environment [Meena: 2014]. This system relies heavily on protein kinase A (PKA), an enzyme commonly activated by cAMP that has the capability to phosphorylate a whole host of subsequent enzymes. This phosphorylation can activate or deactivate different proteins, and the ubiquitous nature of PKA makes it involved in a large number of pathways [Johnson: 2017]. One pathway that relies heavily on PKA is cellular locomotion and migration [Qian: 2018]. As with any protein, there are compounds that can competitively or non-competitively inhibit the activity of PKA. Curcumin, for instance, is a known inhibitor of PKA and has the potential to prevent it from phosphorylating the proper enzymes in certain pathways which is likely to prevent basal cellular function because specific proteins will be wrongly activated, deactivated, or silenced. The present study hoped to test the ability of curcumin to prohibit normal locomotive activity of Physarum. We expected that curcumin, an inhibitor, would adversely affect the distance Physarum would be able to travel in a set amount of time towards a food source.

Materials and Methods:
This study began by cutting singular (1 x 1) cm squares in the center of each of the 2% water agar plates assigned to the control group. These locations were marked with a box on the underside of the plate to create a point of reference during observation.  A 10mM curcumin solution was prepared through a 1:20 dilution of 200mM curcumin in distilled H2O. The experimental, 2% agar plates were allowed to soak in 4 mL of 10mM curcumin solution for approximately ten minutes before the same excising and marking method was repeated. Physarum was then introduced into each well for both the control and experimental groups from a 1x1 cm block of 2% agar. This Physarum was adequately fed prior to being introduced to the experiment. An oat food source was then placed on the periphery of all six plates and their location marked with an “X” to serve as another frame of reference during observation.  The plates were then secured with tape, wrapped in tin foil, and placed in a black bag to control for light. The plates were then placed in an incubator at 25 degrees Celsius for 24 hours. Once this incubation period passed, the migratory distance of Physarum for each plate was determined, and a two-tailed T test was performed to test for a statistically significant difference between the distance the mold migrated for control and experimental treatments.



Results:
There appeared to be a clear and consistent difference in the distance that Physarum traveled based on the treatment of the agar plate it was to migrate over as evidenced by figure 1. Physarum that was treated with curcumin averaged a migration distance of 7.66 mm. This value is less than half of the mean migration distance of Physarum that was not treated with curcumin, 16.00 mm. Not only did the positive control group have a larger mean than the group on the plates that were treated with curcumin, each of the individual members of the control group migrated farther than each of the individual members of the experimental group. The shortest distance traveled by organisms receiving control group treatment was 13.6 while the farthest distance traveled by organisms receiving experimental group treatment was 9.7. Despite these differences, the results yielded a conclusion that there was not a significant difference in distance traveled by Physarum in the presence and absence of the PKA inhibitor, curcumin (t(3) = 2.882, p = 0.102263) as shown in figure 1.

Discussion:
Physarum and other related species must have the ability to utilize their actin microfilaments in order to migrate towards food sources. They rely heavily on feedback mechanisms to determine the location of these food sources and properly coordinate the appropriate response. These mechanisms often involve second messenger pathways to convey various messages amongst the cell and the organism, and one of these is the cyclic AMP pathway. Cyclic AMP acts as a signal in a system that results in the phosphorylation of some enzyme by PKA that will eventually result in some sort of desired effect. Some inhibitors, however, can interrupt this process which can manifest itself as abnormal cellular behavior. Curcumin, for instance, inhibits PKA across a wide phylogeny of life [Johnson: 2017]. Past studies have showed that PKA has profound effects on the migration of cells, and scientists were able to prove this in pancreatic liver cells demonstrating the ubiquity of this secondary messenger system and the potential applications that could be uncovered by understanding its role in the cell [Qian: 2018].  We hypothesized that curcumin would adversely affect the migratory capabilities of the slimemold, but, based on statistical testing, our hypothesis cannot be accepted. Curcumin does not, in fact, decrease the ability of Physarum migrate towards a food source according to our study. This would suggest that at a cellular, physiological level, PKA is not necessarily involved in the systems that cause Physarum to migrate towards food sources.  This conclusion is certainly not in line with our predictions or other scientists’ findings based on reviewed literature involving slime mold and protein kinases [Eichinger: 1996]. 
One potential reason for the discrepancy between the literature and our results might have nothing to do with the function of PKA at all. The Physarum we tested in this experiment was stored sitting on oats, a desirable food source for slime mold. Perhaps the Physarum was not expending its energy searching for food because it had adequate nutrition when we began testing it. Physarum has the ability to go extensive periods of time without food in “hibernation” and reactivate itself when a food source presents itself [Johnson: 2017]. Future experiments hope to explore concepts similar to the present study but with Physarum that is in more desperate need of finding a food source so that it will be more likely to respond to the presence of food with migration. This change will allow us to get a more accurate control measurement about the migration capabilities of Physarum without an inhibitor and should make the contrast between control and experimental treatments sharper. We are hopeful that we can learn from our mistakes and move forward with experimentation that will be more useful to the scientific community despite being unable to prove our hypothesis in the present study.
