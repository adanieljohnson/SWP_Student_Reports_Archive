Title: The Effect of Calcium on Growth of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Understanding the effect of calcium on the growth of Physarum polycephalum is important to understanding how cells work and function. After concluding the experiment, the results and data were statistically insignificent due to the p_value of 0.431. Even though the treatment group (calcium) showed a slightly higher average of change of surface area after 48 hours, the data is still inconclusive. Due to the n-value of three plates per group, this could have affected the results due to a small sample size. Furthermore, calcium was expected to cause a higher change in surface area since calcium influences growth. 


Introduction:
Slim mold, or Physarum polycephalum, is an organism with multiple nuclei located inside a single plasma membrane (Iwanaga: 2004). They are easy to see under microscopes, which is why they are useful for experiments like this, in addition to being easy to handle. Each physarum is referred to as a plasmodium. Plasmodia share common behaviors , such as bidirectional cytoplasmic streaming, and movement relative to light (phototaxis), gravity (gravitaxis), and other molecule (chemotaxis) (Youatt: 1993). In this experiment, the effect of calcium on Physarum polycephalum growth is examined. Calcium ions have been implicated in the regulation of many metabolic processes such as cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, cell division, and membrane structure (Borle: 1973, Rasmussen: 1975, Berridge: 1975). Calcium is an essential requirement for the growth of all cells (Balk: 1973, Liang: 2018). Understanding how internal cellular compartments respond to variation in external calcium concentrations is important to a learning of the contribution and the relationship of different compartments. It is hypothesized that an increase of calcium will lead to more growth of the Physarum polychepalum. A one-tailed, paired t_test is used to analyze the data.


Materials and Method:
Three PDA, a general purpose medium for yeasts and molds, plates were melted in the microwave for forty seconds each. 1.5Ml of 50M calcium was added to each PDA plate. The plates were then cooled at room temperature until they hardened. Grid paper was taped to the back of each plate (controll and experimental). A 1cm^2 square was cut from the center of each PDA agar plate (controll and experimental). 1cm^2 squared were cut from the Physarum polychephalum stock and were placed in the middle of the agar plates. The plates were closed, taped, and wrapped in tin foil. They were then stored in a black bag for 48 hours. After 24 hours and 48 hours, the surface area of slime mold was measured. A one-tailed, paired t_test was run to analyze the data. As an important note, every time squares were cut out of the plates, the utensil was always cleaned in ethanol. 


Results:
The results show the effect of calcium on Physarum polycephalum growth. According to figure 1, there was only slightly more growth of slime mold in the treatment group. However, the data appears to be inconclusive since the p_value is 0.431. (p=0.431, dt=5, t=0.92). Because of this, the data is statistically insignificent. Each group had three plates. The treatment group only showed 0.25 more growth after 48 hours, but this data is not statistically significent, so there is no true conclusion. The results do not show enough statistical difference between the controll group and treatment group.


Discussion:
After concluding the experiment, it is inconclusive if calcium increased or decreased the growth of Physarum polycephalum. Due to the p_value, the data is statistically insignificent. Based on the results, calcium did not influence growth in anyway. In the future, it is important to have a higher sample size since it reduces error. Next time, a higher n-value will be used in order to see if clearer and more accurate results occur. In other words, because each group only had three plates each, this could have happened by chance. Calcium is important to study on growth since it plays so many vital roles in many different organisms. In a study done by Constantin and Meerschaert, they found that tightly regulated calcium concentrations provides a more suitable mechanism to regulate microfilament organization (Constantin and Meerschaert: 1706). In the future, a higher n-value will be used to avoid error. Based on the results collected, there was not enough of a statistical difference between the controll group and the treatment group. After completing the lab, calcium did not show a positive correlation with slime mold growth over a 48 hour time period. There are a few possible causes for inconclusive results. A bad stock might have been used. In addition, there could have been contaminated mold present in the plates before commencing the lab since some of the controll and treatment plates both had white mold (Achenbach: 1981). After completing, the null hypothesis was rejected due to the p_value. Even though the results of the experiment were inconclusive, observations can be drawn that calcium slightly increased the change in surface area over the 48 hour time period. But, more experimentation needs to be done in order to fully prove its factuality.
