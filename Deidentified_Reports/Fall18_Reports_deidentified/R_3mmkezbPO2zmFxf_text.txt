Title: The Impact of Herbicide Inhibition in Chloroplast Samples of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration are vital to living organisms. However, these same processes can be altered or interrupted through various biochemical inhibitors. In our experiment, we tested a dilution of DCIP, an electron carrier, with, store bought herbicide, homemade herbicide, and an acid rain dilution. The goal was to observe these inhibitors on photosynthesis on Spinacia oleracea and measure the percent change in absorbance over a 30 minute period broken up into 3 sets of 10 minutes. Because DCIP turns from blue to colorless when photosynthesis is occurring, we are able to observe this transformation with a spectrophotometer. We hypothesize that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the chloroplasts without herbicide. We also hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes. The results indicate that the synthetic herbicide showed the least percent change of -19.22+/-3.39%, demonstrating the most inhibition of photosynthesis. Using an ANOVA test, the p-value for our data was 0.295 showing the inhibition was not statistically significant. However, this insignificance allows for room to draw different conclusions.

Introduction:
Energy is necessary for the survival of living things. This energy either comes from the sun, or is consumed through metabolizing glucose. Plants and other phototrophs use a process called photosynthesis to capture solar radiation which allows the production of glucose to occur. Inside of the plant leaves, chlorophyll is the location where this energy gets harvested. High energy photons from the sun light excites electrons within the chlorophyll to leave their electron carriers. This forms a proton gradient which then drives the synthesis of ATP. This ATP generated here is almost entirely used to power the production of glucose in the Calvin Cycle [Mabrouk: 2011]. From here this glucose can be harvested by other living organisms that metabolize it and use it for energy. The two pathways for metabolism are glycolysis, which happens in the cytoplasm, and cellular respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria [Mabrouk: 2011]. Together, cellular respiration and photosynthesis are two of the most important cellular processes for living organisms [Allakhverdiev: 2008].  
The electron carrier, previous mentioned, that lets go of its electrons to start the process of the electron transport chain and kick starts photosynthesis typically is NADP+. However, there is an alternative electron carrier that is used in this specific experiment. This electron carrier is known as 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). When oxidized, the DCIP has a deep blue color, but when reduced it changes to colorless. We can monitor the color change using a spectrophotometer, which will give the concentration of active chloroplasts that are undergoing photosynthesis. From here we can compare which of the herbicides inhibited photosynthesis the most. The general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light is called the Hill reaction and is what we are basing this experiment on. 
This experiment tested the effects of acid rain, homemade herbicide, and common store-bought herbicide (Round-up) in a solution with DCIP and 5 cut up leaves of Spinacia oleracea. All of these herbicides are used to prohibit photosynthesis from occurring. The Round-Up herbicide used, glyphosate, disrupts photosynthesis through oxidative stress from a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide accumulation [Gomes: 2016]. The next herbicide tested was the home-made herbicide. This was made up of vinegar and a clove oil product which was previously examined in a study as a use for weed control in sweet corn, potatoes, and onions, which all observed inhibition on weed growth [Evans: 2008]. The final herbicide tested, acid rain, has been an environmental concern, as it damages a variety of the plant through its low pH concentrations that denature proteins not only in the electron transport chain, but also other proteins that are needed to conduct a variety of other processes in the plant cell [Zhang: 2018]. 
	Along with the herbicides, we used blue light to start photosynthesis. Blue light has a powerful influence on both genomes, nuclear and plastid, in chloroplast development in plant cells [Poudel: 2008]. Blue light also was responsible for the highest number of stomata in all the genotypes with a significant difference compared to red light [Poudel: 2008]. Because of this, it is clear that blue light would be the best option to maximize photosynthesis and also limit variables that could sway the results of the experiment.
Knowing the background of each herbicide can be used to help make predictions and confirm validity of the herbicide’s effectiveness. By examining all of these factors in detail, the question of what herbicides are going to disrupt photosynthesis the most and also what about the herbicide is disrupting this process. These questions can be answered by comparing it to a control with active chloroplasts and no herbicides present. We hypothesize that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the chloroplasts without herbicide.  We also hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes.  This hypothesis is based off of research that indicated the effects of acid rain, an extremely acidic solution (pH 4), affects more than just the electron transport chain. 


Materials and Methods:
 Materials Needed:

•	Blue Light Bulb
•	36 mL 130mM CDIP
•	38 mL (Reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5)
•	6 mL 25% Nitric Acid Dilution Solution
•	6 mL RoundUp 
•	20 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0)
•	6 mL Homemade herbicide
o	White Vinegar
o	Clove Oil

	
Methods for preparing solutions: 

1.	Dilute Nitric acid to a 1:4 ratio of acid to water. Need 6 mL of diluted solution. 
2.	Prepare home-made solution: 4 mL white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2 mL clove oil. 
3.	A blue light bulb hungover test tube solutions. 
4.	Attain 6 mL of Store Bought herbicide (RoundUp 1.33 Gal. Ready-to-Use weed and Grass killer). 




Methods:
	Obtain five medium sized spinach leaves. Remove the central vein from each leaf and then rinse with water and put into a mortar and pestle. Add 10mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Grind to a thick paste and then add an additional 10mL of cold grinding buffer. Strain the solution through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. Put the green liquid obtained into a 50mL tube and centrifuge for 13 minutes. 
      	Before adding the spinach paste, prepare reaction mixtures to go into 16 large test tubes.  Label test tube 1 as the blank containing 8mL of water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts.  Label the no chloroplasts test tubes negative control 2-4 and add w 6mL of water, 2mL of DCIP (130mM), and 2mL of reaction buffer. Label test tubes 5-7 with chloroplasts, and prepare with 6mL of water, 2mL of DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts. Label and prepare the chloroplasts with acid rain (tubes 8-10) with 1mL of 25% nitric acid, 5mL of water, 2mL of DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts.  Label and prepare tubes 11-13, home-made solution, and add the same mixture as the acid rain but mix with 1mL of the home-made solution (4mL white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2mL of clove oil) instead of the nitric acid. Label and prepare the tubes 14- 16 with chloroplasts with synthetic herbicide and mix the same way as well but mix with 1mL of RoundUp instead of nitric acid or the home-made solution. Transfer some of each solution into spectrophotometer cuvettes.
        After blanking the spectrophotometer, the absorbance for all of the samples at 600nm should be recorded as the time zero data. Place all of the samples in a rack under a blue light, and repeat the same absorbance measuring process at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for all samples.  After getting the data and calculating the percent changes after each absorbance, use an ANOVA test to measure the significance of the data.  The legitimacy of the ANOVA test can be ensured by running it with a negative control. The ANOVA test compares the absorbances of the groups with chloroplast to the groups with chloroplasts plus the different herbicides.


Results:
Our results gave us three absorbance readings from each of the five solutions we were testing to determine the reduction occurring in the system. With these absorbances, we found the percent change from time 0 to 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min as seen in Table 1 and observed in Figure 1. Observable trends all, but the solution with no chloroplasts, have an increasingly negative percent change the greater the time as seen in both Table 1 and visually in Figure 1 where each series is differentiated to show the trend towards negativity. Our data had a p-value for the percent changes of 0.295 determined from an ANOVA test, which yielded no statistical significance. The ANOVA test was used to compare each of the average absorbances with chloroplast sample to the average absorbances of the different herbicides tested. We know that this statistical test was accurate because we ran the test with a negative control. After the results were analyzed, the data did not support our hypothesis that acid rain would be seen to inhibit photosynthesis the most. Rather, the synthetic store-bought herbicide, Round-Up, showed the most inhibition. When compared to the -44.46%+/-15 change in absorbance of the control sample, all 3 inhibitors tested were shown to have been at least somewhat effective. Proving that our first hypothesis was correct: that it would show more inhibition than the control. However, the acid rain and home-made herbicide sample produced -29.63%+/-4.05 and -29.77%+/-7 change in absorbance, respectively. Inhibition was seen in both as they had a percent change in absorbance lower than the control by about 14%. However, the Roundup herbicide had an even greater effect on photosynthesis with a -19.22%+/-3.39 change in absorbance, which was over 20% lower than that of the control. Though this means our data is not statistically significant, we can still use it draw conclusions that can go beyond the scope of the experiment.


Discussion:
There are a variety of alternate explanations that can help explain why we got the results that we did. One of which could be simply that the synthetic herbicide was much more potent than the acid rain and homemade herbicide. The concentrations of both Round-Up and synthetic were not given on the bottle and we diluted our own concentration of acid rain. If these concentrations were measured in all the herbicides, we would have been able to rule out this source of error that contributed to our hypothesis being not supported.  
	Along with that, the actual physical coloring of each herbicide varied. The acid rain solution was almost entirely translucent, whereas the other herbicides had a darker tint to them. When combined with the DCIP solution, it was obvious that the samples were all different in their color and transparency. When the DCIP was added to the acid rain sample, it did not turn the solution as blue as the other samples. This would have altered our results through problems keeping the starting color consistent throughout all of the test samples. Just from the increase in clarity of the acid rain test sample, the DCIP could have caused us to think that photosynthesis was occurring in the acid rain test tube, as it started to look clearer immediately after adding in the acid rain. It was seen that acid rain decreased in absorbance by only 0.005 over 30 minutes, but that small decrease was calculated to be a 29.63%+/-4.05 change in absorbance. On the other hand, the homemade sample decreased in absorbance by 0.039 over 30 minutes, producing close to the same percent change in absorbance at 29.77%+/-7. From these results, it can be seen that even though the homemade sample decreased by much more overtime, the percent changes proved to be somewhat similar. Because the acid rain started at such a small absorbance, any small change in clarity appears to be a much greater percent change in absorbance than it actually was. We believe this statistical insignificance could come from errors in the way our assay or dilutions of DCIP and herbicides were conducted. 
	Another possible explanation for the results comes from a separate study that was conducted. Looking at acid rain and its environmental impacts on plant life, it can be seen how pollution and other environmental factors cause this phenomenon to occur. In an alternate study, acid rain’s impact on the electron transport chain and specifically the enzyme that generates ATP in eukaryotic systems, ATPase, was measured. These acid rain samples were made to mimic polluted areas and conditions where acid rain is likely to occur: industrial factories in wet climates, or volcanic areas. Looking further into this study, the results seemed to be somewhat inconclusive. It was inconsistent as to when photosynthesis was inhibited and when it wasn’t. That is, the different dilutions of acid rain seemed to have a large effect on the ATPase activity [Zhang: 2018]. This could help offer some insight as to why exactly acid rain wasn’t proven in our experiment to inhibit photosynthesis the most. If we had changed the concentration of Nitric Acid in our acid rain dilution or have done more research into the chemical components, I believe that our hypothesis would have been proven accurately. 
When putting this experiment in a larger scope of the real world, it is easy to see the environmental aspects associated with herbicides. Industrial farming operations use herbicides on crops to prevent weed growth. Even everyday home owners use weed killer by spraying herbicides directly onto weeds to maintain yards. This experiment was a close up look of the process of inhibition on plant life by specifically focusing on the disruptions of photosynthesis. It also can show the damaging effects of acid rain on our environment, because when looking at how it effects plant development compared to a home-made herbicide, acid rain is essentially just an herbicide falling from the skies. The problem here though comes when looking at the factors that promote acid rain precipitation, which are all largely from industrial pollution that is condensed in the atmosphere and then dumped back down through precipitation. This can be used for better environmental effects on nature, like what acid rain does compared to what an herbicide is designed to do. In a broader, more applicable way of thinking, this experiment can be extended to environmental awareness and the effects of pollution, as acid rain precipitation tends to come from a lack of environmental protection.
