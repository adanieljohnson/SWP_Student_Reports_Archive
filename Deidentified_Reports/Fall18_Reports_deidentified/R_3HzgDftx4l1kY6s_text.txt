Title: Effect of pH change on photosynthesis in [Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica] as measured by the Hill Reaction

Abstract:
     The proteins in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis are instrumental in the capture and conversion of light energy to chemical energy.  Reduction of DCIP, an alternative electron acceptor for NADP+, can be measured through the Hill Reaction, which results in a decrease in measured absorbance when DCIP is reduced. When treated with a pH buffer more acidic or basic than that of the Hill Reaction buffer (pH 6.5), it may change the environment of the stroma in the chloroplasts where the protons that reduce the electron carrier come from-- resulting in an inhibitory effect on the reduction of DCIP.  To test this hypothesis, the isolated chloroplasts of [Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica] leaves were reacted in a pH 4, pH 10, or neutral (pH 6.5) buffer and the difference between their initial and final absorbances were measured. Two one-tailed two-sample t_tests were then performed between the controll group and both the pH 4 and pH 10 groups which indicated no statistically significent difference between either treatment and the controll group. Although the slight decrease in absorbance could correspond to photosynthetic activity, these differences in measured absorbance were likely due to chance and not actual photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts.  

Introduction:
     Like all plants, [Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica] (kale) harvests light energy through the process of photosynthesis in addition to the capture of energy from glucose through cellular respiration. During the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH by proteins bound to the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplasts. These proteins capture light energy which is used to split water and release oxygen in order to create the high energy products which are then used in the light-independent reactions [Graham: 2017]. Reduction in chloroplasts can be indirectly measured through the Hill Reaction summarized below: 
2 H2O + 2 DCIP (blue) ⟶ 2 DCIPH2 (colorless) + O2

     The color change of DCIP from blue to colorless upon its reduction causes a decrease in measured absorbance at 600 nm. In many cellular processes, the environment of the cell must be at an optimum pH in order to function efficiently [Heber: 1975]. In order to determine the effect of a change in pH on the reduction of DCIP, chloroplasts isolated from kale leaves will be treated in a pH buffer of either 4 (acidic), 10 (basic), or 6.5 (Hill Reaction buffer pH, controll). 
	Previous studies have shown a pronounced effect of a shift in pH away from the optimum on the formation of oxygen as well as the reduction abilities of chloroplasts in spinach leaves [Heber: 1975]. The reduction of NADP+ to NADPH in the electron transport chain of the light-dependent reactions in chloroplasts causes a movement of protons across the thylakoid membrane. The reduction of NADP+ removes protons from the stroma, resulting in a lower pH in the thylakoid lumen and a higher pH in the stroma [Roach: 2014]. If the pH is altered to be more acidic or basic, it may create a change in the environment (amount of protons available) in the stroma with which NADP+ (or DCIP in the case of this experiment) can be reduced.  If the Hill Reaction is allowed to occur in chloroplasts of kale leaves in light at a pH more acidic or basic than that of the Hill Reaction buffer (pH 6.5), it may result in an inhibitory effect on the reduction of DCIP leading to a greater measured change in absorbance in these treatments after 30 minutes. 


Materials and Method:
To begin, 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes, a mortar and pestle, and a beaker were packed into crushed ice to chill. The central veins were then removed from a large kale leaf which was then rinsed with tap water and dried. The leaf fragments were then added to the mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of pH 8 grinding buffer and grinded into a paste. The paste was added to an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer and strained through cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Next, the liquid was transferred into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4℃. After 3 minutes, the supernatant was poured into a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 15 Ml of the grinding buffer and mixed, then separated into three conical tubes. 5 Ml of pH 4, pH 6.5, or pH 10 buffer were added to their corresponding labeled tubes and centrifuged again at 2800 rpm for 10 more minutes. Each pellet was then resuspended in 3 Ml of their corresponding pH buffer (either pH 4, 10, or 6.5) to increase the concentration of chloroplasts. 
Nine tubes were then labeled and filled with 2 Ml Hill Reaction buffer, 6 Ml of water, and 2 Ml 130 mM DCIP. 3 of the prepared tubes were used for the pH 10 chloroplasts, 3 tubes for pH 4 chloroplasts, and 3 for the controll (pH 6.5) chloroplasts. One blank tube was labeled and filled with only water and Hill Reaction buffer. The 2 negative controll tubes were labeled filled with 6 Ml of either pH 4 or pH 10 buffer, 2 Ml Hill Reaction buffer, 6 Ml of water, and 2 Ml 130 mM DCIP, but no chloroplasts. To begin the assays, 1 Ml of the enriched chloroplasts previously prepared were put in their corresponding labeled tubes (excluding the blank and the negative controlls). Each tube was then mixed and transferred into a spectrophotometer cuvette. After blanking the spectrophotometer, the absorbances of each tube were measured at 600 nm and recorded as Time 0. The cuvettes were then placed in a rack under a light for 10 minutes and the absorbances were measured and recorded again at 600 nm. This process was repeated and the absorbances of each cuvette were measured twice more, for a total of 30 minutes. Two one-tailed two-sample t_tests were then performed between the raw measured change in absorbances of the controll and pH 4 as well as the controll and pH 10 to test the statistical significance in one direction with assumed equal variance between groups at an α-value of 0.05. 


Results:
Over the duration of the 30 minute assay period, the colors of the liquids did not show any observable change. Most were a clear shade of dark blue but the negative controlls, as well as one tube in the acidic treatment (tube 2) and one in the controll group (tube 5), were visibly lighter than the others. Figure 1 displays the average change in absorbance as measured between the final absorbance (taken after 30 minutes) and that taken at time 0 for both pH treatment groups and the controll. The average change between final and initial measured absorbance for the controll (pH 6.5) treatment was -0.004 (SD= 0.005) while that for pH 10 was -0.002 (SD= 0.006) and that for pH 4 was -0.015 (SD= 0.014).  A one-tailed two-sample t_test performed between the acidic (pH 4) treatment and the controll yielded a P-value of 0.155 (T-stat = 1.16, α-value = 0.05, d.f. = 4) and that performed between the basic (pH 10) treatment and the controll yielded a P-value of 0.159 (T-stat = 1.40, α-value = 0.05, d.f. = 4) which was also greater than the α-value of 0.05. 


Discussion:
As indicated by the results, a change in the pH of the buffer solution did not have a statistically significent effect on photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of [Brassica oleracea var. Sabellica] leaves as measured by the Hill Reaction. The two one-tailed two-sample t_tests performed between the controll and the acidic and basic treatments yielded P-values greater than the α-value of 0.05 (P-value = 0.155 for acidic, P-value = 0.159 for basic), indicating that the null hypothesis could not be rejected; therefore, the average change between final and initial absorbances were statistically insignificent for both treatments. The absorbance of all three groups decreased slightly after the 30 minute assay period, indicating that the chloroplasts may have been photosynthesizing and reducing the DCIP-- making the samples more clear. Although the basic treatment did have a smaller decrease in absorbance than the controll group, that of the acidic group was greater (yet still statistically insignificent). However, since both negative controll samples (which had no chloroplasts and therefore could not photosynthesize) also showed a slight change in absorbance across the 30 minute assay period, these measured changes were likely due to chance and not actual photosynthetic activity. These results did not support the hypothesis that measured absorbance in the treatment groups would be higher than in the controll as a result of inhibition of reduction of DCIP caused by a change in pH, which would have lead to a higher measured absorbance. If the acidic or basic pH buffer had inhibited the reduction of DCIP during photosynthesis, oxygen evolution and synthesis of the products necessary for the light-independent reactions would likely have been reduced as well [Heber: 1975]. 
Although an extra centrifuge step was performed on the isolated chloroplasts in order to minimize the effect of pH on the color and therefore absorbance of DCIP, pH contamination of the DCIP before the assays could have affected results and minimized the effects of pH change on the photosynthetic abilities of the chloroplasts during the assays because the pH buffers would be integrated into the chloroplasts instead of being added in the liquid mixture with the DCIP which could have caused the DCIP to be reduced before being added to the chloroplasts [Dean: 2006]. In order to minimize this effect in future studies, additional centrifuge steps of the chloroplasts could be performed on a larger sample of each treatment. Furthermore, the effect of pH on the reduction of DCIP (and therefore NADP+ in the light-dependent reactions) could be better understood if the chloroplasts were treated with more extreme basic and acidic pH buffers. More extreme conditions performed on a larger sample size with extra precautions during the isolation of the chloroplasts could lead to more accurate and informative results about the relationship between pH and the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
