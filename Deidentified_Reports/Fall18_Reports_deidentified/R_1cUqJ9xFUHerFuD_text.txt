Title: The effect of ethanol on the twitch amplitude of Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle

Abstract:
For this experiment, ethanol was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle from the Rana pipiens frog, and we observed whether or not there was an effect on the twitch amplitude. Ethanol had previously been researched and is a known inhibitor of nerve and muscle pathways, so we were curious as to what direct effect it could have on the gastrocnemius, which could then be related to a broader understanding of the effects alcohol has on our own systems. Using a 2% ethanol solution, we predicted there would be a statistical difference between the injected and non-injected muscles. Our p-value was .9933, which did not support our hypothesis and was therefore statistically insignificant, showing that there was no difference between the twitch amplitude of the ethanol-injected and non ethanol-injected muscles. This experiment could have been re-done or further studied using higher concentrations of ethanol solutions or possibly repeated exposure to ethanol and testing over time.

Introduction:
Organisms rely on nerves and muscles in order to sense and respond to internal and external cues from the environment. The neuromuscular system is much faster and more efficient than hormones, as it can respond in milliseconds using electric signals. This efficiency makes it a major system to aid an organism’s functioning. These nerves, found in animals, are present and are what allow for movement and control, as seen in the leg muscles of many organisms. Frog legs specifically can easily be artificially tested and recorded on a myogram to see the response of the muscle to an electrical stimulation, including the time to fatigue and the twitch amplitude of the muscle. Our experiment will focus on the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens frog leg and its twitch amplitude. The twitch amplitude, or strength of the muscle’s twitch in reaction to the stimulus, can be strongly effected by chemicals, Chemicals can have a strong effects on twitch amplitude, as changing the balance of the natural chemicals in the process can inhibit or excite a response. Ethanol has been proven to reduce the calcium ions in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, therefore limiting the overall process of muscle contraction. Previous research has suggested that alcohol misuse leads to muscle weakness, citing that ethanol, the active chemical, creates an inhibitory effect [Cofán: 2000]. This inhibitory effect could directly reduce the muscle’s ability to react to the stimulus, thus decreasing the twitch amplitude. For this experiment we will inject a Rana pipens gastrocnemius muscle with a 2% ethanol solution. Our hypothesis expects that if the muscle is injected with the ethanol there will be a statistical difference in twitch amplitude.

Materials and Methods:
First, 3 Rana pipens legs were collected and the skin was removed, then the inner thigh muscles were separated and pinned down to a dissecting pan with the gastrocnemius strung up on the force transducer. Throughout the experiment, the leg muscles were continually moistened with frog Ringer’s solution and handled carefully as not to disturb the sciatic nerve. The prongs of the force transducer were then attached into the base of the gastrocnemius muscle and LabScribe was used to record the threshold of the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. The LabScribe settings were set to frequency 1Hz, 5 pulse, pulse width 5ms, and pulse amplitude 0.000V. Next, the threshold stimulus of the muscle was determined by increasing the amplitude by 0.5Hz until reaching threshold. Then, three pulses were conducted at the threshold rate plus one which was 1.3Hz, and the voltage of the contraction was recorded. We then injected 0.2mL of 2% Ethanol into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. After waiting five minutes, three pulses were conducted at the threshold plus 1, and voltage was recorded. Overall, three pulses were conducted on each leg without ethanol, then after 5 minutes three pulses were conducted with 0.2mL of 2% Ethanol injected in the Rana pipiens gactrocnemius muscle. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to calculate the data.

Results:
Throughout the experiment, we noticed all the muscle’s twitch amplitudes decrease over time due to fatigue. As shown in figure 1, the average voltage for the normal (non-injected) gastrocnemius muscles was 0.4303 +/- .158 Volts. The average voltage for the ethanol-injected gastrocnemius muscles was 0.4313 +/- .1139 Volts. Our degrees of freedom was 4, our t-value was .008891, our one-tailed p value was .49666 and our two-tailed p value was .99332.



Discussion:
Our p-value was .99332 and was not statistically significant, so we failed to reject the null hypothesis. This result was probably due to the ethanol concentration of 2% being too low to have a significant effect on the muscle. To gain significant results or further the study we could try using a higher concentration of ethanol to possibly have more drastic effects on the muscle. It would first be important to find the concentration of ethanol that is significant enough to have inhibitory effects on the calcium ions in the muscle contraction cycle to be able to branch out the studies to the specific effects on the muscle.  Other further studies could use repeated exposure to ethanol, as to parallel the change that may occur over time as seen in patterns of alcohol abuse [Song: 1972]. These further experiments are not only useful to learning more about the inhibitory effects ethanol may have on the body, but is very relevant to seeing the direct effects alcohol can have on our own nerve and muscle systems.
