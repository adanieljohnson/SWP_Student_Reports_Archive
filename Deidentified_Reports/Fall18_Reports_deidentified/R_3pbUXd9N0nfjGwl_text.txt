Title: 20E Inhibitor Halts the Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Ecysdone (20E) is a vital hormone for development in most insects working together with the JH hormone to propagate the transition from an egg to an adult insect. The Manduca Sexta goes through this metamorphosis brought upon by the interaction of JH and 20E. However, inhibiting 20E in a Manduca Sexta will result in lower weights and heights as well as a lack of the ability to pupate. In this experiment, the experimental group was given a 20E inhibitor (azaguard) along with the regular Great Lakes Manduca diet while the controll group was fed a regular diet. The weight and lengths of both groups were recorded for the course of two weeks. The results indicated a statistical significance between the data collected for both the heights and weights of the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The results indicated that the hypothesis was supported as the experimental group had a lower weight and height average than the controll group. Also, the controll group was able to pupate while the caterpillars in the experimental group were unable to pupate and some died by the end of the two weeks. 	


Introduction:
Multicellular cell to cell communication is controllled by chemical signals that bind to the receptors of their appropriate target cells (Sadava 2017). These chemical signals are known as hormones. Hormones play a crucial part in the daily regulatory processes of complex organisms as well as their development. Insect development, in the majority of insects, is controllled by the secretion of hormones by the PTTH in the brain of the insect. The hormones 20E and JH are instrumental in the development of the insect from an egg to adulthood. When comparing both hormones, it has been demonstrated that the hormone 20E launches the development transitions from egg, larva, pupa, to finally an adult; the JH hormone transduces 20E impulses into responses for crucial stages (Dubrovsky 2015). This process occurs in the development in the insect Manduca Sexta which pupates from instar to instar through the combined secretion of both these hormones. The brain controlls the secretion of ecysdone (20E) through the activation of the tropic hormone on the prothoracic gland with various secretions of the hormone occurring throughout development (Nijout 1974). This raises the question of how inhibiting 20E could affect the development of the insects and their survival. The inhibition of these in halting the development of insects could be crucial in real world scenarios such as insect population controll. This raises the question of how the inhibition of 20E will affect the pupating caterpillars and if they will be able to fully pupate. If caterpillars are exposed to the 20E inhibitor (azaguard), it will stunt development consequently preventing the caterpillar from transitioning to the pupation stage halting their growth and weight. 


Materials and Method:
In order to test if the 20E inhibitor will affect development in Manduca Sexta caterpillars, eight caterpillars are split up into two groups. Within each group, four caterpillars were placed in plastic containers with perforated lids to along oxygen to reach the developing caterpillars.  One group served as the controll group for the experiment and was fed the Great Lakes Manduca diet normally fed to developing Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The other four caterpillars served as the experimental group and were given the Manduca Sexta food with ten drops of the 20E inhibitor each time they are fed. The controll group was 10 drops of distilled water along with the food in order to prevent the food from drying out and maintaining the same consistency as the food fed to the experimental group. Each caterpillar is given 10g of food every time their food is consumed and each group is stored in a temperature controllled Celsius incubation chamber in a twelve hour dark; twelve hour light cycle. The caterpillars were weighed and measured everyday for two weeks. These measurements were recorded in grams and centimeters. In order to reproduce statistically significent results, a t test will be conducted comparing both groups to determine if the data is significent to support the hypothesis. Also, the means of both groups are found through  T tests in order to further support statistically significance. 
					


Results:
	The results of the experiment indicated that the mean weight of the controll group was 4.97 g and the mean weight of the experimental group was 4.43 g comprised of all the data collected in the two weeks of the experiment. To the same accord, the mean length of the controll was 5.5 cm and the mean length of the experimental group was 5.4 cm. The controll group and the experimental group were both statistically different to each other when it comes to both weight and height. This was determined by finding the p values of both groups when it came to length and weight. The p value for all the data compiled for weight for both the experimental and controll group was 0.099 making it statistically significent as it is greater than 0.05. Similarly, the data collected for length for both groups had a p value of 0.82. By the end of the two weeks, the controll group was able to pupate while the experimental group was not. 



Discussion:
According to the results and observations, the hypothesis presented in this experiment was supported. The t tests demonstrated a statistical difference between the weights and lengths of the controll and experimental group. Both p values for the length data and weight data were above 0.05 indicating a statistical difference between the data. Also, the mean length and weight of the controll group was greater than that of the experimental. The insect hormones JH and 20E are crucial to insect development and when one is inhibited the insect cannot develop or survive. 20E regulates the timing of molting in insects and without the small increase of 20E during the commitment impulse the caterpillar cannot go through the steps to commence metamorphosis (Johnson 2018).  As a result, the experimental group receiving the inhibitor was able to develop and pupate unlike the controll. The importance of hormones has been acknowledged by scientific researchers for many years. In relation to insect hormones, various scientific research has been presented that demonstrates the importance of JH and 20E and insect development and how the nature of their secretions and timing affects insect growth. Research has concluded, that the the time of PTTH secretion of insect hormones is correlated with the rate of growth (Nijout 1974). Although the means of the weight and length of the controll group were larger than the experimental, there were various instances throughout the two weeks of collecting data were the lengths of the weights of both group were similar or almost the same. However, the experimental group was able to properly pupate. This can be explained through previous research that indicates that the total bulk of food consumed that contributes to the weight and length has no effect on the timing of hormone secretion (Nijout 1974). Although larvas must reach a certain weight, once they reach it the commitment impulse can start and metamorphosis can occur. Inhibiting insect development can have various real world applications, one example being pest controll. Manduca Sexta can be considered a pest as they can destroy crops. Insecticides with growth regulating properties may negatively affect insect pests by inhibiting hormone secretion and blocking the biological pathways for development (Tunaz 2004).
