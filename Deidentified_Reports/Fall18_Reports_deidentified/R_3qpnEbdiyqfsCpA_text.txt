Title: Azadirachtin causes decreased food consumption in Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones, including juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone, control the physiological mechanisms of change in insect life cycle between larval instars and pupation. Knowledge of insect hormone regulation can be applied to agriculture and health, where pests or disease-carrying insects can pose problems. Chemicals that mimic hormonal functions, for instance, can alter the life cycles of certain pests, allowing agriculturalists to control damage to crops. This experiment specifically examined the role of azadirachtin, an ecdysone blocker, on the life cycle of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Two groups of Manduca larvae were reared and fed an artificial diet for 14 days where one group's diet supplemented by a dose of azadirachtin. Due to the ecdysone blocking properties of azadirachtin, we predicted larvae fed a diet containing the insecticide would not pupate but continue to grow. We collected data daily on larval mass and ran a two-tailed t-test. The resulting data indicated a significant difference (P = 0.0076) between the change in masses of each larval group, those fed a diet including azadirachtin being significantly lower than those not. From this, we concluded that azadirachtin decreases the overall food consumption of Manduca sexta and does not prevent pupation.

Introduction:
Hormones are responsible for the physiological processes that regulate the larval instars, molts, and pupation of holometabolous organisms. The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, proves to be an excellent model organism in this area of research; it demonstrates a holometabolous life cycle, is easily reared in a lab, and has already been extensively studied. The larval and pupal stages of Manduca sexta are controlled by the release of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone. JH determines the type of molt a larva will undergo, essentially keeping the larva in a juvenile state from molt to molt when concentrations are high. When JH production is drastically reduced in the fifth larval instar, metamorphosis will proceed uninhibited. Ecdysone, on the other hand, regulates the timing of each molt. A commitment pulse occurs when a rise in ecdysone occurs simultaneously with low JH levels, indicating to the caterpillar it has sufficient resources stored and can begin pupation [Nijout: 1976]. Administration of artificial hormones can induce a physiological response that alters the normal life cycle undergone by Manduca sexta larvae. These hormone-mimicking chemicals are relevant to modern agriculture because they can manage the presence of pests, for example: forcing tobacco hornworm larvae into pupation, after which their adult form will no longer destructively feed on tobacco plants, tomato plants, etc. One example of such a chemical is azadirachtin, an insecticide that blocks the signaling of ecdysteroid hormones. If used on Manduca sexta, it should leave only Juvenile hormone acting on the larvae, effectively removing the agent that initiates transition between larval instars and pupation. We predicted, therefore, that Manduca sexta given food mixed with azadirachtin would prevent the larvae from pupating, and as forced to remain in the larval stage would instead experience continued larval growth, compared to those that receive food not treated with azadirachtin.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta larvae were raised on artificial food at a constant incubate temperature of 25°C. All larvae were placed in separate identical containers. Four were designated to an experimental group which received an additional chemical supplement of azadirachtin to their food. The remaining four received water in lieu of the chemical additive to account for any affect added liquid would have on their diet. The four caterpillars fed azadirachtin each received 10 grams of food mixed with six drops of azadirachtin. The control group also received 10 grams of food each, but mixed instead with six grams of distilled water. All larvae were incubated and observed for 14 days. During this period, feces were discarded as needed and food was replaced as it ran low or dried out, adhering to the same procedure described above. The mass (grams) of each caterpillar was recorded daily, with the exception of three consecutive days (day 10 -12) in which weather conditions prevented access to the larvae. Upon completing data collection, the results were analyzed using a two-tailed, two-sample t-test.

Results:
All larvae entered pupation by the end of the experimental period except one, which showed evidence of a commitment pulse and, given more time, would have entered pupation as well. Larvae reared in the control group (C1-C4) all pupated. C2-C4 all pupated between day 10 and 12, while C1 pupated by day four. In the experimental group receiving an azadirachtin-supplemented diet (E1-E4), larvae E2, E3, and E4 pupated at staggered intervals about three days apart, beginning on day five. E1 entered commitment pulse but did not pupate. In general, the control group experienced greater overall gain in mass and maintained their vibrant blue coloration. The larvae receiving azadirachtin showed a decrease in  experienced either immediate loss in mass or only a very slight increase before declining in mass. Furthermore, their individual colorations also became yellow-green early on in the experiment. The average change in mass of the control group was 1.0175 g ± 1.19, and the average change in mass of the experimental group was -1.4325 g ± 0.36 (Figure 1). Thus, the data indicated a significant difference between the change in mass of the Manduca larva fed and not fed azadirachtin (t-stat = 3.94, df = 6, P = 0.0076).

Discussion:
	Based on the significant difference between the change in masses of our Manduca larvae groups, we can reject our null hypothesis. Feeding azadirachtin at amounts of six drops per 10g of food produced a relevant effect on our experimental group. Rather than grow normally throughout the pre-pupation instar, the larvae fed azadirachtin seemed to display earlier physiological preparation for pupation and decreased food consumption. The significantly lower masses of this group indicate that azadirachtin caused the adverse affect on larval food consumption. Azadirachtin cannot, however, be said to have caused earlier pupation. Despite the general trend of early commitment pulse and pupation, the mass data we collected cannot fully support such a claim. Furthermore, the coloration of our experimental group shifted. The original vibrant blue coloration of Manduca sexta is due to a pigment called insecticyanin, which ceases to be synthesized by the epidermis in the absence of JH 18-20 hours after the release of prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) and, subsequently, ecdysone [Riddiford: 1981]. Thus, the cessation of insecticyanin synthesis in this group should have corresponded to the start of pupation. Our control group, by comparison, retained their coloration by insecticyanin for most of the 14 day period until they committed to pupation. 
	The hypothesis we proposed predicted azadirachtin would prevent pupation, but as all larvae pupated or showed a commitment pulse, this must be rejected. Our assumption was that the dose of azadirachtin administered would completely block ecdysone release. However, the dose used may not have been sufficient to fully inhibit ecdysone release, or ecdysone initiating the commitment pulse may have been released before azadirachtin could be administered. The latter of these two options is unlikely because our control group did not show the characteristic yellowing and black dorsal stripe of a commitment pulse until much later than the experimental group. Assuming the dose of azadirachtin administered was sufficient, it is possible that inhibiting ecdysone release in Manduca sexta impaired the normal physiological processes. In the 5th larval instar, an absence of JH paired with the presence of only a small spike in ecdysone is not enough to initiate molting, but instead commits cells to a program that will culminate in pupation [Riddiford: 1981]. It is important, first, that cells become fully pupally committed and, second, that the subsequent molting concentration of ecdysone (a second, larger spike) is present to initiate cellular production of the pupal cuticle [Riddiford: 1981]. Thus, if azadirachtin caused levels of ecdysone at either of these two spikes to be too low to fully commit cells or initiate pupal molt, the resulting pupae could have been abnormal. The pupae of our experimental group were abnormal in their small size, and if we could have witnessed their full metamorphosis, we may have been able to note whether the pupae experienced complications, death, or a successful molt into adult form. In another study, low doses of azadirachtin administered to Manduca sexta resulted in larvae that pupated yet were mostly defective due to structural deformities that developed during pupation [Schluter: 1985]. This study concluded that, in larvae treated with azadirachtin, disruption in ecdysone regulation not long before pupal ecdysis likely caused such abnormalities to occur. These findings corroborate our proposal that insufficient ecdysone levels during pupation could have interfered with normal development.
	In light of these conclusions, azadirachtin could be effective at reducing the impact of the tobacco hornworm as a pest. It is a Manduca larva that does more damage to crops, such as the tobacco or potato plant, than its adult counterpart. Azadirachtin does not keep the Manduca larvae in this pupal stage. Rather, it seems to induce pupation or prevents the larva from eating as voraciously. We saw this effect demonstrated in the lower masses and food consumption of the experimental group. Overall, more study is needed to determine the effect of azadirachtin on pupal development and the effects of greater and lower concentrations of azadirachtin on the tobacco hornworm.
