Title: The effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle contraction through the sciatic nerve of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Muscles can be stimulated by a voltage in order to cause contraction. Contractions of certain strengths and rates alter the response of a muscle. Overstimulation can result in tetany. Caffeine has been known to have an effect on muscle response. The expectation is that when the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens is exposed to caffeine, there will be a change in the muscle response. This hypothesis was tested on three different frog legs, in which the response was recorded before and after the injection of caffeine into the muscle. A paired t_test showed that the addition of caffeine did have an effect on the muscle contraction of the frog legs. Observations also showed that the muscles experienced tetany when exposed to caffeine. This suggests that caffeine has a significent effect on muscles, and causes them to be unable to relax. However, due to the large dosage used in this experiment, it cannot be concluded that all levels of caffeine cause issues for muscle contraction. 

Introduction:
A muscle contracts when motor neurons carry an action potential to the muscle fibers. The action potential causes the release of acetylcholine which ultimately leads to the release of calcium, causing a contraction of the muscle [Bergner: 1989]. A stimulus can be applied to muscles to act as an action potential and cause a muscle to contract. In order for a stimulus to cause contraction, its voltage must be above that of the threshold of the specific muscle. The threshold is the least amount of voltage that is needed in order for the stimulus to cause contraction. The rate and strength of stimulations can also have an effect on the reaction of the muscle. If the stimulus is close enough together, the muscle remains contracted and does not relax between individual contractions. A muscle may experience tetany, which is a constant state of contraction [Smith: 2018]. Certain substances can also have an effect on the contraction, such as caffeine, which can alter and slow relaxation [Pagala: 1980]. It would be beneficial to know the effects of caffeine on muscles since it is consumed by a large population on a daily basis. In the leg of Rania pipiens (Southern leopard frogs) the gastrocnemus muscle can be contracted by applying a stimulus either directly to the muscle, or to the sciatic nerve that is attached to the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. This experiment treats the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens with caffeine to assess whether voltage will be affected. Due to the effects of caffeine, it can be hypothesized that the addition of caffeine to the muscle of the frog leg will cause a change in voltage and reaction of the muscle when stimulated by the sciatic nerve. 

Materials and Method:
The legs of three Rania pipiens were prepared first by removing the skin from the muscle and bone. Then the muscle of the thigh was cut, exposing the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemus muscle was also cut at the tendon and hung by a string so that it was fully exposed and the twitches could be more visibly noticed. A probe that created stimulation was placed underneath the sciatic nerve of the frog leg and was connected to a computer to controll the amplitude and number of pulses applied. Each leg was exposed to five pulses at an amplitude of 1.0 volts (V). The resulting output volts were then recorded for each pulse in all three of the frog legs. Then 1 Ml of caffeine was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle and the stimulus of five pulses for each leg was immediately applied and results were recorded. A two-tailed paired t_test was used to analyze the results found and assess whether they were significent enough to conclude that caffeine does have an effect on muscle contraction in Rania pipiens. The values used in the paired t_test were the averages calculated from the five impulses in each frog leg during the controll trial and then the experimental trial with caffeine. 

Results:
During the process of this experiment, when the legs were injected with caffeine, they experienced tetany and remained in a contracted state after the first impulse. The average voltage after stimulation in the frog legs in the controll and experimental (caffeine) groups was calculated (Figure 1). The two-tailed paired t_test calculated the degrees of freedom and P-value (Table 1). For the paired t_test, the averages for the controll and experimental group over the five stimulations were averaged for each frog leg. Those values were used in the data of the paired t_test. The p_value found was much lower than 0.05, which means that the findings were significent.

Discussion:
Since the results of the P-value are significent, the hypothesis was supported. This means that caffeine does have a significent effect on the muscle contraction of the frog legs. Tetany was also observed in the muscles injected with caffeine when stimulated, which shows the distinct effect that caffeine emanates on the muscle. Other studies show similar conclusions resulting in tetany of muscles when exposed to caffeine [Pagala: 1980]. These replications further support the findings in this experiment and suggest that caffeine can be harmful to muscle contraction. One issue that arises with this experiment was the dosage of caffeine that was added to the frog leg. A large amount, such as the one used in this experiment, may completely alter the muscle, but when suggesting harms that may be caused, it is important to look at dosages that would be more naturally exposed to muscles. Studies that have looked at more ‘natural’ dosages show that there is an optimum caffeine dose to promote muscle strength [Grgic: 2018]. While this experiment found caffeine to cause tetany to muscles, it is a result of an extreme dosage that would most likely not be seen from caffeine consumption on a normal basis. If it were to be replicated, the experiment would look at different amounts of dosages, especially those smaller than the one used in this experiment to see the extent to which caffeine affects muscle contraction.

Figure 1. The average output stimulation (in volts) of the controll and caffeine groups. The averages were found for each stimulation in each frog, and then averaged for an overall stimulation. In the controll group, the average was 0.118 volts and in the experimental group the average was 0.533. Error bars were added to show fluctuations or uncertainty of the means based off of standard deviations. 
Table 1. This shows the degrees of freedom p_value resulting from the paired t_test. Since the p_value is less than 0.05, the results of this experiment are significent.
