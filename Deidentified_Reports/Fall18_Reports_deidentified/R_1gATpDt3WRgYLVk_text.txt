Title: Caffeine‚Äôs Effects on Physarum polycephalum Does Not Significantly Affect Mobility

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is an organism that responds to environmental stimuli by using cytoplasmic actomyosin‚Äìdriven satellites for movement. Cytoplasmic actomyosin of Physarum is sensitive to changes in Calcium levels, so contractile activity is altered with a concentration change in Calcium. Caffeine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that was used to compare the rate of movement between Physarum in a normal environment versus in a caffeinated agar plate. Measurements of distance traveled were taken after 48 hours to calculate the rate the Physarum moved. While it was hypothesized that the introduction of caffeine to the Physarum would cause it to move at a faster rate to a food source than one in normal conditions, results did not show any significent difference in the rate of movement in Physarum exposed to caffeine. This can be attributed to the caffeine keeping the actin in a constant state of contraction, therefore disrupting motive force generation from locomotion in Physarum. This study could lead to future understanding of how signaling pathways are affected by environmental stimuli.

Introduction:
The Physarum polycephalum, commonly referred to as slime mold, is an organism that thrives in dark, warm, humid environments. Organisms like Physarum are foragers who respond to environmental stimuli. When nutrients are scarce, they use sheet-like motile bodies called ‚Äúsatellites‚Äù to move (Lee et al: 2018). Physarum is able to crawl by extending its actin microfilaments and primarily moves around to search for food (Johnson: 2016). The force behind Physarum‚Äôs mobility is cytoplasmic actomyosin (Wohlfarth-Bottermann: 1979). Calcium essentially enables movement with actin in Physarum. The cytoplasmic actomyosin of Physarum is sensitive to changes in Calcium levels, so contractile activity can be altered with a concentration change in Calcium (Wohlfarth-Bottermann: 1979). For this particular experiment, we focus on chemotaxis and Physarum‚Äôs signaling pathway that is mediated by cAMP. This G-protein linked pathway involves the conversion of ATP into cAMP so that cAMP may activate enzymes like protein kinase A. cAMP‚Äôs signaling pathways are halted by cAMP phosphodiesterase, so the stimulation of cAMP has virtually the same effect as inhibiting this phosphodiesterase (Johnson: 2016). Physarum is a useful model organism to study because it‚Äôs signaling pathways are similar to that of a human‚Äôs. The point of interest in this experiment is exploring how a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor can affect the mobility of Physarum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase should alter the cAMP levels, which will influence the Calcium concentration (von Olenhusen, K. G√∂tz, and K. E. Wohlfarth-Bottermann: 1979). We will be using caffeine as our choice of phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It is hypothesized that if we introduce caffeine to the Physarum, then it will move at a faster rate to a food source than one in neutral conditions (water).

Materials and Method:
We divided 10 water agar plates into two groups: an experimental group and a controll group. On the bottom of the first group of five plates, we labeled caffeine, 1-5. On the remaining five we labeled controll, 1-5. To create the caffeine mixture for our experimental plates, we diluted contents of microtube filled with caffeine with 20 Ml distilled water and added 5 Ml diluted solution to each experiment plate (final concentration of 20mM). To assure even distance between each Physarum sample and the food source in each plate, we drew a 1cm x 1cm block in the middle of each plate on the bottom of the glass container 1 cm away from the edge and a small ‚Äúx‚Äù on the opposite side of the plate 1 cm in from the edge to indicate where the food source would be located. We soaked the caffeine plates in the diluted solution for 10 minutes, then poured out the remaining solution. We cut out 10 1cm x 1cm blocks of Physarum samples from the stock plate and inserted them into the wells of both the experimental and controll plates where the previously drawn squares indicated. We placed one piece of oatmeal at the end of each plate opposite to the block of agar from the stock solution over the ‚Äúx.‚Äù We taped the lids and placed the plates in a black plastic bag, and then placed them in an incubator at 37ÀöC. We returned after 48 hours to measure distance traveled by Physarum, and then calculated the average rate of movement for the experimental and controll plates in mm/hr. We compared the rate of the two groups by conducting a two-sample t_test with an Œ±-value of .05, indicating a 95% confidence interval.

Results:
After returning 48 hours later, we measured the distance covered by each Physarum and calculated the rate of movement in millimeters per hour, as shown in Figure 1. We ran a two-tailed t_test to compare the rate of movement between our experimental and controll groups and reported a p_value of .345. Our p_value was above .05, which was our predetermined ùõº value. Regarding the qualitative observations of our data, we observed that one of the agar plates in our experimental group appeared to have no visible Physarum - not even on the stock cube we inserted. Also, in our experimental group, it appeared that the Physarum moved in several directions - not just toward the food source - for one of our samples.

Discussion:
Since our p_value was above .05, we cannot conclude that there was any significent difference in the rate at which the Physarum migrated when exposed to caffeine versus normal conditions. Caffeine is a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, so it was hypothesized that introducing caffeine to Physarum would result in a faster rate of movement towards a food source relative to that of a controll group which had not been exposed to caffeine. Upon further research, we found that it is possible caffeine would keep the actin in Physarum (the organism‚Äôs ‚Äúmuscle-like‚Äù construction) in a constant state of contraction, as we had inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase, which is the shut-off mechanism for this process. According to a study published in the European Journal of Cell Biology on contraction and locomotion in caffeine-treated Physarum, the application of 5 mM caffeine delayed the onset of oscillating contraction and therefore concluded that caffeine uncoupled motive force generation from locomotion in Physarum (Achenbach et al: 1979). Something can also be said about the alteration of Calcium concentration due to the introduction of caffeine in the Physarum‚Äôs environment. Continuous exposure to caffeine could have depleted the store of Calcium inside the cells of Physarum due to continuous release of Calcium to activate the cytoplasmic actomyosin (Matthews: 1977). It has been found in previous studies that caffeine interferes with Calcium membrane sites, which alters the anchoring of actin to the plasmalemma (Wohlfarth-Bottermann: 1979). This may result in muscle spasms, causing the Physarum to use up all the available ATP for unnecessary movement, rather than migration to a food source. Since the food source was at the other end of the plate, it is also possible that the Physarum couldn‚Äôt replenish ATP. This might have resulted in death and overall lack of movement, which explains why no Physarum was visible in three out of five experimental replicates. With regard to future studies, the use lower concentration of caffeine solution may be advantageous. Using a 1:20 caffeine/water solution in our agar plates could have been too much- perhaps lower concentration would result in significent increase in rate of movement instead of the inhibition of regular oscillatory contraction. One study led by Lawrence M. Matthews, Jr, of the University of Pennsylvania found that repeated experiments using equal volumes of caffeine did not yield consistent responses in Physarum (Matthews: 1977). Decreasing the amount of caffeine in our experiment could increase the consistency in our results, and may even lead to different results, as Physarum cytoplasmic actomyosin may not be exhausted with lower concentrations of caffeine interfering with Calcium flooding out of the cell. Finally, one potential source of error in our experimental data could be due to the fact that no Physarum was observed in one of our controll agar plates, so the recorded rate of movement was 0 mm/hr. This may be due to the small amount of Physarum that was on the stock plate to begin with.
