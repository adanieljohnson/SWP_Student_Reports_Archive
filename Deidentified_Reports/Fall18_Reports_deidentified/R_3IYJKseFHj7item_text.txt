Title: The Effects of Increased Intramuscular Potassium Concentration on The Contraction Force of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rania temporaria

Abstract:
During muscle contraction in the body, muscle fibers respond to the release of a neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron to cause an action potential to move through the muscle and precipitate the release of calcium, allowing for the right conditions for contraction to occur. The following stage in muscle contraction is relaxation and this occurs during repolarization in the muscle. Multiple ion concentrations are responsible for allowing action potentials (and by extension, contraction) to occur. This study investigated how an increase in the concentration of intramuscular potassium impacted the force of muscle contractions in Rania temporaria from legs. It was hypothesized that an increase in the ion concentration would cause a change in the contraction force. Each of 3 frog legs acted as its own controll before being injected with 1Ml of 20mM K+ Ringer’s solution. The dependent variable of contraction force was measured after electrical stimulation at 5 different voltages so that an optimal one may be focused on for final analysis. No distinct trends were seen and the two-tailed, paired t_test proved the results to be statistically insignificent, meaning the null hypothesis that increased intramuscular [K+] has no effect on contraction force must be acce

Introduction:
This lab explored an aspect of neuromuscular controll using the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania 
temporaria legs (frog legs) and theirs attached sciatic nerves. This muscle and nerve are small and compact yet large enough for one to easily dissect and see visible signs of twitching in. The sciatic nerve is the motor neuron that innervates myofibers of the muscle at various muscle junctions [Johnson: 2018].  This allows the muscle to respond to electrochemical nerve impulses by developing a receptor potential after the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal causing voltage gated sodium channels to open, depolarize the membrane and set off an action potential in the muscle fiber. The result of this action potential is the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which in the presence of ATP allows myosin filaments to connect and move along actin filaments in the muscle fiber and cause muscle contraction which can be seen as a spasm or twitch [Johnson: 2018]. Repolarization of the muscle corresponds with muscle relaxation in which Ca2+ reuptake occurs and the myosin and actin filaments of muscle fiber an detach and no twitching occurs. As with all action potentials, it is the relative ion concentrations of ions like Na+ and K+ and Cl- that determine depolarization and hyperpolarization/ repolarization. Potassium has the greatest impact on membrane/muscle resting potentials and the outflow of potassium is an essential part of hyperpolarization and repolarization that allows for muscle relaxation to occur after an action potential. Considering the role of the potassium ion in action potentials, the question arises: If K+ ion content inside a muscle is increased, will muscle contraction force change? This investigation is relevant to how consumption of potassium heave food may affect an active organism’s ability to move and their eventual fatigue. Previous research  has shown that increased K+ content affects action potential amplitude and propagation related to muscle propagation but there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of [K+] in force development [Sjogaard: 1996]. Also, research on changing external K+ ion content has shown rapid depolarization and muscle contractions [Hodgkin: 1960]. Bearing these effects of potassium content in mind, the alternate hypothesis of this experiment is that if intramuscular potassium concentration is increased, then contraction force will increase. In this experiment, each frog leg will act as its own controll and then be placed under experimental conditions so that the dependent variable of contraction force in volts may be compared.                    


Materials and Method:
First, the testing apparatus including the tray, stand from which to suspend the muscle, and the probes attached to the iWorks electrophysiological recorder were set up at a lab table. Next, three frog legs were skinned, and scissors were used to help expose and separate their gastrocnemus muscles before strings were attached to the very ends of the muscles in order to suspend them about 90 degrees off the tray using hooks on the stand. Leg number one was suspended first and pins were used to stabilize the part of the leg on the foam tray and the leg was moistened with regular Ringer’s solution on the outside. The red and black probe were both inserted into the muscle and the amplitude of the stimulus was set to 0.3V before being administered. The software’s reading of the contraction force was then measured before the amplitude was sequentially raised to 0.4V, 0.5V, 1.0V, and finally 2.0V, with the contraction force recorded at each amplitude. 
After these five trials, a syringe was used to inject 0.1Ml of 20mM K+ Ringers solution directly into the muscle to begin the experimental trial for leg one. A five minute “wait time” was respected to allow the change in ion concentration to have its maximum effect. The tone of the pull on the string suspending the muscle was increased slightly. Then, the process of measuring contractile force at all five amplitudes was repeated before the leg was disposed of. Then, both leg two and leg three underwent the whole process from suspension to stimulation under both the initial controll and experimental conditions as well. 
A two-tailed paired t_test was then run on the differences between the average contraction force under the experimental verses controll conditions at an amplitude that produced non-zero values for each leg under at least one condition and produced some mid-range contraction force values (chosen to be 0.5 V for this experiment). 



Results:
The data analyzed was for the trials at 0.5V at which all frog legs produced non-zero contraction values under at least one condition. The two-tailed paired t_test gave a p_value of 0.718 which is greater than the alpha value of 0.05, so the data is statistically insignificent. The differences between the experimental contractile force was sometimes higher and sometimes lower than for the controll conditions. The magnitude of the differences were all quite inconsistent as well, but the difference was never zero (Figure 2). The difference in the mean contractile force for after the potassium was added verses before was about 0.0700V and the spread of the differences is relatively large compared to the mean at 0.290 (Figure 1). Qualitatively, all muscle spasms looked similar to the naked eye, though the lack of a twitch could be seen during trials at amplitudes that did not produce any contraction force.

Discussion:
With a high p_value, the results are statistically insignificent, and the alternate hypothesis that increasing potassium ion concentration directly within the frog gastrocnemus muscle increases its contractile force must be rejected. The null hypothesis that [K+] does not affect the contractile force is supported. In context, the results of this experiment suggest that consumption of lots of potassium will not affect muscle contraction force. There was no sign of an increase in potassium concentration changing contraction force in a specific way, however, it should be noted that there was always a change of some kind. It is possible that just the injection of fluid into the area around the places of electrical stimulation impacted measurement accuracy (a limitation of the method). Taking the probes out while injecting and always injecting in the same place might impact results and could be part of a modified design. Or it is possible that the tone was not adjusted properly to counteract the differences in the weight and swelling of the muscle once injected. The variety in the magnitudes of all contractile forces and differences may be attributed to each frog leg having its own unique threshold amplitude and contraction tendencies even at the standard amplitude focused on for data analysis. 
As mentioned earlier, there has been controversy in the scientific community regarding the role of potassium in force production in muscle contractions. Some recent models have come to the conclusion that [Ca+] is responsible for force production and fatigue while [K+] may be ignored [Sjogaard: 1996]. The results of this experiment support this conclusion, and further research could be done repeating this exact same procedure but altering [Ca+] instead. Altering [Na+] and [Cl- ] to examine their roles in contraction force production could also be useful. If it is [Ca+] that has the most impact on contraction force as recent research suggests, then further study into what precipitates more or less release of calcium is necessary; it seems likely from this experiment that increased [ K+] is not directly tied to greater [Ca+] within the muscle in this case. Also, prior research cited seems to mostly focus on increasing external ion concentration while this design altered ion concentration internally, so this experiment could be done again with increased external [K+] bearing in mind the change in ion flow this would likely cause based on the K+ equilibrium value. Injecting potassium into the sciatic nerve and/or stimulating the sciatic nerve verses the muscle directly could also be done to investigate how potassium content affects the impulse originally sent to the muscle and better mimic how the process of contraction is carried out in vivo.
