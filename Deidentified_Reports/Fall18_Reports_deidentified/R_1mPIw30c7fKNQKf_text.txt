Title: The effect of adding an external source of JH on the weight of Manduca Sexta over a two-week period

Abstract:
The regulation of maturation in animals and insects is usually controllled by hormones. Growth. Juvenile hormone (JH) is a hormone that is involved in the metamorphosis of a caterpillar known as Manduca Sexta. According to previous research if JH levels do not drop a caterpillar will not molt. Our experiment shows the effect external JH has on the weight on Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that that the experimental group will not pupate and will continue to grow much larger in size compared to the controll group. We used eight caterpillars four in the controll and four in the experimental. Both groups were put in the same condition of temperature, space and amount of food. The only difference was that the experimental group had 4 drops of JH in their food and the controll did not. We recorded their weight over 2 weeks as well as any observations on activity level, food consumption and appearance. Once all data was collected, we then calculated; the average increase in weight in the controll vs. the experimental and the average weight of the controll vs. experimental day by day. Our results supported our hypothesis. According to statistical testing, our results for the average increase in weight in the controll vs. the experimental were statistically significent. However, our results for 

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in the growth and development of organisms. A difference of hormone levels has proven to have varying effects on organisms. For example, a caterpillar, also known as the Manduca Sexta, goes through a series of molts and stages before becoming a moth. Each of these stages is regulated by the varying levels hormones, one that is particularly important is called the juvenile hormone (JH). In a caterpillar JH is naturally secreted fluctuating at different points in the its life. When the caterpillar is ready, it undergoes through the commitment pulse in which JH levels drop and it allows the caterpillar to molt. The presence of JH prevents the caterpillar from going from larval to pupal or pupal to adult before it is ready. In a previous experiment done on Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, it was discovered that when external JH was added at a critical time the switch between larvae to pupal will not occur. [Riddiford: 2003] Our group was very interested in this phenomenon and we wanted to expand in this. We wanted to see the effects of external JH on a caterpillar if it was given consistently throughout its growth. Therefore, we propose an experiment where we give our experimental group a consistent source of external. We hypothesized that the experimental group will not pupate and will continue to grow much larger in size compared to the controll group.

Materials and Method:

We started off by separating eight caterpillars into two groups; controll or experimental, four caterpillars in each group. In the controll group we numbered the caterpillars one through four and placed in each one in its own labeled compartment in a divided container. For the experimental group, we did the same thing except we numbered the caterpillars five through eight, not one through four. Then we weighed each caterpillar to measure the starting weight (Day 0) of each and recorded a total of eight weights. We then gave each caterpillar five grams of food, the only difference being that the experimental group received 4 drops of JH hormone mixed into their food and the controll did not. Every other variable between the caterpillars remained consistent including; temperature, space, amount of food etc... Over the next two weeks, each day we remeasured five grams of food for each caterpillar and recorded the weight for each. We also recorded any observations in color, activity level, and whether they were all still alive and if they were pupating. We did make a change to this routine was on Day 6 each caterpillar ate all of their food by the time we came to remeasure the food, therefore we changed from five grams of food to ten grams of food. We did not change the number of JH drops, we still gave the experimental group four drops in their food, it was just that now there was ten grams instead of five grams of food. Due to external circumstances, we did not record weights on days four and ten through twelve. The last day of the experiment was day 14 in which we obtained a final weight. With the weight collected we used this data to calculate; the average weight of the controll group vs. the experimental group and the average growth per day of the controll vs. the experimental. To test is our results were significent or not we used a two-sample t_test comparing the average growth per day between the two groups. The alpha value we compared our results was .05, meaning any p_value of under .05 meant that the results were significent.


Results:

Our data shows 2 things; an overall higher increase in weight in the experimental group and a higher weight day by day in the experimental group. Our two-sample t_test showed that our results for the overall increase in weight was significent but not our day by day comparison. For the overall increase in weight our statistical test showed (t_stat =5.58, d.f. =6, P =0.00) standard deviation in figure 1. caption. For the day by day comparison the statistical test showed our dependent variable resulted in a P-value greater the alpha value of .05 (P = 0.05 or less). Therefore, our results were not significent (t_stat =1.59, d.f. =20, P =0.06) standard deviation in figure 2. Our observations taken down during the study was that overall, we noticed that our experimental group was much more active than the controll group. Also, the caterpillars in the experimental group ate more food than the controll group. Lastly the controll group actually pupated and were in their cocoons, on Day 9 caterpillars one and two began to turn brown and by day 14 all of the controll group caterpillars were in cocoons. 


Discussion:

Our hypothesis was supported by our data. However, our results, after statistical testing using a two-sample t_test with the basis that of a p value lower than .05, showed that our data was significent for the overall average weight of the controll group vs. the experimental group, but not significent for the average growth per day of the controll vs. the experimental. Meaning, that overall, the average weight of the experimental group was much higher than the controll and that data was significent. On the other hand, the day by day weight difference between the weight of the experimental group and the controll group was not significent. Therefore, we can conclude that the external addition of JH in the food of a group of Manduca sexta significently increase their weight, over a 2-week period, compared to a group that does not have JH added. On a day to day basis even though our results were not significent in the difference of weight day by day the trend seen in figure 2 does support our hypothesis. In figure 2. we see that the experimental group weight showed a positive trend while the controll group weight increase at a much slower rate than the experimental and then the weight of the caterpillars in the controll begins to decrease. Some anomalies during our experiment was that our experiment lasted 15 days but we only recorded weights for 11 of those days. If we were to do this experiment again making sure to get that data for those days would be vital because the more data points the more information. Ideas to further expand on could be to specify the data being collected. We focused on the weight of the Manduca Sexta however a research article shows an experiment where data is collected on a molecular basis. Physiological factors are very important, but a step further would be looking at the molecular level and seeing the effects of JH and potentially other hormones [Riddiford:2003].
