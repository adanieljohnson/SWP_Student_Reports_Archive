Title: The effects manipulating signaling pathways with dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin on Physarum polycephalum's movement 

Abstract:
 Physarum polycephalum is a multicellular slime mold that uses signaling pathways to respond to environmental stimuli including searching for food and external conditions. In this experiment, we focused on the G-coupled signaling pathway in physarum. Specifically, this pathway can release a secondary messenger, cAMP, which activates Protein Kinase A enzymes. We sought to manipulate the release of Protein Kinase A through signaling in physarum to understand the effects it had on physarum movement towards oats as food sources. We tested 3 controll samples with physarum on agar plates and 6 test plates. 3 of these physarum plates were mixed with dibutryl-cAMP, a PKA activator, and the other 3 were mixed with curcumin, a PKA inhibitor. These samples were left overnight to see how far the physarum travelled towards food sources under these conditions. We hypothesized that the test samples with dibutryl-cAMP would show the greatest total distance travelled of the physarum, followed by the controll sample, and finally the curcumin sample. None of our test and controlls plates exhibited any growth of the physarum. We fabricated results to demonstrate what our hypothesis would have looked like if proven and further explored reasons and studies for why our physarum sample showed no movement. 

Introduction:
      Physarum polycephalum is a multicellular slime mold that typically thrives in dark, moist areas. Physarum is an organism that can lengthen itself in search for food in the wild such as, but not limited to, microbes in leaf litter, bark, and mushrooms. Physarum spends most of its time in a plasmodial state where diploid nuclei divide and the physarum continually grows. The plasmodium, which has small parts that can split and grow into clones of the original parent organism, constantly results in networks that can travel towards or away from substances. Specifically, the physarum tubular networks can change direction and react to different environmental stimuli. One form of stimulus response in Physarum is chemotaxis, which is the positive or negative response towards a substance such as food [Alim: 2013]. These stimuli serve as signals that provoke different behaviors from the physarum that allow the physarum to survive in varying conditions. These signals are part of signal transduction pathways which include G-protein coupled and IP3-mediated pathways. In this experiment, the G-protein coupled pathway for signaling will be focused on. G-protein coupled pathways contain the subunits Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. These subunits, specifically the Gα are seperated in the presence of a stimulus, causing the release of a second messenger that triggers other enzymes [Urano:2014]. One secondary messenger in G-coupled pathways is cAMP. This secondary messenger can release and trigger enzymes including Protein Kinase A in response to a stimulus. PKA more specifically is an enzyme that can respond to stress stimulations in organisms. One study experimented on PKA to see its effects in response to stimuli resulting from anxiety, a common stress inducing disorder [Keil:2016]. This pathway, second messenger, and PKA enzyme exist in physarum as it is an organism that responds to environmental stimuli to survive.  In this experiment, we will specifically test the effects of activating and inhibiting PKA in the physarum. Curcumin is a PKA inhibitor and dibutryl-cAMP is a PKA activator. A study by Kong, Lawrence, and Sevetson proved that cAMP did increase the activation of protein kinase in rat adipocytes [Sevetson et al: 1993].  Also, another study by Hasmeda and Polya, found that curcumin was an inhibitor of protein kinases and Ca2+ by testing signaling pathways in plants [Hasmeda: 1996]. Using physarum near food and this inhibitor and activator, we want to see the effects at has on physarum movement since signaling pathways are being targeted. Specifically, one source of food we will use are plain oats. We hypothesize that physarum in the presence of curcumin will exhibit minimal movement towards food when compared to a controll samples and the dibutryl-cAMP samples, which we predict will have the least amount of movement do to inhibition of the signal transduction pathway. A paired t_test will be used to find the probability value and test statistical significance because this experiment calls for two test samples and one controll sample to be tested amongst each other. 

Materials and Method:
    In this lab, we used 9, 100 mm plates of 2% agar in water. Each plate was labelled with our names and the time/date on the back. Also, three plates were labelled “controll”, three labelled “+ Dibutryl cAMP”, and three labelled “+ Curcumin”. We spread 5 Ml of a 1 Ml of dibutryl cAMP with 19 Ml of water dilution across each of the three agar plates labelled “+ Dibutryl cAMP” evenly and let stand for a few minutes to soak in. We then spread 5 Ml of 1 Ml curcumin and 19 Ml water dillution across each agar plate labelled “+ Circumin” and let stand for a few minutes. The three agar plates labelled “controll” were kept the same. Using a ruler, we found the centermost point of each test and controll agar plate and placed a small dot where that would be on the bottom. We made sure this was visible through the agar jelly. We used a sterilized spatula to cut out and remove a 1 cm by 1 cm square of agar around the centermost dot of the controll plates. We then resterilized the spatula and repeated the process of cutting out the agar squares for the “+ Curcumin” test plates. We again resterilized the spatula and repeated this process for the three “+ Dibutryl cAMP” test plates. After resterilizing our spatula, we then scored our agar plate with physarum into as many 1 cm by 1 cm cubes as we could fit. We carefully removed a cube of physarum, making sure the cube consisted of solely visible physarum and no stray oats, for each of the 9 plates. We placed these cubes as we removed them into the 1 cm x 1 cm well in each plate, making sure the physarum cube was a good fit. We measured 3.5 cm on either side away from the physarum in the 9 plates and placed 4 oats. With 4 oats on equidistant from the central physarum block, there were 8 oats in total for all 9 plates. We taped the sides down of every plate and placed them carefully in a black bag as to not disrupt the two piles of oatmeal in each. The plates were placed into a dark cubby where they sat for 18-24 hours. They distance the physarum travelled and its direction towards the respective piles of oatmeal were measured in centimeters. Averages were taken and standard deviations for each set of three plates. A paired t_test was used to calculate statistical significance. 

Results:
	Our group expected to see the physarum treated with the PKA activator dibutryl cAMP to grow towards the food covering the most distance. More specifically, we expected to see the physarum to travel around 3.5 +/- 0.75 centimeters towards the food on the physarum plates either direction. 3.5 centimeters was expected because that was the maximum distance the physarum could travel. We then expected the physarum with the PKA inhibitor curcumin to travel the least amount of distance, predicting roughly 1 +/- 0.75 centimeters towards either respective pile of oats. We then expected the controll group with no treatment to lie somewhere in the middle at around 2.5 +/- 0.75 centimeters. Standard deviations were calculated using estimated data for each data group to show that these estimated numbers have sizeable margin of change as they were fabricated. Obvious trends in the data we would have expected can be seen in Figure 1. The data would go in decreasing pattern. Dibutryl cAMP test plates would show the most distance travelled, followed by controll, then curcumin. With this expected data, our hypothesis would have been proven. This fabricated data was based off of a study that found that cAMP activation, which directly correlates to PKA activity. The study found that cAMP activation resulting in increased movement and physarum growth. Based off this, we predicted our data for the dibutryl-cAMP because it is a PKA activator [Block: 1998]. From this study, we also could predict that curcumin would show reduced movement and growth because it is a PKA inhibitor, which should demonstrate the opposite effects of the cAMP activation in the study.  

Discussion:
    One reason for the physarum samples not showing growth is the potential effects of low temperature. The physarum in our experiment was placed in a dark cubby overnight where the temperature is likely lower than that of room temperature or under a light. A study by Uyeda and Furuya found that low temperature exposure of physarum can disrupt their Ca2+ levels resulting in the disruption of their microfilament structures. According to the study, the microfilament structures are necessary for the physarum to maintain their elongated shapes. More specifically, in low temperatures the researchers found substantial increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations following exposure to cold temperature, ultimately causing internal imbalances and issues with microfilament structures [Uyeda: 1986]. This temperature related effect could have resulted in our physarum not responding to the food source in all of our agar test plates. Another study supports this by finding that initially calcium exposure in physarum caused an increase of growth but over prolonged time, the effects switched to inhibition. As time went on, the effects of growth inhibition increase with direct parallels to the calcium exposure [Terry:2008] Another reason the physarum possibly failed to grow was the stock sample provided. The physarum itself could have been a faulty sample due to the age of the organism. A study by Hu, Clark and Lott found that the physarum plasmodium was subject to aging and deterioration based off environmental exposure. Though, they saw the physarum in some conditions could revive itself, the samples did eventually deteriorate and die as the plasmodium deteriorated and the sample began to exhibit minimal growth and movement. Another thing to consider is that the physarum in the study in non-axenic conditions deteriorated quicker and exhibited no growth. If our physarum was either in a later stage, in a period of deterioration, or have been non-axenic conditions, then growth would presumably be stunted [Hu: 1984]. Finally, a third reason for the physarum growth to have been stunted could have resulted from the pH. Though, this is less likely than the previous two reasons, a study by Gray found that physarum in his test samples grew the best at a pH of 3 and slowly grew less and less as pH increased. If the provided curcumin and dibutryl-cAMP samples resulted in higher pH’s, than inhibition of growth was possible. However, this study also states that as they increased the temperature and lowered the pH, the growth of physarum was maximized [Gray: 1939]. This contradicts the earlier study by Uyeda that found that lowering the temperature resulted in less growth. Uyeda’s experiment was significently more recent in comparison with that of Gray’s and also had more consistent data. Beyond the contradiction, Uyeda’s results are likely more dependable than Gray’s, though Gray’s data as is presents a supported argument as the why the physarum samples saw no growth. 	
     To further support there was something wrong with the physarum, the oats should have promoted the physarum to move. Though, physarum not growing when tested with circumin is possible given circumin was an inhibitor. Otherwise, physarum when searching for food sources should have at least exhibited some growth in the dibutryl-cAMP samples and controll. A study by Carlile found that nutrient deprived physarum will seek to replenish itself if a food source is available. The study goes on to test the prevalence of carbohydrates in the physarum food search [Carlile: 1970]. These conclusions would support that the physarum, at least in the controll and dibutryl-cAMP group, should have sought after the oats as a viable food source. Because the physarum, even with food sources available, still exhibited no movement, the reasons above are more likely to have occurred. Given that because of the proposed and possibly other reasons, our fabricated data is solely a representation of if our hypothesis was proven. Further exploring the what went wrong is one direction we would take to further this study. Though, if we had definitive data, we would have likely furthered this experiment by testing the inhibitor and activator under varying environmental conditions including temperature and plates other than agar to better understand the effects. In the scientific world, this experiment was beneficial to understanding the signaling pathways of physarum with different inhibitors and activators. Also, this experiment was relevant as it is beneficial to understand how a experiment might have gone wrong to not only understand it but to still have something to interpret and analyze.
