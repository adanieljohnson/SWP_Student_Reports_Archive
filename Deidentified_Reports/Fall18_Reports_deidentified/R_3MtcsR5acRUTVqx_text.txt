Title: How Color Affects the Intraspecific Behavior of Betta Fish

Abstract:
Bettas (Betta splendens) are common aquarium fish that are native to Thailand. Bettas became a very popular fish in the US because the male’s bright colors tend to attract buyers. However, when buying male Bettas, people are often encouraged to keep them separated due to their aggressive behaviors towards each other. These pre-fight behaviors are called “agonistic” behaviors and they are used by males to fight off mating competition. Since Bettas have good color vision, I tested how color of competition affects the agonistic behavior of males using foam replicas of male Bettas. Based on information from a previous experiment, I hypothesized that Bettas would react stronger towards a red cutout. I preformed this experiment on four Betta males, two red Bettas and two blue. To test the Bettas behaviors in response to colored stimulus, I used two foam fish cutouts (one red and one blue) and lowered them, one at a time, into each tank. I observed the behaviors of the real male Betta and ranked them on a scale of 0-3 with increasing intensity. A two-tailed, two-sampled t-test was performed to determine the statistical significance between the means of behavioral intensity against the red and blue cutouts.

Introduction:
Betta splendens (simply known as “Bettas” or “Siamese fighting fish”) are a common aquarium fish that are native to Thailand. Male Bettas are notorious for being aggressive with each other because they see each other as competition in terms of mating [Johnson: 2018]. These aggressive (or “agonistic”) behaviors are considered to be Intraspecific because they happen between members of the same species. Some examples of these intraspecific behaviors include tail beating, fin flicking or flashing (these are called facing behaviors). More intense behaviors such as gill expansion, darting at or biting an opponent and the exposure of a “red mane” are called broadside behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. In response to these behaviors, male Bettas can either flee, submit to their opponent or match/raise their opponents’ behavior [Johnson: 2018]. If their behavior continues to increase in intensity, it could lead to a fight that lasts about 30-45 minutes. A fight between two male Bettas will only end when either both males stop displaying agonistic behavior or when their competition dies [Simpson: 1968]. Whilst dying isn’t beneficial to a male’s competition, it is beneficial to the species as a whole. Fighting has a reproductive advantage that allows males to ward off competition whilst also attracting mates [Bronstein: 1981]. Fighting is shown to be most beneficial when two males stop displaying behaviors right before fighting would normally occur. This is most beneficial because it avoids expending unnecessary energy [Castro: 2006]. Aside from fighting, male Bettas are also known for being brightly colored. In the wild, all Bettas were dull colored and became bright when they were provoked. However, due to commercial value, they have been bred to stay brightly colored [Johnson: 2018]. Since bright color is a sign of aggression in the wild, I studied how the intensity of agonistic behavior in male Bettas compared between two foam cutouts of different colors. In a previous (unpublished) experiment, I observed the behavior of male Bettas under varying conditions. Generally, it seemed as though red Bettas were more aggressive than blue Bettas. Based on this, I hypothesized that Bettas would display more intense agonistic behavior in response to the red stimulus.

Materials and Methods:
I began this experiment with four male Bettas (two red and two blue) held in separate tanks. To test the Bettas’ responses to colored stimuli, a blue foam cutout was lowered into a blue Betta’s tank compartment for five minutes. After observing the Betta’s behavior, it was allowed to rest whilst the other fish’s behavior was tested. The process of lowering a blue cutout was performed on the other three fish. Next, the same procedure was performed with a red Betta cutout. To quantify the Betta’s behavior, a scale of 0-3 was used. 0 was reserved for Bettas who did not exhibit any response, 1 was used for facing behaviors, 2 was used for broadside behaviors and 3 was used for the presence of a red mane. Additionally, I counted how often a Betta preformed each behavior. I multiplied the number of times the behavior was preformed by the rating of the behavior to determine the overall intensity of each behavior. Then, I added the overall intensities together to calculate the Bettas overall response to each stimulus. Finally, a two-tailed, two-sampled t-test was preformed to determine the significance of response intensity between red and blue foam cutouts.

Results:
Overall, average aggressiveness was more intense in response to the red foam fish than the blue foam fish. Aggressive towards the red cutout was, on average, 8.75 (+/- 5.74) whilst aggressiveness towards the blue cutout was 7.25 (+/- 2.65) on average (Figure 1). Based on the raw data, it was determined that the overall reaction to the red cutout was 35 whilst the reaction to the blue cutout was only 29. Throughout the performance of the experiment, most Bettas’ overall intensity rating ranged from 5-8, however, there were outliers. For example, one fish had a rating of 17 and another had a rating of 10. The difference between the two means of behavioral intensity is not statistically significant based on the results from the two-tailed t-test (df =6, t-stat = 0.479361, p-value = 0.648653).

Discussion:
Overall, the original hypothesis was not supported by the results because the behavioral intensity didn’t have a statistically significant difference between red and blue cutouts. In terms of the response to either cutout, there was generally very little among all of the Bettas. In 6 out of 8 trials, the Bettas initially acted intensely but, over time, their agonistic behaviors occurred less frequently and with less ferocity. This is a common pattern found in similar experiments. For example, in a study done on how fast Bettas can habituate stimuli, it was shown that the resident Bettas usually began by rushing at its “opponent” and then it’s behaviors gradually became less intense over time [Peeke: 1969]. If a Betta doesn’t see a stimulus as a threat, it is less likely to perform agonistic behaviors towards it because they are costly in terms of energy [Castro: 2006]. Additionally, fighting could end in death which is why many animals are selective when fighting [Bronstein: 1981]. It is very possible that the Bettas used in this experiment either realized that the cutouts were not actual male Bettas, or they simply got used to the cutout being present and chose to ignore it. In terms of experimental error, the fact that the tanks used to house the Bettas had mirrored floors could have caused some unintentional behaviors. Some Bettas may have been reacting to their own reflection instead of paying attention to the cutouts. Finally, the difference between reaction intensity in the cutouts may not have been significant due to Betta fish’s underlying biology. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for regulating aggressive behavior in vertebrates. A more aggressive fish will have more serotonergic nerve endings compared to a non-aggressive Betta fish [Lynn: 2007]. It is possible that some of the fish used had a lack of serotonin and therefore, didn’t respond as intensely as others. This could also account for the generally high deviation in the data. If this study were to be replicated, I would advise using either very realistic cutouts or real-life Bettas as a stimulus to prevent selective fighting. Additionally, I would advise using tanks that have opaque flooring to prevent any aggressive reactions towards the Betta’s reflection.
