Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Chloride and Blocking of a Ca Channel on Physarum Growth

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a model organism known for its ability to move in response to positive or negative stimuli. Physarum’s movement is defined as cytoplasmic streaming in which the organism uses a series of contracting and relaxing of its cytoplasm in order to move to its desired location. An IP3-mediated calcium channel in its endoplasmic reticulum is a major component in the process of physarum motility. In this experiment, three water-agar plates were soaked in lanthanum chloride, an IP3 calcium channel inhibitor, and food was placed in a region on the plate. After 24 hours, the movement of physarum was measured. When recording the results, physarum exhibited no movement in both the experimental or control groups leading to the conclusion that the Physarum colonies were defected in some way. It is most likely that the physarum had resided on the same agar plate for an extended period of time, which lead to DNA changes that affected normal motility and lifespan.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a yellow slimy organism that is known for its movement ability in response to certain stimuli. The organism uses a mechanism known as cytoplasmic streaming to move to its desired location, which consists of contracting and relaxing certain elements of its cytoplasm in order to create concentration gradients and move certain molecules to new parts of the organism. Physarum will move to new locations depending on external stimuli and environmental conditions [Overview: 2018]. This process is known as chemotaxis, in which the organism senses molecules in its environment and then responds either by moving towards or away from it. One key component of cytoplasmic streaming is the role calcium plays in the movement of the cytoplasm. When a cell receives a signal, the IP3-mediated pathway is stimulated causing calcium channels on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum to open. The calcium then binds to regulating proteins, which may either stimulate or inhibit their activity [Hatano: 1970]. When a positive stimulus is detected, the calcium channels activate proteins involved in chemotaxis towards the food source [Yoshiyama: 2009]. For the purposes of this experiment, a positive stimuli (oatmeal) was placed a normalized distance from the Physarum culture, and the agar plate was coated with lanthanum chloride, an IP3-activated calcium channel inhibitor. It was predicted that the Physarum’s growth in all directions, especially towards the oatmeal, would be inhibited because the calcium channels that activate motility would be blocked and unable to respond to any stimulus. 

Materials and Methods:
The Lanthanum chloride solution was made first. A 1mL aliquot of 20X lanthanum trichloride stock solution was diluted to a 1X solution. This was accomplished by mixing 1mL of lanthanum trichloride with 19mL of water. This solution was then equally poured on three different water-agar plates for 10 minutes, after which the excess solution was wiped off. A square of about 1cm x 1cm was cut out of the middle of the three agar plates and replaced with a square the same size of physarum from a physarum stock plate. The same was done for three water-agar plates not containing any lanthanum chloride. The forceps used were cleaned in ethanol after each transfer. Once each plate contained a block of physarum, 5-6 oak flakes were sprinkled near each other in one corner of the six plates. After this, the plates were sealed, covered in tinfoil, and placed in a dark incubating container face-up for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the plates were taken out of the incubator and the distance migrated by and direction of the physarum was recorded. A paired t-test was then used to determine if the data was significant or not. 

Results:
The results were inconclusive as the physarum on both the experimental and control plates did not move any significant distance from the implanted blocks. The physarum colonies remained in their starting position regardless of if they were treated with lanthanum trichloride or not. If the hypothesis was correct, the results should have produced a graph similar to the one above. The control group would have responded with normal physarum behavior and migrated positively towards the oatmeal, while the experimental group would not have been able to migrate a significant distance. Both distances migrated, if the experimental group migrated at all, would have been in the direction of the oatmeal. The control group migrated an average of 7mm, while the experimental group migrated an average of 0.5mm, as seen in figure 1. All six physarum plates migrated in the direction of the oatmeal, however, the control plates all moved a significantly larger distance than the experimental ones. 

Discussion:
The IP3-mediated pathway in physarum is responsible for receiving and integrating signals that detect whether or not a food source is nearby. If activated, calcium channels open causing calcium ions to enter the endoplasmic reticulum and bind to regulating proteins. If a positive signal is detected, the regulating proteins then allow for the production of the cellular materials needed for chemotaxis [Overview; 2018]. The experimental physarum colonies exhibited almost no growth due to the inhibition of their IP3-mediated calcium channels, as seen in figure 1. The presence of lanthanum chloride prevented the calcium channels from opening, which meant the physarum’s ability to detect the oatmeal and perform chemotaxis in the corresponding direction was impeded. Figure 1 also shows that the control physarum responded normally by migrating towards the food source as its IP3-mediated calcium channels were functioning normally. 
The physarum colonies used in the actual experiment were defected and failed to grow at all. It has been shown that stock physarum colonies residing on agar plates for extended periods of time become necrotic within a few weeks. Laboratory colonies of physarum that do not contain much genetic variation from mixing of multiple colonies of varying ages leads to the degradation of the organisms’ ability to move, reproduce, and harness nutrients. Regardless of external conditions, the life span on physarum from the same stock colony that have been on the same nutrient agar plates will all die around the same time [McCullough; 1973]. It has also been proven that physarum germinate poorer and exhibit signs of senescence during extended culture on agar plates due to changes in their DNA [Adler: 1974]. Because the physarum used in this experiment was all from the same original colony and had been residing on only nutrient agar plates for extended periods of time, the physarum’s inability to perform chemotaxis and overall weak appearance were most likely a result of this. Changes in DNA because of extended culture on agar plates were why the physarum simply shut down their normal growth.
