Title: The Effect of Light Availability on Resource Allocation in Buckwheat

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a fundamental method that plants use in order to receive adequate resources. Within this lab, phenotypic plasticity is investigated when varying levels of sunlight are available. By using Buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, we grew roughly 100 seeds in 24 hours artificial lamp light and the other 100 seeds in natural light. The seeds were watered every day except weekends for two weeks. The objective of the experiment was to test the ways in which tissue growth different with varying light sources. We predicted that the root to shoot ratio would be higher for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with varying light sources (natural light). The initial focus of the shoot length due to light was ultimately shifted to investigate the ways in which the root tissue was expanded in order to allocate water. The lab concluded in the root to shoot ratio of the limited light was smaller than the 24-hour Buckwheat plants. Going forward this lab can be used in order to further investigate crop plants and the optimal environments for them to grow. 



Introduction:
Resource allocation is a major part of survival within an environment specifically for plants because plants are sessile thus they must adapt in order to receive adequate resources [Mooney, 1996]. For traits expressed on the whole plant level (e.g., mean leaf properties, allocation, canopy structure), changes in the phenotypic characteristics occur through two distinct mechanisms: (1) physiological and anatomical changes within existing tissues, and (2) production of new tissues that exhibit distinct physiological, anatomical or morphological characteristics in response to the current environment [Bradshaw, 1965]. This phylogenetic plasticity can be represented in a vast network of roots when allocating water or even a longer shoot in order to gather more sunlight. The relative importance to these mechanisms depends critically on the lifespan and rate of turnover of different tissues and organs [Grime and Campbell, 1991]. Thus in this experiment the crop plant Buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, is utilized in order to investigate how its resource allocation is affected by light availability. The Buckwheat plant is a perfect species to undergo this experiment for several reasons. First, it is a crop plant, so the information gathered is applicable within an agricultural setting on a much grander scale. Additionally, Buckwheat is cheap and grows quickly allowing the experiment to be inexpensive as well as could be undergone in a short period of time.Within a previous study, plants in high light exhibited greater total biomass, lower allocation to stems and petioles, higher allocation to roots [Bazzaz,1997].  Thus, we predicted the root to shoot ratio would be higher for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with varying light sources (natural light). 


Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, a series of steps were undergone in order to make the experiment as precise as possible. First, the Buckwheat seeds were soaked in water for approximately an hour while the rest of the experiment was being sent up. Ten containers were then filled with Miracle Grow and Vermiculite and 9 holes were created in each to plant seeds. Per hole, at least 2-3 seeds were dropped in each. Then, five of the containers were placed on a window sill for natural light and 5 containers were placed in a lamp box for 24 hours artificial light. The specimen were grown for two weeks under these light conditions, being watered every day by a different group member (excluding weekends). To measure how much water was adequate they were watered until the soil was moist within the container. 	
	Once the two weeks were complete all of the Buckwheat plants were pulled out of their trays for measurement. First, one to ten Buckwheat plants from the natural light condition were harvested by placing the entire block of soil in warm water to detach the roots more easily. The specimen were pulled apart from each other and washed and dried gently so to be examined. The, four different Buckwheat plants were selected from that group to be weighed in grams. Once this was found, the Buckwheat was cut where the root meets the base of the plant and reweighed the root in order to calculate root: shoot ratio by subtracting the shoot mass from the total mass. After this shoot and root length was measured to the nearest millimeter and a mean and standard deviation was recorded. The process was then repeated for the unlimited light Buckwheat plants. After this to analyze the data two-tailed T-test was performed for both the length and weight root to shoot ration in order to analyze whether the data gathered was statistically similar. 


Results:
Upon doing a two-tailed t_test the root to shoot ratio in terms of weight was significent (t=4.94, d.f.=6, p=0.001) whereas the root to shoot length ratio was not significent (t=.078, d.f.=6, p= .47) so further testing is required in order to use it to support a claim. The mean of the controll group root to shoot weight was 0.1493 +/- .0276 compared to the root to shoot weight ratio of the experimental group which was 0.055 +/- .0259.  

Discussion:
Based on the information gathered from the results as well as the statistical analysis, the hypothesis is not supported. The initial prediction was that the root to shoot ratio would be larger for plants with unlimited light compared to the specimen that received natural light, but our data did not match our initial prediction. The root to shoot ratio for the unlimited light was smaller than the natural light controll group. Upon doing the two-tailed T-test the root to shoot weight ratio showed statistically significent data that disproved the hypothesis. Conversely, the root to shoot length ratio was not significent meaning the data is inconclusive and requires further testing in order to support the claim. Additionally, the mean of the natural light groups root to shoot ratio was larger than the unlimited light group which also does not support the hypothesis because it means the weight of the unlimited light groups shoots was larger. In trying to understand and evaluate this data, it is important to investigate the possibility that the data gathered was not in response to the Buckwheat shoots and sunlight intake but rather investigate the length and weight of the roots. This is because both groups received adequate sunlight and thus is was not a limiting reagent. The data provided could have been constructed based off of the varying root weights. The mean weight of the natural light roots was larger than the mean weight of unlimited light roots because the roots were filled with more water. This could potentially be the cause of the unlimited light groups water evaporating more quickly due to the intensity and availability of the light and thus less water could be absorbed into the roots. Within the study there are many potential areas of improvement in order to receive greater precision and more accurate data. First, especially if the experiment focuses on phenotypic plasticity of the roots, it is important to regulate the amount of water the Buckwheat received per day and make sure it is consistent (including on the weekends). Additionally, the next time the experiment is performed it may be beneficial to plant the Buckwheat seeds more spatially. Because they were so entangled together it is possible they succumbed to breakage when being extracted from the soil and each other. This disadvantage makes it harder to make sure the full weight and length were measured. Lastly, in the future the lab would be provide more accuracy if it was performed with a larger sample size of Buckwheat or even alternate plant species. By doing this the data would be far more expansive and could become more universal when being applied to agricultural issues. This lab done with further provisions could be extremely valuable when evaluating the optimal way to grow crop plants in terms of resource allocation. By better understanding the dynamic between resources and phenotypic plasticity it would be essential to the growth of the agricultural market including third world areas [Landsberg, 1997].

Figure Legends: 
As seen in Figure 1, a two-tailed T-test was done in order to compare the means from the two groups of data in order to deduce if the data sets are statistically different. In terms of the Weight ratio, the controll group data was statistically significent from the experimental group data. Contrastingly the Length ratio data was not statistically significent and is therefore inconclusive. 

As seen in figure 2, In this graph the Root to shoot weight ratio is depicted with a clear distinction of a higher root to shoot ratio within the natural light group. Whereas within the root: shoot length ratio the graph has a much smaller margin.
