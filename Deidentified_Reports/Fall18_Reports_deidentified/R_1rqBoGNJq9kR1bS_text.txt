Title: Effects of Herbicide Concentration on the rate of photosynthesis in kale leaves

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a necessary process so that plants can obtain the energy they need. This experiment sought to show the effects of herbicide concentration on the rate of photosynthesis. We used enriched chloroplasts from kale leaves and placed varying amounts (1,3,or 5 mL) of either paraquat or glysophate. Absorbance was recorded at both 0 minutes and after samples had been in sunlight for 20 minutes. The results showed that glysophate was a more toxic herbicide than paraquat, and was more effective at lowering the rate of photosynthesis, as indicated by a higher absorbance in those samples. However, there was little difference in the samples with 1mL, 3mL and 5mL of either treatment group. We can conclude from this experiment, although further testing is needed, that altering the amount of herbicide does not change the effectiveness. 

Introduction:
Every living organism must obtain energy from at least one source. Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration are metabolic processes that organisms use to obtain necessary energy. Plants use photosynthesis, and the process is vital to all plant growth and survival [Lambers: 2008]. Chloroplasts capture energy from a light source [Lambers: 2008]. Furthermore, environmental factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis, and thus plant growth. Herbicides work by inhibiting photosynthesis, making them effective for weed control [Radhakrishnan: 2018]. In this lab we made enriched chloroplasts from kale leaves and measured the rate of photosynthesis after adding two different herbicides, paraquat and glysophate. It was hypothesized that kale treated with different concentrations of the herbicides would have a varying rate in photosynthesis. The rate of photosynthesis was expected to be lower for kale treated with higher concentrations of the herbicides.  

Materials and Methods:
For the purpose of obtaining a solution rich in chloroplasts we first obtained a mortar and pestle, medium beaker, and 3 50mL centrifuge tubes and packed them all in ice to cool. Next, the central vein of the kale leaves was removed. 10 mL of grinding buffer (4mM sucrose in tricine buffer, pH8) was added along with the leaves and grinded using the mortar and pestle until it became a thick paste. Then, we added 10 additional mL of grinding buffer and mixed the solution together. The mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a medium sized beaker. The liquid was transferred to a 50mL centrifuge tube (“a”) where it was spun at 1200rpm for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The centrifuged supernatant was transferred to another 50mL centrifuge tube (“b”), where it was spun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The liquid was poured into yet another 50mL centrifuge tube (“c”), which contained enriched chloroplasts. For the second part of our experiment, we obtained 22 test tubes and prepared reaction mixes as indicated. We diluted glysophate with 49.45 mL of water mixed 0.55 mL of the herbicide so that the two herbicides would be equivalent. Next, we added 100 ul of enriched chloroplasts to all tubes. The mixtures were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes and absorbance was measured and recorded for all samples at 600nm. Afterwards, all tubes were placed in a windowsill in sunlight for 20 minutes. Absorbance was measured and recorded again.
						


Results:
glysophate appears to be more efficient than paraquat at inhibiting the rate of photosynthesis, because samples treated with glysophate had higher absorbances. Also, there is little difference in the absorbance of paraquat samples and the control sample, suggesting that paraquat had little effect on the rate of photosynthesis. 

Discussion:
Photosynthesis is the method plants use to capture energy through sunlight, and they use chloroplasts for this process [Lambers: 2008]. Environmental factors can alter the rate of photosynthesis and affect the growth of plants. Herbicides can slow the photosynthesis rate and therefore inhibit plant growth; this makes them effective in weed control [Radhakrishnan:2018]. It was hypothesized that kale leaves treated with varying concentrations in herbicide would exhibit different rates of photosynthesis. The rate was expected to be lower in samples treated with higher concentrations of herbicide. Our hypothesis was tested by using two different herbicides, paraquat and glysophate. Results of a previous study done with freshwater green algae showed that paraquat was more toxic than glysophate [Wong:2000]. Results of our experiment showed that glysophate inhibited the rate of photosynthesis more than paraquat, illustrated in Fig.1, but they did not show varying levels of effectiveness of either herbicide. Absorbance is directly related to the rate of photosynthesis; a higher absorbance correlates with a lower photosynthesis rate. Using this information, we analyzed our data and determined that adding more of an herbicide does not alter its effectiveness in any way, thus rejecting our hypothesis. Instead, we noticed that paraquat was less effective at inhibiting the rate of photosynthesis than glysophate, suggesting that paraquat inhibits plant growth in another way. This study should be repeated with different, and possibly slightly more, concentrations of each herbicide, so that the difference in the results of this experiment and the one mentioned earlier can be determined. However, this experiment does show that herbicides can work in different manners to inhibit plants, and studies of this kind could show which herbicides would work best for a consumer’s specific needs.

The glysophate treatment group shows higher absorbances than the paraquat and control groups when absorbance was measured after 20 minutes (orange bars), indicating that the photosynthesis rate is lower in groups treated with glysophate than in groups treated with paraquat. Chloroplasts were placed in all samples, and absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer at 0 minutes and after samples had been in sunlight for 20 minutes.
