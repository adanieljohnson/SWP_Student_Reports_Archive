Title: The influence of the environmental pH on the rate of electron transport in Spinach

Abstract:
Electron transport is an essential step in photosynthesis, and its rate largely influences the rate of photosynthesis. In this paper, the relationship between the pH of the environment and the rate of electron transport is discovered. pH3, pH6.5, and pH10 represent the acidic, neutral, and basic environment. The electron transport appears to have the highest rate in the neutral environment. The electron transport activity in pH 6.5 is significently higher than that in pH3 and pH10.

Introduction:
Electron transport is an important procedure in photosynthesis in plants. It helps to generate energy for plant daily use. In this experiment, the rate of electron transport is measured. All green-leave vegetables could be used as the source of observing the rate of electron transport. Spinach is used in this experiment. In nature, there are so many factors that would influence the rate of electron transport. pH is undoubtedly an important factor. Photosynthesis is an essential procedure in plants’ growth and living. The carbon fixation involved in the photosynthesis provides the source for aerobic respiration (Black, 1973), which is the main process of plants getting usable energy and keep growing. Since the electron transport rate determines the rate of photosynthesis, discovering how the environmental factor influence the rate of electron transport helps to discover the influence on photosynthesis. The pH of the mud or water environment would highly influence the metabolism of plants. So, the Biological Question of this experiment is: How the pH value affects the rate of electron transport in spinach leaves? The initial hypothesis of this experiment is that: As the pH goes down, the electron transfer will increase.

Materials and Method:
Preparation: 
First of all, remove the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves, throw away the veins, and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water; Blot off any excess moisture from the leaves. Then, add 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), grind the spinach until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. When done with grinding, add an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mix with the spinach slurry, and strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker.

Extracting chloroplast:
Transfer the green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spin it at 200 times the force of gravity, 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4oC. Be sure to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. After centrifuge for the first time, pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Prevent the debris at the bottom of tube “A,” from going into tube “B”. Centrifuge the second time for the 50-Ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4oC. Again, pour the supernatant to another container. Add an extra 15 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Then, aliquot into 3, 5 Ml volumes by dividing among 3 conical tubes. Add 5 Ml of reaction buffer to each conical tube and spin again at 2800 ppm for 10 minutes. Re-suspend pellet in approximately 3 Ml grinding buffer to concentrate chloroplasts.

Test the response of pH on the electron transport:
Label 10 large test tubes, one Blank tube containing 8Ml of distilled water, 2Ml of pH 6.5 Buffer; three Acidic tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2Ml of pH3 Buffer; three neutral tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2Ml of pH 6.5 Buffer; and three Basic tubes containing 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 Mm DCIP, and 2Ml of pH 10 Buffer. Place them in a tube rack. Turn on the spectrophotometer, and set it to read at 600nm. Add 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts prepare. Then mix each tube immediately after adding the chloroplasts. After mixing, transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Blank the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 0, and then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. Place all tubes directly under direct light for 10 minutes, after 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with Sample 0, Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light, blank the spectrophotometer, again measure the absorbance a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbance one more time for all 10 samples. 

Statistic Method used:
Since there are three sets of data, two paired t_tests are used to find the significance of the result. 


Results:
For pH3, the general trend of change in absorbance is the decrease in the absorbance, while at 20 min, the change in absorbance increases. For pH 10, the absorbance of the solution is always increasing compared to the initial absorbance value. However, for the pH 6.5 curve, the absorbance of the solution decreases dramatically in the first 10 minutes, and then decreasing slower, and in the last 10 minutes, the absorbance increases by a small amount. (Figure 1)

Two paired t_tests are used in this experiment, for comparing pH 3 and pH 6.5 sets of data, the result of paired t_test is: p_value = 0.008; t value = 78.53. The result for the paired t_test between pH 6.5 and pH 10 is: p_value = 0.000006; t value = 69.56. 


Discussion:
pH 3 environment decreases the absorbance by about 20%, which means that electron transport chain could take place under acidic environment. However, in pH10 environment, the absorbance increases. This indicates that the electron transport chain could not take place under alkaline environments, or the basic environment inhibits the electron transport. For pH 6.5 environment, the absorbance decreases dramatically for about 99%. From comparing these three sets of data, pH 6.5 is the most optimum environment among the three chosen environments for electron transport to occur. The p_values are much less that 0.05, which means the three groups are significently different from each other. So, the electron transport rate in pH6.5 environment is significently higher than that in acidic and basic environments. This doesn’t match out hypothesis, which the lower pH, the higher rate of electron transport occurs. From this experiment, the optimum pH for electron transport is around 6.5. This mat because of the different source of the chloroplasts. What’s more, since the limitation of the number of pH trials, pH6.5 may not be the most optimum pH. There may be a higher peak in activity between pH3 to pH6.5, or between pH6.5 and pH10. But from this experiment, we found that the pH3 is more favored than pH10 environment, which means the peak is between pH3 and pH6.5. There are some possible errors in the experiment. First of all, though we tried to compensate the difference in color among different pHs, the spectrophotometer may still be influenced, so the data may be altered and less accurate. What’s more, there’s an abnormal value appeared in pH3 30 minutes absorbance, which means that there may be an error in measuring or doing the data collection. For further experiment, more different values of pHs should be tested to minimize the range of optimum pH for electron transport, and more other factors that may influence the photosynthesis rate else than electron transport rate could be tested to more accurately determine the rate of photosynthesis. (Emerson, Robert, and Charlton M. Lewis, 1939) After knowing how pH influences the rate of electron transport, the influence on photosynthesis rate could also be conjected. With the data of how pH influence photosynthesis and electron transport, the farmers could theoretically measure and manipulate the pH of the soil to maximize the rate of electron transport, thus the rate of carbon fixation. As the rate of carbon fixation is maximized, the plants would grow faster and better.
