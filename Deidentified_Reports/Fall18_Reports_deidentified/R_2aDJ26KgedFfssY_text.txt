Title: Limited growth and arrested development in Manduca sexta resulting from 20E blocker

Abstract:
Hormones regulate the growth and development of plants and animals through a variety of functions. In many insects, Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone (20E) are primarily responsible for the development and maturation in these organisms. Insect growth regulators are substances used commercially to alter the natural demonstration of these hormones in a form of pest controll. In this experiment, we used a commercial 20E blocker, Azaguard, to analyze alterations in growth and development of larval Manduca sexta. With a controll group fed standard food and a controll group fed identical food with the added azaguard component, we completed a two-week experiment observing the larval development. We hypothesized that by feeding this inhibitor to M. sexta larva, they would grow smaller in weight than a controll group and would be unable to successfully pupate to adults. Our experiment supported this hypothesis finding the change in weight to be significently less in those fed the azaguard than the controll. Limited development was also evidenced in the experimental group as many of them died while the controll pupated. 

Introduction:
This experiment investigates the impact of hormone variation on insect development. In the caterpillar, Manduca sexta, ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone are two types of hormones that primarily regulate growth and development. The life cycle of a Manduca sexta caterpillar typically consists of five instar stages of larva before pupal and finally adult forms [Johnson: 2018]. During its larval period, juvenile hormone allows growth of the larva while 20E regulates the molting process to subsequent larval and pupa stages [Riddiford: 2003]. Extensive experimentation has been done with Manduca sexta as a model organism for the trends in insect developments. Spikes in 20E concentrations have been seen to initiate a molt to another instar larval stage. Additionally, a spike in 20E simultaneously with low levels of juvenile hormone initiate a commitment pulse to pupation [Riddiford:2003]. Insect growth regulators are used commercially as insect controll and impact the typical growth cycle of insects such as the Manduca sexta [Tunaz: 2004]. In this experiment, we used the insect growth regulator azaguard which functions as a 20E inhibitor. I hypothesize that by introducing this inhibitor to the diets of Manduca sexta larva, the insects will grow smaller in weight than a controll group and will be unable to develop typically to pupate. 

Materials and Method:
To test the effects of 20E blocker, we selected eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of similar initial size and weight. The caterpillars were categorized into two groups of four each to be tested as a controll group and experimental group. Each caterpillar was placed into individual enclosures and housed in identical temperature and light conditions throughout the experiment. Each individual of the test group was fed 10g of prepared food with an added 4 drops of distilled water. The test group was fed 10 g of prepared food with four drops of Azaguard, a 20E blocker, added. Every day for two weeks, each caterpillar was weighed, and its physical appearance was observed. Food was replaced when the supplied food was largely consumed or dried at an average rate of every other day. A one-tailed, two sample t_test was used to compare the difference in maximum and initial mass. Averages of group daily mass measurements were plotted on a line graph to compare general group trends throughout the experiment.

Results:
The mean growth difference in the controll group was 6.765 g and the experimental group was 2.1275 g (Fig. 1). The standard deviation was 1.38 for the controll group and 0.975 for the experimental group (Fig. 1). The difference in growth averages between the controll group and experimental group was statistically significent (t_stat=5.48, d.f.=6, p_value=.000774). The average weight of Manduca sexta in the experimental group was consistently less than that of the controll (Fig. 2). All four of the caterpillars in the controll group pupated by the end of the experiment. The experimental group ate less than the controll and appeared lethargic throughout the experiment. Three out of four of the experimental group died by the end of the experiment.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that Manduca sexta fed 20E inhibitors would grow smaller in weight and would not develop properly, was supported. The t_test rejected the null-hypothesis with an incredibly low p_value demonstrating a significent difference in the growth change between the experimental and controll groups. Additionally, a graph of average weight in the groups over the course of the experiment demonstrates clear differentiation between the experimental groups. In the time frame of the experiment, all of the controll Manduca sexta were able to successfully pupate demonstrating the expected developmental progression. On the other hand, most of the experimental group died. This is consistent with the commercial purpose of insect growth regulators as pest controlls through alteration of normal development [Tunaz: 2004]. The experimental group also demonstrated a drop in mass before pupation. Studies have shown the spike in 20E that initiates pupation to cause larva to stop feeding and lose weight in preparation for their pupal stage [Nijhout: 2007]. The more gradual loss of weight in the experimental group could be indicative of an attempt to pupate in the 20E inhibited organisms or a result of general deterioration. Additional experimentation would be necessary to determine causality.
