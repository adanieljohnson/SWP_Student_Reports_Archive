Title: The effects of Tubocurarine on the responses of the gastrocnemius muscle group of frog legs

Abstract:
In the experiment we used three frog legs to study the effects of the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist Tubocurarine on the contraction of the frog gastrocnemius muscle. Muscular neurons require ACh as the neurotransmitter to transfer the signals or messages between neurons so that the action potential signals could be passed to the neurons or muscles. In the lab, Tubocurarine was injected into the gastrocnemius of the frog leg to compare . It was hypothesized that the addition of 1mL of 1mM Tubocurarine would cause the decrease in response amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle. The data obtained in the experiment did not show a significance difference between the control group and the experimental group but the still showed some differences between the values so we concluded that the application of Tubocurarine would have effects on the response amplitude. 

Introduction:
Both in vertebrates and invertebrates, there are skeletal muscles to support the animal body and the skeletal muscles are made up of hundreds and thousands of myofibers. Myofiber is the smallest complete contractile system and it is used in contraction system. Every individual myofiber is bounded with the other by connective tissue. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons and the axons of the neurons will extend into a muscle at points called neuromuscular junctions. At a neuromuscular junction, the motor neuron will transmit the signals to the muscle fiber and cause the contraction. The synaptic transmission occurs at the neuromuscular junction when an action potential reaches the presynaptic axon terminal of motor neuron. The sodium channels open to let the sodium ions rush into the neuron and then the voltage-gated calcium channels open to let calcium ions enter. The calcium ions trigger the fusion of acetylcholine(ACh) vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. Then the ACh molecules will bind to the postsynaptic receptors to open the cation channels and continue the next depolarization in the next neuron. In the experiment, we attached the force transducer to the sciatic nerve and analyzed the myogram to determine response amplitude of the gastrocnemius muscle. Also, in the experiment we are used the 1mM Tubocurarine as the nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. Tubocurarine is the prototype non-depolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants [Cclarks: 2018]. Its function is to paralyze the muscle group. It is a selective competitive antagonist for skeletal muscle nicotinic receptors [Cclarks: 2018].  At low concentration neuromuscular blockers compete with ACh for binding to postsynaptic nicotinic receptor sites in the skeletal muscle neuro-muscular junction [Cclarks: 2018]. After combining the process of muscle contraction and the function of the Tubocurarine, we have the hypothesis as if we apply the nicotinic ACh-receptor antagonist Tubocurarine to the gastrocnemius muscle, the response amplitude of the muscle contraction will decrease. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs of similar sizes are selected for the experiment. Grasp the skin of the leg and separate the inner thigh muscles to free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue. The legs are kept moist with Ringer’s solution to maintain the muscle’s contractile ability. Attach the probe to the sciatic nerve and hang the gastrocnemius muscle, which is isolated from the connective tissue by cutting through the Achilles tendon, to the specific instrument. Then run the software and apply the stimulus current of 0.1A, 0.2A, 0.5A, 1.0A, 1.5A and 2.0A with frequency of 5Hz to the nerve. Record the response voltage amplitude of the response for each stimulus. Then use the syringe to inject 1mL of 1mM of Tubocurarine solution to the gastrocnemius muscle at different positions. Wait for at least five minutes and repeat the stimulus with the same stimulus and record the values of the responses. Repeat the same steps with the other two frog legs and use paired t-test to compare the values for each leg and get the conclusion. 

Results:
We used the values of highest response amplitudes for three frog legs separately because we only need two values, the control and the experimental one, from each frog leg to run the paired t-test. Also, in this experiment, we had to use the paired t-test because we were comparing the values of one frog leg instead of comparing between different legs. In addition, frog leg 2 which on the graph has value of 1.0V stimulus amplitude was pale and had no blood which might influence the whole result of the experiment. 

Discussion:
Usually in the biology experiment we use significance level of 5% and since p value obtained in the experiment was 0.0586, we rejected the hypothesis that if we apply the nicotinic ACh-receptor antagonist Tubocurarine to the amplitude of the muscle contraction will decrease. However, p value was very close to 5% and we concluded this as there was difference between the response amplitudes we got from the control and the experimental group but the difference was not significant. The reason why we used the muscle contraction amplitude was because muscular contractions are taken as an index of the propagation of the impulses across the impaled region [ICHIJI: 1952]. We compared the values of three legs and discovered there was an obvious decrease in control and experimental values. By assessing the contraction amplitudes of the muscle, we knew the propagation of the impulses to that we could speculate the effects of the antagonist on the muscle. Some of the ACh receptors lose their functions because they are blocked by the Tubocurarine so there is less amount of neurotransmitters being transferred between the neurons. The neurons are less excited but they can still transfer the action potential between neurons because action potential is an all-or-none response. 

Also, there was another reason why we might could still conclude Tubocurarine will decrease the muscle contraction amplitude. The frog leg 2 in the experiment was pale and lack of blood compared with the other two. Also the responses created by this frog leg, both the control and experimental group values, were much lower than the values of the other two frogs. It might be due to the frog has died for a long time and the muscles were lack of ATP to do the muscle contraction. Or the other reason was that the frog was sick so that it did not perform normally. In the experiment we had three legs both worked as the control group and experimental group because each individual was different and we could not mix them together to prevent the similar situations like the second frog leg. Also, the reason why we used three legs was because we wanted to reduce the influences of the deviations brought abnormality, for example, the second frog leg. So if we had the leg 2 operate normally, we might gain a smaller p value for us to accept the hypothesis. 

However, even though we injected the antagonist to the frog leg, there were still responses from the muscle because the volume we injected to the muscle group was not enough to block all the ACh receptors or to paralyze all the muscle so that there were still lower responses produced by the muscle. 

For further study, we can change the volume we inject to the muscle to see if we inject enough amount of ACh-receptor antagonist Tubocurarine to the muscle then there will be no response from the muscle group because all the ACh receptors are blocked. Also at the same time, we can increase the number of frog legs to reduce the influence of the deviations from each frog leg.
