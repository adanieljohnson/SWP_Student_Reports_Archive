Title: The Influence of 20E on Manduca Sexta Development

Abstract:
Abstract: This experiment tested the effects of a high dosage of ecdysterone blocker on the growth rate and pupation in the caterpillar, Manduca Sexta. I hypothesized that a high dosage of 20E blocker would cause those caterpillars treated with this to grow slower than those not treated with any hormone blocker. To conduct this experiment, my lab group used 8 different caterpillars with four in the control group and four in the experimental group in order to have four replicates for each group. The control group received 10g of food with 10 drops of water in it and the experimental group received 10g of food with 10 drops of Aza Guard, the 20E blocker, in it. The caterpillars were weighed daily. The hypothesis was statistically supported due to the fact that the P value of the two sample T-test was less than 0.05. The data gathered from the experiment showed that caterpillars given a high dosage of 20E blocker will grow slower than those that do not receive it.


Introduction:
Introduction: The development, molting, and pupation of insects is controlled by the hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormones (JH). This lab focuses on the effect of 20E. 20E is secreted by prothoracic glands, groups of cells in the back of the insect’s head and thorax. 20E most specifically regulates the timing of an insects molting and regulates other functions in adult insects. The metamorphosis of insects treated with high amounts of 20E blocker is halted. Blocking 20E in insects can cause the them to become pupal-adult intermediates due to the fact that the primary function of 20E is the induction of periodic apolysis during the insect’s postembryonic development [Socha; 1972]. Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, has a holometabolous life cycle in which they go through the process of molting, pupation, and finally metamorphosis to complete its development. Based off of Socha’s experiment and knowledge of the effect of growth hormones on insects, my group hypothesized that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are given a high dosage of 20E blocker they will grow at a slower rate than Manduca sexta caterpillars that are not given a dosage of chemicals that can block 20E. 

Materials and Methods:
Methods: To begin the experiment, we poked holes in a plastic container that were divided into four compartments to house the Manduca sexta caterpillars. Next, we labeled the containers as either control or experimental and labeled each compartment with numbers one through four. Next, we selected our caterpillars and weighed each of them in grams and recorded the weight. We used a total of eight caterpillars for this experiment, 4 for the control group and 4 for the experimental group. After weighing each caterpillar, we placed them each into a separate compartment in the control and test containers. After weighing and recording the weight of the caterpillars, we prepared the food for them. Each caterpillar in the control group received 10g of food with 10 drops of tap water, administered by a pipette, mixed into the food. After weighing and mixing in the water, we rolled the food into balls and left one in each of the control groups compartments. The experimental group received 10g of food with 10 drops of 20E blocker called Aza Guard, administered by a pipette, mixed into it. The 10 drops of Aza Guard classified this experiment as having a high dosage of the 20E blocker. Next, we rolled the food and hormone blocker mix up into a ball and placed one of them inside each of the experimental groups containers. After the caterpillars were fed, we placed the top onto the container and put them into the incubator. Over the next two weeks, a different member of the group would come every day to check on the caterpillars and weigh them. The group member would weigh the caterpillars, record their data, and give the caterpillars fresh food if the food had dried out and no longer felt moist to the touch. We used a one sample T-test to determine if the difference in growth between the control group and the experimental group was statistically significant. The t-test values used were the average of the control weights and the average of the experimental groups weight for a single day. 

Results:
Results: The mean value for the control group was 5.50 ± 1.77 while the mean value for the experimental group of caterpillars was 4.46 ± 0.86. The mean weight value for the control group was statistically significantly greater than the experimental group (t-stat = 1.84, df = 22, P = 0.04). The caterpillars in the experiment greatly fluctuated in weight. Day five of the experiment marked the peak weight of both the control and the experimental group. On this day, the average weight of the control group reached 8.81g and the weight of the experimental group reached 5.32g. After this peak in weight caterpillars in both the control and experimental groups began to lose weight. By day 10,  3 out of 4 of the control caterpillars has pupated while none of the experimental caterpillars had. On the last day of the experiment, all four of the control caterpillars had pupated. None of the experimental caterpillars pupated. Three of the experimental caterpillars were a yellow-green color but turning brown. All of them were extremely unresponsive and lethargic. The fourth caterpillar in the experimental group was dead. During the first week the caterpillars were much more responsive, squirming around when they were picked up and weighed. 

Discussion:
Discussion: My hypothesis, that Manduca Sexta caterpillars given a high dosage of 20E blocker will grow at a slower rate than those not given it, was statistically supported by this experiment. The results of this experiment show that the caterpillars given 20E blocker will develop slower than the ones not given it and as a result, not pupate at the same time. In the natural development of insects, there is a spike of 20E at each instar. Giving insects a high dosage of Aza Guard, which blocks or inhibits 20E, makes them grow at a decreased rate. The control group grew at a quicker rate and grew heavier than the experimental group (Fig. 1). The control group also had a larger difference between the average weight of the caterpillars at Day #1 than at Day #5, the day of maximum average weight for both control and experimental groups (Fig. 2). 20E controls development in insects, specifically the timing of their molting. A decrease of 20E, disrupts the system and causes the caterpillar to stay in juvenile state. This excess 20E leads to the existence of the pupal-adult intermediates of the species because it accelerates the apolysis process [Socha: 1972]. This is because the insects are still developing but they do not have the hormone available to pupate and become a full adult. The results from the experiment, along with the one sample 2 tail T-test, showed that the hypotheses was proven because the results were statistically significant. These results correspond with the information from the Socha (1972) article. Our Maduca sexta experiment occurred during the time Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina. A possible source of error in this experiment was that my lab group was not able to check and weigh the caterpillars every day because the school was closed as a result of the hurricane. We are missing three days of data, which has the possibility to alter the results of the experiment. In future research, one should make sure to check on and weigh the caterpillars every day so as to not have a discrepancy in the data. Another issue with the current experiment is that the original weights of the caterpillars varied greatly. In a future experiment, one should select caterpillars that all start at a weight within a gram of one another.
