Title: Effects of different types of salt on the rates of photosynthesis of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Living organism must obtain energy to run metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Plants, protists, and bacteria capture and store energy from light energy from the sun through photosynthesis. Other cofactors are used to facilitate these reactions, such as light, Mn^2+ ions, chlorophyll, a phospholipid bilayer with a proton gradient, and several electron transport complexes. So, in this experiment, we will be using iodized salt, Kosher salt, and sea salt to testing how different types of salt affect the basic process or rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea, or spinach. And we hypothesized that the introduction of all types of salt would decrease the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach leaves, with sea salt having the most negative effect. The trend observed was that the sea salt solution had the highest average absorbance, and inhibited the rate of photosynthesis the most. While, the Kosher salt solution, actually exhibited the lowest average absorbance, and thus had the highest level of photosynthesis. Future study plans include looking at how different salt concentrations induce different effects on photosynthetic rates in plants.

Introduction:
Living organism must obtain energy to run metabolic processes, such as cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Plants, protists, and bacteria capture and store energy from light energy from the sun through photosynthesis, 6 CO2 + 12 H2O --&gt; C6H12O6 + 6 H20 + 6 O2. Other cofactors are used to facilitate these reactions, such as light, Mn^2+ ions, chlorophyll, a phospholipid bilayer with a proton gradient, and several electron transport complexes. This stored energy is subsequently released by glycolysis and respiration. The first stages photosynthesis are light-dependent reactions. These reactions generate most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis and are divided into, Photosystem I and Photosystem II. Along the Electron Transport Chain, which transfers electrons in a complex of oxidation-reduction reactions, involves excited electrons being pumped into the intermembrane space and reduce NADP+ to NADPH [Lambers: 2008]. Measuring ATP production, or reduction of plastoquinone or NADP+, is difficult. Electron transport chains in chloroplasts pass electrons to other electron acceptors besides NADP+, and are easier to measure. An example of which is the Hill reaction. When A is an electron acceptor, 2 H2O + 2 A → 2 AH2 + O2. The alternative electron acceptor we will use in this lab is 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). 2 H2O + 2 DCIP → 2 DCIPH2 + O2 compound with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600 nm. In contrast, reduced DCIP has conjugated C=C bonds and is colorless. The DCIP assay can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. The DCIP assay can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis [Moreland: 1962]. Previous studies have shown that salt stress causes decrease in plant growth and productivity by disrupting physiological processes, especially photosynthesis. The accumulation of sodium ions changes the ratio of the sodium and potassium ion gradient. This affects the bioenergetic processes of photosynthesis [Sudhir, 2004]. Understanding how plants respond to increased salinity can play a role in stabilizing crop performance under drought and saline conditions and in the protection of natural vegetation. Photosynthesis, together with cell growth, is among the primary processes to be affected by water or salt stress [Chaves, 2009]. So, in this experiment, we will be using iodized salt, Kosher salt, and sea salt to testing how different types of salt affect the basic process or rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea, or spinach. And we hypothesized that the introduction of all types of salt would decrease the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach leaves, with sea salt having the most negative effect because of the presence of the added ions disturbing the concentration gradients.

Materials and Methods:
We packed a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 ml size), and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves. Then, we threw away the veins and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Then, we blotted off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, we wiped them dry, then added the spinach leaves. Afterwards, we added 10 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). And grinded the spinach until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. Subsequently, we added an additional 10 ml of grinding buffer, mixing with the spinach slurry, and straining the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We then transferred the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spinning it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4*C. Making to include a balance tube in the centrifuge. Next, we poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”, making sure not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. We centrifuged the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4*C. We poured the supernatant, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C”, being careful not to disturb the pellet, and placed tube “B” on ice.    We then prepared: one blank test tube with 8 mL water, and 2 mL reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5); three control test tubes with 6 mL water, 2 mL 130 mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer and three replicates of 14 g of Kosher salt, sea salt, and iodized salt and 6 mL water, 2 mL 130 mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer. After which, we added 100 uL of enriched chloroplasts (sample C) that we prepared and mixed each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. We transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes and immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using the blank. Then, we measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600 nm. We place the tubes under light, using a lamp. After 10 minutes, we re-blanked the spectrophotometer and re-measure all tubes. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) we re-blanked the spectrophotometer and re-measured all tubes. After 10 more minutes (30 minutes total) we re-blanked the spectrophotometer and re-measured all tubes. Record results in lab notebook using a table similar to the one below. We then ran a one-tailed two-sample T-test using the three absorbances the replicates of each salt solution after 30 minutes, compared to those of the control sample. Our significance level, or alpha value, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, and was set to 0.05.

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the trend observed was that the sea salt solution had the highest average absorbance, 0.209 +/- 0.074 (T-value = 0.454, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.121), followed by control, 0.202 +/- 0.035, followed by iodized salt, 0.189 +/- 0.087 (T-value = 0.396, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.356), and then Kosher salt, 0.159 +/- 0.128 (T-value = 1.49, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.104). All of our statistical tests resulted in alpha values above 0.05, which means our results were statistically insignificant. Using the the properties of (DCIP), which absorbs light maximally at 600 nm, we can indirectly measure the amount of reduced DCIP, which has conjugated C=C bonds and is colorless, and absorbs less light at 600 nm. So the higher the absorbance levels, the lower rate of photosynthesis, and vice-versa. When looking at Figure 1 and the absorbance of each salt solution compared to the control with not salt added, 0.202, Kosher salt had the lowest absorbance levels, 0.159, meaning a higher rate of photosynthesis.  Sea salt solution had the highest average absorbance, 0.209, and thus inhibited the rate of photosynthesis the most, with the most negative effect.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of all types of salt would decrease the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach leaves, with sea salt having the most negative effect, was not fully supported by our results. When looking at the absorbance of each salt solution compared to the control with not salt added (0.202 +/- 0.106), iodized salt (0.189 +/- 0.087) and Kosher salt (0.159 +/- 0.128) had lower absorbance levels, meaning a higher rate of photosynthesis. Sea salt solution had the highest average absorbance, 0.209 +/- 0.074, meaning that sea salt had the most negative effect on the rate of photosynthesis.  During photosynthesis, the light dependent reactions generate most of the proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis. Accumulation of excess protons in the lumen creates an electrochemical gradient that is pushing protons back towards the stroma (innermost space) of the chloroplast. When protons move down their combined electrical and diffusion gradient, new ATP molecules are synthesized by this complex [Lambers: 2008]. Sea salt has more ions and minerals compared to Iodized salt, which is stripped of most minerals during manufacturing. Kosher salt, which contains no Iodine and other additives. Not only do the sodium ions flood the lumen, altering the gradient, iodine ions could possible also have an effect. Sea salt, which contains the most trace minerals, decreased the rate of photosynthesis the most, in comparison to the control. A future study would be to look at how different salt concentrations induce different effects on photosynthetic rates in plants. In our experiment, we used 400 mM salt concentration, but our results somewhat indicate that the levels of salt weren’t really high enough to statistically affect the rates of photosynthesis, and maybe due to the chloroplasts themselves in the solutions. An experiment that supports this hypothesis was published by Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety in 2017 and demonstrated that certain plants can tolerate diﬀerent salt concentrations. However, higher salt levels induced a constraint of photosynthetic activity through carbon dioxide uptake [Garcia, 2017]. This could have been do to the the chloroplasts being compromised and the water exchange in the plant was affected by the salt ion concentration gradient. Higher and continuous salt concentrations can compromise seedling growth and plant establishment, and thus plant growth, through signiﬁcant alterations in the leaf gas exchange [Garcia, 2017].
