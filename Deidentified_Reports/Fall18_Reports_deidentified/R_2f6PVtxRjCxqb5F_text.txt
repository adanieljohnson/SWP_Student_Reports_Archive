Title: Juvenile Hormone Effects on Manduca sexta Larvae Weight and Development

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone play a crucial role in the development of Manduca sexta. Precor, an artificial form of juvenile hormone, can be added to the insects’ diet to manipulate their hormone levels at different stages of their life cycle. This experiment uses Manduca sexta caterpillars, yet to reach their commitment pulse, and treat an experimental group with a diet containing precor to delay their pupation and to show the continuous increase of weight without the natural drop of juvenile hormone levels. Results show that the experimental group did show a greater increase in weight over time and did not pupate after 7 days, contrasting to the controll group who showed successful pupation. Conclusions drawn suggest that the organism’s inability to reach its commitment pulse inhibited its ability to pupate while those caterpillars whose juvenile hormone levels naturally dropped were able to pupate successfully. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, a species of moth native to Northern and Central America is considered a pest in its larval form. Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E) are two key hormones that play a significent role in the maturation of the Manduca sexta, especially from its 5th larval instar to its pupal form. In particular, these hormones together promote the organism’s ability to reach its commitment pulse. This crucial point is reached when JH levels drop significently at the end of the 5th larval instar and 20E levels rise [Baker: 2003], indicating that the insect has reached a sufficiently large size with enough nutrients to pupate into its final stage of adulthood. In this lab, Manduca sexta hormone levels are manipulated with precor, an artificial growth hormone that simulates the effects of JH to see whether the addition of the hormone can lead to a delay in pupal development. Precor is added to the diet of 4 trial larvae, while 4 controll larvae receive the addition of water to the same diet. Is it hypothesized that the addition of precor to the organism’s natural supply of hormones will simulate an increase in JH levels, thus delaying their commitment pulse and allowing the organisms to continue growth in the 5th larval instar. Specifically, it is predicted that the experimental Manduca sexta will show a greater change of weight over time than that of the controll group. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars around the 11 to 12 weeks of age were obtained and split into 2 groups of 4. One group was assigned to the controll group and one to the experimental group. Holes were punctured in each of the enclosures to ensure oxygen circulation; one caterpillar was placed in each enclosure. The controll group was treated with a regular diet including 5 drops of water. The experimental group was given the same diet, but with 5 drops of precor mixed in. Each food supply and additional liquid was replaced every 2 to 3 days. All enclosures were kept in an incubator while data was not being recorded. Each caterpillar was weighed every 2 to 3 days and observations were taken based on physical changes of each caterpillar. To test significance of the hypothesis and compare the experimental and controll groups, a one-way ANOVA test was used. 

Results:
The data in Table 1 shows the difference in weights of the caterpillars, both controll and experimental groups, between each data collection. As displayed in Figure 1, both groups, on average, showed over 3 gram increases in weight from Day 0 to Day 3 with the controll group growing more than the experimental group. The following data collection on Day 5 shows a smaller weight increase for both groups, each growing less than 3 grams, with the experimental group’s weight increasing more than that of the controll group. By the last data collection on Day 7, the controll group’s weight decreased over 2 grams while the experimental group continued growing over a gram. In general, both groups showed a smaller increase of weight over time until the experimental group began to lose weight. The two-sample t_test gave a one tailed p_value around 0.481, giving evidence that the data is not statistically significent.

Discussion:
In general, the hypothesis was supported by the data from the caterpillars used for testing. Observations over time revealed that after the 7 days, all 4 larvae from the controll group had reached their commitment pulse and pupated. In contrast, all 4 experimental larvae were still in their larval form, with much greater mass than their initial size on Day 0. This evidence is supported by the Manduca sexta’s capacity to drop JH levels at the end of their 5th larval instar just before pupation. The introduction of precor prevented JH levels from dropping significently, allowing the organisms to keep growing because high JH levels signal a continuation of growth in earlier larval instar stages. In an observation of hormone levels, another experiment found the JH levels dropped almost completely in this crucial point of development [Baker: 2003]. The addition of artificial JH inhibited the drop that signals the end of the 5th larval instar, delaying the pupation of the experimental group and arresting them in a larval form. Graph 1 reveals that over time, both groups did increase in size, but the controll group actually decreased between Day 5 and Day 7 before they pupated. This trend suggests that naturally, these insects would get smaller before they form pupae. To test if this weight loss was an error, the experiment could be repeated with a larger population size and record the weight over time of the caterpillars from the beginning of the 5th larval instar to their pupal phase, paying special attention to not only the comparison of net weight change between groups but within the controll. The higher net weight change of the experimental group supported the initial hypothesis. However, the statistical test reveals that the results found are not statistically significent. This could result from the small sample size of the experiment. In the future, a higher probability for statistically significent results would require larger sample sizes. Studying these hormones and their effect on the maturation of the Manduca sexta could help the development of pesticides to target the organisms from their early larval stages and induce early pupation by blocking their JH hormones.
