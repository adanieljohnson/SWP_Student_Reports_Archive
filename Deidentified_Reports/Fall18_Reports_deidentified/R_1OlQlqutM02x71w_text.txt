Title: The Effects of Hunger on Agonistic Behavior in Siamese Fighting Fish

Abstract:
This study focused on the effects of hunger on the frequency of agonistic behavior in male Betta splendens. To conduct this experiment, a hungry fish was paired with a well fed fish and placed in an aquarium with a clear partition. There behavior was observed for five minutes. I hypothesized that betta fish that were hungry would show lower levels of aggression than those that were fed properly and this hypothesis was supported by the data and through statistical testing. The results of this experiment suggest an inverse relationship between hunger levels and aggression in male Betta splendens. 

Introduction:
In nearly every ecosystem, animals are forced to interact with other species, as well as with members of their own species. Interaction within a species, or intraspecific behavior, often manifests as a set series of signal behaviors known commonly as displays [Johnson, 2016]. These ritualized signals are regularly seen in male on male interaction to show aggression. This is known as agonistic behavior. One species that is known for displays of aggression and agonistic behavior is the Betta Splenden, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish. These fish show agonistic behavior due to their territorial nature. These displays increase in frequency when in the presence of other males. Agonistic behavior in Betta splendens is categorized into two distinct types: broadside movements and facing movements. There are three types of facing movements that the betta fish will display when being aggressive: erect pectoral fin (least aggressive), expansion of the gill covers, and the extension of the “Red Mane”(most aggressive). Likewise, there are three major broadside movements that betta fish display when being aggressive: pelvic fin flickering (least aggressive), tail beating, and tail flashing (most aggressive) [Johnson, 2016]. The purpose of this experiment was to test whether a lack of food would decrease the frequency of agonistic behaviors in a male Betta splenden. To test this we paired two fish, one who was fed and one who was not, in an aquarium with a transparent partition. My hypothesis is that the fish that was not fed will show less aggressive displays than the fish that was properly fed. 

Materials and Methods:
Six male Bettas were collected, three had been fed normally and the remaining three hadn’t received food in 24 hours. Two males, one fed and one hungry, were placed into a single tank and were separated to opposite sides of the tank by a barrier of glass and dark plastic. The fish were given two minutes to acclimate to their environment before observation began. At the end of the two minutes, the dark plastic partition was removed leaving only the glass. The males were allowed to view each other for five minutes. During this time the number of facing and broadside displays was tallied. This process produced three data points for facing movements and three for broadside movements. Each individual behavior was assigned a multiplier of one, two, or three based on how aggressive the behavior was (i.e. 1x for pelvic fin, 2x for tail beating, and 3x for tail flashing). These values were then added together to give an “aggression score” for each individual fish (three hungry, three fed). These scores were then used to create an average value for aggression for both hungry and not hungry fish. From here a one tailed two sample T-test was then run to determine significance. 

Results:
With a p value of p=0.001 there is statistical significance to the claim that hungry Betta splendens show less aggressive displays than properly fed bettas (Table 1). This supports my hypothesis.The well fed bettas had a higher aggression score (mean 97.6 +/- 16.7) than the hungry bettas (mean 22 +/- 9.53) see figure 1. 

Discussion:
This experiment illustrated a significant inverse relationship between hunger and aggression levels. Supporting the hypothesis that the hungry fish would show less agonistic displays. The bettas that had been held without food showed far less interest in being aggressive than the fish that had been well fed. This is in line with another experiment conducted by Nidia Castro on “Metabolic Costs of Aggressive Behaviour”. This experiment explains the aerobic costs of agonistic displays and fighting in betta fish [Castro, 2006]. The study found that the winners of fights showed higher levels of oxygen consumption after the fight. This shows that the acts of displays and fighting is costly. Given this context, it makes sense that a fish with low energy levels from a lack of food would be less willing to enter into a conflict. In order to add width to this study, it would be interesting to put two males (one fed, one hungry) in the same aquarium and introduce food into the environment. It would be interesting to see if the hungry fish became more aggressive in order to secure the food, or if the fully fed betta would use its strength to hoard/protect the food. In conclusion, this experiment showed a significant relationship between hunger levels and agonistic displays, supporting the original hypothesis.
