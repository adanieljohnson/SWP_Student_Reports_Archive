Title: The effect of ethanol on the twitch amplitude of Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle

Abstract:
For this experiment, ethanol was injected into the gastrocnemus muscle from the Rania pipiens frog, and we observed whether or not there was an effect on the twitch amplitude. Ethanol had previously been researched and is a known inhibitor of nerve and muscle pathways, so we were curious as to what direct effect it could have on the gastrocnemus, which could then be related to a broader understanding of the effects alcohol has on our own systems. Using a 2% ethanol solution, we predicted there would be a statistical difference between the injected and non-injected muscles. Our p_value was .9933, which did not support our hypothesis and was therefore statistically insignificent, showing that there was no difference between the twitch amplitude of the ethanol-injected and non ethanol-injected muscles. This experiment could have been re-done or further studied using higher concentrations of ethanol solutions or possibly repeated exposure to ethanol and testing over time.

Introduction:
Organisms rely on nerves and muscles in order to sense and respond to internal and external cues from the environment. The neuromuscular system is much faster and more efficient than hormones, as it can respond in milliseconds using electric signals. This efficiency makes it a major system to aid an organism’s functioning. These nerves, found in animals, are present and are what allow for movement and controll, as seen in the leg muscles of many organisms. Frog legs specifically can easily be artificially tested and recorded on a myogram to see the response of the muscle to an electrical stimulation, including the time to fatigue and the twitch amplitude of the muscle. Our experiment will focus on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens frog leg and its twitch amplitude. Chemicals can have a strong effects on twitch amplitude, as changing the balance of the natural chemicals in the process can inhibit or excite a response. Previous research has suggested that alcohol misuse leads to muscle weakness, citing that ethanol, the active chemical, creates an inhibitory effect [Cofán et al: 2000)]. For this experiment we will inject a Rania pipens gastrocnemus muscle with a 2% ethanol solution, expecting that if the muscle is injected with the ethanol there will be a statistical difference in twitch amplitude.

Materials and Method:
First, collect and remove the skin from 3 Rania pipens leg, then separate inner thigh muscles and pin them down to a dissecting pan with the gastrocnemus strung up on the force transducer. Throughout experiment, continually moistened with frog Ringer’s solution and handle carefully as not to disturb the sciatic nerve. The prongs of the force transducer were then attached into the base of the gastrocnemus muscle and use LabScribe to record the threshold of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle. The LabCribe settings were set to frequency 1Hz, 5 pulse, pulse width 5ms, and pulse amplitude 0.000V. Next, the threshold stimulus of the muscle was determined by increasing the amplitude by 0.5Hz until reaching threshold. Then, three pulses were conducted at the threshold rate plus one which was 1.3Hz, and the voltage of the contraction was recorded. We then injected 0.2Ml of 2% Ethanol into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens. After waiting five minutes, three pulses were conducted at the threshold plus 1, and voltage was recorded. Overall, three pulses were conducted on each leg without ethanol, then after 5 minutes three pulses were conducted with 0.2Ml of 2% Ethanol injected in the Rania pipiens gactrocnemius muscle. A two-tailed paired t_test was used to calculate the data.

Results:
Throughout the experiment, we noticed all the muscle’s twitch amplitudes decrease over time due to fatigue. The average voltage for the normal (non-injected) gastrocnemus muscles was 0.430333 Volts. The average voltage for the ethanol-injected gastrocnemus muscles was 0.431333 Volts. Our degrees of freedom was 4, our t-value was .008891, our one-tailed p value was .49666 and our two-tailed p value was .99332.

Discussion:
Our p_value was .99332 and was not statistically significent, probably because the ethanol concentration of 2% was too low to have an effect on the muscle. To gain significent results or furthering the study we could try using a higher concentration of alcohol to maybe have more drastic effects. Other further studies could use repeated exposure to ethanol, as to parallel the change that may occur over time as seen in patterns of alcohol abuse. These further experiments are not only useful to learning  more about the inhibitory effects ethanol may have on the body, but is very relevant to seeing the direct effects alcohol can have on our nerve and muscle systems.
