Title: Resource Allocation in Fagopyrum Esculentum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important topic in understanding environmental science. Resource allocation and phenotypic plasticity can be great indicators of environmental change. For our experiment, we sought out to test the effects of resource allocation in the plant, buckwheat.  We tested whether acid rain would lead to larger root:ratios than in those of buckwheat watered by regular water. After gathering our data and collecting a statistical analysis we found that the root:shoot ratios between the two groups showed no statistical significance. We believe that the chemical agents in the acid rain that we used was not different enough from the the chemical agents in the regular water that we used. We can improve upon our experiment by using a stronger acidic rain. We can also improve our experiment by being more consistent in watering the plants.


Introduction:
This experiment studies the effects of resource allocation in plants under different conditions. Our group will be testing the effects of resource allocation in the plant Fagopyrum esculentum or more commonly known as buckwheat. Buckwheat is a warm-season broadleaf annual with superficial surface roots a weak tap root and erect reddish stems (Clark, 2007). 
Buckwheat is a pseudo-cereal processed into products such as breakfast foods, flour and noodles, and is used as stuffing in therapeutic pillows. In 2012, buckwheat was grown as a commercial crop on approximately 33,687 acres throughout the U.S. (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2012). Buckwheat has historically been used as feed for cattle, pigs and chickens (Myers and Meinke, 1994).  We will be analyzing the phenotypic plasticity of buckwheat under different conditions. For our study we are to test if acid rain has a significant effect on the root:shoot ratios of buckwheat plants compared to that of buckwheat watered by regular water. Our hypothesis is that the plants watered by acid rain will have higher root:shoot ratios those of the plants watered by regular water. We believe that the plants watered by acid rain will allocate more resources toward soaking up more groundwater with a larger surface area.Acid rain is a rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic and possesses elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low pH) (Lal, 2016).
 Acid rain removes minerals and nutrients from the soil that trees need to grow (Environmental Protection Agency, 2017). Because of this, we believe that the plant will allocate more resources toward root growth to make up for the depleted soil resources. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin our experiment we collected buckwheat seeds from a bag in the laboratory. We then gathered eight canisters that are capable of holding soil. In each canister, we filled them close to the top. In each of canister we planted 10 to 20 buckwheat seeds. We then randomly separated the eight canisters into two groups of four. One group became our control group which was watered by tap water and the other group became the treatment group watered by acid rain. Over the course of a week, we watered the two groups of plants with their treatment, water or acid rain. After a week, we collected the plants from the greenhouse and took five plants from each of the canisters in each group. We then measured the weights of the shoots and roots of all of plants.  So in total we measured 20 plants from the acid rain treatment and 20 plants from the water treatment. As we measured our data, we recorded our data in a spreadsheet. After collecting our data, we calculated the means, standard deviation to assess their statistical significance. We also used a two-sample t-test to help us understand the statistical significance of our data.


Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of the buckwheat plants was .95 for the planted treated by water and .73 for the acid rain. The mean root:shoot ratio for the length of the buckwheat plants was 1.01 for the plants with water and 1.08 for the acid rain group. The average root:shoot ratio standard deviation for mass of the water group is .54 while the standard deviation for mass of the acid rain group is .42. The average root:shoot ratio standard deviation for the water group was .32 while the average root:shoot ratio standard deviation for the acid rain group was .40. We used a two-sample t-test to analyze the results of our study. The mean weight of the root:shoot ratios for the water and acid rain groups did not show statistical significance (t-stat= .98 df=19 P=.33). The mean length of the root:shoot ratios for the water and acid rain groups did not show statistical significance (t-stat=.44 df=19 P=.66). When we gathered the plants for measure, we could not tell a difference between the heights of the plants in each canister.


Discussion:
After collecting the data we must reject our hypothesis. Our hypothesis was that the plants watered by acid rain will have higher root:shoot ratios those of the plants watered by regular water. We observed no significant difference at the .05 level in the root:shoot ratios of the the buckwheat plants. These two group may not have been statistically significant due to the similarities of the different watering treatments that we used. The acid rain and the regular water may not have had much different pH levels. The difference in pH levels clearly was not strong enough to induce strong evidence of resource allocation. We can improve our experiment for the better by organizing which days a person would go to Winston Hall greenhouse to water the plants. We really didn’t know who watered the plants on certain days so there is a possibility that they did not get watered on some days. It is important for my lab partners and myself to have an efficient system to make sure that experiment runs smoother so that we may get accurate results for our study.
