Title: Effects of Acidic and Alkaline Environments on the Average Absorbance of Light Over Time by Chloroplasts in [Spinacia oleracea]

Abstract:
This experiment studied the effect of acidic and basic environments of chloroplasts on the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea. Chloroplasts are the primary organelle in plants that are used for photosynthesis and energy formation. The light independent and dependent reactions play a significent role in the production of energy as they produce the necessary glucose molecules to make ATP. The acidic and alkaline environments were made through a pH buffer of 5 and 10, respectively. It was hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesis would decrease if the pH of the environment was not neutral because it was thought that the change in pH would cause the degradation of the membranes in the chloroplasts results in lower absorbances. The independent variable was the pH of the environment and the dependent variable was the average percent change in absorbance. The results showed that there was no significent difference in the rate of photosynthesis between chloroplasts in acidic environments or alkaline environments (P= 0.711, d.f.=3). The most reasonable explanation for this result is that chloroplasts maintain a pH homeostasis. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process of energy capture in plants. Light energy is captured by the chloroplasts and is converted to glucose, which is then used by cellular respiration to produce ATP [Lambers]. ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is used for biological and chemical processes. In order for ATP to be generated, a series of redox reactions occur to create an electrochemical gradient [Avron: 1958]. Photosynthesis occurs through two types of light reactions: the light independent and the light dependent reactions. The light independent reactions produce glucose molecules and the light dependent reactions produce NADPH. In this experiment the rate of photosynthesis is measured when the environment of the chloroplasts is acidic or alkaline. Chloroplasts operate at a pH of about 6.5, and spinach is found to grow best in a neutral environment around a pH of 6.5 to 7. If the environment of the chloroplasts is more acidic or alkaline than its neutral environment, it is expected the average percent change in the absorbance of light by chloroplasts in [Spinacia oleracea] will be lower. The decrease in the average percent change in the absorbance of light over 30 minutes of time by spinach chloroplasts is expected to decrease because the membranes in the chloroplasts will degrade due to the changes in pH. Since the chloroplasts will no longer be in homeostasis, photosynthesis will not be able to occur properly due to the degradation of the membranes, resulting in an overall decrease in the average percent change in the absorbance of light over time. 


Materials and Method:
First, a mortar and pestle, a 150 Ml beaker, and a three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes were placed in crushed ice. Then, four medium-sized spinach leaves were obtained, the central veins were removed, the leaves were rinsed, and then blotted dry to remove excess moisture. The mortar and pestle was then used to grind the spinach leaves in 10 Ml of grinding buffer. The leaves were grinded until a thick paste formed, and 10 more Ml of grinding buffer was added. Then, three layers of cheese cloth were used to strain the paste. The following steps were conducted in order to obtain enriched chloroplasts to test the effect of pH. 200 L of the filtered paste was transferred from the beaker using a micropipette into a microtube labeled “Sample of A”, which was stored on ice. The rest of the solution was transferred to a 50 Ml conical tube marked “A” and was placed in the centrifuge to be spun at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4C. It was ensured that a blank was placed opposite the tube in the centrifuge. After, the tube was decanted into another tube marked “B” and the debris was left at the bottom. Then, 200 L of this was removed from “B” and placed into a microtube labeled “Sample of B”, which was stored on ice. After, the tube “B” was centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C. Then, the supernatant was decanted into another tube labeled “C” leaving the pellet behind in tube B. 15 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet in tube “B” and gently stirred in order to resuspend the pellet. The resuspended pellet was separated into three conical tubes. Each tube contained 5 Ml of the pellet and 5 Ml of corresponding pH buffers. One tube received the pH 5 buffer, another received the pH 10 buffer, and the last one received the grinding buffer which is at a pH of 6.5. Each tube contained 10 Ml of solution and was centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C. Then, 200 L were removed from tube “C” and placed into a microtube labeled in “Sample of C”, which is stored on ice. After this, 13 large test tubes were obtained, labeled, and placed on a tube rack. Each reaction mix was prepared with 3 replicates each. The blank of the experiment was prepared first with 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of the Hill Reaction buffer. The negative controll group, which consists of three test tubes, received no chloroplasts 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of Hills reaction buffer. Tubes 5-7 was the positive controll group, and received chloroplasts along with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of Hills reaction buffer. Tubes 8-10 represented the acidic environment, and received 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of Hills reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of pH buffer 5. Tubes 11-13 represented the alkaline environment, and received 13 received 5 Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of Hills reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of pH buffer 10. The assay started when 100 L of the enriched chloroplasts in tube “C” were added to the blank and tubes 4-12. The spectrophotometer was then immediately blanked and the absorbance of the tubes at time zero were recorded at 620 nm. The tubes were placed under a growth light for 10 minutes, and the absorbance for each tube was recorded. This was done again for times 20 minutes total and 30 minutes’ total. Finally, a Turkey-Kramer statistical test was conducted to see if there was a significance data between the acidic and alkaline environments, and the neutral environment. 


Results:
Figure 1 shows that the average percent change in absorbance is smallest in the negative controll, no chloroplasts, and highest in the acidic environment, pH buffer 5. The percent change in the no chloroplasts is 2.033  1.121. The percent change in the neutral chloroplasts is 34.37  52.742. The percent change in the acidic environment is 60.4003  102.366. The percent change in the basic chloroplasts is 28.203  37.207. The statistical test used was the Turkey-Kramer test. The statistical testing revealed that the difference in percent changes was not significent (P= 0.711, d.f.=3).


Discussion:
According to the statistical test, there is no significent difference in the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts in an acidic environment and chloroplasts in a basic environment. The results also did not support the hypothesis because the average percent change in absorbance of the acidic and basic chloroplasts did not decrease. Several studies conducted using pH showed similar results to this experiment. One such study used Sphagnum species and found that the rate of photosynthesis slightly varied between an acidic pH of 5 and a neutral pH of 7.5 [Haraguchi]. This is related to the experiment conducted because both dealt with changes in pH. The acidic pH had similar results to the neutral pH despite the change in acidity. The rate of photosynthesis was unaffected by the change of pH as the average percent change of absorbance was unaffected in the experiment done here. Another study found that chloroplasts adapt to their alkaline and acidic environments to maintain pH homeostasis through a proton exchanger consisting of sodium, potassium, and hydrogen [Song:2004]. Spinach chloroplasts also contain this proton exchanger [Maury]. This is a biological explanation for the result of this particular experiment. The chloroplasts adapted to their environment whether it be acidic or alkaline in order to continue photosynthesis to maintain survival. Future studies could investigate the realm of temperature in order to see if chloroplasts maintain homeostasis in environments that are more acidic or alkaline than a pH of 5 or 10 in order to see if the chloroplasts will continue to use the proton exchanger to maintain homeostasis or if the chloroplasts will ultimately show a decline in absorbance.
