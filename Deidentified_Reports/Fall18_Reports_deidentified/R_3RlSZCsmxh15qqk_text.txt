Title: The Impact of Tubocurarine on Muscle Contraction in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
All vertebrates and most invertebrates have a skeletal system that functions to give structure to their bodies and to support the muscles that are responsible for the generation of the force necessary for movement. The frog species Rania pipiens relies on the contraction of its gastrocnemus muscle to jump, stimulated by action potentials traveling down the sciatic nerve which cause a release of acetylcholine (ACh) into the synapse between the neuron and the muscle. In this experiment, the effect of tubocurarine, an ACh antagonist, on the threshold stimulus voltage required to stimulate muscle contraction was tested. Three frog legs were stimulated at increasing voltages first without the injection of tubocurarine and then after an injection of tubocurarine. It was hypothesized that due to the interruption of ACh communication due to the use of tubocurarine, the threshold stimulus voltage would increase. However, the data collected does not show a statistically significent difference in the threshold stimulus voltage before and after treatment. This suggests that while tubocurarine may not completely prevent chemical communication at the neuromuscular junction, it may be responsible for another aspect of neuromuscular controll.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle in most animals, including that of Rania pipiens, is controllled by the somatic branch of the peripheral nervous system, and more specifically by motor neurons. The axons of these motor neurons extend into muscle but then spread out to make synapses with individual myofibers, which make up a muscle with hundreds to thousands of other myofibers. These synapses between the axons and the myofibers are called neuromuscular junctions, and they are the location of the release of ACh [Johnson: 2018]. This neurotransmitter causes muscle contraction through a process called excitation-contraction coupling, where ACh binds to receptors on the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018]. That binding opens sodium channels, creating an action potential in the muscle fiber that leads to the release of Ca2+ ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of Ca2+ ions causes the muscle to contract [Johnson: 2018]. In the case of Rania pipiens, the sciatic nerve is the motor neuron that must be stimulated in order to produce the neurotransmitters to cause contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle. 
When the action potential in a motor neuron ceases, the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum halts, preventing the release of any additional acetylcholine from the axon terminals. However, the acetylcholine remaining in the synapse must be removed to stop the transmission of the neural message to the muscles which causes the muscle contraction. This can occur due to the action of acetylcholinesterase, which ends the chemical communication in the neuromuscular junction through hydrolyzation of acetylcholine [Downes: 2004]. Another method to stop communication is through the use of ACh antagonist drugs. One of the most common antagonists to ACh is tubocurarine which is an active ingredient in curare, a poisonous extract from plant leaves. It has been determined that tubocurarine acts as a competitive inhibitor in the acetylcholine receptor and therefore blocks the neural message [Aniszewski: 2007]. Because tubocurarine physically blocks ACh from binding to its receptors by binding to those same receptors itself, some scientists have conducted studies about tubocurarine’s ability to create depolarization in the muscle fiber. In those studies, it was shown that tubocurarine depolarizes the muscle but also causes a weakening in the amplitude of muscle twitches and decreases the severity of what would be spikes on a myogram [Kosay: 1972]. 
	In this experiment, tubocurarine is used to decrease the amount of ACh in the synapse. This drug blocks synaptic transmission [Konay: 1972], making it more difficult for the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle to contract. It therefore would require a greater amount of stimulation to initiate contraction; the stimulation voltage required for this first muscle twitch is referred to as a higher threshold voltage. For this reason, it is hypothesized that with the addition of tubocurarine, ACh concentration will decrease, and the threshold voltage for muscle stimulation will increase. In relation, it is expected that the amplitude of the muscle twitch at threshold will decrease due to the decreased amount of ACh binding to muscle fiber receptors.


Materials and Method:
3 hind legs of Rania pipiens were collected and skinned. The sciatic nerve of each leg was exposed, and the gastrocnemus muscle was separated from each leg and suspended from a force transducer with slight tension. Pins were used to hold the specimen in place. Ringer solution was applied to each opened leg to keep it fresh. The electrodes were placed under the sciatic nerve for neuron stimulation as opposed to direct muscle stimulation. iWorx’s LabScribe software was used to emit the pulses for stimulation as well as to record data on the action potentials associated with the muscle twitches. The stimulation was set to 5 W, 1 Hz, and 1 pulse. Each frog sciatic nerve was first stimulated without the application of tubocurarine, starting at a voltage of 0 V and then at increasing voltages at an interval of 0.1 V until 1 V was reached. After 1 V, the muscle was stimulated at intervals of 1 V until 5 V was reached. Amplitudes of the action potentials (if present) were recorded for each stimulation. Each frog gastrocnemus muscle was then subjected to an 0.1 Ml injection of 1mM tubocurarine. The tension of the suspended muscle was adjusted because of the increased weight and tone resulting from the injection. The sciatic nerves of each frog leg were again stimulated, following the same interval pattern as the test without treatment by tubocurarine. After each stimulation of varying voltages, the amplitudes of the action potentials that appeared were recorded. After all recordings were taken, the threshold stimulus voltage and the amplitude of the muscle twitch was determined for each frog leg, with and without the tubocurarine treatment. A paired t_test for each gastrocnemus muscle was used to compare the twitch action potentials before and after treatment and to determine if the difference in action potential voltage was statistically significent.

Results:
Each of the three frog legs displayed a different pattern of muscle twitches both before and after treatment. The first frog leg before treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.5 V before treatment, and the muscle twitch voltage increased steadily until stimulation with 2 V, where twitch voltage spiked. After treatment with tubocurarine, the same frog leg had a threshold voltage of 3 V and from that point on, twitch voltage remained relatively consistent (Fig.1). The second frog leg had a threshold voltage of 0.1 V before and after treatment; however, the voltage of the twitch at threshold voltage was much lower after treatment with tubocurarine in comparison with the voltage before treatment. The voltage of the twitches of the second frog leg peaked around stimulation with 0.2 V and then steadily decreased from there (Fig.2). The third frog leg’s pattern of twitch voltages was similar to that of the first leg in that its stimulus threshold voltage was larger after treatment with tubocurarine; before treatment, the threshold voltage for stimulation was 0.5 V while after treatment it was 0.6 V. However, other than this small difference in the stimulus threshold voltage, the voltages of the muscle twitches followed the same pattern: gradual increase and then a peak in voltage around a stimulus of 2 V (Fig.3). Figure 4 displays a comparison of threshold stimulus voltages and the muscle twitch voltages as a result of those stimulations for all three frog legs before and after treatment.
	The difference in threshold voltage between no treatment and treatment for each frog leg was determined to not be statistically significent manner (t_stat=1.095, d.f.=2, p_value=0.38776). The difference in voltage of the muscle twitch at the threshold voltage compared before and after treatment was not statistically significent either (t_stat=0.837, d.f.=2, p_value=0.490662). However, if statistically tested with a 90% confidence interval, the difference in twitch voltage at maximum stimulation voltage (5 V in this experiment) is just slightly statistically insignificent (t_stat=2.73022, d.f.=2, p_value=0.11205). The mean twitch voltage for the frog muscles prior to injection of tubocurarine was 0.3963 V with a standard deviation of 0.1057 V, while the mean twitch voltage rate for those same frog muscles after injection was 0.177 V with a standard deviation of 0.15198 V (Fig.5).


Discussion:
The proposed hypothesis that treatment with tubocurarine would cause an increase in threshold voltage was not supported, as shown by the insignificance of the difference in this stimulus threshold voltage before and after treatment. Because of tubocurarine’s proven ability to block chemical communication in the neuromuscular junction but also to cause depolarization, it could be inferred that the difference in threshold voltage was caused, in part, by the fact that tubocurarine would not cause action potentials to completely disappear in the muscle fiber [Koray: 1972]. In relation to this concept of prevention of neural message transmission, the expectation of a decrease in muscle twitch voltage after tubocurarine treatment was proved to be correct. The difference in voltages at maximal stimulation (5 V) was only slightly statistically insignificent, suggesting that in an experiment without the effects of error, the difference could potentially be significent. Due to tubocurarine’s function as a competitive inhibitor, in the presence of tubocurarine, less ACh receptors are going to bind ACh. However, without tubocurarine in the synapse, all receptors would bind ACh, creating a larger voltage difference (depolarization) and therefore a larger action potential in comparison with the action potential created when most ACh receptors bind tubocurarine.
	In a perfect scenario, the results of any experiment would prove to be accurate and reliable. However, it is more likely that experiment results are to be tainted with effects of some errors. In the case of this experiment, for the measuring of the muscle twitch voltages in the first frog muscle, the iWorx’s LabScribe software malfunctioned and that required intense electrical impulses to be sent to the sciatic nerve as a diagnostic test to determine the problem. These intense impulses could have potentially caused exhaustion in the muscle, leading to observations of higher voltages being necessary to initiate the initial muscle contraction. In addition, the intervals of stimulus voltages being used did not allow the exact determination of the stimulus voltage threshold for the second frog muscle. It is conceivable that after treatment, the threshold could have been slightly lower than the threshold before treatment; based on the voltages tested, this difference would not have been distinguishable. In addition, in other scientific studies of tubocurarine’s impact on neuromuscular controll in Rania pipiens, it has been found that higher level concentrations of the drug cause drastically different effects. It is possible that with the access to more than just 1mM tubocurarine, this experiment’s results would display different trends [Koray: 1972].
	The data suggests that tubocurarine reduces the strength of muscle contractions, making it applicable to use in human medicine. Curare, containing a high concentration of tubocurarine, was the poison of choice for the poison arrows of the Indians as a result of the paralysis it induces in its target. Early in the research on its impact on neuromuscular junctions in humans, tubocurarine was tested as a remedy to controll seizures and spastic states of certain illnesses [Console: 1951]. Console mentions that at the time of his article, tubocurarine had already been included in many anesthetic treatments because of its ability to relax muscles, especially in the abdomen [Console: 1951]. In current surgical procedures, tubocurarine is the muscle relaxant of choice [Aniszewski: 2007]. In the future, as Console mentions, it could be found that tubocurarine has the ability to prevent autonomic nervous system responses (also known as reflexes) like coughing and sneezing.
