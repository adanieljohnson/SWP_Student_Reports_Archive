Title: The negative impact of an acidic pH on photosynthetic rates of spinach (Spinacia oleracea)

Abstract:
In this experiment, we focused on the effect of acidic conditions on the photosynthetic activity of spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea). This type of experiment connects with environmental impacts such as the Acid Rain phenomenon and air pollution, which have been noted to affect photosynthetic rates in various ways. We hypothesized that an increase in acidity would cause a decrease in absorption after centrifuge treatment. We measured this by grinding spinach leaves and spinning samples with pH 3, 5, and 7 (neutral) treatments in a centrifuge, developing chlorophyll-rich samples in 9 test tubes. We treated the samples with DCIP and reaction buffer, and measured the absorbance for each tube after time increments of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. We calculated percent changes for these, and were then able to run a one-way anova test that categorized all of our results as insignificent, with an overall p_value of 0.616. Our absorbance decreased overall for the pH 5 and 7 solutions, and increased in the pH 3 solutions. We therefore were unable to conclude that there was a difference in the photosynthetic rates between the solutions treated with varying levels of acidity.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis, an autotrophic property that is crucial for each individual biome, relies on a variety of processes and reagents in order to function successfully. It is characterized by processes such as glycolysis to produce ATP and reduced carbon, as well as electrochemical gradients that utilize high-energy electrons to drive cellular reactions. Many of the reagents for this process, including sunlight, water, and soil, are procured from the environment that the autotroph utilizes as its habitat. This process is highly specific, so it is important that the environmental conditions follow this specificity, and factors such as temperature and pH can alter these ecosystems greatly. There are various compounds present in and around the plant environment that can affect electrochemical gradients and lower the pH of the environment with protons such as high envelope Mg2+ [Peters: 1991]. The electron transport chain relies heavily on conformational changes in the individual proteins to create this concentration gradient, and denaturing of these proteins, or an alteration of the pH of the water from the soil involved in this process, has been known to produce an effect in the composition of the plant body. Acidification, specifically in parts of the plant like the stroma, has been recorded as a photosynthetic inhibitor. An influx of H+ protons in the stroma causes a decrease in pH, which is important in that the stoma has linkages to chloroplast metabolism [Wu: 1992]. Therefore, in our experiment, we decided to focus on pH, specifically low pH, in order to determine the impact of an acidic environment on the photosynthetic production of a commonly-cultivated autotroph, spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We selected this variable because of its implication in Acid Rain and air pollution, as ozone treatments have been noted to cause significent decreases in photosynthesis [Reich: 1986]. To measure this, we used absorbance as our method of measuring photosynthetic rate, as a decrease in absorbance demonstrates an increase in photosynthetic activity, and the DCIP chemical used reacts to form a deep blue color which is diminished as the chloroplast function. We hypothesized that a decrease in pH would cause a decrease in photosynthetic activity, determined by percent change in absorbance rates. 

Materials and Method:
We prepared spinach leaves by removing the leaves from their stems and adding 20 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) and grinding in a mortar and pestle in 2 rounds of 10 Ml. Then, we transferred this into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube through a three-layered cheese cloth and spun for 10 minutes at 200 x G and 4 degrees Celsius. We poured out the supernatant into a separate centrifuge tube. Then, we spun this for 10 minutes at the same settings and then poured out that supernatant into another centrifuge tube, leaving the pellet alone. We suspended the pellet with 15 Ml normal grinding buffer and then separated it into 3 tubes equally. We added 5 Ml of pH 3 buffer to one centrifuge tube, 5 Ml of pH 5 buffer to another centrifuge tube, and 5 Ml more of grinding buffer to the last (controll) centrifuge tube. We allowed these to sit for 10 minutes. Then, we spun these for 10 minutes at the same settings, and re-suspended each pellet with 5 Ml grinding buffer after pouring out the supernatant. We transferred 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuge tubes and separated them into three sections of 3 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube empty of chloroplasts to serve as the blank (10 tubes in all). We added 6Ml of water to all tubes except for the blank, and added 8 Ml of water to that. The, we added 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP to all tubes except the blank. We added 2Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) to all tubes. We allowed each tube to sit for 10 minutes and measured absorbance using a spectrometer blanked at 600nm. We repeated the absorbance measures twice, after times 20 minutes and 30 minutes. Finally, we conducted a one-way anova statistical test with an alpha value of 0.05 using the percent change data from absorbance from times 10-30 minutes [Johnson: 2018].



Results:
Our average percent changes of absorbance from time 10 minutes to 30 minutes were -53.83% for the pH 3 tubes, 14.80% for the pH 5 tubes, and 20.43 for the pH 7 (neutral) tubes. The calculated standard deviations were 169.56 for the pH 3 tubes, 7.64 for the pH 5 tubes, and 21.08 for the pH 7 (neutral) tubes (Figure 1). The standard deviation for pH 3 was extremely high with a large percent change in tube 1 of the pH 3 samples. The highly negative value denotes a large increase in absorbance, while the positive percent changes denote a decrease in absorbance. The anova test characterized all of our comparisons as statistically insignificent, with an overall p_value of 0.616. We observed a darker blue color in the tubes with higher absorbance, and a more clear, light color in the tubes with lower absorbance.

Discussion:
Based on our data, we are unable to reject our null hypothesis on the basis that our results did not provide statistically significent differences in percent change of absorption between 10 and 30 minutes. As previously discussed, our standard deviation was notably high in the pH 3 samples, and the average percent changes in absorbance from 10-30 minutes was considerably lower than the other pH tubes, characterizing a large increase in absorbance between the two times. However, as the two other tubes at this time all demonstrated increases in absorbance, similar to the pH 5 measurements, it is likely that this result could be characterized as an outlier. We originally hypothesized that our pH 3 and pH 5 (more acidic) solutions would produce higher rates of absorbance, as we inferred that the chloroplast would be inhibited and therefore would not cause a discoloration due to the reduction of the DCIP dye. However, aside from the outlier value, we noticed decreases in absorbance on average, and the pH 5 tubes on average only demonstrated a slightly lower decrease in absorbance rates when compared to the neutral controll tubes (Figure 1). This is potentially due to the photosynthetic process not having been given as much time as nature would actually allow. Additionally, certain autotrophs react in separate ways to differing environmental conditions, so spinach (Spinacia oleracea) could be compared to similar plants in future experiments. The outcome of our experiment did not allow us to make a distinction between pH, but the role of this factor in autotrophic processes are highly investigated. For example, certain processes rely heavily not only on the pH, but also on significent changes in the pH, such as the proton gradient in the Electron Transport Chain of photosynthesis. As acidic environments are characterized by proton donors, pH environments affect the activity of the proton gradients in the same way that the electrochemical gradient affects it [Graber: 1976]. This means that a change in the flow of protons across photosynthetically-related envelopes in the plant can affect processes such as the protein conformational changes in the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which is highly important in energy production as well as the production of the products of the photosynthesis reaction (oxygen, glucose, etc.). In a different way, if one investigates the role of acid rain in wildlife degradation, it has been determined that acid rain simulations in some cases has not had a significent effect on autotrophs such as the red oak tree and the sugar maple tree, though it potentially would have been more effective to determine long-term effects instead of effects over a short period of time [Reich: 1986]. Even though spinach and trees have structurally different compositions, they share highly similar energy production processes, so this potentially could connect to our short-term experiment as well. It has also been noted that the sulphate concentration in acidic rain can be highly damaging to leaf surfaces [Cape: 1992], so an effective experiment could be found in measuring the photosynthetic rates after leaf damage, instead of treating the chloroplast with acidic conditions after the grinding and buffering.
