Title: Limiting resources and their effects on Plants: How Light Affects Energy Allocation in Pisum Satium

Abstract:
This experiment’s main goals were to outline the effects of sunlight on phenotypic plasticity and relative root to shoot ratios. Placed in poor conditions, plants must allocate resources to survive: whether that be through growth or maintaining current conditions. We hypothesized that Pisum Satium placed in complexly dark conditions would have larger root to shoot ratios than those placed in a normal light condition. This is because they would have to allocate resources to growth to find available sunlight, and would have larger roots than shoots. We found that with regard to weight, our root to shoot ratios were not statistically significent, and our alternative hypothesis was rejected. Our Null hypothesis is accepted for weight root to shoot ratios. In regard to length, our root to shoot ratio were statistically significent and our alternative hypothesis was rejected (P=0.00). So, while weight root to shoot ratio is not affected by amount of sunlight, length root to shoot ratio is. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will be analyzing the ways in which sunlight affects energy allocation and how the Pisum Satium, or common field pea, distributes resources. The Pissum Satium is a great model organism for this study because of its ability to take in nutrients fast. [Andrews: 1999]. In order to take full advantage of all resources available, plants alter the distribution of their available nutrients-a process called phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2018]. Phenotypic plasticity allows growth patterns overtime to chance to accommodate environmental conditions. In this experiment, we tested how light as a limiting resource affected energy allocation and phenotypic plasticity by measuring root to shoot ratios. By calculating biomass and relative root to shoot ratios we can determine the way in which the Pissum Satium allocates energy in different light conditions. For the purpose of this experiment, we had two groups: one light and one dark. The light group was placed in a greenhouse with normal light conditions. The dark group was placed in a beta dark condition in a cabinet. Our independent variable is the amount of light, either light or dark, and our dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio growth because of the specific condition. My group predicts that the Pissum Satium in the light condition will have a smaller root to shoot ratio then that of the dark group because it does not need to allocate resources as readily to find sunlight. The dark group will have longer shoot in order to find sunlight, and have small roots to compensate for the energy provided for shoot growth. 

Materials and Method:
We began our experiment by taking four flower pot trays and putting in an appropriate amount of soil-leaving about an inch on the pot free of soil. We then designated and labeled two pots for the light and dark group. Using our fingers, we then poked holes three rows down and four across. Taking twelve Pissum Satium, we then filled each hole with a seed. We then poured about 100Ml of miracle grow to spur growth, and followed that with another 100Ml of water. Covering the holes back up with soil, we then placed two pots in the dark condition and two in the light condition. Retuning every day for the next two weeks, we watered each of the four plants with 100Ml of water. At the end of the two weeks, we then removed up to twelve Pissum Satium in each condition and washed and dried them. Separating their roots from their shoots, we cut right above the visible bean. Using a ruler and a scale, we calculated the length and weight of both the root and shoots to determine root to shoot ratio. In order to interpret the results of the root to shoot ratio of the two conditions, we ran a two-sample t_test. 

Results:
Shows the root to shoot ratio in regard to length and weight under the two conditions of light and dark.  The mean root to shoot ratio for weight in the light condition was 1.38 and our mean root to shoot ratio for length in the light condition was 0.511 (Fig 1 SD: 1.35 and 0.136). The mean root to shoot ratio for length in the dark condition was 0.723 and the mean root to shoot ratio for length was 0.176 (Fig 1. SD: 0.167 and 0.085) After running the two-sample t_test we found our root to shoot ratio for weight to be very variable (t value=1.68, d.f.=16, pvalue:0.112). The mean root to shoot ratio for weight was not significent. The root to shoot ratio for length was statistically significent (t vavlue=6.45, d.f.=16, Pvalue:0.00)

Discussion:
After conducting a two-sample t test, we found that the mean weight in the light group was not statistically significently different from that of the dark condition. This means that our alternative hypothesis was rejected in regard to the weight root to shoot ratio. Our p value was above 0.112 making the weight between the light and dark condition not significent, and our hypothesis unsupported with regard to weight in root to shoot ratio. We believe this is due to the fact that there was outlier Pisum Satium that contained a fused bean which contributed to the excess weight: making our average weight in the light condition off. With regards to the average length root to shoot ratio our alternative hypothesis was supported. With a p value lower that 0.00, length was statistically significently different within the light and dark condition. This separates our data from the rest saying that our experiment and data was not conducted by chance. While weight root to shoot ratio is not affected by amount of sunlight, length root to shoot ratio is, becuase our null hypotesis was accepted in weight root to shoot ratios. A separate study conducted by the university of Dundee found similarly that when certain macronutrients or sunlight were restricted, that root to shoot ratio increased in Pisum Satium [Johnson: 2018]. More studies could be conducted in the future on the restriction of light on Pisum Satium in order to learn more about phenotypic plasticity, or the best light conditions in which to grow certain types of plants in order to promote favored growth.
