Title: The Effect of Different Wavelengths of Light on the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Spinacia oleracea (spinach) is a plant that captures light energy through the process of photosynthesis to produce glucose. Photosynthesis requires NADP+ in order to capture electrons and generate the reducing power of NADPH, an electron carrier. Therefore DCIP, an electron acceptor, was utilized in assays to function as NAD+ and capture electrons and therefore measure photosynthetic activity. The photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts was tested under various light wavelengths: red, green, and blue. It was hypothesized that chloroplasts under the blue light would cause the greatest reduction in DCIP due its high energy compared to the other light wavelengths. Three samples of chloroplasts were placed under the three different light conditions for a 30-minute period and the samples’ absorbance were measured every 10 minutes. The hypothesis was rejected since chloroplasts under the green light had the highest mean of percent change in absorbance, 100.22%. The mean percent change in absorbance—due to reduction of DCIP—of chloroplasts under the blue light resembled that of the control group, 47.14% and 43.39%, respectively. The results could be a result of human error: the chloroplast samples under green light were always measured last, giving them more time to reduce the DCIP.

Introduction:
Plants, such as Spinacia oleracea (spinach), capture energy through the process of photosynthesis: the use of sunlight to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water. The green pigment chlorophyll of the chloroplast, which is on the surface of the leaves, is involved in the process by capturing the sunlight energy [Snowden: 2015]. There are three stages of photosynthesis. The light-dependent reactions are the first two stages [Snowden: 2015]. They absorb light photons to generate reduction power in the form of NADPH. These stages also create a proton gradient used to drive ATP formation [Snowden: 2015]. The third stage of photosynthesis is known are the light-independent reactions, which use the enzyme-complex RuBisCO and the reducing power of the NADPH from the first two stages to combine CO2 with the 5-carbon ribulose phosphate molecules [Snowden: 2015]. This creates glucose, the desired 6-carbon molecule product. 
	This procedure tests how different wavelengths of light—white fluorescent, red, green, and blue—affect the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts, since light energy is essential for photosynthesis [Muneer: 2014]. The wavelengths of the different light intensities increase in this order: blue, green, and red [Snowden: 2015]. Blue light is known to strongly influence a wide range of physiological plant processes such a stomata opening and leaf functions involved in photosynthesis; therefore blue light promotes photosynthetic activity of the plant [Muneer: 2014]. On the other hand, green light opposes stomata opening, which indirectly indicates that less photosynthesis occurs under green light conditions, since stomata open to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide [Muneer: 2014]. However, in another experiment, the stomatal response from the red light is independent of the photosynthetic activity; therefore, it was concluded that stomatal conductance in response to different light intensities is independent of photosynthesis [Baroli: 2008]. 
The photosynthetic activity of the spinach chloroplasts in this experiment is indirectly measured by measuring the reduction of NADP+, since the reducing power of NADPH is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. Therefore, the Hill reaction—the general process of electron transfer in active chloroplasts with light—is used. However, in a laboratory measuring NADP+ reduction is difficult, though the electron transport chains in chloroplasts will pass electrons to other electron acceptors. Therefore, this experiment utilizes DCIP as an electron acceptor. Oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound with an aromatic ring, though when reduced, DCIP is colorless with conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds. In essence, DCIP assays will be used to measure photosynthetic activity of the spinach chloroplasts. 
Based upon the previous findings and the Hill reaction, it was hypothesized that if the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea are placed under various wavelengths of light—white fluorescent, green, blue, and red—under a 30-minute period of time, then more photosynthesis—increased reduction of DCIP—will occur under the presence of blue light due to blue light’s high energy.

Materials and Methods:
Firstly, the chloroplasts were extracted from the spinach leaves through differential centrifugation. This means that twelve spinach leaves were ground up with a chilled mortar and pestle with the addition of 10 milliliters of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) in order to obtain a paste. The paste was strained then through cheesecloth. The remaining green liquid was placed in centrifuge tube “A” and spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity) with the use of a balance tube for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then poured into another centrifuge tube marked “B”, yet the debris at the bottom of the tube was not disturbed or transferred. Centrifuge tube “B” was then spun at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. This supernatant was transferred into centrifuge tube “C”, and once again the pellet of debris at the bottom of the tube was not disturbed or transferred. The chloroplasts in centrifuge tube “C” were used in the procedure since this sample contained the most concentrated number of chloroplasts; the process of centrifugation removed the debris of the rest of the spinach leaves. 
	The chloroplasts of sample “C” were then used to test the effect of light wavelengths on the reduction of DCIP. One blank tube was prepared for the spectrophotometer in addition to three tubes for each light wavelength (white fluorescent, red, green, blue). Therefore, each light wavelength had three trials. Eight milliliters of water were placed in the blank tube and six millimeters were placed the control tubes and each of the variable light tubes. Two milliliters of 130mM of DCIP were placed in all of the tubes, except for that of the blank. Lastly, two milliliters of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) were placed in all of the tubes, including the blank. 
Once all the tubes were prepared, 100 microliters of chloroplasts from sample “C” were placed in three tubes for the control and each of the three light variables (red, green, and blue): no chloroplasts were placed in the blank tube. The tubes were mixed immediately and transferred to cuvettes after the addition of chloroplasts and the spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm. All of the absorbances of the cuvettes were immediately measured: this absorbance measure was at time zero. Then, the samples were placed under their respectively labeled lamps with the corresponding light wavelength for 30 minutes. The absorbances of the sample were measured each 10 minutes during the 30-minute period.
A line graph of the percent change in absorbance of the samples in 10 minute intervals over the total 30-minute measurement and a two-sample t-test between the overall percent change in absorbance of control fluorescent light and of each of the various light wavelengths (red, blue, and green) were then used to analyze the data.

Results:
The Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts’ reduced the most DCIP under the condition of green light (Figure 1). Under the blue light, the chloroplast’s reduced the least amount of DCIP in comparison to red and green. However, the reduction of DCIP by the chloroplasts under the blue light was similar to that under the fluorescent control lighting. The percent change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval of the chloroplast samples of blue light and fluorescent light are 47.14% and 43.39%, respectively; they are not statistically significantly different (p-value = 0.911) (Table 1). The mean of total percent change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval of the chloroplasts under the green light was not statistically significantly different than that of the chloroplasts under the fluorescent control (p-value = 0.062) (Table 1).  In addition, the mean of total percent change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval of the chloroplasts under the red light was also not statistically significantly different than that of the chloroplasts under the fluorescent control (p-value = 0.133) (Table 1).  

Discussion:
The chloroplasts under the green light conditions for the 30-minute interval had the largest percent change in absorbance; green light conditions reduced the greatest amount of DCIP which indicates the most photosynthetic activity occurred under the green light conditions. Therefore, the hypothesis of the experiment is rejected. This is evident through the data collected since the mean of the percent change in absorbance of the chloroplast samples under the green light was the highest compared to the chloroplasts under the fluorescent light, red light, and blue light (Table 1). These results collected are not supported by a previous study that concluded that green light reverses the stomatal opening which the blue induces, since stomatal opening parallels the photosynthetic activity in the plants [Wang: 2011]. 
	In addition, the blue light reduced DCIP in a similar trend to the control fluorescent light (Figure 1). The similarity between the mean percent change in absorbance over the 30-minute interval of the chloroplasts under the blue light and that of the chloroplasts under the fluorescent light indicates that data supports the idea that blue light has no significant effect on the reduction of DCIP and therefore does not increase photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea (Table 1). 
	With respect to the reduction of DCIP by the chloroplasts in the red light conditions, the mean of the percent change in absorbance of the is not statistically different from that of the chloroplasts under the fluorescent control light (Table 1). However, the chloroplasts in the red light samples had an average of a 85.89% percent change in absorbance, therefore the data shows an increase in photosynthetic activity under red light. A previous study claims that red light drives photosynthesis due to it’s narrow spectrum of light wavelength, which is close to the maximum absorbance for the chlorophyll: the part of the chloroplast absorbing the light [Muneer: 2014]. Therefore, the wavelength of the red light may be the cause for the increase of photosynthetic activity in the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts under these conditions. 
	The error that may have caused the increase reduction of DCIP under the green light conditions is that the absorbance of the cuvette chloroplast samples under the green light conditions were consistently measured last each 10 minutes during the experiment. Therefore, these chloroplasts—compared to the chloroplasts under the blue light which we measured first each 10 minutes—had an increased amount of time in order to reduce more DCIP and appear more colorless. This is a procedural error that could not be avoided due to time constraints since access was not given to more than one spectrophotometer to measure absorbances. If this procedure were to be performed again, more than one spectrophotometer should be used in order to manage the timing of measuring the absorbance of the chloroplast samples under different light conditions more effectively. 
	The variable of different colored chloroplasts was going to be added to the experiment: the difference between photosynthetic activity of purple chloroplasts—purple kale—and of green chloroplasts—spinach—under the various light wavelengths was to be measured. However, due to the supply of not fully purple leaves, this variable was removed. In addition to utilizing more than one spectrophotometer to increase the validity of the results, the addition of this variable of different colored chloroplasts, if available, should be embedded in the procedure.
