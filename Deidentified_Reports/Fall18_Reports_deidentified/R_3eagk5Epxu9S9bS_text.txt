Title: Increased Growth Response of Physarum polycephalum in Low Wavelength Conditions

Abstract:
Signal transduction is dependent on the type of stimuli that the organism is presented with. The stimulus begins a cascade of molecular actions, often resulting in genomic changes. The effects of these pathways are easily seen in the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum. This mold has the capability to respond to chemical or light stimuli in processes called chemotaxis and phototaxis. It is known that Physarum can show partiality towards certain stimuli. Regarding phototaxis, Physarum gravitates towards different wavelengths of light. Although this type of mold prefers to grow in dark, humid environments, growth still continued under conditions of blue light (a wavelength at around 450 nm). In red light conditions (a wavelength at approximately 650 nm), the Physarum grew less than the blue light conditions, but still more than the white light (negative control) conditions. A general trend of increasing growth in lower wavelength is observed, although the data is not statistically significant. 

Introduction:
Signal transduction can be easily seen in the organism Physarum Polycephalum. This slime mold is used in studies of transduction because the pathways are very similar to the signal pathways in humans. Although Physarum does not have a nervous system, it has the capability to perform life supporting behaviors, such as migrating towards a food source or away from harmful chemicals [Alim: 2013]. The main behaviors that the Physarum exhibits are chemotaxis and phototaxis. Chemotaxis is the movement of the organism towards or away from a chemical [Ueda: 1976]. Phototaxis is movement towards or away from light. Physarum prefer to live in dark, humid environments, so it has a natural repulsion away from light sources [Hato: 1976]. The Physarum has the ability to recognize and respond to these stimuli because of their physiology and their ability to receive signals through transduction pathways.
When a stimulus reaches the Physarum, the second messenger system involving cAMP is activated [Block: 1999]. This pathway is very similar to the pathway humans use to transduce certain signals. This pathway is activated when a stimulus binds to the receptor. This leads to the alpha subunit on the G protein to release, causing adenylyl cyclase to be activated. Adenylyl cyclase then produces cAMP which binds to protein kinase A. Protein kinase A then causes changes within transcription later in the pathway [Thatcher: 2010]. Another similar signal transduction that the Physarum uses is the IP3 pathway. These signal transduction pathways are used in chemotaxis and phototaxis. The second messenger system signals to the mold to move in response to the stimulus. This movement is driven by pressure changes within their cytoplasm. The oscillations of fluid within the cytoplasm, as well as actin and myosin filament interactions, allow the mold to move [Alim: 2013; Hato: 1976].  
	The stimuli that cause chemotaxis and phototaxis vary greatly: the mold may move towards a certain stimulus but move away from a stimulus of the same nature. While Physarum avoids natural white light, lights of different wavelengths can cause different responses in the Physarum. According to research done by Hato and others, blue light caused a negative phototaxis response and red light caused a positive phototaxis response [1976]. 
	In this experiment, the phototaxis response of Physarum polycephalum will be examined. The effects of red (650 nm) and blue (450 nm) light will be tested. It is expected that, based on previous research, the red-light condition will lead to more Physarum growth, but the blue-light condition will inhibit the growth. 


Materials and Methods:
Twelve potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates were premade and a 1 cm by 1 cm square was drawn on the bottom of the plate. A cube of the agar (where the drawn square was) was cut out of each of the plates. These cubes were discarded. Twelve cubes containing Physarum growth were cut out of the stock plate. The cubes containing the mold replaced the gap in the blank PDA plates. All plates were taped shut and labeled. Three of the plates were completely covered in aluminum foil to act as the positive control. These plates were placed in a drawer in complete darkness. Three plates were left uncovered to act as the negative control. These plates were placed under a regular white light. Three more plates were covered in blue cellophane and placed under a lamp. The final three plates were covered in red cellophane and placed under the same lamp. The plates remained in these conditions for 24 hours and observations were made. The longest strand of mold was measured after 48 hours and recorded. A one-way ANOVA test was performed with an alpha of 0.05 to determine significance. 

Results:
The growth was the most significant in the positive control, complete darkness. The next highest growth level was at the blue light, then the red light, and finally the regular light without any color resulted in the least growth. A trend of increased wavelength resulting in decreased mold growth can be observed. The one-way ANOVA text proved the difference between any data set was insignificant. The P-value reported was 0.184. 

Discussion:
Although the data is insignificant, the trends in the data found is comparable to research found by Häder [1976, 1984]. As expected, shown in Figure 1, the darkness condition is most favorable to the Physarum, so that condition showed the longest strand on average, signifying it had the most growth. The light condition only showed growth in one of the three plates, but this condition still had the lowest average of growth. All three plates that were exposed to blue light grew, making this condition the most favorable for the Physarum besides darkness. Although the data does not support the original hypothesis, the data is similar to the data that Häder and Schreckenbach proved. They state that there are different receptors for different wavelengths. Since the blue light had more of a desirable effect than the red light, they suggest that the blue light receptor in the Physarum has more of an effect on signal transduction [Häder: 1984]. However, without further testing it is unclear whether the blue light caused more signal transduction, leading to an increase of growth, or whether the red light produced a condition where it inhibited signal transduction and mold growth. It is also unclear what the effect of the light was on phototaxis, since the entire plate was covered in the colored cellophane, and not just one piece that the mold could move towards. However, according to the research done by Häder, it is most likely that the blue light caused more of an increase in cytoplasmic streaming in comparison to the red light. This cytoplasmic streaming is what causes the mold to expand and migrate. 
Because there was some growth on the negative control plates, it suggests that an error had occurred, or a confounding variable was present. It is possible that there was food (a piece of oatmeal) on the cube cut out from the stock plate. Perhaps this food helped sustain the mold better in this plate more than the others, causing it to grow. 
For further studies, it would be best to include a larger range of wavelengths, including UV and IR wavelengths. This way a larger trend could have been seen. Also, it would be important for future studies to eliminate all confounding variables that may skew results. For example, pieces of food should be consistent in all plates or not present at all. The temperature and location of all plates should remain consistent for all treatment groups as well as for the entire testing period. It is likely the temperature may have changed within the 24-hour testing period, causing inconsistent growth patterns. 
It is important to understand pathways such as phototaxis in Physarum mold, to not only better understand the organism, but to better understand the pathways of signal transduction. Since signal transduction and second messengers like cAMP and IP3 are also used in humans, studying the pathways in slime mold can help to understand the signal transduction, specifically of the photoreceptors in this case, in humans. It is through experiments like these that modifications can be made, and the genetic outcomes and effect could be seen. Further research in alterations to signal transduction pathways could result in significant findings for human signal transduction pathways.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The average longest strand of "Physarum Polycephalum" in varying light conditions. The length of each plate's longest mold strand was measured after 24 hours of growth and averaged with the other two plates in its biological replicates. The error bars are representative of the one standard deviation specific to each of the treatment groups. One standard deviation defines the variation within each light condition. *************************************************************************
