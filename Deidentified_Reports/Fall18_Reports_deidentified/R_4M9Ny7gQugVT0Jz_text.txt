Title: The effect of Lidocaine and Pyrethrin on "Physarum polycephalem" chemotaxis

Abstract:
In this experiment we will be observing the slime mold "Physarum polycephalem" which exhibits positive chemotaxis toward glucose. However, we will be testing the effect that the sodium channel activator Pyrethrin and the inhibitor Lidocaine has on its movement. We hypothesize that in the Pyrethrin there will be positive chemotaxis but even more than that of the control and when in Lidocaine there will be less chemotaxis than the control. Due to our cultures shutting down growth we were not able to get any data and there was no movement in any environment and we were not able to do any statistical tests. A potential reason for this inhibition of growth could be the photoreceptor responsible for sporulation was not activated due to insufficient light exposure and another reason could be the inhibition of the protein kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of casein. Also it could be that the Physarum were stored at too high a temperature or were so undeveloped that they did not have actin to move yet.

Introduction:
"Physarum polycephalem" is a slime mold which is composed of multiple nuclei within one plasma membrane which means it acts as a single cell and conveniently can be observed without using a microscope [Johnson: 2018]. It is very simple to human cells due to our shared ancestry and even uses the same signal transduction pathway as humans [Johnson: 2019]. It crawls using actin microfilaments and has complex behaviors which alter its migration patterns. In addition, Physarum exhibits cytoplasmic streaming in which its cytoplasm flows bidirectionally but the direction changes frequently [Johnson: 2018]. It also exhibits phototaxis in which it migrates away from the light, typically, and chemotaxis in which it moves toward or way a molecule, depending on its identity [Johnson: 2018]. Furthermore, it exhibits the behavior of gravitaxis in which it moves relative to gravity [Johnson: 2018]. However, these behaviors may be altered due to presence of activators or inhibitors present in the culture/environment in which it is in [Johnson: 2018]. The activators produce signals that promote the behaviors mentioned before while the inhibitors produce signals that inhibit these behaviors even when stimulus is present [Johnson: 2018]. We are most interested in the chemotaxis that the Physarum exhibits in the presence of glucose under conditions of the compounds Lidocaine, activator, and Pyrethrin, inhibitor [Johnson: 2018]. Physarum itself moves through actin filaments activated by a sodium ion channel activated by the presence of activators or inactivators [Johnson: 2018].  From past studies we know that the Physarum, under normal conditions should exhibit a positive chemotaxis towards glucose [Johnson: 2018]. We will be seeing the effect that a sodium channel activator, pyrethrin, and inhibitor, lidocaine, have on this movement. We predict that when the Physarum is put in the agar plate with Lidocaine there will be positive chemotaxis but even more than the control and when put in the agar plate with Pyrethrin there will be less chemotaxis than the control. 

Materials and Methods:
The first thing we did was label three plates for control, three plates for treatment of lidocaine, and three plates for treatment of pyrethrin. In each plate we drew two boxes in the middle of the plates with a space between the blocks. To create the lidocaine solution we took 1 mL. of lidocaine and diluted it with 19 mL of water. To create the pyrethrin solution we diluted 1 mL of pyrethrin in 19 mL of water. Following this step, we cleaned a spatula with ethanol and cut two squares out of the agar plate where we previously drew the squares. We then rubbed four milliliters of lidocaine on the surface of the water agar plates on the three plates labeled lidocaine and four milliliters of pyrethrin on the three water agar plates labeled pyrethrin. After we removed blocks of Physarum and put them in the empty boxes we cut out before of all the plates. On these plates we placed eight oatmeal flakes equidistant from each other in a circle along the perimeter of the plate. Lastly, we taped the plates so the top doesn`t fall off and put them in a black plastic bag. We waited a day and tried to measure the distance they have traveled. Anova would have been used if we had data at the alpha value of 0.05.

Discussion:
We were unable to ascertain whether our hypothesis was supported or not as our Physarum did not experience any movement due to our cultures causing them to shut down growth. One potential reason for our cultures doing this is the tendency of Physarum polycephalum undergoing differentiation or sporulation only in response to light [Wormington: 1976]. The cultures were stored in a dark environment after our experiment which could have hindered the photoreceptor responsible for initiating sporulation and the reproductive pathway [Wormington: 1976]. Without the photoreceptor being activated the signal transduction pathway responsible for triggering growth will not be activated and therefore the Physarum will not differentiate [Wormington: 1976]. Another reason why growth may have been inhibited is the presence of an important protein kinase responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of the protein casein was inhibited by cAMP [Kuehn: 1971]. This condition would prevent the Physarum not being able to conduct intracellular signal transduction pathways such as the G-protein coupled pathway in which the cAMP is used as a second messenger and then progresses through the cAMP-mediated path [Kuehn: 1971]. In this pathway the cAMP activates the effectors which could be protein kinase A [Johnson: 2018]. This kinase then can act to phosphorylate different enzymes leading to activation or deactivation of them [Johnson: 2019]. In the case of the Physarum the protein kinase not being activated is the one being used to phosphorylate casein and activate it for use [Kuehn: 1971]. Casein is important in growth and without its amino acid content Physarum might not have been able to grow and therefore had to shut it down in order to conserve energy. Another reason for the lack of movement by Physarum is that the culture we were given was undergrown. This could mean that the Physarum did not have the adequate actin filament developed in order to move which means that no matter what activator presented. In our case it was the molecule of glucose which should have caused positive chemotaxis. However, there was nothing to move the organism or for the sodium ion channel signal transduction pathway to activate [Johnson: 2018]. Lastly another problem may have been the storage conditions. Physarum`s ideal growing temperature is 26 degrees but if grown in hotter moister conditions it will not grow or replicate as well or at all depending on the how hot it is kept at [Laffler: 1979]. In an experiment by Laffler, Physarum was grown at 31.5 degrees Celsius and then at 22 degrees Celsius. Then replication and growth of these two were compared. The replication was significantly lower in the Physarum put in higher temperature having an extent of replication of half than that of the Physarum placed in 22 degrees Celsius [Laffler: 1979]. A high temperature causes “both mitosis and chromosome replication to be blocked” as well as DNA replication to drop [Laffler: 1979]. A potential reason for this is that under high heat the shape of the Physarum nuclei changes so much that it is blocked from entering S-phase [Laffler: 1979]. Without being able to go through the cell cycle past G1 hinders growth and prevents replication which could also explain why our Physarum did not move.
