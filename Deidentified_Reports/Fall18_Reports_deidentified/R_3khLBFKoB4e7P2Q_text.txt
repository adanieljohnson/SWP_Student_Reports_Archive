Title: Effects of caffeine on the growth of Physasum polycephalum through cAMP regulated pathways

Abstract:
Caffeine is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effect of caffeine on the cAMP mediated pathway in Physarum polycephalum. The hypothesis was that the inability to breakdown cAMP would cause continuous stimulation of transcription factors leading to a continuous growth of the organism. This was tested through soaking water-agar plates in caffeine and comparing Physarum growth in these plates compared to non-caffeine treated agar plates. The trend observed was that the non-caffeine treated plates had a higher growth than the caffeine treated plates. The hypothesis was refuted however the data from the experiment was statistically insignificant therefore more testing needs to be conducted.    

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is an organism which occupies cool and shady areas. It is a mold which behaves as a single giant cell. Physarum extend their leading-edge using actin microfilaments. The organism engulfs organic material and transports hydrolytic enzymes to digest the food. [Oettmeier, 2017] Physarum constantly are in search of nutrients and achieve this through transduction pathways. Physarum respond to their environment many pathways. One of those pathways is the cAMP-medicated path. Organisms convert stimuli form the environment by converting the signal to an intracellular signal. The extracellular signal is known as the first messenger while the intracellular signal is called a second messenger. Once the Physraum receives a first messenger on its cell surface, it activates a G-coupled protein. [Yan:2016] This G-coupled protein activates Adenylate cyclase which converts ATP to cAMP. cAMP then binds to protein kinase A which can lead to responses such as transcription factors and protein synthesis along with the release of metabolic enzymes which digest any organic material encountered. cAMP signaling is broken down by phosphodiesterase which terminates responses. [Simonds: 1999] Caffeine is a chemical which is found in products such as coffee and tea. When caffeine is introduced into the cAMP pathway, phosphodiesterase activity is inhibited. If phosphodiesterase activity is inhibited, then the levels of cAMP in cells will increase. Therefore, the breakdown of cAMP is also inhibited and signaling continues. [Rollins:1998] Physarum was used as the model organism as it utilizes the cAMP signaling pathway. I hypothesize that with the introduction of caffeine the Physarum will continue to grow due to the inability of cAMP being broken down leading to a constant stimulus of cellular reproduction. 

Materials and Methods:
A 20x stock solution of caffeine was diluted 1x. 5 mL of diluted caffeine was poured over each of the three agar plates and allowed to soak for 10 minutes. Excess solution was poured off the plate after 10 minutes and kimwipe was used to blot the lip of the agar plate. Blocks of 1 cm by 1 cm were cut out of the 3 caffeine-soaked agar plates and 3 untreated agar plates. Blocks of 1 cm by 1 cm Physarum were transferred to the empty space on the plates. Once all the Physarum blocks were transferred, 5-6 grains of oatmeal were added around the agar dish. The sides of the plate were then taped and placed in a dark bag. The growth of the Physarum was then checked after 48 hours. A blank tailed t-test was conducted. 

Results:
The first trial showcased a growth in the Physarum treated with caffeine larger than growth in plates which were not treated. However, the remaining trials showcased a decrease in growth of the experimental group compared to the control. Based on the data collected, the trend observed between the two groups was that the experimental group had less growth than the control group. The control group had average growth of 2.73 cm while the experimental group had average growth of 2.63 cm. Since growth in the experimental group was not larger than the control, it can be concluded the caffeine did not inhibit the phosphodiesterase and therefore led to the breakdown of cAMP leading to the reduction of growth. The results from the trials were statistically insignificant as the p-value was above the alpha value. The results from the experiment did not support our hypothesis. The introduction of caffeine inhibited growth which did not support our previous findings. 

Discussion:
 The results from this lab were statistically insignificant therefore further testing is required. The results which should have been seen was a larger growth in the group which contained the caffeine treated plate. This would mean that the cAMP would have not been able to be broken down where for transcription factors would keep reproducing the Physarum causing it to grow larger. The variance in the data collected is due to a systemic problem within the cultures of Physarum which were provided. Normal growth was not observed in the cultures. Therefore, since the Physarum was not behaving normally, it is a possibility that the cAMP pathway, which was targeted, could also not have been behaving in its normal manner. Prior research conducted on cAMP signaling pathway and caffeine suggests that cAMP levels decrease. Research was conducted on an ameba and it was concluded that the caffeine inhibited adenylate cyclase. If this is the case, then our results of decrease would make sense since adenylate cyclase would not be able to convert ATP to cAMP. [Brenner: 1984] Therefore, there would be low levels of cAMP leading to less protein synthesis and cellular reproduction. However, a study conducted with Physarum concluded that there was an increase in surface area from the increased levels of cAMP. [Kukulies: 1983] Therefore, further testing should be conducted to come to a conclusion. The results from this experiment can be used to understand how caffeine affects human singling pathway. cAMP acts as a synaptic transmission and mediates neuronal gene expression. The cAMP acts as a pathway between the environment and what physiological response should conducted.
