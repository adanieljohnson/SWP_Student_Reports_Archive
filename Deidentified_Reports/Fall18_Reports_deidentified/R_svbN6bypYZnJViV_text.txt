Title: Manduca sexta changes in weight due to increased juvenile hormone

Abstract:
Hormones are a key factor that plays into maintaining homeostasis in animals. Each hormone must be regulated in order for an organism to remain in a normal state of function. Manduca caterpillars (Manduca sexta) use hormones for regulation and life cycle processes. This experiment looks at how the hormone JH (juvenile hormone) affects the growth of caterpillars, specifically, by looking at the effect on their weight. The expectation is that caterpillars that are exposed to increased levels of a JH mimic will have a significant change in weight in comparison to caterpillars exposed to normal JH levels. The weights in grams of two groups of caterpillars, one exposed to increased JH and one exposed to normal JH levels, were recorded over a twoweek period. Data showed that there was no significant difference between the change in weight of caterpillars exposed to higher JH levels in comparison to those who were not. However, observations showed that the life cycle was altered due to the pupation of the caterpillars exposed to normal JH levels, while those exposed to increased JH remained in the adolescent state. This suggests that JH could have an effect on development of the M. sexta that could be further studied.


Introduction:
This experiment assesses the regulation of growth hormones in insects. In order for the survival of an organism, it must maintain homeostasis. Animals are able to do this by the regulation of hormones. Each hormone must be distributed in specific amounts to allow for normal function in the body. The life cycle of the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) is regulated by the presence or absence of certain hormones that allow for functions such as growth and molting [Johnson: 2018]. When they are properly regulated, the caterpillar goes through five instar stages of growth before pupation, where it will develop into a moth [Reinecke: 1980]. Failure to maintain normal levels of hormones can cause changes in development. Juvenile hormone (JH) is used to aid in the control of growth in caterpillars.  As a caterpillar molts, and grows through its five instar phases, JH levels decrease, and then cease during pupation and adulthood [Vince: 1977]. Because of this, the presence of JH allows caterpillars to remain in their adolescent state. JH mimic refers to a hormone that acts on insects in the same way that JH would [Brown: 1974]. This experiment treats Manduca caterpillars with an increased amount of JH mimic to see how it will affect the growth of caterpillars, measured in weight. Because of this, it can be hypothesized that due to the role that JH plays in the life cycle, Manduca caterpillars that are treated with increased amounts of JH mimic will have a significant effect on their growth and development.


Materials and Methods:
Manduca caterpillars were placed in containers and split into two groups (a control group and an experimental group), with four caterpillars in each group. Each caterpillar was given food inside of their container. In the experimental group, a pipette was used to add 12 drops of JH mimic to each of the caterpillar’s food. In order to regulate the texture of the caterpillar food between the control and experimental groups, 12 drops of water were added to the food of the caterpillars in the control. Every day, the weight of each caterpillar was recorded in grams in order to observe the growth changes due to the presence of increased levels of JH mimic. Weights and additional observations were recorded for two weeks (with a three day gap during the second week) to look at changes in caterpillars. After two weeks, the differences in weights from the first and last day were calculated. A statistical analysis: a two-tailed two-sample T-test was used to determine if the results were significant enough to conclude that the presence of JH mimic has an effect on growth through weight of the Manduca caterpillars.


Results:
Figure 1 displays the mean difference in weights was higher in the JH mimic experimental group than the control group. Error bars showed that there was a large amount of uncertainty in these numbers. Observations showed that the caterpillars in the control group became pupates, while the caterpillars in the experimental group remained in the fifth instar. The p-value is 0.390, which is greater than 0.05 and means that the results are not significant. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis, that an increase in JH mimic would cause a difference in weights among the caterpillars, was not supported. The T-test showed that the results were not significant, therefore this experiment concludes that JH does not affect the weight of caterpillars. However, this could be due to the large uncertainty caused by a caterpillar in the experimental group that died during the third day. Its weight was still recorded every day and was taken into account in statistical analysis. When this caterpillar was removed from the statistical analysis, the p-value became lower, but was still not significant enough to support the hypothesis. Observations during the experiment showed that there was an effect on the life cycle of the caterpillars since the JH experimental group remained in the adolescent state while the control group began pupation. Previous experiments that have looked at the effects of juvenile hormone and other insect growth regulators focus on changes in the development and life cycles [Staal: 1975]. Rather than measuring changes in weight, it would be more beneficial to look at differences in development, such as time of pupation, when studying changes in JH levels.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The average difference in weight between the first and last day of the experiment in the control group was 0.293 grams. In the experimental group, the average difference was 1.53 grams. Error bars show the range of uncertainty of the means.  Table 1. This shows the calculated t-value, p-values, and degrees of freedom. For the relevance of this experiment, the Two-tailed p-value is most relevant to the results. Since its value is greater than 0.05, the results are not significant.*************************************************************************
