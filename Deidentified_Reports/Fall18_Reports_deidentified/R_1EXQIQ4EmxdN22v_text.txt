Title: The Difference in Strength of Muscle Response Caused by Tubocurarine in Frog Legs

Abstract:
In this experiment, frog legs were dissected and tested to examine how introduction of a neurotransmitter receptor antagonist impacts the strength of contraction response. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists (NARA’s) are substances that block the binding site of acetylcholine at its receptors, preventing muscle contraction. Three frog legs were treated as both the controll group and experimental group in a paired experiment, receiving stimulation without treatment at first and then examining the muscle response to the response of the muscle following injection of tubocurarine. After examining the responses of muscle contraction at various stimulations, we found that the experimental group that received tubocurarine had an average contraction response of 0.186V, which was less than the controll group’s average contraction response of 0.368V. This supports our alternative hypothesis that NARA’s decrease the amplitude of muscle contraction, and the data suggests that this experiment was statistically significent. For further experiments, it may be interesting to test whether the size of a frog’s leg has an impact on how effective a NARA like tubocurarine is and how dramatic the differences are with and without treatment in a similar paired experiment.  

Introduction:
For many organisms, the neuromuscular system provides processes that allow them to respond and adapt to their environment for optimal survival. Unlike hormones that travel slowly through the circulatory system, neurons send electrical signals called action potentials that propagate down axons to cause extremely fast responses [Johnson: 2018]. These action potentials release neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine [ACh]) within the neuromuscular junction which bind to muscle receptors, causing them to have excitatory or inhibitory behaviors such as contraction or relaxation of the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. When ACh binds to the muscle receptors, sodium channels open, depolarizing the cell and creating an action potential that releases calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium release is correlated to contraction of the muscle, while reuptake of calcium leads to relaxation of the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we will be looking at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (NARA) activity on muscle contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of frog legs. Tubocurarine is a type of antagonist that fights for the binding of acetylcholine, therefore blocking acetylcholine from producing effects on the muscle [Bowman: 2006]. This explains tubocurarine use as a method of anesthesia and temporary paralytic, as it prevents the muscles from receiving input from stimuli. It is also considered a muscle relaxant, as preventing muscles from releasing calcium which causes contraction [Bowman: 2006]. Our alternative hypothesis is that injection of tubocurarine directly within the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog will cause less direct muscle contraction than normal at various amplitude stimulations. This experiment will help one understand how receptor antagonists can be used to affect binding at the neuromuscular junction and alter muscle response.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, three frog legs were dissected in order to expose the gastrocnemus muscle. Each frog leg acted as the controll group, receiving normal stimulation from the transducer and no additional treatment. Stimulation was received at different amplitudes (in volts) of 0.0V, 0.1-0.5V, and 1.0-5.0V. The response amplitudes were recorded on LabScribe and data was recorded by students of the force of muscle contraction following stimulation. After a few minutes of allowing the legs to rest, the same three frog legs acted as the treatment group and received the same increments of stimulation. However, stimulation wasn’t received until about five minutes after 0.1Ml of tubocurarine was injected in the gastrocnemus muscle by a syringe. Again, LabScribe recorded the amplitude of the response and students wrote these numbers for future data analysis. The frog legs were in identical environmental conditions, and the controll group received the same increments of stimulation as the treatment groups. A paired t_test was conducted to compare the difference between the two groups, testing the null hypothesis that introduction of tubocurarine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, does not affect the amount of muscle contraction in frogs.

Results:
The data of the controll and treatment groups were combined in conducting the paired t_test, and the average difference between the controll and treatment group was 0.1698V. The average response of the frog legs without treatment was 0.368V, and the average response of the frog legs following treatment with tubocurarine was 0.186V. The mean response of the groups before receiving treatment was significently greater than the mean of the treatment group receiving tubocurarine (t_stat = 6.912, d.f. = 33, p = 3.99×10-8). This p_value, if given an alpha level of p&lt;0.05, represents the data as statistically significent. Table 1 shows that the response difference is greater at higher voltages than lower voltages. Leg pair three in Figure 1 appears to have a much different line than legs one and two.

Discussion:
When looking at the results from the graph and data table presented above, it appears that the frog legs produced a significently different response on average when treated with tubocurarine compared to when the legs received stimulation without any form of treatment. The table is reporting the differences with the treatment group response being subtracted from the controll group response, so the positive values indicate that the controll group had a higher response throughout the entire experiment except for two responses in the third pair. One study explained how tubocurarine in frog muscle was found to cause negligible effects at first, but after some time, the differences between responses of frog legs with and without tubocurarine became more distinguished [Magleby: 1981]. This may explain the two negative values during the early stages of muscle contraction may be explained by the possibility that the tubocurarine didn’t kick in until later in the treatment even after waiting five minutes before starting stimulation. The differences in response for each pair appear to somewhat level off towards the end of the experiment with heavier stimulations, which may suggest that the muscle is getting tired. One study suggests that tubocurarine does indeed impact the spike amplitude at heavier doses following a period after injection [Cooke: 1964]. This, along with our experiment, further supports our alternative hypothesis that injection of tubocurarine directly within the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog will cause less direct muscle contraction than normal at various amplitude stimulations. 
For future experiments, it may be useful to test whether the size of the frog leg has a significent impact on tubocurarine effects. If possible, it may be preferable to do a paired test using multiple frog legs, with each pair consisting of a certain size or weight and then establishing either a particular dose or a couple different dosages. This experiment is successful at allowing students to understand how agonist and antagonist substances produce effects on the neuromuscular system, and it provides students the opportunity to explore multiple different ways to experiment with the neuromuscular system.
