Title: The effects of red light on the weight and length root:shoot ratios in Buck Wheat plants

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if red light has an effect on the weight and length root:shoot ratios in buck wheat plants. The hypothesis is that the red light plants will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the plants under normal sunlight conditions. In order to determine this, we will test a controll group in normal sunlight and a treatment group under red light conditions with the same soil and the same amount of water for two weeks. After measuring and recording the weights and lengths of the roots and shoots in 12 treatments and controll group plants, the root:shoot ratios were calculated. From these results, statistical tests determined that there was no statistical significance (p_values = 0.483 and 0.963) to support our hypothesis. As a result, we were able to conclude that the root:shoot ratio for the red light plants are not higher than the controll group plants. 


Introduction:
Plants live in environments that force them to adapt in order to enhance their chance of survival. Within these environments are both biotic and abiotic factors that pose challenges for the plants. These factors include coexisting plant species, sunlight, and temperature; how the plants respond to these external influences depends on how well they are able to thrive [Johnson: 2018]. Specifically, plants have to deal with sunlight availability and varying lighting. The resources that plants gather have to be allocated within the three main areas of the plant: the leaves, shoots, and roots. In environments with an abundance of light, resources are allocated to the leaves, as they are the main site of photosynthesis [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we will be testing the growth of buck wheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants in normal sunlit lighting versus the same plants that are only exposed to red light. The hypothesis is that the red light plants will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the plants under normal sunlight conditions. The red light will inhibit the plants’ shoot growth because it is not naturally occurring, and as a result will have its resources allocated to the roots. 


Materials and Method:
In order to perform this experiment, we had to get four containers: two for controll and two for treatment. Each container was filled with the same soil and holes had to be made in each container to plant the buck wheat seeds. Then, 200 Ml of miracle grow solution was added to each of the four containers followed by enough water to make the soil wet in each container. After labeling the containers, the plants had to be moved to the greenhouse with the controll group in normal sunlight and the treatment group under the red-light tent. For the next two weeks, the plants had to be watered equal amounts every day. After two weeks, the root and shoot weights and lengths for twelve controll and treatment plants had to be measured and then the root:shoot ratios could be calculated. A t_test then had to be used to test for statistical significance.


Results:
The mean root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were not significently different from one another (weight: t_test = 0.714, d.f. = 22, p = 0.483; length: t_test = 0.0467, d.f. = 22, p = 0.963). For example, the mean weight root:shoot ratio for the controll group was 0.383  0.282 and for the treatment group it was 0.318 0.144. This emphasizes that between the controll and treatment groups, there was not much variation in the root:shoot ratios. The data showed that the plants in the controll group that were exposed to normal lighting (sunlight) had much greater lengths and weights than those in the treatment group. However, out mean ratios were very similar in regard to weight as discussed in the beginning of the results section (mean controll 0.383, mean treatment = 0.318) and length (mean controll = 0.576, mean treatment = 0.579). 


Discussion:
The main observation was that our mean root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were not significently different from one another. Our t_tests revealed p_values (p = 0.483 and p = 0.963) that indicate that our results do not have statistical significance. From this we can see that our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Therefore, this suggests that the root:shoot ratio for the red light plants was not greater than the ratios from the controll group. Additionally, it is important to note that the controll group did appear to grow better than the treatment groups as their lengths and weights were almost all higher; however, their root:shoot ratios are very similar. Also, due to the hurricane, we had been unable to water for two days. That did not outwardly appear to effect the plants. Regardless of the results, it is important to mention that the red light tent appears to have helped those plants retain water, as the soil was always extremely moist everyday before watering. This could be something to explore in the future to see if it makes a significent impact on growth. After researching what the effects of red light are on plants, it was interesting to find that in an article by Erik Runkle, red light actually enhances a plant’s ability for photosynthesis because the red light is very well absorbed and the red light is effective with converting electricity into photosynthetic photons [Runkle: 2016]. This research suggests that the presence of red-light may result in a lower root shoot ratio because if photosynthesis is promoted by red-light, then the resources will most likely be allocated to the leaves. As a result, the shoot may grow more to extend the leaves closer to the light to absorb more.
