Title: Negative Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibitor Azaguard on Growth Rates of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca Sexta caterpillar is a common pest known for its defoliation abilities on valuable crops. Because of its ability to be reared in a lab, it has been subject to many experimental investigations regarding the endocrine system of insects. The hormone ecdysteroid, or E20, is perceived to be involved in the development of the Manduca Sexta with roles centered around molting during maturation of a larvae. In this experiment, the effects of the inhibition of this hormone was tested on Manduca Sexta Larvae by addition of the chemical azaguard into the food. It was hypothesized that a decrease in available E20 will cause the inability for growth in the Manduca Sexta caterpillars. It was concluded that the repression of this hormone leads to the incapacity for the Manduca Sexta to molt, which causes a slow decline in the weight and rate of consumption of food of the insect and eventually prompts an inability to pupate into an adult moth. With this information, the development of an insecticide that inhibits this hormone is possible, which will significently decrease defoliation caused by the Manduca Sexta.
  


Introduction:
The Manduca Sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a common pest of plants in the family Solanacae, which includes tobacco, eggplant, pepper, and several other less valuable
weeds. After pupation, the Maduca Sexta molts into a fully-grown adult moth, commonly known as the hawkmoth [Byron: 2017].  During developmental stages, the Manduca Sexta larvae has been acknowledged in the agricultural sect as a pest because of its ability to cause significent defoliation of many economically valuable crops. In addition to its notability in the agriculture business, it is also an important model organism for the study of insect hormones, specifically in the developmental period. The hormones that are involved in Manduca Sexta maturation are also apparent in the growth and development process of many other insects. Actions and interactions of the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysone (20E), and the juvenile hormone (JH) in controllling the molting and metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta have been the subject of numerous experimental investigations regarding insect physiology [Warren: 1998]. Briefly, the endocrine tract of the Manduca Sexta consists of the brain, the corpus cardiacum, the corpus allatum, and the prothoracic gland [Sadava:2017]. The focal point of this experiment is the prothoracic gland because of its controll over the release of ecdysone. Ecdysone is particularly known for its activity during development, particularly its regulation of the timing of molting between each instar [AD Johnson: 2016]. The hormone is released by the prothoracic glands in response to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH). Ecdysteroid is then hydroxylated into 20-hydroxyecdysone, which elicits a molt [Bollenbacher: 1987].  The focus of this experiment is on the role and regulation of the hormone ecdysterone in the holometabolous life cycle of the Manduca Sexta, with a specific concentration of the effects brought about by the restriction of this hormone on the developmental process. By understanding the roles of this hormone on the life cycle of this insect, it would be possible to create a pesticide that limits the ability of growth during larval stages, which would reduce necessity for nutrition, thereby reducing its effects on economic crops. It is hypothesized that the severe reduction of the hormone ecdysterone in the Manduca Sexta will stunt the growth of the insect, specifically because of the hormone’s role and interaction with timing of molting between each instar, leading to their inability to grow large enough and store the proper nutrients necessary to initiate pupation. 


Materials and Method:
In order to complete this experiment and determine the effects of an E20 inhibitor on growth of the Manduca Sexta, we obtained a total of eight Manduca Sexta larvae and separated them into two groups, one designated as the controll group and the other designated as the experimental group. The ecdysteriod inhibitor utilized was a chemical called azaguard. Two separate containers, each with four separate compartments, were labeled as controll or experimental and each compartment was labeled with a number and punctured on the side to allow air circulation. Each controll compartment was supplied with ten grams of Manduca Sexta food with an additional ten drops of distilled water (to match the consistency of the experimental food). Each compartment in the experimental container was also filled with ten grams of Manduca Sexta food, but an addition of ten drops of azaguard was also incorporated. The caterpillars were chosen, weighed, and placed in each compartment. No judgement about which caterpillar should be placed in which group was made. In other words, random assignment was used in order to sustain an unbiased representation of data. Both groups were ensured to be fed at the same time and kept in an incubator. Identical conditions were maintained other than the contents of the food. The weights (in grams) and measurements (in centimeters) of each caterpillar were taken daily for a span of two weeks in order to track the growth of each insect. In addition, observations about appearance and general temperament were noted. The average growth of each group was used to determine the difference between the developmental processes of the controll group and the experimental group. This data was graphed in line format to visualize the growth of each group over the fourteen-day period and decipher major differences. The average growth between a specific period of time was also plotted on a bar graph. Lastly, we conducted a two-tailed t_test to determine whether the data at two different time points was significent.

Results:
It was observed that by day seven of the experiment, the controll group pupated, and the experimental group did not. Upon inspection of the data, we observed that both groups rose in weight between day one and day two (refer to figure 1). However, the controll group gained much more weight than the experimental group up until pupation (see figure 2). The mean growth of the controll group was significently larger than that of the experimental group (t_stat of controll = 7.456, P = 0.0499; t_stat of experimental = 1.971, P = 0.143).  There was a drastic drop in average weight of the controll group between day four and day five, which was right before pupation began. In Figure one, the controlls experienced a large spike in growth between days one and five and the experimental group showed a small rise on day one, but in the following days up until day fourteen, they slowly declined in weight until they were under their starting weight. We observed that the experimental caterpillars stopped eating their food after around day five and six (figure 3 depicts the caterpillars on day seven). Two of our experimental caterpillars died on day thirteen (figure 4 shows caterpillars on day fourteen).

Discussion:
The fact that the controll group pupated and the experimental group did not supports our hypothesis that the inhibition of 20E would stunt the growth of the caterpillar, rendering it unable to pupate. In addition, Figure 1, which depicts the change in average weights over the fourteen-day period, shows that the controll group grew large enough to pupate whereas the experimental group did not. Figure 1 explains this phenomenon because of the pattern that the experimental weights follow. The burst in growth between days one through five shows the caterpillars gaining the necessary weight to pupate and the major loss in weight around day six demonstrates their preparing to pupate. Small amounts of water can be seen on the bottom of the containers after this drastic loss in weight, meaning the caterpillars lost a large amount of water weight, which we believe is necessary for pupation. The experimental group also declined in weight over time, but there was a different cause. The purpose of ecdysteroid is to regulate the timing of a molt in the Manduca Sexta. Therefore, if this hormone is severely inhibited in the Manduca Sexta, the timing of molts between instars will be significently altered to the point where the process is ineffective. Figure one supports this statement because the spike in the beginning shows growth before the molt into the next instar, however after day two, the experimental caterpillars could not molt because of the lack of 20E in their systems. This is why their weights gradually declined and they stopped consuming their food. They could not molt when necessary and therefore could not grow any larger, thus leading to their inability to pupate and eventually their death. Figure 2, which shows the average weight gained by each group between days one and four, also supports the evidence given above because it shows that the experimental group was unable to gain the same amount of weight as the controll group. In addition, the t_test highlighted specific differences in the mean growth between each group over a span of four days in that the average weight gain of the controll caterpillars was much larger than the average weight gain of the experimental caterpillars. This is not because they were not eating, because as previously mentioned, they only stopped eating around day six. They were unable to gain that amount of weight because they could not properly regulate the molting process due to the inhibition of ecdysteroid. This conclusion is supported and accepted because it is known that ecdysteroid regulates the timing of molting between each instar [AD Johnson: 2016]. With the conclusion that the Manduca Sexta cannot properly grow and pupate when the hormone ecdysteroid is inhibited, further research can be done to develop a pesticide, not only for this specific insect, but also for others that produce the same hormone during development. Since it caused a decline in the consumption of food by the Manduca Sexta, this inhibitor is successful in decreasing the rates of defoliation caused by the insect.
