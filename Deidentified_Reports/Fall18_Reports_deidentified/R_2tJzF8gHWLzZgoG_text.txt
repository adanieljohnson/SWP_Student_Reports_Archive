Title: The Effects of Neomyacin and A23187 on Physarum Polycephalum IP3 Mediated Signaling Pathway and Chemotaxis

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum responds to external stimulus through many second messenger mediated signal transduction pathways. One key behavior of Physarum is chemotaxis, a negative or positive migration in response to external chemicals. To study chemotaxis behavior in Physarum, we introduced a Phospholipase C activator and inhibitor to induce or inhibit the IP3 mediated signal transduction pathway responsible for the organism’s migration. This was done with the primary goal of gaining a deeper understanding of cell chemotaxis in response to harmful chemicals. We expected that the Physarum would experience positive chemotaxis toward the Phospholipase C activator and negative chemotaxis away from the Phospholipase C inhibitor. We recorded inconclusive results due to improper culturing of the Physarum, which caused the cultures to shut down and experience no growth. 


Introduction:
Organisms survival is dependent on its ability to respond to external stimulus around them through a variety of cellular responses. Most multicellular organisms respond using hormones or a nervous system, but simpler multicellular organisms use signal transduction pathways that are mediated by molecular and ionic second messengers, like those seen in human cells. (Johnson: 2016). In this process, external stimulus activates a sensory receptor, which through a series of conformational changes and molecular interactions causes the production or release of second messengers. Three common second messengers include cAMP, calcium ions, and IP3. These second messengers mediate different signal transduction pathways by amplifying the signal and causing cellular responses, such as opening calcium ion channels and allowing for a voltage membrane potential that gives actin microfilaments the ability to move the organism away from or toward a stimulus. Movement toward or away from an external stimulus of a chemical is knows as chemotaxis. (Johnson: 2016).  

Signal transduction pathways are present in many cellular responses crucial to life within animals, such as response to cold, heat, fever, and pain. By studying a simple model organism, we can grasp a better understanding of signal transduction pathways, specifically how cells react when faced with potentially harmful chemicals. Understanding this response could be relevant to understanding how human cells migrate when chemicals are introduced into the body, such as during cancer treatment when chemicals are injected as a way to destroy cancer cells. Understanding cell chemotaxis, which includes the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells, can help scientists predict how healthy and cancerous cells will react to the introduction of cancer drugs inside the body. (Roussos: 2011). Due to this, we are investigating the chemotaxis behavior of Physarum Polycephalum in response to an IP3 activator and inhibitor. Physarum is a multicellular organism that uses signal transduction pathways as a cellular response to external stimulus including using its actin microfilaments to move the organism toward or away from external chemicals present, similar to the cytoskeletal function of actin in animal cells. Because of this, Physarum makes a reliable model organism as a simple multicellular organism without a hormonal or nervous system. 

To observe the chemotaxis behavior of Physarum, we will be introducing Phospholipase C activator A23187 and inhibitor Neomyacin. Phospholipase C is an effector enzyme that cleaves a membrane phospholipid to produce second messengers diacyglycerol and IP3. IP3 then binds to a receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is an organelle that stores calcium ions. Calcium ions are released from the endoplasmic reticulum and bind to many calcium regulated proteins to activate or inhibit them. (Johnson: 2016). The interaction between IP3 and calcium ions are important factors in the enabling of membrane potential for the contraction and extension of actin microfilaments, which allows the organism to travel and migrate. (Valeyev: 2009).  

We hypothesized that the Physarum would undergo positive chemotaxis toward the Phospholipase C activator and a negative chemotaxis away from the Phospholipase C inhibitor. This is because when Physarum is kept in dark, humid conditions, it remains a multicellular plasmodium that grows to actively search for food. (Johnson: 2016). Through pinocytosis, the intake of small amounts of extracellular fluid during endocytosis while searching for food, the Physarum is able to sense its surroundings and respond to the chemicals present through chemotaxis. Since the Phospholipase C inhibitor would be a harmful chemical to the IP3 pathway and inhibit the opening of calcium channels that allow for migration, the Physarum will not grow toward the chemical. The Phospholipase C activator would stimulate the IP3 pathway and calcium release, and the organism will grow toward the Phospholipase C activator as taxis is stimulated. The Physarum will be kept in a dark, humid environment and the chemical introduced into their environment will be the independent variables while the dependent variable is measured Physarum chemotaxis. 


Materials and Method:
In order to determine the chemotaxis behavior of Physarum in response to IP3 mediated pathways activator and inhibitor, we first obtained 6 2% water agar plates and drew 3 1 cm x 1 cm squares on the back of each plate with a sharpie. We also labeled the plates #1-6 and assigned 3 plates to be tested with A23187 and 3 plates to be tested with Neomyacin. We sterilized a metal spatula with ethanol then cut out all of the 1 cm squares from each plate. We used sterilized forceps to remove two of the cut agar squares from each plate and kept one cut square in the plate, which serves as the experimental blank. We then made the A23187 and Neomyacin chemical plates by diluting the 20x solutions to 1x solutions by combining 0.5 Ml 20x of the chemical with 9.5 Ml water. The diluted chemicals were poured onto two separate agar plates and allowed to sit for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the excess chemicals were poured from the agar plates and dabbed gently as needed to remove the excess liquid from the plates. To prepare the treatment plates, we used a sterilized spatula and forceps to cut 6 1 cm squares out of the Physarum plates and place the Physarum cubes into the empty middle box on the treatment plates. The leftover empty box on the treatment plates were filled with 1 cm squares of the respective chemical treatments, which were cut and placed with a sterilized spatula and forceps. The lids of the treatment plates were the taped shut and each plate was wrapped tightly with tin foil and labeled. All 6 plates were put into a black plastic bag and closed into a dark drawer for 23 hours before recording data. We recorded any distance moved by the Physarum in centimeters and the direction of the movement. The intended statistical test to compare distances traveled of the Physarum was a two sample t_test to compare the distances traveled by plates treated with A23187 and Neomyacin. 


Results:
Positive Chemotaxis was seen in only one plate given phospholipase C activator A23187 with a taxis rate of 0.0348. This result is what we expected for plates given A23187, however it was the only plate that experienced any Physarum growth. Because of this, our results are inconclusive. The expected results were to see similar positive taxis of plates give A23187 and negative taxis in the plates given Neomyacin. No plates given Neomyacin experienced any growth. Ideal expected chemotaxis rates are shown in Figure #1.


Discussion:
We recorded insignificent and inconclusive data which showed only one plate with Physarum growth, so no statistical tests for significance were run on the data. Many lab groups who used the same Physarum culture to run many different experiments experienced the same inconclusive results and lack of Physarum growth regardless of conditions the experiments were run under. There are many reasons why the Physarum cultures could have shut down normal growth and therefor been invalid cultures to use for the experiment. An important characteristic of Physarum is that, if humidity drops or food becomes unavailable, the plasmodium enters a stage called a sclerotium, its hibernation state, where it hardens and does not grow. (Johnson: 2016). The sclerotium is a thick-walled, yellow mass that contains a rare polysaccharide. It is formed in response to environmental conditions and only germinates a vegetative plasmodium under favorable conditions. (Singleton: 2006). For this reason, quality controll during the culturing process it vital. This includes making sure there is no cross contamination with any fungi or bacteria, which can cause a failure of the Physarum to sporulate. As well, Physarum loses spore viability within a few weeks after sporulation, so if too much time has passed after sporulation, Physarum cultures shut down or die. (Haskins: 2008). In the future, this can be avoided through a proper and cautious culturing process that avoids the introduction of fungi or bacterial contamination and ensures that only a small amount of time passes between sporulation and experimental use.
