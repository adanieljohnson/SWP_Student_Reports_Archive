Title: The effects of herbivory on the resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
I studied the effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum). I conducted this study by simulating herbivory by cutting the leaves of the plants in our experimental group. After a 14-day experimental period, I measured the root and shoot lengths and masses of our buckwheat plants. Our statistics showed that the difference between the control and experimental groups were not significant. I conclude that herbivory does not significantly affect resource allocation in buckwheat plants.

Introduction:
I will be studying buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum). Buckwheat is a domesticated food plant commonly grown in Asia and was introduced into the New World by European settlers in the 17th century [Treadwell:2008][Huang: 2008]. In this experiment, I am trying to understand the effects of herbivory. Herbivory is the eating of living plants by insects. I know that herbivory reduces plant fitness [Harvell:1999][Tollrian: 1999]. Herbivory also has meaningful impacts on abundance, distribution, and dynamics of plant population [Maron:2006][Crone:2006]. I am specifically trying to see if herbivory affects the root to shoot ratio of our buckwheat plants. The effects on the root to shoot ratio are important because it shows how the plant is allocating its resources. I am studying this because insects are common in almost every environment that plants are grown around the world. It is important for us as biologists to understand the effects that the insects have on these plants, and how the plants respond. I hypothesize that if herbivory acts on the leaves, it will cause the plant to have a smaller root to shoot ratio.


Materials and Methods:
I planted 32 total buckwheat plants in 8 different pots 4 plants in each pot. Half (16) of these plants served as the experimental group and the other half served as the control group. In the experimental group, I simulated herbivory by cutting a small hole in one leaf per plant per day. The control group was not cut and both groups received the same amount of daily water. After an experimental period of 14 days, I uprooted the plants. I then cut the plants at the area where the root becomes the shoot and separated the two. I measured the mass all 32 roots and all 32 shoots using a scale and I measured the length in centimeters using a ruler. I used these data points to calculate mean root:shoot ratios for mass and length in the control and experimental groups, as well as the standard deviation for each measurement. I measured the significance of our results by comparing the means using a two sample one-tailed T test.


Results:
Figure 1 shows the difference between our mean root to shoot ratio for mass in our experimental (0.2797 ± 0.1713) and our control (0.2627 ± 0.0587) groups. The experimental group was more variable than the control group, but the means were very similar.  (t-stat = 0.377, df = 30, P = 035)  Figure 2 shows the difference between our mean root to shoot length ratio in our experimental (0.8331 ± 0.2594) and control (0.9690 ± 0.2712) groups. Both groups had small variability.  (t-stat = 0.1.45, df = 30, P = 0.08)

Discussion:
My hypothesis that if herbivory acts on the leaves, the buckwheat plants will allocate more resources to the leaves, causing a smaller root to shoot ratio is rejected. Our hypothesis is rejected because our results show that there is no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in root to shoot mass ratio and root to shoot length ratio. There are a few reasons that herbivory would not affect the root to shoot ratio in a significant fashion. One explanation is that herbivory affects the overall size of the plant but not the root to shoot ratios, as seen in Clay et. al [1993]. Another feasible explanation is that the buckwheat plants did allocate more resources to the leaves but not enough to show a significant difference considering I was stunting the growth of the shoot by cutting the leaves. If I were to do this experiment again, I would lengthen the experimental period to longer than two weeks and give herbivory more time to act, as well as measuring the effect on the total mass of the plants instead of the root to shoot ratios.  I think my biological thinking was logical in forming our hypothesis based on Meiden et al.: “Plants that are frequently consumed have low shoot/ root ratios and a well-developed regrowth mechanism, whereas plants that are rarely consumed have high shoot/root ratios and a poor regrowth mechanism” [1998]. Meiden et al’s model organism was not buckwheat, however. I find another example that supports our hypothesis and the need to lengthen the experimental period: “Trees experiencing folivory over four consecutive years maintained similar levels of foliar biomass after attack yet possessed twice the number of leaf-bearing terminal stems as undamaged trees” [2005].
