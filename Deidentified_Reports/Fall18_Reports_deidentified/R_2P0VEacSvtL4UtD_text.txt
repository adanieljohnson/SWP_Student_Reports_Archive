Title: Sodium and its Impact on Neuromuscular Control in an Electrically stimulated Frog Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
The main objective of the experiment was to understand and observe the way neuromuscular control functions. To better understand neuromuscular control, each lab group adopted a different element to determine the impact on the gastrocnemius muscle. Specifically, our group was to determine the impact of added levels of sodium on the contractions in a gastrocnemius muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle we manipulated originated from a frog leg that we dissect. The control group was the three frog legs before exposure to sodium, while the experimental was after. We utilized electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment and a computer program called “LabScribe” to measure the strength of each contraction. I predicted that the addition of high levels of sodium into the muscle would result in a stronger contraction. The hypothesis was not supported when the one-tailed paired t-test indicated the results were insignificant and because the results presented no signs of stronger contraction forces between the control and experimental groups.

Introduction:
On October 19th the class manipulated the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve on a frog leg to determine the effects of neuromuscular control. The gastrocnemius muscle is one of the two muscles that make up the calf muscle. The peroneus muscle is positioned on the opposite side of the gastrocnemius muscle. The function of the Gastrocnemius is to facilitate movement and locomotion. A contacted Gastrocnemius results in the extension of the leg which facilitate the frog’s ability to jump and swim. [English: 1982] The sciatic nerve is the longest and largest nerve in the body and measures approximately three quarters of an inch in width. The nerve originates in the lower back in a network of nerves called the sacral plexus. It continues down the body towards the gluteal region then down the posterior compartment of the thigh, until it separates into the tibial nerve and the common peroneal nerve. [Sobia: 2011] The sciatic nerve is the nerve that stimulates the gastrocnemius and therefore, is the point at which the electrical stimulus will be applied. The specific biological question we are adopting as a lab group is: what is the effect of introducing sodium into the gastrocnemius muscle?  The class seeks to understand the relationship between electrical signals in the brain and physical muscle movement. The class engaged in the experiment to understand not only how muscular contractions happen in nature, but also within humans. Frog legs were selected because they have a simple structure, can be dissected easily, and is small enough to investigate easily. The firing of an action potential progressed through five stages in the seconds it takes to fire. The first stage is the introduction to the stimulus which allows the action potential to reach threshold and begin depolarizing. The depolarization of the cell is where sodium enters the cell by moving down the concentration gradient. The action potential continues down the neuron opening more sodium channels as it progresses. Repolarization of the cell occurs when the Na+ gates close and potassium (K+) is moved to the outside of the cell, eventually leading to hyperpolarization and then the resting state. An action potential can only be fired when sodium (Na+) flows down the concentration gradient into a neuron. [Charand: 2000] I hypothesize that if the gastrocnemius muscle is exposed to high levels of sodium before an electrical stimulus it will result in a stronger muscle contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
The experiment had two groups a control and an experimental, each containing three frog legs. The frog legs before they are introduced to sodium represented the control. The control shows us the way the muscle contracts naturally, without the addition of the independent variable, sodium (Na+). The experimental is represented by the frog legs after they have been administered the sodium injection. The dependent variable was the action potential, or more specifically the force of the gastrocnemius contraction when stimulated. The control was recorded first because once the leg is injected with sodium it can no longer produce a nonbiased control measurement. Sophisticated electrophysiology (EP) recording equipment is needed to measure the strength of muscle contractions. To access the measurements a computer program named “LabScribe” is needed. Frog legs were dissected before being observed. The frog legs were de-skinned, and the gastrocnemius was separated. The exact same dissection was repeated for each leg. The gastrocnemius was suspended in the air using a string. The next step was to record the control’s values which was done by inserting the EP barbs into the gastrocnemius and clicking record in the LabScribe program. It is important to note that the settings, including aspects like the voltage of the electric stimulus, are properly imputed before recording data and reset after each test. Only .1 ml of sodium was injected into the gastrocnemius using a syringe. We recorded the contraction force the muscle produced at different voltages (V), slowly increasing the amount of voltage, starting at .1 V. We engaged a one-tailed paired t-test to test the statistical significance of our results to compare the relationship between the sodium injected gastrocnemius (the experimental) and the frog legs before the injection (the control).

Results:
The one-tailed paired t-test results indicated that the results were insignificant because the P-value was above the .5 mark. The average difference between the two points was very small. The different groups when tested showed that they were not significantly different. (Table 1) The general trends of the data show no signs of a stronger contraction when the gastrocnemius was injected with sodium. (Na+). Not every leg in the control group nor the experimental reflected the same measurements. Frog leg one produced no contraction until the seventh test while the other legs experienced contractions at lower voltages. (Figure 1)

Discussion:
The results suggest that that the hypothesis was not supported. The statistical test indicates that the results are not significant meaning that the two groups don’t share a direct relationship. Once an action potential is successfully fired the neuron enters what is called hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarization results in a resting neuron that is unable to fire until the potassium (K+) is moved from the cell and the concentration gradient is reestablished. [Physiol: 2013] Hyperpolarization is the best explanation of why the frog legs that were injected with sodium (the experimental) experienced similar contractions to the legs that were not injected (the control). Once the threshold is reached then sodium (Na+) rushes in and depolarizes the neuron which continues down the axon. The increase in the amount of sodium does not influence the strength of contractions rather just facilitate firing rate of the neuron. Once enough sodium is introduced then an action potential is fired, and the excess sodium moves down the axon following the action potential. Sodium is a key element in the creation of action potentials and muscle contraction but additional amounts of it do not produce a stronger contraction force. The addition of sodium into a muscle that has already fired an action potential is the same as providing access materials or resources to an already completed task or project.  The data shows that the contraction force increases to a set point but then begin to slowly decrease. The ATP that is used to fire action potentials remains in an organism’s system until it is eventually decomposed. The presence of ATP in the deceased frog legs is what allows the gastrocnemius muscle to contract, but the ATP is slowly consumed with each action potential. [Ratkevicus: 1998] The consumption of ATP after each action potential explains why each frog leg primarily experiences increasing contraction forces and then a slow decline. The reason for the decline in force is attributed to the consumption of ATP after each action potential making each contraction weaker. David H and Arnold P investigated the contractions of a frog’s gastrocnemius and received similar results to this experiment. The two scientists experimented with intensity, while we focused on the influence of sodium. David and Arnold determined that contractions increased in force until a specific point (2.25 V) and then began to decrease despite intensity increasing in each test. [David: 2016] The similarities in the experiments suggest that we completed the experiment without making any major errors. Overall, we were able to observe the influence of sodium on the contraction forces of a frog leg’s gastrocnemius. Our results suggested additional sodium does not account for a stronger action potential. The experiment allowed the class to develop a better understanding of neuromuscular control. We now know that the amount of sodium does not influence the strength of action potentials, ATP stores are still present in deceased organisms and slowly decrease if used, and that hyperpolarization prevents a neuron from continuously firing.

Figure 1: The graph represents the contraction forces each frog leg experienced as a result of increasing stimulus strength. Each line represents a frog leg. There are six lines because there are six individual groups. The first three frog legs not exposed to sodium represents the control and the three legs injected with sodium represent the experimental group. We stimulated each leg a total 14 times starting with a stimulus of .1 volts and slowly increasing it with each test.
