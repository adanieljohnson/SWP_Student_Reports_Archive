Title: The Effect of Cold Temperature on Male Betta Splendins Intraspecies Behavior

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of colder water temperature on the time it would take male bettas to make physical contact with each other was tested. It was hypothesized that the male bettas in the colder water would take longer to react to each other than when tested in the room temperature water. 3 groups, consisting of two male bettas, were tested for up to 5 minutes, or until contact was made, in 15 degrees Celsius and 18 degrees Celsius water. The mean difference was not significent (t_stat=1.295, d.f.=2, p=0.325). The hypothesis was rejected, as the temperature of the water had no statistical significance for the time it took two male bettas to make contact. 


Introduction:
Betta fish, also known as Betta Splendins, are popular subjects for experiments about behavior, especially intraspecies behavior. A lot of the resources bettas acquire are allocated towards aggressive behaviors used for competition and mating. The agnostic behaviors vary in severity and type: broadside and facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. In order of least to most aggressive behaviors are pelvic fin flickering or erect pectoral fins, tail beating or spreading opercula, and tail flashing or protruding branchiostegal membrane [Johnson: 2018]. Those behaviors culminate in biting, which the male bettas use to deter or kill their competition. Due to domestic breeding, betta fish are retaining what are known as “fighting colors”, which are vibrant and a stimulant for male bettas to begin aggressive behavior [Todd: 2008]. In contrast, wild male bettas are actually dull in color, and only display brighter, more vivacious colors when excited by another male’s challenge. Male Bettas who are the quickest to display aggressive behaviors, like tail beating, have an advantage over the opponent, who chooses to use that information to decide whether to engage or flee the encounter [Castro: 2006]. In colder temperatures, animals are required to use more resources to maintain body temperature [Cho: 1982]. Based on that information, it is hypothesized that males bettas in colder water will take longer to make a physical connection when challenged by another male than male bettas in room temperature water.


Materials and Method:
Six male betta fish were obtained for the experiment. The six male betta fish were divided into three groups, with each group having two male betta fish. Each group was tested twice, once in room temperature water of 18 degrees Celsius, and again in slightly colder water of 15 degrees Celsius. In each trial, with six total trials, the chosen group of male bettas were placed together, with no divider. They were monitored during the interaction to determine when the male bettas would make physical contact. The time was measured in seconds to quantify the aggressive behavior of the male bettas. If the time exceeded five minutes with no contact, it was concluded the male betta fish would not make contact. The individual male bettas were isolated after each interaction for five minutes, with no way to make physical contact or visually see another male betta. The water was cooled down by gradually adding ice to the tank with thermometer in it with an approximate ten second delay, and no more ice was placed in the tank after 15 degrees Celsius was achieved. A paired t_test was used to statistically test the data collected from the experiment.


Results:
The mean time it took the males bettas to make contact in 18 degrees Celsius water was 122 seconds +/- 24.759 (figure 1). The mean time it took the male bettas to make contact in 15 degrees Celsius water was 142 seconds +/- 28.024 (figure 1). The mean difference between the room temperature water and the colder water was not significent (t_stat=1.295, d.f.=2, p=0.325).


Discussion:
The hypothesis that male bettas would take longer to make physical contact in colder water was rejected. Colder temperature does not have a statistically significent impact on how long it takes male bettas to make contact during an interaction. The mean time for the colder water was only slightly longer than that of the experiments done in the room temperature water, and not drastically different. It was expected that, as the temperature became colder, the males betta fish would be allocating more of their resources towards maintaining their body temperature instead of displaying agnostic behaviors. An improvement to the lab would be to make a more drastic change to the temperature. However, a three degrees Celsius difference may not have been enough of a contrast in temperatures to warrant a palpable change in the male betta aggressive behaviors, while a more vast difference of about six degrees could have resulted in a more extreme result [Hess: 1952].The fish may not have had time to properly adjust their body systems to the colder water, so their metabolism rates could have been operating faster than is usual for betta fish in colder water.  Also, other factors go into the interaction between male bettas. Body size causes an automatic agnostic advantage for males bettas, and the size differences of the male bettas could have negatively impacted the results so it took longer for the fish to make physical contact [Bronstein: 1984]. Another external factor is the strength of the visual stimulation provided by the opponent fish. Stimulations that are more intense tend to cause long-duration attacks [Bronstein: 1983]. In conclusion, making a temperature colder does not affect the amount of time it takes for two male bettas to make physical contact when interacting.
