Title: Effect of Atrazine, a Photosynthesis II Inhibitor, and Light Intensity on Photosynthesis Hill Reaction in Enriched Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The herbicide Atrazine is a Photosynthesis inhibitor that has have harmful effects on the environment due to its effect on cell growth and photosynthesis. In this study, we found that the addition of Atrazine in enriched chloroplasts lead to reduction of photosynthesis and oxidative strain in photosynthetic redox reactions. We quantified the photosynthetic reduction activity with the Hill Reaction by using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance. The percent change in absorbance decreased when the chloroplasts were treated with Atrazine; thus, the photosynthetic light reaction rate (Hill Reaction) decreased. We further explored the effect of the reaction rate with differing light intensities. We found that the average absorbances under the spectrophotometer decreased with decreased light intensity; therefore, decreasing the light intensity decreases the rate of photosynthesis for both the control group and treatment group. Our results show that Atrazine does inhibit the photosynthesis rate by attacking the electron transport chain, PSII, reducing the redox reaction required for photosynthesis and ATP synthesis. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a metabolic process for plants and bacteria to capture and store energy from light. It involves redox reactions: electrons carry energy and are transferred down an electron transport chain. This energy develops a proton gradient across the membrane which then drives ATP synthesis. Specifically, Photosystem II causes oxidation of H20, reduction of plastoquinone, and development of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. [Amerongen Herbert: 2013]. Electron transfer reactions can be measured by measuring the ATP production; however, ATP production is difficult to measure so alternative electron acceptors are easier to measure. The Hill Reaction is the process of electron transfer in the presence of chloroplasts and light. [Kummerova Marie: 2006]. In this experiment, the addition of the herbicide Atrazine, a photosynthesis II inhibitor, to enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation was studied to determine its effect on the Hill Reaction. Atrazine is a widely used toxic herbicide on crops and agriculture. An assay for the electron acceptor 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) will be used to determine if Atrazine, a Photosynthesis II Inhibitor, effected the redox reaction. DCIP is an electron acceptor: oxidized DCIP is blue that absorbs light at 600 nm and reduced DCIP is colorless that absorbs light less than 600 nm. [Wake Forest Sakai: 2018]. In a previous study, it was shown that the addition of Atrazine on the plant Algae reduced the rate of photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and cell numbers [Plumley, Davis: 1980]. In another study inspecting different light intensities with the addition of Atrazine, it was shown that the exposure to more light with Atrazine caused the photosynthesis rate to be more tolerant towards the inhibitor [Olsson Louise: 2000]. Consequently, the hypothesis for this experiment stated that the addition of Atrazine decreases the absorbance of DCIP. Also, the rate of photosynthesis will be faster in higher light intensity (100%) than in lower light intensity (50%) and the dark (0%). The dependent variable will be the absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis. The independent variable will be the differing light intensity on the enriched Chloroplasts. The control groups will be the chloroplast with no added Atrazine while the treatment groups will be the chloroplasts with added Atrazine. We will then compare the control groups and treatment in the dark, 50% light, and 100% light. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to make chloroplasts for this experiment, we enriched chloroplast by differential centrifugation using spinach leaves. We added 10 ml of grinding buffer numerous times to grind the spinach. After grounding the spinach leaves in grinding buffer, we collected the liquid part at different steps in the purification process. After gathering our enriched chloroplasts, we labeled 19 large test tubes. The reagents were different mixtures of water, 130 mM DCIP, 100 mM phosphate buffer, and the herbicide Atrazine. The blank test tube had 8 mL of water, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Next, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts in dark contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of phosphate buffer. Next, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts in 50% light contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of phosphate buffer. Next, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts in 100% light contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of phosphate buffer. Next, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts plus atrazine in dark, contained 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of phosphate buffer, and 1 mL of Atrazine. Next, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts plus atrazine in 50% light, contained 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of phosphate buffer, and 1 mL of Atrazine. Finally, three test tubes labeled plus chloroplasts plus atrazine in 100% light, contained 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of phosphate buffer, and 1 mL of Atrazine. Then we added 100 Î¼l of the enriched chloroplasts to tubes 1-18 and transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer and read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. We repeated these three times until we reached 30 minutes total. We then recorded the results for all three readings. [Wake Forest Sakai: 2018]. To investigate the effect of Atrazine on photosynthesis, we quantified the reduction activity with the Hill Reaction by using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance. We treated the samples without Atrazine as control groups and the samples with atrazine as treatment groups. We used a two-tailed T-test to explore the effect of the reaction rate with differing light intensities. We compared the absorbances amongst the samples in the three different light conditions by computing three two-tailed T-test. If the p-value was significant enough (p&lt;.05), we were able to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference amongst the control groups and the treatment groups.  

Results:
After quantifying the reduction activity with the spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance, we found that the addition of Atrazine decreased the overall absorbance value in the treatment group when compared to the control group [Fig. 1]. We treated the samples without Atrazine as control groups and the samples with Atrazine as treatment groups. The percent change in absorbance decreased faster with time in the treatment group. We further explored the effect of the reaction rate with differing light intensities. We compared the absorbances amongst the samples in the three different light conditions by computing three, two-tailed T-test. All three T-tests had three degrees of freedom. The samples under the dark conditions had a p-value of 2.611*10^-6 and t value of 3.182. The samples under 50% light intensity conditions had a p-value of 3.138*10^-9 and t-value of 3.182. Lastly, the samples under the condition of 100% light intensity had a p-value of = 8.283*10^-5 and a t value of 3.182. These values are significant enough to support that the average absorbance in the photosynthesis reaction was greater in conditions with more light. Therefore, increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis for both the control group and treatment group.

Discussion:
In conclusion, the reduction activity showed that the addition of Atrazine decreased the overall absorbance value in the treatment group when compared to the control group. We rejected the null hypothesis (p&lt;.05) and accepted the alternative hypothesis that the addition of Atrazine decreased the absorbance of DCIP. Also, the rate of photosynthesis was faster in higher light intensity (100%) than in lower light intensity (50%) and the dark (0%). The percent change in absorbance decreased faster with time in the treatment group. So, the addition of Atrazine in chloroplasts decreased the rate of photosynthesis. Thus, it caused oxidative strain in photosynthetic redox reactions in photosystem II. Many studies have shown that Atrazine inhibits the rate of photosynthesis such as the study with Phaeodactylum tricornutum plant that was treated with Atrazine. The Atrazine entering the chloroplasts attacked the electron transport chain, especially PSII since it is a photosynthesis II inhibitor, causing oxidative stress which effected the expression of photosynthesis in the plant [Bai Sun: 2015]. We also found that the exposure to more light with Atrazine caused the rate of photosynthesis to be more tolerant towards the inhibitor; similar to another study [Olsson Louise: 2000]. Many studies show that Atrazine can have harmful effects on other living things other than plants. For example in one study, atrazine had a toxic effect on Photosystem II in aquatic organisms. A Bioassay was used to determine the target sites for PSII inhibitors in the PSII electron transport chain. The results showed the imbalanced oxidation in the redox reactions leading to a decreased rate of photosynthesis [Laviale, Morin: 2016]. In conclusion, our study showed how Atrazine, a Photosynthates II inhibitor, disturbs the electron transport chain. The energy in PSII decreased due to Atrazine inhibiting electrons from leaving chlorophyll to move to plastiquinone; thus, there was a decrease in developing a proton gradient and ATP synthesis needed for photosynthesis.  Despite its scientifically proven toxic effects, Atrazine is an overwhelmingly used herbicide in the U.S. [Stevens J.T.: 2003]. This widely used herbicide on crops, agriculture, and lawn upkeep is associated with many other harmful effects such as endocrine disturbance, neurological disorders and cancer.
