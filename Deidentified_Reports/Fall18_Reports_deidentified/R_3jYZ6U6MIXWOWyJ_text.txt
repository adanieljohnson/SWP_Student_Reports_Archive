Title: The Effects of Various Solutions of NaCl on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea Leaves

Abstract:
All living organisms must acquire energy to carry out metabolic processes. Plants capture and store this energy from the sun through photosynthesis. There are many ways that the environment can affect the rate of photosynthesis, either inhibiting or stimulating plant growth. In this experiment three solutions of NaCl were tested on Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts to determine its effects on the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesize that the addition of salt buffer would disrupt the photosynthesis process significantly and result in a decrease of photosynthesis activity. Photosynthetic rate was determined by absorbances of the solutions at 3, 10-minute intervals. Trends indicated that higher NaCl concentrations led to decreased photosynthetic activity.

Introduction:
All living organisms must acquire energy to carry out metabolic processes. This energy comes from three major sources: chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction potential, and electrical or chemical gradients across a lipid bilayer. Plants capture and store this energy from the sun through photosynthesis. Chloroplast convert light energy of the Sun into sugars that can be used by cells during glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration in the mitochondria. Photosynthesis occurs in three parts. The first two parts are known as the light-dependent reactions because they require absorbed photons to generate reducing power. In the first reaction, Photosystem II, energy from absorbed photons of light prompt electrons to leave the chlorophyll and enter the plastoquinone. [Arnon:1971] Oxidized chlorophyll indirectly activates the cleavage of water to produce molecular oxygen, plus electrons that are replace the ones lost from the chlorophyll.  As the energized electrons reach lower energy states they are transferred through molecules. Some of the released energy is transferred to the cytochrome b6f triggering the release of hydrogen (H + ) protons across the thylakoid membrane and into the thylakoid lumen, adding to the proton gradient.  The cytochrome b6f in turn transfers the electrons to the plastocyanin where Photosystem I takes place. Once again, the electrons in chlorophyll molecules are excited by light energy. The electrons go to lower energy states and eventually is used to reduce NADP+. [Arnon:1971] NADP+ is an electron acceptor that synthesizes NADPH--a key reactant in the synthesis of sugar. Furthermore, the increase in the proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthase which creates ATP from phosphate and ADP--completing the process of photosynthesis.    There are many ways that the environment can affect the rate of photosynthesis, either inhibiting or stimulating plant growth. In this experiment various solutions of NaCl were tested on Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts to determine its effects. NaCl is a common table salt but is naturally harvested from salt water. Salt is commonly used for flavoring foods but is also used to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth. [Malays:2008]. Former research tracking the effects of NaCl on plant growth over a 3-week span found that rate of growth declined with increasing salt concentration. [Guenther:1987].   An assay at 600 nm using dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) inhibitor as a substitute electron acceptor and enriched chloroplasts to determine if NaCl would affect photosynthetic reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. If a reaction occurs DCIP will go from blue to colorless when it cleaves an electron at binding site “A”. A centrifuge was used to obtain the supernatant from the pellet so that the chloroplast could be used for experimentation. We hypothesize that the addition of salt buffer would disrupt the photosynthesis process significantly and result in a decrease of photosynthesis activity.

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, chloroplast were extracted from 8 Spinacia oleracea leaves. Mortar, pestle, and 3, 50 mL centrifuge tubes were placed in ice. Then, veins were removed from all Spinacia oleracea leaves. Chloroplasts were isolated by grounding leaves in 10 mL of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0—the grinding buffer—using the mortar and pestle. Additionally, 10 mL of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 were added to ensure thorough grinding and was strained through a cheesecloth into a beaker. To obtain a pure supernatant chloroplasts were centrifuged three times. 200 μl of the filtered liquid were transferred from the beaker into a microtube labeled “Sample of A” and stored on ice. Remaining liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge marked “A” and spun with a balance tube at 200 xG for 3 minutes at 4oC. Supertant in “A” was transferred to “B” and 200 μl were transferred from this tube into a microtube labeled “Sample of B’ and stored on ice. Tube “B” was centrifuged for 3 minutes. Then, the same process was done for tube “C”, which contained the purest supernatant, and was poured into a beaker.  Thirteen large test tubes were labeled and prepared as follows:  Enriched chloroplasts in supernatant “C” were used for the spectrometer assay. 100 μl of enriched chloroplasts were add to the blank tube and tubes #4-12. Each tube was mixed immediately after adding chloroplast and were then transferred to the spectrometer cuvettes. Tube 0 containing only chloroplasts, water, and reaction buffer were used to blank the spectrometer at 600 nm--serving as the Time Zero data points. All samples were places under light and record absorbance after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes and calculate percent change per samples. Find averages of each and record data in a table. One-paired t-tests were used to analyze absorbance value and percent change. 

Results:
Results show the trends of NaCl solutions: 0M, 0.2M, 0.4M, and 0.6M at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. Figure 1 is the Average Absorbance Values of Chloroplasts Samples. Figure 2 shows the Average Percent Change of Solutions at time intervals. Trends in our data indicate that as salt increases, absorbance decreases. Amongst the three solutions, the 0.6M solution of NaCl had the lowest absorbance, 0.183, and highest percent change, 49.955, at 30 minutes--indicating 0.6 M of salt had the greatest inhibition on chloroplasts rate of photosynthesis. [Figure 1 and Figure 2] The p-value for average absorbances of the 0.4M solution of NaCl was 0.097 and 0.053 for the 0.6M solution of NaCl. [Figure 2] A p-value of 0.05 or higher indicates that results could be due to chance. Furthermore, at 30 minutes, the absorbance of 0.4M solution was 0.239 and the absorbance of the 0.2M solution was 0.189. [Figure 1] The absorbance value at 30 minutes of 0.4M solution was higher than that of the 0.2M solution.  

Discussion:
In this experiment it was determined that the addition of salt decreases photosynthetic activity-supporting our hypothesis that the addition of salt would inhibit photosynthetic activity. Our data is supported by previous experimentation indicating that the growth rate of Spinacia oleracea declined with increasing salt concentration. [Guenther:2008] Conversely, our hypothesis was not statistically supported. Discrepancies are most likely due to human error. A surplus amount of salt solution could have been added when preparing solutions which lead to high p-values and statistically insignificant data. Also, tubes #4,5,6 (0.2 M solution) and tubes #7,8, 9 (0.4M solution) could have been misplaced and interpreted as the opposite data. Further testing could extend experimental period to possibly acquire statistically significant results.
High salinity of soil is a major issue facing farmers and agriculture. Soil salinity is one of the most brutal environmental factors limiting the productivity of crop plants. [Shrivastava: 2014] Salt stressed soils are known to suppress plant growth. [Shrivastava: 2014] Soil salinity varies with other determining environmental factors. Further testing could be conducted to identify practices that could be implemented to decrease soil salinity or to decrease the adverse effects high salinity soil has on plants.
