Title: Decreasing the twitch threshold of the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle using Lidocaine

Abstract:
Rania pipiens, northern leopard frogs, need to be able to contract their leg muscles so that they can jump.  Their Na+ channels are necessary for this process because they depolarize the membrane so that an action potential can travel down the axon and to the axon terminal.  Acetylcholine can then be released and the muscle can contract.  This experiment tested the effects on the twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle after being injected with 0.25 mmol Lidocaine.  It was hypothesized that the twitch threshold would decrease after being injected.  To test this, the gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated and the twitch threshold was recorded before and after it was injected.  Once this data was collected, a paired t_test was used to calculate the probability that this hypothesis was correct.  The results of the paired t_test (P=.00077--7.97  x10⁻⁵) confirmed this hypothesis.

Introduction:
Rania pipiens, or the northern leopard frog, require muscles in their legs to contract so that they can jump.  Muscles are able to contract because an action potential travels to a neuromuscular junction, and causes a neurotransmitter to be released.  Sodium channels are necessary for this nervous signaling around the body.  When they are opened, Na+ ions flow into an axon, causing its membrane to depolarize, which allows for an action potential to travel.  This process initiates a positive feedback loop in which Na+ ion channels are opened when their conformation is changed by the depolarization of the membrane.  Therefore, more depolarization leads to more Na+ ion channels being opened which leads to more depolarization, and etc.  Finally, the action potential travels to neuromuscular junctions which releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the muscle.

Lidocaine, a commonly used local anesthetic, has been extensively studied for its potential antiarrhythmic properties because of the role that it plays in blocking the Na+ ion channels in the Purkinje fibers of the heart [Bean: 1983].  Because it prevents Na+ channels from opening which allows the action potential, the question that scientists were trying to solve was whether or not it would be a good antiarrhythmic therapeutic agent.  What they found is that Lidocaine effects the inactivated Na+ channels rather than the active ones that are responsible for controllling the depolarization [Bean: 1983].  Thus, it did not make an effective drug.  Although this study reported these findings, we hoped to reopen the investigation into the efficacy of Lidocaine.  While we did not experiment with the heart, we examined the twitch threshold of various Rania pipiens gastrocnemus leg muscles before and after they were injected with Lidocaine to test the hypothesis that, after being injected, the twitch threshold would significently decrease


Materials and Method:
A leg of the Rania pipiens was degloved.  The sciatic nerve was exposed and separated from the gastrocnemus muscle which was then partially removed after the Achilles tendon was severed.  A string was tied around the severed Achilles tendon and hooked onto the voltage reader so that the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended at a 90˚ angle.  A stimulation probe was inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle.  A threshold voltage was found, and the leg was stimulated at this voltage four more times.  Once these controll readings were taken, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with 0.1 Ml of 0.25 mmol Lidocaine, and stimulated four more times.  This process was repeated with two more Rania pipiens legs.  A standard paired t_test was conducted using the measured twitch thresholds of the frog legs before and after they were injected.


Results:
The threshold voltage found in the first leg was 1 V and the twitch threshold in the controll group remained around 1 V with the average voltage being about 1.12 V (±0.079).  With the injection of lidocaine, the twitch threshold decreased by about 76% and remained around 0.201 V (±0.049).  The threshold voltage found in the leg used in the second trial was 1.5 V (±0.019).  The twitch threshold of the controll averaged at 0.507 V (± while the threshold of the legs injected with lidocaine averaged around 0.505 V (±0.004).  The final trial found that the twitch threshold of the third leg was 1 V and the controll averaged about 0.653 V (±0.009) while the threshold of the injected legs averaged 0.248 V (±0.016).  These values are shown in Figure 1.  The results of the paired t_tests confirmed that the p_value of all of the legs was &gt;0.00077.

Discussion:
The results yielded from this investigation rejected the null hypothesis, but confirmed the alternative hypothesis because the twitch threshold of the legs significently decreased after being injected with Lidocaine.  The paired t_test proved this because the P-value, which was separately calculated from each trial, was considerably &gt;.05, meaning that the probability of the results not being accurate is too low.  With this confirmation, we can reasonably conclude that the Lidocaine blocked some of the Na+ channels which is why the twitch threshold decreased.  This finding implicates that Lidocaine, although already widely used as a local anesthetic, has the potential to inactivate muscular function at a high dose.  This would have to be studied because the Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscle is not necessarily comparable to the skeletal muscles of a larger species.  Although previous studies have shown that the heart is not affected by Lidocaine, this study indicated that there is still room to investigate its effects on other skeletal muscles [Bean: 1983].  It is also worth investigating and calculating just how much the Lidocaine caused the twitch threshold to decrease by.  In this study, it was estimated that, with the injection, the threshold decreased by about 76% but that value could vary because each leg is different.
