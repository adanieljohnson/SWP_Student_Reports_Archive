Title: Varying water temperatures indicate no clear effect upon elodea photosynthetic rate

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the mechanism by which plants produce their own energy in the form of glucose. While studying photosynthesis with regard to plant cell biology, the effect of varying water temperatures was examined with the aquatic plant elodea. Three identical elodea chloroplast assays were prepared and placed in either a hot, cold, or room temperature water baths for thirty minutes. Absorbances were recorded every ten minutes and percent changes between time intervals were calculated. There was no statistically significent difference between the assays, indicating no significent difference in photosynthetic rate between water temperatures. However, this shows that elodea performs well in a variety of water temperatures. Since elodea is an invasive species, our results contribute to the body of knowledge surrounding how to controll invasive species given their high adaptability to varying environmental conditions. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, the biological mechanism by which plants generate energy in the form of glucose, is responsible for sustaining plant biochemical reactions. Since energy production is key to supporting plant systems, a common question asked by scientists is how varying environmental conditions affect the photosynthetic rates of plants, and which conditions may be most optimal for photosynthesis [Johnson, 2018]. 
With regard to aquatic plants, Elodea, a species of aquatic plant, has been used for cell biology research due to its ability to grow in a variety of freshwater environments. In addition, it is an invasive species and is known to grow rather rapidly [Madsen, 1978]. One way to experiment with aquatic plants is by varying the temperature of the water to see if there are any positive or negative effects on the photosynthetic rate of the plant.  
A study by the Department of Cell Biology at the Carnegie Institute of Washington discusses that photosynthesis is highly influenced by changes in temperature, and extreme shifts in temperature can often inhibit photosynthesis by denaturing key enzymes or diminishing their activity levels [Berry, 1980]. Additionally, a study performed by the University of Georgia noted that Rubisco, an enzyme present in chloroplasts responsible for carbon fixation during photosynthesis, is inhibited at temperatures approaching or higher than 30°C due to the disruption of rubisco regeneration and inhibition of its electron transport processes [Salvucci, 2004]. Similarly, a study by the University of Umeå in Sweden indicated that low temperatures result in the inhibition of the Calvin Cycle, consequently inhibiting proficient photosynthesis of coniferous plants. At such low temperatures, repair mechanisms become unable to counteract the stress and damage caused by decreases in temperature [Ottander, 1990]. 
Given what is known about photosynthesis and its inhibition given severe changes in temperature, varying water temperatures might provide insight into an optimal water temperature for a high photosynthetic rate for elodea and how best to manage it as an invasive species.

Materials and Method:
Leaves from four elodea stalks were ground via mortar and pestle with grinding buffer. The chloroplasts were twice centrifuged to isolate the chloroplasts into a pellet. The pellet was then suspended in additional grinding buffer, making the chloroplast solution.  
Nine test tubes consisting of six milliliters of distilled water, 100 microliters of chloroplast solution, two milliliters of buffer, and two milliliters of DCIP were prepared and divided into three assays of three replicates. The first assay would be placed in a hot water (34 ℃) bath, the second in a cold water (10 ℃) bath, and the third in a room temperature (22 ℃) water bath. Additionally, a blank of eight milliliters of water and two milliliters of buffer was prepared. 
The absorbances of each assay were recorded using a spectrophotometer set to 600 nanometers prior to placing the assays in their water baths.  For thirty minutes, the assays were bathed in their respective 34 ℃, 10 ℃, or 22 ℃ baths. Every ten minutes, the absorbances of each assay were recorded under the same spectrophotometer conditions and the percent change was calculated between each ten-minute period.  A one-way ANOVA statistical test was run with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine if the collected data was statistically significent. 


Results:
An overall average positive percent change in absorbance was observed, represented by Figures 1 and 2. The 22 ℃, 10 ℃, and 34 ℃ conditions exhibited a 2.11, 4.62 and 3.20 percent change, respectively. All three treatments exhibited decreases and increases in percent changes from the start time to thirty minutes later, indicated by Figure 1.
In addition, the standard deviation of the average percent changes was high and overlapping, best seen in Figure 1.  The data was ultimately not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.89. 


Discussion:
The average percent changes in absorbance over the course of the thirty minutes indicate a positive photosynthetic rate for all three assays. However, our results were not statistically significent, and cannot confirm that varying water temperatures definitely influence elodea’s photosynthetic rate.  
A factor that could have contributed to this result is that our experiment ran for a total of thirty minutes. Dalhousie University noted in a study that photosynthetic data that had short incubation periods is rather constrained in comparison to data taken from three to four-hour incubation periods [Lewis, 1983]. Performing an experiment focused on gauging photosynthetic rates for only thirty minutes cannot entirely assess how varying water temperatures influence elodea growth in an undisturbed environment. 
However, a study by Aarhus University in Denmark arrived at the conclusion that of three different invasive freshwater plants, elodea was the most competitive due to its ability to establish a colony in both aquatic temperature extremes [Riis, 2011]. Additionally, a study performed by the Department of Plant Biology of Denmark noted that aquatic plants can exhibit photosynthetic acclimation in response to changing temperatures, especially since temperature stress reduces the photosynthetic performance of plants [Madsen, 2001]. 
Our results, although not statistically significent, align with the findings of these studies. They can provide insight into the fact that varying temperatures may not have a significent effect on elodea’s photosynthetic rate, indicating its potential fitness as an adaptable plant. 

Furthermore, our results contribute to scientific knowledge that elodea is able to perform photosynthesis in a variety of aquatic temperatures without being severely affected by certain conditions. Since elodea is an invasive species, further research investigating how varying environmental conditions affect its photosynthetic rate can provide key information regarding how to best manage it in wild and domesticated environments.
