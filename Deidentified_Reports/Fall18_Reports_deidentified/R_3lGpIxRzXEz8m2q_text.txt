Title: The effect of resource competition on the aggressiveness of Betta splendens

Abstract:
The effect of the presence of food on the agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens was tested. The fish naturally react violently to one another, however a prior study shows that the fish would rather eat than go in for a fight. Thus, this question is rasied: when in competition for food will Betta splendens increase their agonistic behavior? After allowing two sets of two male betas to interact in the presence of no stimuli, a female, and a limited quantity of food and allotting points for each aggressive behavior exhibited, it was shown that there was no significant difference in aggression levels between any of the stimulus groups. Because the experiment had so few trials it wouldn’t be correct to draw any conclusions from the results of this experiment. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens is a species of fish native to southeast Asia that is famous for it’s extremely aggressive behavior. The agonistic behavior triggered by seeing another male can easily be triggered by many other stimuli, including blobs of color and the male’s own reflection in the mirror [Thompson: 1966]. Though the response can be elicited by many things, the presence of another male elicits the most aggressive response in Bettas [Craft: 2003]. They are known to have many different behavioral actions and patterns that indicate how aggressive they are at that moment, allowing researchers to determine levels of aggression in the fish. These behaviors include everything from tail flicking to flaring their gill covers to form a “mane” to attacking the stimulus. Though always ready to fight at the sight of another male, when given the choice between eating and fighting, the majority of Betta males will choose to eat rather than fight [Hogan: 1974]. This raises the question: when in competition for food, will Betta splendens increase their agonistic behavior? This experiment tests whether the aggressive behavior is amplified or diminished in the presence of a limited quantity of food. For controls this experiment also tests agonistic behavior between solely two males as well as the behavior of two males in the presence of a female, a limited resource. The control group of two males will tell us the normal levels of aggression when not in competition, and the groups with a female will tell us the standard aggression level when there is a competition for resources. The hypothesis is that the competition for food will increase the level of agonistic behavior in the fish.


Materials and Methods:
To test the hypothesis, we attempted to quantify the aggressive behaviors of Bettas in a point system. For less aggressive actions, one point was awarded. One point behaviors included flickering of the pelvic fin and erecting pectoral fins. More aggressive actions were given two points, two point behaviors included tail beating and spreading gill covers earned two points. The most aggressive actions allotted three points. Three point behaviors included tail flashing, protruding the brachiostegal membrane, and engaging in combat. We placed the fish into a tank with two dividers, making three sections. The trials were five minutes each, the first being an observation of two males without any of stimuli present, the second was an observation of two males in the presence of a female, and the third trial was two males in the presence of six flakes of food. This set of three trials was then repeated with a second set of fish. An ANOVA statistical test was then used to analyze the three groups.


Results:
There was not a significant difference between the three groups. P = 0.333. No individual group was significantly different from the others. Figure 1 shows the comparisons of the three trial groups for the agonistic behavior ratings for two male Bettas in a control, in the presence of a female, and in the presence of food. 


Discussion:
This data did not support the hypothesis that the presence of food would cause an increase in aggressive behaviors displayed by the fish. These findings seem to contradict the findings of Hogan et. al. [1974]. Whereas Hogan’s experiment concluded that Betta fish nearly always choose eating rather than fighting, our experiment showed that there is no significant difference in levels of agonistic behavior in the presence of food. However, there are multiple problems in this experiment that prevent the data from being viable to draw inferences about the overall behavior of Betta splendens. First, there are not enough trials to build an amount of data that could allow us to draw inferences from it. Second, the rating system is subjective and may have been flawed, as adding points for each display meant that fish that started and stopped the behavior yielded more points and therefore were considered more aggressive than fish that showed continuous expression of the agonistic behavior over a long period of time. This could be remedied in future experiments by assigning each fish an overall aggressiveness rating rather that adding points for each individual display. Finally, using the same fish for each of the three groups likely skewed data as the fish may have different responses upon seeing each other multiple times. This could be remedied by either using new fish for each observation or waiting much longer in between trials. Though the data obtained has no way of showing this, the fish did seem to be distracted by food while it was available and went to eat before fighting. This observation is in alignment with findings in previous studies [Hogan: 1974].
