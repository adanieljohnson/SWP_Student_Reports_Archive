Title: The Effects of pH on the Root-to-Shoot Ratio in Buckwheat

Abstract:
The purpose was to determine if the acidity of the soil has an effect on the phenotypic plasticity in plants by measuring the root-to-shoot ratio. There were two groups of buckwheat plants, 36 seedlings watered with water and 36 with a solution having a pH. After two weeks of growth and daily watering, the root-to-shoot ratio of weight and length were measured using nine samples from each group. The two-paired t_test did not produce a significent difference, meaning the results did not support the hypothesis. After calculating the ratio for weight and length, it was determined that there was no significent difference between the neutral soil and acidic soil in terms of phenotypic plasticity.

Introduction:
Phenotypic plasticity refers to the way in which plants change how they allocate their resources based on their environmental conditions, such as soil nutrients and pH, and the availability of sunlight and water. For example, during a dry season, a plant must put more resources into the roots than during the wet season, resulting in a larger root to shoot ratio. During a rainy season, water is readily available for the roots to absorb, meanwhile during the dry season the plant will put more work into growing the roots to increase the surface area through which it can absorb as much water as possible. Phenotypic plasticity is important to plants as it allows them to adjust to changes in environment, rather than dying if they were unable to adapt. 
Fagopyrum esculentum, known as buckwheat, was the plant chosen for the experiment as it has the ability to adjust its phenotypic plasticity more than other cereal grain plants. It will produce a crop in locations where not many others can grow (drained marshland, newly cleared land, etc.). Buckwheat helps to increase the amount of plant-friendly phosphorous in the soil, aid in weed controll, and can also deter bugs and other crop pests. Additionally, buckwheat has a high tolerance to acidic soil. Although there are many benefits to using buckwheat, it also has its drawbacks; it has fine roots which require aerated, easily penetrable soil for successful growth. Over the past 30 years, research has shown the effect of acid rain on our environment whether it be the quality of crops or degradation of lakes, streams, and wildlife populations. Acid rain destroys nutrients in soil and microbial processes which impact plants and animals [Killham, 1983]. Buckwheat is a crop that can be used to restore nutrients to the soil. 
We hypothesize that a soil of a lower pH, around 3.0, would produce a buckwheat plant with a lower root to shoot ratio than buckwheat in soil of a neutral acidity. 


Materials and Method:
Buckwheat plants were chosen as the model organism and twelve seeds were planted in six containers. Initially, the seeds were watered with 50Ml of miracle grow and then set in the greenhouse. Each day the seedlings were watered; the controll with water and the second group with an acidic solution having a pH of around 3.5. At the end of the two-week growth period, the plants were harvested by removal of plant and soil from tray. Then the vermiculite was broken apart, to separate the roots, the roots were washed with water and then patted dry using a paper towel. Three samples from each plant were weighed as a whole, and then the roots and shoots of each plant were weighed separately. The longest length of root and shoot were measured and recorded. The raw data was used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the length ratio and the weight ratio; then used to graph the data and calculate the t-value and p_value using a two-sample t_test with a critical value of 0.05.

Results:
The two-sample t_test showed the controll (0.5700  0.1929) and the acidic group (0.5132  0.1065) varied the root-to-shoot length ratio of the two groups (0.6985, 0.4163, 0.10). There was no significent difference between the two groups.

Discussion:
Our results showed no significent difference in the root-to-shoot length ratio of the two groups (0.6985,0.4163,0.10), thus our hypothesis was not supported. Buckwheat has a high tolerance for acidic soil which is evident in our data, as there was no significance between the weight or length ratio. Thus, there was no need for the plants in acidic soils to allocate their resources differently than they would in neutral soil. Therefore, buckwheat plants can continue to produce the same amount of nutrients in all soil regardless of the pH; making them a good crop to rotate in all soils as they replenish the nutrients that the acid rain destroys [Killham: 1983]. 
One of the greatest limitations of the experimental design was the number of experimental groups. By using a larger number of samples and wider range of soil pH, then a more precise conclusion could’ve been drawn. Also, choosing a plant that thrives at a neutral pH would’ve been a better choice than buckwheat in terms of drawing conclusions that could be applied to plants in general. The ability of plants to use soil nutrients is closely linked to the pH of soil; the ability to absorb and utilize phosphorous in the presence of aluminum is imperative to nutrient utilization [Foy: 1964]. Thus, knowing extent to which pH affects the ability of plants to access and use the nutrient they need would also make the data gathered more applicable on a general basis. In future experiment, increasing the number of samples and a larger range of pH watering solutions would provide more accurate data. A larger amount of data would allow us to draw more general conclusions about phenotypic plasticity and allocation of resources in the presence of a range of soil pH in buckwheat crops.
