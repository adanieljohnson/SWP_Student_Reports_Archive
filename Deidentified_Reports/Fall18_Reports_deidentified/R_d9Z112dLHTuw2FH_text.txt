Title: Sodium Inhibition on the threshold of Contraction Force in Raina Pippin

Abstract:
In this experiment, we were trying to identify whether or not putting a sodium inhibitor would affect the threshold of a muscle contraction. Sodium is used because of the prevalence of the Na+/K+ase. So, we believed that If sodium channels are inhibited, then there will be a change in the threshold for the contraction force. For the experiment, we need three frog legs, so we would be able to run through the experiment several times. We ran through each frog twice, just to see if there was a drastic difference. The p-value for the paired t-test was .4221. Being above 0.05, the data is not significant. Seeing how inhibition of this enzyme has worked previously, it should be able to work in future versions of this experiment.

Introduction:
In this experiment, we were trying to identify whether or not putting a sodium inhibitor would affect the contraction of a muscle. The reason we decided to go with a sodium inhibitor was due to the fact that sodium is essential to generating an action potential. An action potential, or the electrical charge generated when a stimulant is activated, is generated through a process involving a Na⁺/K⁺ase. When the stimulus is activated, then voltage gated sodium ion channels are activated, allowing sodium to enter the cell. This process is called depolarization [Johnson]. Following this, voltage gated potassium ion channels are activated, which result in potassium leaving the cell, in a process called hyperpolarization. This process allows the cell to have an action potential. The easiest way to analyze this, at least in the lab setting, was with the raina pippin species of frog.(Johnson) The frog was generally small and was easy to manipulate. We analyzed the charge of an action potential in the leg, analyzing the neuromuscular junctions, and to see if this process had any effect on the generation of an action potential. So, we wondered if preventing the sodium channels from activating would cause either an increase or decrease of the threshold of a contraction in the muscle. Inhibiting the Na⁺/K⁺ase has been used to stop various physiological ailments and organs. One study inhibited a dog’s infected kidney from affecting the rest of the body over time (Cantly). So, we tested out the following statement: If sodium channels are inhibited, then there will be a change in the threshold for the contraction force.

Materials and Methods:
For the experiment, we used three frog legs, so could run through the experiment several times. We needed sodium inhibitor, a system to be able to give the frog a shock in the sciatic nerve, and a liquid to clean off the frog/stimulate a charge. We started off by cleaning the frog legs, to expose the muscle alone. From there, we inserted the stimulator, so we could stimulate the charge into the nerve. As a constant, the frequency of the charge was 2 Hz, and a constant voltage of 5 volts. Following that, we stimulated the frog’s nerve at various amplitudes to measure what the threshold is, and what the voltage at various amplitudes. We measured the voltage at amplitudes at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0. After finishing the first frog, we then added one milliliter of the sodium inhibitor, then waited five minutes after the injection to remeasure the voltages. Once those five minutes passed, then we remeasured the various altitudes, to see whether or not there was a change of threshold in the stimulus. We did this experiment three times, once for each frog leg. We used a paired t-test as our statistical test.

Results:
When we took the frequencies of the frogs, we got no difference for trials one and three, and a difference of 0.4 for frog two, leaving the average difference to be .1333 V. The average amplitude of a threshold in which a contraction occurred before adding the sodium inhibitor was 0.2666 V. After the inhibitor, the average was 0.4 V. The standard deviation before the inhibition was 0.11547005. The standard deviation after the inhibition was 0.34641016. This, along with the standard error, can be seen in figure one. The p-value for the paired t-test was .4221. Being above 0.05, the data is not significant.

Discussion:
Because our data was not significant, we are not able to accept the hypothesis. For the most part, our data showed the same threshold before and after adding the sodium inhibitor, yet one of the frogs followed the trace stated in our hypothesis. We can admit where we made faults in the lab, however. Going into the lab, the group did not work unanimously to plan out the experiment, and we ended up each having our own plans for the experiment. We did not even have a consensus of what we were measuring for in the first place. On top of that, we also left a large margin of error for where the threshold could be for the frog. We measured the amplitude in increments of .2 for the amplitude, which is a large gap. If we were to re-do the experiment, we would be clear about measuring the amplitude where the threshold occurs. We would also decrease the change of amplitude between trials to get a more specific value for the amplitude. Seeing how inhibition of this enzyme has worked previously, it should be able to work in future versions of this experiment (Cantly).
