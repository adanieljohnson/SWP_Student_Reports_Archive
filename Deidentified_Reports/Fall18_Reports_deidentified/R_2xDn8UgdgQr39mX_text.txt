Title: Effect of the IGR Precor on the Growth of Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that regulates the type of molt that Manduca sexta caterpillars undergo. Once the larvae gain enough nutrients, the JH levels drop and the larvae enters commitment pulse and molting begins. Our hypothesis is that larvae with Precor, which mimics JH, in their diet will weigh more on average than those without. We gave one group of caterpillars Precor in their diet and the others received water, and the difference in weight after 2 weeks was measured. To evaluate the data collected, a one-tailed 2-sample t_test was used. Our p_value was 0.06, so we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that Precor causes caterpillars to weigh more on average.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta are a model organism used to study larvae development and molting. Manduca sexta are commonly used to study insect molting they are small, easy to feed, and mature into adults by pupating in just a few days if properly nourished. An important hormone used in molting is Juvenile Hormone (JH), which regulates the type of molt the caterpillars undergo. Once the larvae gain enough nutrients, the JH levels drop and the larvae enters commitment pulse and molting begins. Molting is defined as the period in which an insect’s epidermal skin cells secrete a new cuticle, or outer layer, and it changes in size radically during metamorphosis. Larval molting is also present in cecropia silkworms and occurs once there is “a declining titer of juvenile hormone” [Williams: 1961] and the silkworms begin to mature into adults. We will test whether adding Precor to Manduca sexta’s diet will affect their growth. Precor contains the IGR methoprene, which mimics JH functions, so the caterpillar’s JH levels remain high although they are getting plenty of nutrients. Normally, JH levels would drop, molting would begin, and the insect would stop growing. Our hypothesis is that larvae with Precor in their diet will weigh more on average than those without because their JH levels will not drop, so they will not be able to achieve commitment pulse and begin molting.


Materials and Method:
We had 8 caterpillars that were somewhere between the 3rd and 4th larval stage. They were divided into 2 groups of 4. One group received 10 g each of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet, with 3 drops of water for the controll group. The 2nd group received 10 g each of GLM diet with 3 drops of Precor. Both groups of food were stirred well. Initial measurements were taken and then the caterpillars were placed in the containers. Measurements were taken every other day for 2 weeks to check weight. Food was changed when it dried out. To evaluate the data collected, a one-tailed 2-sample t_test was used.


Results:
The controll and treatment group appeared similar in size for a week, but the controll developed black lines after a few days. All caterpillars ate well except for one who appeared diseased and later died. At the end of the 2 weeks, all of the caterpillars in the controll group had molted, but none of the treatment group had. The treatment group gained weight more slowly but weighed more at the end of 2 weeks. The average change in weight for the controll was 5.32±0.93 g, and the average change in weight for the treatment group was 8.10±2.80 g, which can be seen in Figure 1. The p_value from a one-tailed t_test is 0.06.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis is that larvae with Precor in their diet will weigh more on average than those without because they will not be able to achieve commitment pulse and begin molting. However, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that adding Precor to Manduca sexta caterpillar’s diet causes them to grow larger. Since our result is not statistically significent, we cannot be sure that our results are not due to chance, so fail to reject our null hypothesis that Precor does not cause Manduca sexta to increase in weight. These data may not be significent because we had one caterpillar die in the treatment group, which causes the standard deviation to be higher and makes us less confident that the results were not due to chance. While our results are not significent, we are confident that had the experiment continued on for a few days, the treatment group would continue to grow more and the controll group’s weight would stagnate because the controll group showed signs of pupation, including the black lines and proboscis formation, while the treatment group appeared to remain in the larval stage. Our next step would involve using the same hypothesis with more caterpillars to account for one that may die, or run the same experiment for a longer period of time to see if the treatment group would continue to grow larger, which would support our original hypothesis. Other literature confirms that “low concentration of juvenile hormone” [Williams: 1961] in silkworm larvae causes pupation to occur, so we are reasonably sure that further experimentation using Precor as a JH inhibitor would show this effect.
