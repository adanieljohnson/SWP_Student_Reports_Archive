Title: The Effect of Water Color on Betta splendens agonistic behaviors 

Abstract:
In biology, it is important to understand how members of the same species interact with each other in different situations. Whether it be agonistic or aggressive behavior presented during mating season or collaborative behavior, it is necessary to know specifically how species demonstrate these behaviors. In this experiment, researchers observe these intraspecific behaviors and asses based on a scale whether conditions of water coloring (specifically food coloring present in their water) either reduces or increases the demonstration of these aggressive behaviors. Researchers found that there is not a statistical significant difference between the amount of aggressive behavior displayed by fish with colored water added to their tank compared to the fish before in clear water.

Introduction:
Betta splendens, commonly referred to as Siamese fighting fish, are known to exhibit aggressive or agonistic behaviors between two male B. splendens. This is recognized as an intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behavior is displays of behavior between two organisms of the same species. [Svanbäck & Bolnick: 2007]. One type of Intraspecific behavior for B. splendens is agonistic or aggressive behavior, shown through broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are displayed when a fish turns its side towards its opponent, and has three movements that increase in level of aggressiveness (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing) [Robertson: 1979]. They also exhibit facing movements, facing opponents with their pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula, and protruding Branchiostegal membranes (also known as the red mane) [Robertson: 1979]. There are certain factors that are thought to have an effect on these aggressive behaviors. In this experiment, researchers are looking at the factor of visibility, as variables that limit visibility in B. splendens water are thought to reduce aggressive behavior demonstrations. It was hypothesized that if Betta splendens are in colored water that limits their visibility then the amount of agonistic behavior demonstrations will decrease.


Materials and Methods:
Three different sets of two Betta splendens were collected and placed in 3 tanks (1 tank for each set), and one opaque and one clear divider was placed in between the two fish in each tank. All of the fish were red. The tanks were all filled with room temperature water and the fishes were fed prior to this experiment, growing accustomed to the tank environment. For each set of fish, the experiment began by lifting the opaque divider (to let the fish see each other) and then recording the frequency of each aggressive behavior according the developed behavior scale. The scale was based on an increasing level of aggressiveness determined by the specific display behavior. For Broadside movements the scale was Fin flick (1), Tail beat(2), Tail flash (3). The facing movements were ranked in a similar way, Erect pelvic fins (1), Spreading operculum (2), and protruding Branchiostegal membrane (3). A time multiplier was also used to account for the amount of time on average it took for the fish to display aggressive behavior. The more these behaviors were demonstrated based on the scale, the more aggressive each B. splendens’ behavior trend was thought to be. In the next part of the experiment, blue water coloring was added to one out of the three tanks, and red food coloring was added to another tank, while the remaining tank was left clear to represent the control group.  Each set of fish took turns being placed and observed in the different treatment tanks.Then their aggressive behavior frequency was recorded. Data was then compiled and an ANOVA test was run to determine the significance of the results.


Results:
The Mean of the control trials of B. splenden was 3.575 +/- of 2.528. The Mean of the red experimental trial was 2.4 +/- 4.8. And the Mean of the Blue experimental trials was 2.3 +/- 2.959. The ANOVA test found that the results were not significant across all groups (figure 1). However, there was not a significant difference between the tested groups (Fs = 0.158, df=11, p = .856).


Discussion:
In this lab, the hypothesis was not supported. This is due to the statistical results of the ANOVA test showing no statistical significance across all three testing groups. This implies that visibility was not hindered significantly enough to have an effect on the agonistic behaviors when food coloring was added to and changed the color of the water, as it was even observed that in colored water the fish were still able to find their way towards each other in about the same amount of time (3.5 minutes) in almost every trial. This however is still a confounding variable, as it is thought to be but not known whether visibility being hindered enough to has a significant effect on Betta splendens aggression [Higa & Simm: 2004]. This promotes the idea that further testing should look into whether the concentration of coloring or opaqueness of the water hinders visibility and therefore intraspecific behaviors in Betta splendens.
