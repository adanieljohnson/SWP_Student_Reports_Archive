Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Weight of the Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, tobacco hornworm, is a type of pest that affects tobacco crops, as an adult. The hornworm relies on certain hormones such as its Juvenile Hormone (JH) to transform into different larval stages, leading to its adulthood. To prevent it from becoming a pest, inhibitory growth regulators (IGRs) are used to disrupt the secretion of JHs and edysterones. IGRs interfere with the molting process of tobacco hornworms. Martin’s IGR is a type of inhibitory growth regulator that contains a chemical called methoprene, which is an insecticide against mosquitos and other insects and prevents the insect from maturing. Six drops of Martin’s IGR were applied in 10 grams of food for four caterpillars, to determine whether the caterpillars’ weights would decrease. The other four caterpillars were given six drops of water. Each of the caterpillar’s weights were measured and recorded for two weeks. Data was ignored after day 10, since the experimental group began to pupate. Based on the statistical test, the p-value was 0.003, with a df of 6 and t-value of 4.012. Methoprene was not efficient against the Manduca sexta, due to its functionality and concentration

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a type of pest that usually feasts on crops such as tobacco, tomato, pepper, eggplant, and variety of others. These crops are usually economically beneficial to farmers but are unfortunately devastated by the tobacco hornworm as a larva [Byron:  2017]. The Manduca sexta primarily undergoes certain life stages, in order to become an adult pest. The tobacco hornworm begins as an egg, where it hatches after one to three days. The caterpillar proceeds into its larval stages, consuming food and increasing in weight and size. Towards the culmination of its larval stages, the tobacco hornworm pupates, and the pupal cell becomes reddish-brown, developing new body parts. After the pupation, the Manduca sexta transforms into an adult [Byron: 2017]. The Manduca sexta changes through these different stages by a process known as molting. Molting occurs when the insect sheds its skin cells to create a new layer skin called cuticle. The process helps to change the morphology of the caterpillar. Molting primarily depends on two hormones: juvenile hormones (JH) and edysterones. JH controls the type of molting for the tobacco hornworm [Staal: 1975]. Edysterones control the timing of molting. Both JH and ecdysone are crucial for the survival of the tobacco hornworm. If either hormone is inhibited or less than normal, the moth will most likely remain the in the same larval stage or die.
	There are certain substances called inhibitory growth regulators (IGRs) that can control the life cycle process. IGRs interfere with insect growth and development of an insect, primarily affecting the secretion of both JH and ecdysone hormones. They can prevent normal molting, egg-laying, egg-hatching, and development from the larval stage to the adult stage. IGRs are used as natural forms of insecticides to prevent the spread of pests like the tobacco hornworm. A consumer product that acts as an IGR is Martin’s IGR. Martin’s IGR contains a chemical called Methoprene, which is type of IGR that used to combat against mosquitos, beetles, and other insects. The purpose of Methoprene is to disturb the insect’s lifecycle and hinders its maturity or reproduction, by altering the amounts of JH and edysterones. A larva that fails to morph into its next stage is more likely to have a lower weight than usual since it remains in a premature state. 
	To determine whether Martin’s IGR is efficient against the Manduca sexta, it is hypothesized that if six drops were to be implanted in the food of the tobacco hornworm, the weight of the tobacco hornworm would decline. 


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups: experimental and control. The experimental group was given a  labeled container with four compartments, while the control group was also given a container with four compartments. The compartments had two holes poked out and contained 10 g of food for each of the caterpillars. Before putting the caterpillars in their respective compartments, all of their weights were measured by an electronic balance and recorded. After the caterpillars were placed in their compartments, a lid was placed over the two containers and placed in the refrigerator. The refrigerator mimicked a 12-hour day with light exposure and remained at a constant temperature of 25oC. For two weeks, each of the caterpillars’ masses were measured and recorded. The experimental groups received six drops of the Martin’s IGR in their food while the control group received six drops of water, within the two weeks. If the food decreased, 10 g was measured and put in the compartment. 
	For safety purposes, gloves were worn during the measurements of the caterpillars and when putting the IGR drops in the food. 
	A two tailed 2-sample t-test was conducted to analyze the weights of the experimental and control groups.


Results:
The highest average change in weight was experimental group #4 with 9.42, while the lowest average change in weight was control group #2 with 0.19. Throughout the 14 days, the experimental group had higher amounts of feces and started to turn into a red-brown color, while the control group remained the same color and lower amounts of feces. The larvae for the experimental group started to pupate after Day 10, therefore all data till Day 14 was ignored. The average change in weight and standard deviation for the experimental group was 7.408 +- 2.122 (Fig 1). For the control group, the average change in weight and standard deviation was determined to be 2.008 +- 1.655 (Fig 1). From the 2-sample t-test with an alpha of 0.05, the t-value was 4.012, the p-value was 0.003, and the degrees of freedom (df) was equivalent to 6. 

Discussion:

The results were proven to be statistically significant. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected, but the results did not prove that the research hypothesis was supported, since the average change in weight for the experimental group was expected to be lower than the average change in weight for the control group. Based on the results, Methoprene overactivated the hormones involved in molting, instead of inhibiting the hormones. The overactivation can be from the increased secretion of ecdysone and lower secretion of JH. Ecdysone still proceeds to secrete under the influence of Methoprene, while JH secretes gradually slower [Ghekiere: 2006]. After 10 g/l of Methoprene is applied to the insect, Methoprene is expected to inhibit JH and edysterone hormones [Ghekiere: 2006]. Five drops of Methoprene was not equivalent to the 10 ug/L, but rather smaller and did not suppress the hormones. Since the Methoprene was extracted as a liquid, it becomes inefficient towards hindering the larval stage of the insect, since it loses its functionality from compounds that degrade from poor storage and processing conditions [Wijayaratne: 2018].  Additional research could be repeated with having more drops of methoprene and more caterpillars, to ensure better results. With better results, the experiment would help to find broader ways in combating the prevalence of the tobacco hornworm.
