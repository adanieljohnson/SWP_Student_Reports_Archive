Title: The Effects of Caffeine on P. polycephalum Chemotaxis

Abstract:
To examine specifics in cell signaling, we experimented with Physarum polycephalum, a yellow slime mold that has unique intelligent properties. Because P. polycephalum has similar signaling pathways to humans, it is helpful in biological research. In this experiment, we used water agar plates and oatmeal to measure the effects of caffeine and cAMP dibutyryl on the P. polycephalum’s growth. After 24 hours, we measured the growth and we concluded that caffeine does indeed increase P. polycephalum growth, because it inhibited cAMP, which triggered an increase in movement.


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is a multinucleate syncytium, meaning it is a mass of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane. Because all the cells must undergo mitosis simultaneously, it essentially performs as one large cell [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab, we will study P. polycephalum in the plasmodial stage of its life cycle. P. polycephalum in the natural environment grows over leaves and dead tree branches looking for food. It is important that we study P. polycephalum because it uses many of the same signal transduction pathways that human cells use, and is also easier to handle and observe than human cells. P. polycephalum has exhibited efficient weighted networks, when presented with multiple sources of food. It can form a maze between food sources, expand reduce the number and size of the strands of growth based on the amount and quality of the food, and control its uptake of nutrients through a balance system. Because of P. polycephalum’s intelligence, it could potentially be used in bio-computers: a computing device that uses biological molecules rather than silicon chips to preform calculations. The common behavior of P. polycephalum that we studied in this experiment was chemotaxis, the ability for the organism to sense molecules in its environment, and respond by crawling toward or away from the food. Previously many experiments have been performed on P. polycephalum, including ones that examine chemotaxis but with different types of food, such as valerian root, passion flower, and wild lettuce, instead on potential movement inhibitors [Adamatzky:2012]. P. polycephalum was also used in cancer research before cell culture techniques and tissue engineering advanced [Oettmeier: 2017]. In this lab, we will be looking further into the signaling pathways the P. polycephalum uses. Because P. polycephalum lacks an immune system, it relies on signaling pathways to control its responses to the environment.  Much of the behavior of P. polycephalum is regulated by two receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, and ion-coupled receptors. In this lab, we will be examining how the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a second messenger, is affected by caffeine. In the cAMP pathway, the effector enzyme that is activated by the G-protein is adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP into cAMP. The cAMP then diffuses through the cell and binds to substrates. Protein kinase A (PKA) is the enzyme activated by cAMP [Johnson: 2016]. We want to answer the question: How is the cAMP pathway affected when caffeine is introduced into environment of the P. polycephalum, as well as, how would a PKA activator affect P. polycephalum movement and growth? To determine if caffeine and PKA activator, dibutyryl cAMP, affects movement, we will soak water agar plates in the two substances and add P. polycephalum and oatmeal, and measure how much growth each P. polycephalum exhibited. We will also have a control which will contain food, but no caffeine or dibutyryl cAMP. Our negative control will contain neither caffeine, food, or cAMP dibutyryl. We hypothesize that the caffeine will cause an increase in growth in P. polycephalum due to the inhibiting effects on the cAMP signaling pathway.


Materials and Methods:
First, 10 100mm petri plates containing 2% agar and water were collected and labeled. Three were labeled control, 3 were labeled caffeine, 3 were labeled cAMP dibutyryl, and one was labeled negative. Next, the 20mM caffeine solution was diluted from 20X to 1X. The solution was poured onto the three water-agar plates labeled caffeine. The same dilution procedure was carried out for the cAMP dibutyryl solution. It was then poured onto the three water agar plates labeled cAMP dibutyryl. The plates were left to soak for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the excess solution was poured off and blocks of P. polycephalum were added about one centimeter from the edge of the dish into 1cm squares that were removed previously from the water agar plates. P. polycephalum was added to all plates including, positive control and negative control. Four centimeters away from the P. polycephalum 5 flakes of oatmeal were placed on the water agar plate. All 10 plates were wrapped in aluminum foil to provide the P. polycephalum a dark place to grow, and the plates were placed in a black bag in a dark drawer. After 24 hours, the plates were removed and P. polycephalum growth was measured with a ruler and recorded. A two-tailed t test was carried out to compare the data.


Results:
To determine how caffeine affects P. polycephalum growth, we used caffeine solution and cAMP dibutyryl. Based on the measurements after 24 hours it is clear, from observation of Figure 1, that the caffeine increased P. polycephalum growth. The control grew as expected and the cAMP dibutyryl caused the P. polycephalum to grow, but not as much as it normally does. The negative control did not grow at all.


Discussion:
Based on our results, it is evident that caffeine increases growth of P. polycephalum. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor, so therefore promotes chemotaxis. Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors and promotes the signaling pathway that triggers cAMP production and protein kinase A (PKA) activation [Lindskog: 2002]. Because of this effect on the signaling pathway, the molecule is advected by fluid flows, but simultaneously hijacks flow generation by causing local increases in contraction amplitude as it travels [Alim: 2017] A feedback loop causes it to continue searching for food. Many studies show conflicting results, which concludes that P. polycephalum is inconsistent with growth. In the study by Brenner, they found that caffeine inhibits the binding of cAMP to the receptor, which decreases P. polycephalum movement [Brenner: 1984]. Our results clearly showed the opposite. Based on our statistical tests, our results are not statistically significant. Our data provides no evidence that the null hypothesis is false, therefore we reject our hypothesis. This could have been because the growth was not large enough between the control and the test groups to show significance. This error could be resolved by using larger water agar plates that could account for more growing room. Also, if we examined the P. polycephalum over a longer period of time, we would be able to account for more growth and our results could possibly show significance. cAMP dibutyryl caused the P. polycephalum to grow, but not as much as the control did. We suspect this is because the cAMP, PKA activator in the P. polycephalum interacted with the cAMP dibutyryl negatively, which caused the P. polycephalum to grow, but not as much as it could have with only its natural PKA activator. PKA activation is needed for chemotaxis, but it is very regulated and sometimes over activating, so can interfere with mobility [Johnson: 2016]. The dose of the activator that is needed is extremely specific. The intelligence of the P. polycephalum would be an interesting field of study for future experimentation of P. polycephalum.

Figure 1: Rate of P. polycephalum growth from 0 to 24 hours for control, negative, caffeine, and cAMP dibutyryl. At 0, P. polycephalum had no growth. The P. polycephalum with the most growth was the one on the caffeine enhanced agar plate. The one with the least amount of growth was the one on the cAMP dibutyryl enhanced agar plate. The control grew steadily. A two-tailed t test was taken between control and caffeine, and another one was taken between control and cAMP dibutyryl. (For caffeine, error bars are ± 0.0121244 s.d., T-value is 3.60359, two-tailed p-value is 0.065265, N value is 3) (For cAMP dibutyryl, error bars are ± 0.0056862 s.d., T-value is 3.60359, two-tailed P-value is 0.095434, N value is 3).
