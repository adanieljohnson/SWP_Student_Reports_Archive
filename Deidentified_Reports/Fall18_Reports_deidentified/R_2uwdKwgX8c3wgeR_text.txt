Title: Effects of juvenile hormone administration on tobacco hornworm larvae

Abstract:
Hormones play an important role in many organisms, and insects are no exception.  Juvenile hormone has proven to play a particularly large role in larvae development and pupation.  In this experiment, we demonstrate the effect of JH on the pupation and weight gain of Manduca sexta larvae, as we administer JH to larvae who are close to pupation.  The expectation was that such administration would prevent pupation, and lead to larger weight gain in the experimental larvae than in the larvae who were not administered JH.  Our data showed a significent difference in weight gain between the experimental and controll groups, and that, combined with our observations of the experimental group remaining in the larvae stage, indicates that JH administration could prevent many insects from reaching adulthood.  Such a finding could help protect crops from predatory pests, as it could keep such pests in a larval (and harMless) stage.

Introduction:
This experiment demonstrates and evaluates the influence of certain hormones (specifically juvenile hormones) on the development of insects.  Hormones, in both humans and insects, are signals sent by the body to begin the transition from youth to adult.  In humans, such a phase is known as puberty; in insects, the phase constitutes molting or pupation (when the larva form a cocoon, and reemerge from it as an adult).  In this experiment, we will be studying Manduca sexta (the tobacco hornworm), and how it is affected by administration of a juvenile hormone around the later larva stage.  Manduca sexta has been studied to such an extent that it is known as the “lab rat” of insects (Riddiford 2003), and the role that juvenile hormone (JH) plays in its development has been established.  JH remains at a high level in hornworm larvae until the 5th instar (larvae phase), as it combines with ecdysteroids to play a large role in larvae development (Johnson 2018). It then drops precipitously, then rises slightly, then disappears at pupation (Riddiford 2003).  Pupation thus occurs when the corpora allota stops secreting JH – at this time, the larva weighs about 5 pounds (Nijhout 1974).  To test the effect of continuous high JH levels on pupation, we will be administering methoprene (a juvenile hormone) to 5th instar larvae and tracking the results of our administration.  We as a group believe that if we feed Manduca sexta caterpillars (larvae) food containing methoprene, it will inhibit pupation in the caterpillars that consume it, and they will grow to be larger than the caterpillars in the controll group (who are not given methoprene).

Materials and Method:
We were given 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars by our TA and measured their initial weights before placing them in their designated compartments.  The controll group was placed in one 4-compartment container, and the experimental group was placed in the other.  We then measured 10 grams of food for each caterpillar and placed the food in the compartments.  However, for the experimental group, we put 5 drops of methoprene into each one’s food.  We then closed the containers (poking air holes in the top), and returned the caterpillars to their in-class habitat.  Each day, a member of the group measured the weight of each caterpillar, making sure that they all had enough food, and occasionally cleaning out the compartment (the experimental group defecated a great deal).  However, due to Hurricane Florence, we were not able to feed and measure the caterpillars over the second weekend of observation.  Thus, one group member measured their weights, and gave each caterpillar 20 grams of food on Friday.  On Monday, when the lab reopened, the normal procedure was followed.  We measured and fed the caterpillars for two weeks, from September 5th through September 18th.  On the 18th, we measured the ones that were not pupating or dead, threw the caterpillars out, and cleaned out the containers.  We then used a two-sample t_test to find the difference in weight change among the caterpillars, as well as the standard deviation in weight change.

Results:
Our mean value of weight gain in the controll group was 3.0875 grams (Fig. 1), and our mean value of weight gain in the experimental group was 8.425 grams (Fig. 1).  The standard deviation for the controll group was 3.7101 (Fig. 1), and the standard deviation for the experimental group was 1.5438 (Fig. 1).  Our two-sample t_test showed a d.f. of 6, a t-value of 2.656, and a P-value of 0.018851, meaning that the mean of the controll group’s weight gain was statistically significently different than the experimental group’s weight gain.  Observations: All 4 experimental caterpillars grew much larger than is to be normally expected, and were bright blue, with a pulsing nerve.  3 of the controll caterpillars remained somewhat small, and pupated during the observation period – however, Control #3 resembled the experimental subjects in color and size and died before pupation.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that feeding caterpillars with methoprene-laced food will give them greater weight than the controll group, as well as inhibit their pupation, was supported in the experiment.  Besides the observations that favored our hypothesis, the statistically significent P-value of weight gain demonstrates that such gain is relevant, and that methoprene is responsible for it.  Such a finding has been previously documented, as past investigations have found that larvae tend to stay at around 5 grams once JH level plummets before pupation, so JH administration would logically increase their weight a great deal (Nijhout 1974).   However, we did appear to make an error in our care of Control #3, as it resembled the experimental caterpillars, rather than the controll subjects.  While we were careful not to contaminate different food samples, it is possible that any early meal for Control #3 contained methoprene, which led to #3’s experimental appearance.  Anyhow, our experiment could demonstrate a pattern in most, or all, insects; if JH plays a prominent role in the maturation of every insect, using it for regulation could prevent numerous pests from reaching adulthood.  The tobacco hornworm, for instance, is a pest in youth (it chews on tobacco plants), but harMless in adulthood (as a moth).  But for an insect that is a pest as an adulthood, administration of JH could prevent it from reaching adulthood, and thus could protect certain plants from parasitic pests.
