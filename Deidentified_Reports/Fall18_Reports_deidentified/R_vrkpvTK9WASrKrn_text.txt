Title: Effect of Lidocaine on Muscle Contraction in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Neurotransmitters receive external stimuli which interactions with the skeletal muscle system to enact a response to the environment. Nerve impulses known as action potentials travel through sensory neurons to the cell membranes of muscles. Here, action potentials cause the contraction and relaxation of targeted muscle(s). It was hypothesized: If a sodium inhibitor is present, then the maximum contractile force of the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle will be lower than untreated muscles. Three northern leopard frog legs were dissected and prepared with each leg acting as its own control. The maximum contractile forces of the untreated and treated (with a sodium inhibitor) legs were determined by applying a range of voltages. A paired t-test was conducted to determine the average maximum contractile force of both groups. The experimental group displayed a lower maximum contractile force in comparison to the control group. This data coincides with previous research on the effect of sodium inhibitors and muscle contraction in various organisms.

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles in various organisms collectively communicate to process and respond to environmental stimuli. Skeletal muscles are stimulated by motor neurons in the grey matter of the spinal cord and are formed by connective tissue which are made up of bound myofibers. Nerves trigger muscle contractions by relaying signals through neurotransmitters to specific locations (this process is referred to as “excitation-contraction coupling”) [Johnson: 2018]. Action potentials travel along an axon of a nerve until it reaches the neurotransmitter junction where depolarization of the neuron in the membrane occurs. Consequently, voltage gated calcium channels open and release acetylcholine (Ach) which diffuses and binds with receptors on the muscle fiber membrane. This opens sodium channels which generate an action potential that travels through the muscle fiber and along T-tubules until calcium ion channels are opened in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Calcium release causes the contraction and relaxation of the select muscle. Reuptake of calcium and release of sodium during repolarization allows the muscle to relax before the next contraction. If adequate levels of sodium are not present, an action potential cannot be stimulated, and minimal response is recorded [Castle: 1993]. 
	To measure muscles and nerve activity, a myogram is used by attaching a force transductor to a muscle. This records and documents muscle contractions over a period of time. Myograms display a latent period (stimulation to start of contraction), contraction phase, and relaxation phase [Johnson: 2018]. During stimulation, when one motor neuron produces an action potential, every attached myofiber contracts. To increase these action potentials or create spatial summation, increase the applied voltage. To generate temporal summation (motor units producing maximum force called tetanus or tetany), increase the frequency of stimulation. 
	Rana pipien is an ideal organism to study neuromuscular control. Nerve and muscle stimulation are easy to perform due to the accessibility of the exposed nerves in the gastrocnemius muscle and clear visualization of nerve response. It is hypothesized that when injected with a sodium inhibitor, Rana pipien legs will display lower maximum contractile forces compared to untreated legs.


Materials and Methods:
Three northern leopard frog legs were prepared by skinning and exposing the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve. Next, the muscle of each leg was separated from the tibialis anterior muscle and the tibia. Additionally, the Achilles tendon was cut near the ankle of the leg and string was knotted around the tendon to hang from the force transductor. With the nerve exposed at the top of the muscle, the lower region of the leg was positioned at a 90-degree angle and pinned to a tray. With each leg acting as its own control, twitches were produced by ten bursts of electricity (ranging from 0.10 V to 5.0 V). The pulses were generated by BNC electrodes and recorded with myograms. This methodology was replicated after injecting each leg with 25mm lidocaine and letting them acclimate for two minutes. After all data was collected, statistics were analyzed using a paired t-test.

Results:
The experiment measured the average threshold of the legs across a range of voltages (Figure 1). The experiment also measured the average threshold for each frog leg (Figure 2). In addition, the results recorded by the myograms visually indicated a higher amplitude/maximum contractile force for the untreated frog legs. Based on the paired t-test, the mean of the control group was statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group (t-stat = 8.481, df = 9, p = 1.38 x 10-5 ).

Discussion:
As expected, our data was statistically significant and thus verified our hypothesis. Thus, the injection of a sodium inhibitor, in this case 25mm lidocaine, in Rana pipien legs appear to have decreased the maximum contractile force. With minimal presence of sodium, the action potential necessary for release of calcium and contraction of the muscle could not be adequately completed. The gastrocnemius muscle in the leopard frog legs were therefore unable to contract as much as they typically would [Castle: 1993]. Data from this experiment is skewed (as can be seen by large standard deviations) due to a small sample size of frog legs. Had there been more subjects an even larger and more definitive difference between the control group and experimental group could have been evaluated.
	Future studies regarding the neuromuscular system could include the effects of 1) increased sodium levels, 2) decreased levels of potassium and/or calcium, or 3) a combination thereof. The research conducted on sodium and muscle contraction is relevant to medical advancements through drug therapy. Specifically, medications that could potentially aid in reducing the intensity of unwanted muscle contractions in humans.
