Title: The effects of water temperature on intraspecific aggression among Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta splendins is a breed of fish that show aggressive behaviors among males within the same species. This experiment looks at the differences in aggressive behaviors among males in warm water and colder water. We placed bettas in room temperature tanks as well as tanks with slightly colder water and tracked the number of red mane occurrences when two males were placed together. We found that water temperature is essential to the bettas’ ability to allocate resources towards aggressive, intraspecific behaviors. In this experiment, we found that those bettas placed in colder water were far less likely to allocate resources towards aggressive behaviors than those in the warmer water. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins, or “Japanese fighting fish,”  are a species which show intraspecific aggressive behaviors among males. Such behaviors include flashing certain fins as well as eventual physical contact if allowed. In this experiment, we tested the effects of water temperature on male aggressive behaviors. If the water is significently colder for some males, they may be more likely to allocate more resources towards basic functions such as breathing and swimming rather than fighting other males when they are present. Aggression in Betta splendins is correlated with some hormone levels, and it is likely that these hormones play a role in regulation of metabolic rates among the fish as well. Therefore, it is highly likely that muscle energy is correlated with metabolic rates, which means that the fish can decide whether or not to engage in aggressive behaviors based on their current metabolic rates [Haller: 1989]. If so, fish that are experiencing lower metabolic rates (for various reasons, but including colder water) will have a lowered ability to allocate resources towards aggression. We predict that the male Betta splendins which are given a significently colder water temperature will be less aggressive than those in water that is room temperature. 


Materials and Method:
In this experiment we had two tanks; one tank was kept at room temperature (around 10 degrees celsius), and then placed ice in the other tank to lower the temperature to between 8 and 9 degrees celsius. Two male betta were placed in the room temperature tank and the opaque divider was removed (the clear glass was left in). The number of red made occurrences was recorded within five minutes and then the fish were allowed to rest for five minutes. This was repeated twice more for the warm take and three times in the colder tank. We tested six fish, and each fish was assigned a number 1 through 6. For the warm trial, 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6 were placed together. In the cold trial, 1 and 6, 2 and 3, 4 and 5 were placed together; the fish were mixed in this way to avoid cohabitation. We used a paired two-sample t_test to compare means of the two groups. 

Results:
The results of this experiment showed a significent difference for water temperature (t=3.24, d.f.= 5, p=0.023) with an alpha level of 0.05. The graph shows the difference of red mane occurrences in the warm versus cold water. 


Discussion:
Our results supported our hypothesis, as there was a significent difference in red mane occurrences of the warm water bettas versus those placed in the cold water. Those bettas place in cold water, in all six trials, showed no effort to engage in aggressive behaviors -- this is most likely due to the fact that nearly all of their resources and energy were being allocated towards regulating their metabolism. In this case, the Bettas’ need for survival overpowered the aggressive behavior that is generally seen among these fish. In areas that are affected by global climate change and are experiencing harsher winters, fish could be negatively affected in regards to their ability to perform mating displays or engage in foraging for food. The natural habitat of Betta splendins is in Thailand where the temperature of the water is high [Jaroensutasinee: 2000]. If fish which are affected by cold shock are unable to perform aggressive behaviors, as was shown in our experiment, they may also be unable to allocate resources toward other behaviors that are essential to survival such as foraging. The temperature change in this experiment was only approximately 2 degrees celsius, therefore showing that a significent change in behavior can occur as the result of a relatively small fluctuation in water temperature, and can be potentially detrimental to the bettas’ quality of life. Along with this, social hierarchies among Betta splendins are formed through aggressive behaviors and fighting. Winners and losers are established in a short, social context, but a more structured, established hierarchy of dominant and submissive individuals eventually occurs as well [Haller: 1988]. If fish are affected by fluctuations in water temperature, this essential aspect of the social structure may also be lost. Overall, aggressive behaviors among males is essential to the functionality of many aspects of the bettas’ lives, and if water temperature is decreased by only marginal amounts, the effects could be detrimental to individuals of the species and their ability to perform certain behaviors.
