Title: Effects of Acid Rain on the Root to Shoot Ratio of the Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to compare the root to shoot ratios of buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum) under two different conditions, one group treated with acid rain and one group treated with regular water. Water and acid rain was applied to the plants everyday for week, except for three days due to time constraints and natural causes. Taking this into consideration, the plants were administered about 25mL water or acid rain each, half receiving acid rain and half receiving regular water. A large amount of liquid was applied the first day of testing because they would not be watered for the next few days. However, after the three-day period of no liquid, the plants were given water or acid rain for the next four days of the week. The plants were kept under stable conditions in the greenhouse during the week. After the seven days elapsed, the buckwheat plants were removed from the greenhouse and the measurements of their roots and shoots were made in the lab. In the lab, the group decided to measure twenty plants from the experimental (acid rain) and twenty plants from the control (water) groups. Each individual root and shoot length and weight were measured and recorded from both groups. 

Introduction:
In this week’s lab we will take measurements of buckwheat plants that were administered acid rain and will compare the root to shoot ratios with buckwheat plants given water instead. Due to time constraints and natural causes, the plants were given a large amount of acid rain and water originally because they would not be watered for the next three days. The plants were then watered for the remaining four days of the week. 
	Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide react with chemicals like water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to form nitric and sulfuric acid. These acidic compounds are known to harm plants. However, this damage does not occur immediately, but gradually. Over time, a plant exposed to acid rain will die. The acidic water alters the pH of the soil, dissolving many of the essential nutrients plants need to grow and flourish. As the pH of the soil decreases, the plants will suffer. 
	In any ecological system, plants and animals must interact with and adapt to each other, known as biotic factors, environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms. Organisms must adapt to abiotic factors such as wind and temperature, non-living stimuli. These two factors can play a key role in reproduction and overall fitness. Resource limitation affects what species are present in a certain area or environment. Resource allocation is a term used for describing a pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. This pattern is sometimes genetically determined, but it is not entirely fixed as there is some room for alternation, in response to variations in the environment. In other words, resource allocation is a fundamental plant response to abiotic or biotic stress in a given environment. Plants under biotic or abiotic stress in the environment typically have larger root to shoot ratios as they try to increase their overall surface area to absorb as many nutrients as possible. 
	In a similar study to the one we will conduct, Thomas El-Mallakh found that the effect of acid rain on root systems, specifically in Scindapsus aureus, is not as severe as many believe. In fact, acid rain, he claims, has little effect at all. In his study, Scindapsus aureus were grown for approximately seven weeks with sulfuric acid and water, lowering the overall pH, similar to the effects of acid rain on the soil. After seven weeks of testing, he concluded that sulfuric acid, similar to acid rain, had no major effects on the roots of the plants. El-Mallakh stated, “The pH of plants in more acidic pH remained unchanged. Some roots prefer a more acidic pH. If this is characteristic is widespread, the effect of acid rain on plant root systems may be less severe than anticipated.” [El-Mallakh: 2014]
	Based off of these conclusions, we hypothesize that the root to shoot ratio of the buckwheat plants treated with acid rain will be larger than the buckwheat plants only provided water. Because of the acid rain being present in the soil, the buckwheat plants will have to increase their roots through resource allocation to obtain as many nutrients as they can. 


Materials and Methods:
Measurements of twenty buckwheat plants that were planted with acid rain and twenty buckwheat plants treated with normal water were made. Specifically, the lengths and weights of the roots and shoots were measured separately. The plants were planted in a total of eight separate pots, four for the acid rain and four for the normal water. Approximately 25mL of acid rain was applied to one half of the pots and the same amount of water was used for the remaining four pots. These plants were given rather large amounts of liquid the first day of testing because due to time constraints and natural causes, the plants were not watered for three days consecutively. The plants were then watered for the next four days of the week. Once the week elapsed, the plants were removed from the greenhouse where they were being kept during the week. In the lab, the group decided to measure twenty plants from the experimental (acid rain) and twenty plants from the control (water) groups. The plants were removed from their respective pots and separated in a large container of water. This was done to separate them from the soil. The plants were then dried with paper towels. The roots from each plant were separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction. Each individual root and shoot length and weight were measured and recorded from both groups.

Results:
Figure 1. Average weight (g) between roots and shoots in buckwheat plants treated with water versus buckwheat plants treated with acid rain. A total of forty plants were measured, twenty per each group. The error bars on both graphs represent standard deviation. A two-sampled T-test was used to calculate the p-value (0.338). The data is not significant as the p-value is larger than 0.05. 

Figure 2. Average height (mm) between roots and shoots in buckwheat plants treated with water versus buckwheat plants treated with acid rain. A total of forty plants were measured, twenty per each group. The error bars on both graphs represent standard deviation. A two-sampled t-test was used to calculate the p-value (0.665). The data is not significant as the p-value is larger than 0.05. 

Discussion:
In the end, our calculated p-values of 0.338 for the weights and 0.665 for the lengths were not significant enough to support our original hypothesis. As originally hypothesized, we believed that there would be a significant difference in root to shoot ratio between buckwheat plants treated with water versus acid rain. However, the null hypothesis that the root to shoot ratio would not be affected between buckwheat plants in both acid rain and water was supported. There was not much significant difference between the two groups as originally predicted. This follows what El-Mallakh concluded in his study, that there should be little to no difference in root or shoot length. 
	One reason why we could have received inaccurate data could have been due to the fact that no liquid was given to the plants for three days consecutively. As a result, this could have led to the plants becoming unhealthy and not at their full potential. Another reason that could have led to the data we received was that maybe a larger amount of acid rain should have been applied to the experimental group. Maybe more acid rain could have led to the plants having to allocate more as the rain absorbs many of the nutrients found in the soil. Lastly, maybe a higher concentration of acid could have been used to lead to better results. The higher the concentration of the acid in the rain, the lower the pH of the soil. We would expect to see a greater difference between both groups if these points were administered.
