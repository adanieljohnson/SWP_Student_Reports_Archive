Title: Effects of Protein Kinase A Inhibitor, Curcumin, and Activator, dibutryl cAMP, on Phototaxis in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold, that has similar cell signaling processes to humans. It can be a useful model organism, because it behaves as a single, giant cell; it is easy to study its properties without the need of a microscope. Our experiment sought to test the effects of Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor on the cAMP mediated pathway and phototaxis in the slime mold. It was hypothesized that the PKA activator would cause an increase in the growth rate of Physarum polycephalum while the PKA inhibitor would cause a decrease in the growth rate. Our results supported our hypothesis by showing that the sample plates with activator added had more average growth than sample plates with inhibitor added and control plates. This experiment shows that the PKA activator, dibutryl cAMP, is important in speeding the cAMP mediated pathway. Experiments of this kind are useful because of the similarities Physarum shares with human biological processes. 

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways help cells respond to both internal and external stimuli, or environments. Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that can be a useful organism when studying cell signaling. It behaves as one single, giant cell, which allows for observation of cellular processes without the need of a microscope. A common behavior of Physarum polycephalum is phototaxis, where the slime mold will move away, negative phototaxis, or toward, positive phototaxis, light [Johnson: 2018]. In a study focusing on light intensity, light stimulation alone was shown to trigger phototactic movement [Hato, Ueda, Kurihara, & Kobatake, 1976)]. One of the major G-protein signaling pathway used by Physarum is the cAMP mediated pathway. This pathway uses cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as its second messenger; it diffuses through the cell and can bind to other substrates. One such substrate is Protein Kinase A (PKA), which can activate or inactivate many cell processes [Johnson: 2018]. The cAMP mediated signaling pathway is important in phototaxis of Physarum polycephalum. This experiment examined the effects of PKA inhibitor and activator on the phototactic behavior of Physarum. It was hypothesized that Physarum treated with PKA inhibitor Curcumin would show a decreased growth rate and an inhibited phototactic response compared to a control group and a second group treated with PKA activator. It was expected that the group with PKA activator would show the most growth. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained eighteen Potato-agar (PDA) plates and a Physarum stock plate. We also obtained a spatula, Protein Kinase A (PKA) activator (dibutryl cAMP), and PKA inhibitor (Curcumin). We performed dilutions to get 90 mL of both the activator and inhibitor to use for the experiment. Next, we sterilized the spatula using ethanol and cut 1 cm squares out of each PDA plate. We then soaked six plates in the activator solution and six plates in the inhibitor solution. The remaining six plates were our control and were left alone. We waited ten minutes for the solutions to absorb into the PDA plates. After waiting ten minutes, we sterilized the spatula and cut 1 cm Physarum squares from our stock plate and placed one square in each of our eighteen PDA plates. Next, we wrapped each plate in foil and labelled them as follows: 3 activator with light, 3 activator without light, 3 inhibitor with light, 3 inhibitor without light, 3 control with light, and 3 control without light. In “with light” samples, a small hole was cut into the foil to allow light into the plate. We placed the samples labelled “no light” in a dark drawer and the samples labelled “with light” in a light box. We waited 24 hours before coming back to check and measure the growth of Physarum in each sample. We did a one-way ANOVA test to see if our results were statistically significant. 

Results:
The sample plates with an added Protein Kinase A inhibitor, Curcumin, showed less growth than both the control sample plates and the sample plates with an added Protein Kinase A activator. By doing a one-way ANOVA test, we determined that our results were significantly different (group p value of 0.0027), thus supporting our hypothesis. However, looking within groups, our samples appeared to have little difference in growth between the plates in light environments and plates in dark environment. The inhibitor, activator, and control plates with and without light showed similar growth averages. The results support our hypothesis in that the PKA activator increased growth, while the PKA inhibitor decreased growth. However, our hypothesis needs further testing, because there was no change in the growth of samples in light and in dark environments.

Discussion:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that is a good model organism for studying signaling pathways. A common behavior of the slime mold is phototaxis, which is that the organism moves away from light [Hato et al., 1976)]. One of the signaling pathways it uses is the cAMP mediated pathway, important in phototaxis, which uses cAMP as a second messenger to activate PKA [Johnson: 2018]. It was hypothesized that Physarum would show decreased growth and inhibited phototactic activity when a PKA inhibitor was introduced. Also, it was thought that Physarum would show an increase in growth with an added PKA activator, so that causation of PKA in Physarum growth could be determined. Our results supported our hypothesis, because the plates treated with PKA inhibitor had less growth than the plates treated with PKA activator and the control plates. However, the samples with light and without light showed similar measurements in each group. Our hypothesis should be retested to determine the effect of Protein Kinase A activator and inhibitor on phototaxis, because our experiment did not lend any conclusive results on the effect in light and dark environments. Studies of this kind are important, because Physarum polycephalum signaling pathways is similar to that of humans, so studying this slime mold could help researchers gain insight into human bodily functions.

Samples with Protein Kinase A activator added show farther growth from the original slime mold location while samples with Protein Kinase A inhibitor added show little or no growth from the original slime mold location. 3 plates for each treatment group were exposed to either a dark environment or light environment, and growth was measured after 24 hours. Each bar is the average growth rate between 3 plates; error bars are +1 s.e.*************************************************************************
