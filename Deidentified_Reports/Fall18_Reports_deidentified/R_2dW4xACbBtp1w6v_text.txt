Title: Energy Allocation in Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
Overall, the energy allocation of buckwheat in warmer environments is worse off than the allocation of plants in cooler conditions because temperature plays a vital role in the longevity of a plant. Temperature makes all the difference, and most times the plant grows at a better rate when temperature is taken into consideration. Miracle Grow was also an important part of the process because the growth could have also been altered due to the substances used.

Introduction:
Today we will be measuring buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) that has been growing in two polar opposite environments. One environment has a temperature of 28⁰ C and the other, 20⁰ C. The energy allocation of the samples can be shown through the root-shoot values of each plant because of a phenotypical change. If the plants are placed in a cooler environment, then the root to shoot values will be higher than those in a warmer environment. Higher temperature, however, could be dangerous because extreme heat will slow growth, and increase the amount of moisture lost [Illinois.edu].

Materials and Method:
First there will be thirty-six seeds collected. Then we will get four black planters to place soil in. Following this, we will place soil into each black planter and poke nine evenly spaced holes into the soil. Then, we will put 200Ml of water into each planter, followed by pouring 100 Ml of Miracle Grow into each planter. Following this, each hole will be covered again with soil. Once each seed has been planted, two of the four black planters will be placed in a larger tray and taken to the greenhouse. The other two black planters will be placed in another larger sized tray and will be placed close to the lab window for sunlight. Each individual black planter had labels made entitling the TA name, and peer names. We will return every day for two weeks and add 100 Ml of water to each planter. After the two weeks we will remove each plant and place them into their respective group.

Results:
The average r:s ratio for length was 0.472 +/- SD, which was not significently different from the r:s ratio in warmer environments which was 0.567 +/- SD (tstat = 1.08, d.f.= 20, p = 0.146). The average r:s ratio for weight in cold temperature was 0.128 +/- SD, which was similar to the average of r:s weight of buckwheat in warm temperatures 0.118 +/- SD (tstat = 0.63, d.f. = 20,
p = 0.268). The plants grown in warmer temperatures had red coloring near their roots.

Discussion:
Overall the results did not show significent differences between length in cold and warm temperatures. This is seen in graph one. This can be due to a low difference between the temperatures of both environments. The 8o C in room temperature difference can also explain the small difference in r:s weight as well (graph two). Buckwheat tends to live in conditions from 10o C to 21o C. If another experiment is conducted, the temperatures should be a larger focus. Because the data barely differed, the null hypothesis was accepted, which means our hypothesis was rejected. Another difference is the number of plants that survived outside. There were only ten available for the warmer climate, and twelve for the cooler climate.
