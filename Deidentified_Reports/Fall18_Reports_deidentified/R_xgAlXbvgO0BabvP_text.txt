Title: Effect of Low and High pH on the Photosynthetic Rate of Chloroplast in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica

Abstract:
pH is an environment condition that can impact the process of photosynthesis in plants. Drastic changes in environmental pH (acidic or basic) can cause denaturing of proteins that are important in many processes, including the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. With these changes occurs, photosynthetic rates of plants can be affected. In this experiment, the effect of both acidic and basic pH on photosynthetic rates in chloroplasts from Brassica oleracea var. sabellica is tested. We predicted that the photosynthetic rate of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would decrease when placed in acidic or basic conditions and compared to the optimal pH condition for photosynthesis (7). Using the DCIP electron acceptor (Hill’s reaction in the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis) as a color indicator, absorbance of the samples can be measured in a spectrophotometer to determine changes in the rate of photosynthesis between the different pH solutions. From the data collected, the chloroplasts in the different pH conditions showed no significant difference in photosynthetic rate. This shows that when put in these pH conditions, photosynthetic rate of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica will not be affected.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a cellular metabolic process used by plants to capture light energy and store the energy for use. This energy is stored in the form of covalent bonds, oxidation-reduction potential, and electrical gradients across the lipid bilayers, which will later be broken down through processes of glycolysis and respiration in order for plants to use the energy [Johnson: 2018].  The process of photosynthesis follows the basic format of this equation: 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 12 H2O (water) ---------------&gt; C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 H2O (water) + 6 O2 (molecular oxygen). The main point to understand is that light energy is being transformed into chemical energy (glucose). Within the process of photosynthesis, there are two stages, light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. When looking to measure the rate of photosynthesis the light-dependent reactions can be used [Johnson: 2018].
The light dependent reactions involve two stages: photosystem I and photosystem II. Within this part of photosynthesis, light photons are absorbed and used to excite electrons. By exciting electrons, the cleavage of water is triggered, which also causes a photon gradient to generate ATP. This ATP will be used to create the glucose molecules produced later in the light-independent reactions. To measure these electron transfer reactions in the chloroplasts (rate of photosynthesis) ATP production, NADP+ reduction, or reduction of plastiquinone could be used, but these are difficult to measure. An easier reaction of electron acceptors can be used (Hill’s reaction) instead of NADP+ acceptor reaction. Specifically, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol is used as the alternate acceptor. Normally, this electron transfer follows the Hill’s reaction (2H2O + 2A -&gt; 2AH2 + O2). When DCIP goes through this reaction, the color of the molecule goes from dark blue to colorless (at 600 nm) due to the reduction of DCIP to DCIPH2. This allows for electron transfer to be easily measured through absorbance, specifically if a higher absorbance is measured, then less electron transfer is occurring (less photosynthesis) [Johnson: 2018].
pH is an environmental condition that plants can come in contact with and be affected by. Normally plants maximally go through photosynthesis at a pH around 7-8 due to acidic and basic conditions inhibiting photosynthesis [Heber: 1976]. Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, or more commonly known as kale, is a plant that has a high photosynthetic rate in best conditions, similar to spinach (light, normal water, etc.) [Erwin: 2017]. Considering the use of kale as a source of chloroplasts, and the measurement of photosynthetic rate through the reduction of DCIP, the effects of pH environmental change will be tested on the photosynthetic rate change of kale. With this in mind, we believe that if Brassica oleracea var. sabellica is placed into either acidic or basic environments, then the photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts will decrease compared to a neutral pH due to the possible inhibition from high and low pH. 


Materials and Methods:
In conducting this experiment, first chloroplasts had to be abstracted from the kale leaves. After grinding 3 kale leaves, without the main veins, in a cold mortar and pestle with 20 mL grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8) and straining the paste made, the liquid was transferred to a centrifuge tube and spun at 200x G (1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4°C. After the mixture spun, the liquid portion was put in to a new tube and spun at 1,000x G (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4°C. This time with the centrifuge was finished, the liquid was removed, and 15 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet left at the bottom of the second tube. This liquid was then mixed and separated into three tubes, each of which was given 5 mL of a different pH buffer solution (4, 10, and distilled water). Each of these tubes were put into the centrifuged and spun again at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. After finishing the last centrifuge, the liquid was poured out of each and the pellet were resuspended in 3 mL of grinding buffer and mixed.
	After preparing the chloroplasts, the 12 test tubes were labeled: Blank, 1-3 (pH 4), 4-6 (pH 7), 7-9 (pH 10), 10 (negative control for pH 4), and 11 (negative control for pH 10). Equal variance was used in the sample size; each of the testing categories (pH 4, 7, and 10) had three replicates. 2 mL of DCIP (130 mM) was added to all test tubes except the blank, distilled water was added to all test tubes (6 mL except water which had 8 mL), and 2 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 8.5) was added to all test tubes. Chloroplasts were added to the test tubes according the pH, tubes 4-6 received pH 4 chloroplasts, tubes 1-3 and blank received pH 7 chloroplasts, tubes 7-9 received pH 10 chloroplast, and 10-11 received no chloroplasts due to being negative controls. Each of these replicates and controls were then measured for absorbance in a spectrophotometer (600 nm) to get an initial reading. After the initial reading, all the samples were place under a grow light and re-read three times after 30-minute increments. After the results were recorded, a graph showing the average difference in absorbance from initial to 30 minutes was created to compare photosynthetic rate difference between pH 4 and pH 7, and pH 10 and pH 7. Two two-sample one-tailed t-test were completed to find significant difference between the pH 7 and pH 4, and pH 7 and pH 10.

Results:
After measuring the absorbances of the different pH/chloroplast solutions after 30 minutes of exposure to light, there was no difference found between the pH 4 and pH 7 solution and the pH 10 and pH 7 solution through absorbance. When comparing the pH 4 and pH 10 solutions to the pH 7 solution, a similar absorbance change (30-minute absorbance-initial absorbance) was found. The average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 7 solution after 30 minutes was -0.004666666667±0.00503322 [Figure 1]. The average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in pH 4 after 30 minutes was -0.01466666667±0.0140119 [Figure 1]. Lastly, the average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 10 solution after 30 minutes was -0.001333333333±0.00057735 [Figure 1]. Once a two sample one tailed t-test was completed, the average difference in absorbance in chloroplasts placed in pH 4 was not statistically significant from the average difference in absorbance in chloroplasts placed in pH 7 (t-stat=1.16335, df=4, P-value=0.154677). When a two sample one tailed t-test was completed for the difference in absorbance of the chloroplasts placed in pH 10 and pH 7, no statistical significance was found (t-stat= 1.139606, df=4, P-value= 0.15903).

Discussion:
Looking at the results of the average absorbance differences between both the acidic (4) and basic (10) solutions and the neutral/optimal pH (7), we can conclude that our results do not support our hypothesis that the photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts will decrease when put into acidic and basic conditions compared to a neutral pH. This was concluded by two two-sample one-tailed t-test that were completed when comparing pH 4 to pH 7 (P-value= 0.154677) and comparing pH 10 to pH 7 (P-value= 0.087475). Both of these values showed the there was no statistical significance in the average absorbance change after 30 minutes. Since the absorbance ultimately did not show large another change between these two comparisons, it can be said that there was no photosynthetic rate difference between the acid and basic conditions and the optimal condition (Figure 1). 
Usually when pH is changed from the optimal condition to more acidic or basic conditions, photosynthetic rates are shown to drop [Heber: 1976]. A possible reason that this did not occur in this experiment could be due to the pH affecting the DCIP reaction. DCIP is a chemical that acts as an alternate electron acceptor in this experiment. This is due to DCIP going through a reduction to DCIPH2 turning the solution colorless, while the normal DCIP turns the solution blue [Dean: 2006]. When mixed with different pH values, DCIP can go through color change due acidic pH donating H+ (to DCIP) and basic pH can accept H+ (from DCIPH2) [Obata:1982]. This could automatically affect the color change in the sample if contaminated with these pHs.To fully understand if this is the result of DCIP, a follow-up experiment could be run looking at a different electron excerptor, running the experiment with more acidic or basic conditions or even running the centrifuge one more time to make sure the pH is really mixed into the chloroplasts to risk less contamination. 
Environmental pH conditions are becoming a problem as the plant environment is exposed to runoff waste and other pH changing factors. Seeing how the process of photosynthesis is impacted by these changes in environmental conditions is important to understand in order to stop harmful agents from decreasing or stopping photosynthesis. This could ultimately lead to a dangerous situation for all organisms that rely on this process to survive. Looking at this result of pH change we can see that small differences to the optimal pH do not have much effect on the photosynthetic rate according to the light dependent reactions, but this is only one aspect of photosynthesis and only one environmental condition. With this experiment, the extent in which pH environmental change can have no effect on photosynthesis before it inhibits the process is only touched on but is a good starting point of looking at how environmental changes will affect important processes if not controlled.
