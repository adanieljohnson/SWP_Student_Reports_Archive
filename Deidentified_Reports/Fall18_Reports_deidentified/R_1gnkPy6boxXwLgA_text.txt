Title: The effects of Azadiracthin in Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
Abstract
The effects of azadirachtin in Manduca Sexta were being studied over the course of  2 weeks before their commitment pulse. Keeping the caterpillars from reaching the commitment pulse and pupating. The experiment was to block the 20E (ecdysterone)and keep them as larva. We observed that moulting the food was not the answer. We predicted that the azadirachtin would stop the commitment process. Our controll group t value was greater than our experimental group’s p value. Our hypothesis was not supported by this experiment because 6 of the 8 caterpillars reached the commitment pulse and 5 pupated. 


Introduction:
Introduction  
For this experiment, we looked at the Manduca Sexta. We watched the growth of the Manduca over 2 weeks. Using a blocker either JH or azadirachtin which are hormones, should block the growth of the caterpillar and keep them from reaching their commitment pulse and pupating. 
20E regulates timing of molting during insect development. If 20E is blocked, this could keep the Manduca Sexta from pupating and becoming adult moths. In a study on Locusta Migratoria they put azadirachtin in neem trees which the Locusta eat. The study showed using moult inhibition is due to an interference with the endoctrine system rather than to altered feeding bahviour [K.-P. Seiber,H.Rembold 1983] Our project allowed us to use the blocker hormone and try to keep the pests from moulting into adult moths. Keeping them larva helps tobacco farmers keep their tobacco from being destroyed. Will the hormones blocker keep the pesticides from reaching pupation? Azadirachtin is the blocker we were given. We hypothesis that azadirachtin would block the Manduca Sexta from reaching its commitment pulse. 


Materials and Method:
Over the course of 2 weeks, we monitored the growth of 8 caterpillars grouped into 4 controllled and 4 experimental. We separated the replicates into two containers – one for controll and one for experimental – with a separate compartment for each caterpillar. The experimental caterpillars were given 6 drops of the blocker hormone azadirachtin, and 10 grams of food daily. We gave our controll group 6 drops of distilled water in 10 grams of food daily. Each day we weighed each separate caterpillar with a scale and in grams and measured them in millimeters. We also recorded the amount of food and poop left in each compartment before the caterpillars were weighed. The caterpillars  were stored in an incubator over-night and food in the refrigerator. Data recorded in google sheets and a two-tailed T-test was run on the weight to compare the controll versus the experimental group.  


Results:
The mean of the controll caterpillars was 1.0175g and the mean of the experimental caterpillars were -1.4325g. The standard deviation for the controll group was 1.18 and the Standard deviation for the experimental group was 0.36. The mean of the weight controll group was positive while the mean of the experimental was negative. Statistically the controll group was not off by a lot from the experimental group (t_stat=3.94, d.f.=6. P=0.003). Our caterpillars pupated except for the 2 in the experimental. One of the them died while in the middle of pupating. All of our controll pupated within a couple of days into our experiment. Our experimental group pupated and pupated at a faster rate than anticipated. Both groups pupated but the controll group grew while the experimental stayed or lessened in size and managed to pupate anyway. 


Discussion:
In the end of the experimental, our hypothesis was not supported. We stated, the experimental group would not pupate if given 6 drops of food in 10 grams. We were proven wrong because 2 of our 4 caterpillars reached commitment pulse and/or pupated. We observed that there was a difference between the two groups in length and weight. Our t value and p value were significently different. The experimental were different from the controll because the experimental grew at a slower pace than the controll group. In a study on Rhodnius prolixus larvae, they conducted an experiment where Trypanosoma cruzi were found inside the stomach and azadirachtin blocked the development of protozoan intermediate forms.[M.R. Cortez et al.2012] This could be why these insects live the life they live because even when 20E is blocked they can still reach commitment pulse. Not to say this did not slow down the process of them becoming moths. This can suggests that people could keep these pests as larva and away from tobacco farms.
