Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Chemotactic cAMP and PKA Signaling Pathways in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Chemotaxis is a cellular process that involves the movement of a cell or an organism (or part of one) in a direction corresponding to increasing or decreasing concentrations of a particular chemical(s). In this experiment, attempting to discover how different chemicals such as caffeine and an dibutyryl-cAMP affect the rate of chemotaxis in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we hypothesized that the highest rate of chemotaxis would occur in the caffeine-treated samples. The procedure for this experiment involved the creation of 1x solutions of diluted caffeine and Protein Kinase A activator dibutryl-cAMP, soaking 2% agar water petri plates with the solutions, and quantifying the different chemotactic rates based on millimeters traveled from the starting point after 24 hours. The results of the experiment showed statistically-insignificent, yet stark differences in the extent of chemotactic rates (physical distance traveled over time) of the caffeine-treated replicate samples, supporting our hypothesis, but not allowing us to reject the null hypothesis for this experiment. Our results also shed light onto the web of relationships between Adenylyl Cyclase, Adenosine Triphosphate, the second messenger cAMP, Protein Kinase A, dibutryl-cAMP, and the rate of chemotaxis. 


Introduction:
Chemoreception is an integral part of the organismal ability to assess and adequately respond to its ever-changing environment. From single-celled bacteria to multi-cellular Mammalia, chemoreception is universally utilized to respond to chemical stimuli in the environment and produce an appropriate physiological response. This is important for many microorganisms to find sustenance by moving towards the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from toxins or poisons. The term “Chemotaxis” describes the most primitive form of chemoreception in which motile bacteria or protozoa, for example, move towards or further away from a chemical stimulus [Ueda: 1975]. On the other hand, in higher vertebrates, receptor cells in olfactory and taste organ systems facilitate chemoreception, the information introduced by the external chemical stimuli transduced into nerve impulses and transmitted to the brain. Lacking a nervous system, multinuclear amoeboid cells undergo chemotaxis, sensing and responding to their environments via intracellular signal transduction pathways. One of those pathways is the G-protein coupled receptor pathway that uses the second messenger, cyclic- AMP, as a second messenger. In this pathway, an extracellular chemical “signal” activates a G-protein, which then activates adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase converts Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic-AMP (cAMP), which then passively diffuses throughout the cell and binds enzymes such as protein kinase A (PKA). PKA in turn phosphorylates many other enzymes initiating a protein kinase cascade that terminates in the phosphorylation of glycogen and facilitates glucose metabolism, providing the supply of energy for motility. It is imperative to understand the method behind environmental chemical stimuli’s ability to alter chemotaxis via interactions with the cAMP-mediated pathway because primarily, previous research has been inconclusive and secondly, new findings may shed light upon adenylate cyclase’s (found in the cellular membrane and activated by cAMP) involvement in the intricate and still-puzzling communication system of the slime mold [Smith: 1978]. With experimental objective of achieving an understanding the machinery behind the cAMP-mediated pathway, the roles of cAMP and PKA, and all of their impacts on chemotactic rate, we specifically focused on caffeine’s either inhibitory or promoting effects on the extent of taxis in Physarum polycephalum, our model organism. Physarum polycephalum was selected as the model organism not only due to convenience of culture and its cell growth having quantifiable motile response, but also due to the fact that its observable behavior can be analyzed and quantified without the presence of confounding variables of population and intercellular interaction effects [Smith: 1978]. We hypothesized that the greatest significent difference in the extent of chemotaxis (as measured in the greatest rate of growth in millimeters per hour by the organism) would occur in an experimental group in which agar plates were saturated with caffeine solution. 


Materials and Method:
The general plan for this experiment was to use 3 agar plates without caffeine solution, but with food (oatmeal inserted into an incision in the agar layer) as controlls, 1 plate with neither caffeine, nor food, nor PKA as the negative controll, 3 plates with caffeine and food as the first experimental treatment group, and 3 plates with dibutyryl-cAMP and food as the second experimental treatment group. 

Preparing the Plates 

For this part, we used 10, 2% agar petri plates with lids and a black sharpie. For this preparatory stage of the experiment, we took the 10, 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water, labeling our names and dates on the backs with black sharpie. On the other side, we drew 1cm by 1cm black square outlines. On 3 of the plates, we wrote “Caffeine” in the space  “+ ___”. On another 3 plates, we wrote “Control.” These 6 plates were turned over, lid facing upwards. We labeled an additional 3 plates “dibutyryl-cAMP” in the space “+___”. Three plates with added food, but no treatment solutions added was incorporated as a controll. On the last plate, we wrote “Negative,” to indicate that it would be used as our negative controll. 

Applying the Treatments

In this stage, we used 20x caffeine solution, 20x Dibutryl-cAMP (dcAMP), distilled water, and the previously prepared agar plates. For the 3 caffeine plates, we diluted 20x caffeine solution to 1x via dilution in 100Ml of distilled water, and added 10Ml to each of the 3 plates. The caffeine solution was allowed to soak into the agar for 10 minutes, then all accessory liquid was removed. For each of the 3 “dibutyryl-cAMP” plates, we applied 10 Ml of 1x dcAMP after diluting its 20x antecedent in 100Ml of distilled water, as well. The 1x solution was allowed to soak into the agar for 10 minutes, then all excess liquid was removed. 

Inserting the Physarum polycephalum

In this final portion of the experimental procedure, we used a spatula, a Bunsen burner, ethanol solution, the Physarum polycephalum stock plate, the previously prepared petri plates, and foil. We sterilized a spatula with the use of a Bunsen burner, allowed it cool, and then began to cut out 1cm by 1cm squares out of the agar of the 6 water agar plates (the two treatment groups). The blocks of agar were removed and the spatula was returned to an ethanol solution for disinfection and agar removal. Next, we once again flamed and cooled the spatula and proceeded to extract 6, 1cm by 1cm cubes from the Physarum polycephalum- infested plate. Using sterile forceps, we inserted one Polycephalum slab into each excised cubical space for the 6 plates in the two treatment groups, re-sterilizing the forceps and spatula between treatment groups to avoid cross-contamination. We transferred 6 pre-cut blocks of Physarum culture from the stock plate to the center of our 6 test plates (and labeled the squares “Start Point” on the other side of the plate). Each lid of each plate was taped down to hold it in place and all plates were entirely wrapped in foil, then placed into a dark drawer overnight (18-24hrs). The statistical significance of our results was measured via a two-tailed t_test, comparing the chemotactic growth (in centimeters) means of the treatment groups (caffeine and PKA) to the controll group mean. We chose the two-tailed t_test because it would allow us to determine whether a group's observed difference in average chemotactic growth was statistically significent.


Results:
In order to find out whether one of the treatments (caffeine or dibutyryl-cAMP) negatively or positively affected chemotaxis, we compared average growth rates of Physarum polycephalum in each experimental group against those of the controll samples after allowing chemotaxis to take place for approximately 24 hours in 2% water agar petri plates. We found that in comparison to the dcAMP treated group, the caffeine treated group showed a greater rate of growth, with caffeine-treated Polycephalum samples sprawling out faster by an average of 0.67 millimeters/hour than the dcAMP samples and 0.3473 millimeters/hour faster than the controlls after 24 hours (see Fig. 1). When compared against the controll samples, the results of the growth rate of the caffeine-treated samples were observably greater, yet did not prove to be statistically significent (p_value: 0.1518 &gt; 0.05, t-value: 1.767, d.f. = 4). Even though the dcAMP-treated group showed less chemotactic growth rate on average than both the caffeine-treated group and the controll group, with an average growth of 10.5mm over 24 hours (growth rate = 0.4375mm/hr) between all 3 of its samples (p_value: 0.1549, t-value: 1.752, d.f. = 4), these results were still statistically insignificent due to a p_value &gt; 0.05. The sample with no food, no caffeine, and no dcAMP (negative controll) showed no signs of quantifiable growth whatsoever. Figure 1 shows a bar graph comparing the average growth rates (and thus, quantifies rate of chemotaxis) of all experimental groups as a function of growth in millimeters over a time span of 24 hours.  


Discussion:
Our hypothesis included the caffeine-treated samples undergoing chemotaxis towards a source of food (oatmeal grains) at a greater rate than all the other samples. We initially arrived at this hypothesis based on the initial thought process that caffeine acts as a central nervous system stimulant in human consumption. Even after experimentation, to tell whether the attractants were themselves nutrients or acted in some other manner to promote chemotaxis was not possible. 
While our results supported our hypothesis in that the caffeine-treated samples traveled at the highest rate towards the food in the allotted time frame, our obtained data proved to be statistically insignificent and did not allow us to reject the null hypothesis for this experiment. An observed inconsistency in our results was the high degree of deviation from the mean in the rate of growth of our 3 replicate controll samples. The presence of an outsider in this group is likely to have skewed our treatment group data and prevented us from obtaining p_values &lt; 0.05 for both the caffeine and dcAMP treatment groups. Furthermore, according to one source, we found that caffeine has been known to block the cAMP-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase, which functions to convert ATP to cAMP [Brenner: 1984]. Knowing that cAMP is needed to activate Protein Kinase A and kick off the kinase cascade of glucose metabolism responsible for the movement of the organism, our data can be interpreted to reveal that cAMP levels are negatively correlated to the rate of chemotactic motility, the same applying to the extent of activation of PKA enzymes (the hypersensitivity of the PKA enzyme towards dcAMP was not considered during the experimental procedure, thus the relatively low rate of chemotaxis in dcAMP-treated samples does not conclusively prove a negative or positive correlation between dcAMP levels and chemotactic rate). Since caffeine blocks Adenylyl cyclase’s conversion of ATP to cAMP, it would make sense that the Physarum polycephalum exhibits higher rates of chemotaxis when it is already low on ATP and high in intracellular cAMP concentrations, in turn increasing its levels of motility to reach a new food source and increase its chances of obtaining more metabolic energy reserves (ATP) through the consumption of food. However, according to a different source, caffeine has also been shown to increase intracellular cAMP levels by inhibiting phosphodiesterase enzymes. Higher levels of cAMP linked to increases in chemotactic motility would oppose the previously stated model – however, a plausible explanation for this is the release of chemotactic-powering fuels like free fatty acids and glycerol via caffeine’s properties of promoting lipolysis [Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Military Nutrition Research: 2001]. If further study were possible, conducting a similar experiment (still quantifying chemotaxis) with the addition of ATP-enriched solution as another treatment group would be of interest, as it would shed light on the individual importance of Adenylyl cyclase functioning on the protein kinase cascade responsible for chemotaxis in Physarum polycephalum.
