Title: Effect of Sevin, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on muscle tetany

Abstract:
Acetylcholine is a critical neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction and relies on acetylcholinesterase to unbind it from postsynaptic receptors. Using frog legs as test subjects, various frequencies of stimulus were used to observe when the muscles would reach tetany under normal circumstances compared to when a 2% Sevin solution (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) was administered to the muscle. We hypothesized that the legs receiving the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor would reach tetany at a lower stimulus frequency. We observed that two of the three treated legs reached tetany at a lower frequency than the control legs, however because our data was not statistically significant we can not say these results did not happen due to chance. More precise laboratory techniques need to be employed to gain significant data regarding the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on tetany. 


Introduction:
Acetylcholine (ACh) is the most prominent neurotransmitter involved at the neuromuscular junction, where the motor neuron attaches to the muscle. ACh binds to receptors on the postsynaptic junction, which in turn depolarizes the membrane of the postsynaptic cell, generating an action potential in the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. Action potentials will continue to be sent until the ACh has been unbound from the ACh receptors, resulting in the contraction of a muscle. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is involved in turning the unbinding of ACh by rapid hydrolysis of the ACh which allows for the postsynaptic cell membrane to repolarize, ending the stimulation of action potentials. [Colovic: 2013]. AChE inhibitors do not allow for the breakdown of ACh from the postsynaptic receptors, which increases the level and the duration of the action potential being sent and subsequent muscle contraction [Colovic: 2013]. Muscle tetany occurs due to rapid electrical stimulation of the neuromuscular junction at frequencies ranging from 20-50 Hz [Doucet: 2012]. During muscle tetany, the muscle no longer has time to relax and contract in between successive action potentials, which results in one long lasting contraction leading to muscle fatigue. The present study will be observing the effect of a 2% Sevin solution (an AChE inhibitor) on muscle tetany. The study will address the threshold at which tetany is reached, and how an AChE inhibitor can effect that threshold. It is predicted that if a 2% Sevin solution (an AChE inhibitor) is administered, then the threshold frequency at which tetany is observed will be lower. 

Materials and Methods:
We started by obtaining three fresh frog legs of similar size. We skinned the legs, separated the inner thigh muscles, revealed the sciatic nerve, and freed the sciatic nerve from the connective tissue. We attached the frog leg to the voltage hook by tying the leg at a 90 degree angle, then pinned the leg down to keep it steady. We put the sciatic nerve over the stimulus probes. We opened the labscribe program and set the amplitude to .5 V, number of pulses to 0, pulse width to 5 ms, and start with the pulse frequency at 2 Hz. We recorded each trial for a few seconds before ending the data collecting and adjusting the stimulus. The process was repeated at 4 Hz, 5 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 25 Hz, and 50 Hz. We used the frog ringer solution as needed to keep the legs moist. We tested all legs before administering the 2% Sevin solution. For each leg .1 mL of solution was used. We administered the 2% Sevin, injecting a small amount of the solution at various points of the muscle. We repeated testing on each leg after injecting each with the 2% Sevin. We used a paired t-test to analyze our data. 


Results:
Both the control and treatment groups demonstrated a similar pattern of decreased time between contractions as the frequency of stimulus was increased. The voltage readings were highly variable and no real trends were present for either test group. All control group legs reached tetany at 20 Hz as well as one of the treated legs. The other two treatment legs reached tetany at 10 Hz, a slightly lower threshold (figure 1). The period of contraction was almost identical between the control and treatment groups at stimulus frequencies of 2 Hz, 4 Hz, and 5 Hz. At 10 Hz, the first point of tetany for the treatment group, the average period for the control group was .082 (+/- .013) seconds while the average period for the treatment group was .03 (+/- .052) (t-stat= 1.632, df= 2, P= 0.244). Overall the average periods were very similar between the two data sets (t-stat= 0.831, df= 6, P= 0.438) (figure 2). 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that a the use of a  2% Sevin solution (an AChE inhibitor) will lead to a lower threshold frequency at which tetany is observed will be lower was neither proven nor disproven. We were not able to gather statistically significant data, as out P-Value was much greater than our alpha value. Knowing that AChE inhibitors will not allow for the ACh to unbind from the postsynaptic receptors we hoped to observe that the treated muscle would demonstrate a significant response to treatment [Colovic: 2013]. Even with our data being insignificant, it can still be observed that for the majority of our test subjects, the AChE inhibitor had a marked effect on tetany occuring at a lower frequency, as observed at the 10 Hz stimulus frequency. However because we can not say for certain the results were not due to chance no true conclusions can be made. Additionally, all legs posted very similar data at all frequencies except 10 Hz, which could demonstrate the possibility that AChE inhibitors do not have a significant effect on muscle tetany. The next step would be improved laboratory technique that would ideally improve statistical significance. One problem could be that more legs would be needed to create a larger data pool that would ideally eliminate outliers and give more statistically significant data. Another problem could have been that when laying the sciatic nerve over the stimulus sensor, it was done poorly and the stimulus received by the sciatic nerve was not an accurate representation of the intended frequency stimulus. A third issue that could have affected our data is that when stimulating a muscle by non-physiological means, the efficiency of the contraction will and the development of muscle fatigue occur differently than they would if the muscle were contracted naturally [Doucet: 2012]. Further experimentation would be focused on gaining statistically significant data in hopes of determining whether AChE inhibitors have an effect on muscle tetany or not. Gathering statistically significant data could provide insight into treatment or diagnostics of various diseases, such as glaucoma and bladder distention, that are related to AChE activity.
