Title: Temperature and Photosynthetic Activity in Kale

Abstract:
Abstract
The focus of this study is photosynthesis and how photosynthesis captures and stores the energy from the sun. Photosynthesis needs light, green pigment chlorophyll, Mn cations, and an intact phospholipid bilayer to have the necessary functions to efficiently carry out photosynthesis. Our research question for this experiment is how does temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis in kale? To test this research question, we first centrifuged kale leaves and placed the solution in a hot bath, ice bath, and at room temperature. After collecting the data, there was a correlation between temperature and photosynthetic activity. This research can be applied to the fields of agriculture and environmental science.


Introduction:
Introduction
The focus of this study is photosynthesis and how photosynthesis captures and stores the energy from the sun. Photosynthesis needs light, green pigment chlorophyll, Mn cations, and an intact phospholipid bilayer to have the necessary functions to efficiently carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in distinct stages. There is the light dependent reaction, which use absorbed protons of 2 different wavelengths to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH. And there is a light independent reaction, such as the Calvin cycle, which uses the enzyme Rubisco to use ATP and the reducing power of NADPH to combine a 1-Carbon CO2 molecule with a 5-Carbon ribulose phosphate to create glucose. Photosynthesis is a vital, complex system that allows the living world to function the way it does now. This process provides oxygen and glucose [4]. There are many important complexes and organelles that go to make photosynthesis possible, but what is important to our investigation are the factors that can inhibit and promote photosynthesis. Factors such as colored light, pH, and temperature. For this experiment, the main factor that will be focused on is temperature, and how it affects the rate at which electrons are being transported through an electron accepting solution called DCIP. When it becomes reduced, it turns from a blue color to colorless. In higher plants, the temperature and external conditions determine the areas where said plant can inhabit. This simply means that the temperature plays a key role in the survival of plants, and the output of photosynthesis. This can be seen by simply chilling plants that normally reside in warm temperature or by heating plants that normally reside in cooler temperatures [1]. Our research question is how does temperature affect the rate of photosynthesis in kale? Our hypothesis is that when the chloroplasts are exposed to a higher temperature, the higher the photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Method:
Materials and Method
Method: Materials: - Mortar and pestle - 3 leaves of kale - DCIP - Centrifuge - Water Bath - Ice Bath  We gathered a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, we removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized kale leaves. We then threw away the veins and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Then we blotted off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, wipe them dry, then add the kale leaves. Then we added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). We then grinded the kale until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. Then added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed the kale slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Then we made the concentrated chloroplast sample. To do this, centrifuge a kale solution twice for 3 minutes at 200x gravity to obtain the enriched chloroplast sample. Then label and prepare 3 replicates each of "Cold" tubes "Room Temp" tubes and "Hot" tubes, plus 3 "No Chloroplast" tubes, and a 1 "Blank" tube. The test tubes with the variables that we are testing contained our chloroplast solution, DCIP, and the buffer solution. The no chloroplast tubes contained everything except instead of chloroplasts, the solution will just be water. Take time zero absorbances at 620 nm of all tubes before assays start. Place tubes in respective assay conditions: (Cold: ice bucket at 0 degrees Celsius; Room Temp at 20 degrees Celsius: test tube rack; Hot: hot water bath at 95 degrees Celsius). Then measure absorbances after 10, 20, and 30 min. After getting the absorbances, use a 2-sample t_test to compare the different conditions.

Results
The results of this experiment show that the room temperature condition had the highest absorbance of the other two conditions, followed by cold, then hot. The trend from Figure 1 is that when the temperature is altered, the photosynthetic activity is increased. Both the cold and hot temperature yielded absorbances that were similar to one other rather than the opposite, which was unexpected trend. The absorbance of the room temperature was much higher than that of hot and cold conditions, and when a 2-sample t_test was used, the resulting p_value was 0.0056 and 0.0036.

Discussion
Discussion: When looking at the p_values that were received from the two-sample t_test, it is statistically significent that there is a change in the absorbance between room temperature and both conditions. The absorbance is how we are measuring our photosynthetic activity, and with the low absorbance for both the conditions, it suggests that the photosynthetic activity is higher at the temperatures 0 degrees C and 95 degrees C. This is an important finding because the with this knowledge, the notions for more efficient farming techniques and the use of greenhouses for controllled temperatures can help provide a more stable and larger food supply for the world. This would cut down on the hungry that is threatening parts of the world and allow for a more efficient system for growing crops. It is found that there are optimal temperatures that are both low and high for the inevitable seasonal change that takes place in nature, and this can account for the fact that both the hot and cold conditions had significent data rather than just one. This is logical because there are optimal conditions in each season, winter, spring, summer, and fall, that yield the greatest amount of photosynthetic activity [2]. But as the plants stray from these optimal temperatures, there are problems that arise [3]. When this occurs, the rate of photosynthesis will drop or even halt, and the plant can see catastrophic results. This information can be used for environmental issues such as climate change and the warming of the ocean’s waters. From the experiment, there was consistency in our recordings of the absorbance and where we placed our tubes as we waited for the time to check them. If we did this experiment again, the reliability of this experiment would increase if our results were consistent.
