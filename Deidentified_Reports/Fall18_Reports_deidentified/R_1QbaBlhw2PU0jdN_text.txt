Title: Effect of increased sodium in gastrocnemius muscle of a frog 

Abstract:
Sodium is a vital hormone in the process of the muscle contraction of a frog. The opening of sodium channels in the sciatic nerve (located above the gastrocnemius muscle) activates the necessary action potential that floods into the muscle fiber and, through another hormone called calcium, eventually causes muscle contraction in the frog . Here we observe how muscle contractions are affected when the amount of sodium is increased in the frog’s gastrocnemius muscle as opposed to a frog without the added amount of sodium in the gastrocnemius muscle. Our group expected that added sodium would lead to a stronger contraction (measured by volts) in the gastrocnemius muscle, especially compared to the contraction of the unaffected gastrocnemius muscle.  Our data showed that there was not a significant difference between the contraction force of the experimental group (added sodium) and the contraction force of the control group (no added sodium).  This significance suggests that increased levels of sodium in a frog leg, on the whole, does not cause a significantly stronger contraction.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment was to observe the impact of sodium on the contraction force of a frog. Sodium doesn’t act alone; the opening of sodium channels is activated by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal and the binding of acetylcholine to its receptor on the targeted muscle fiber. Without the initial release and binding of acetylcholine and the eventual opening of sodium channels, contractions wouldn’t occur [Johnson:2018]. Contractions are important in the gastrocnemius muscle, located in the frog’s leg, because they enable the frog to jump. Jumping is essential to the frog because this is one of its primary means of escaping potential predators [Bulbert:2015]. This specific experiment specifically studies sodium and its role in facilitating the movement of a frogs’ leg. We gathered three frog legs and stimulated each with and without increased sodium levels in a before-and-after type fashion. We hypothesized that increasing the amount of sodium in a frog’s gastrocnemius muscle will cause a significantly stronger contraction than that of a frog with no increased sodium within the gastrocnemius muscle. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, the control group was the 3 frogs without the added sodium. The experimental group was the 3 frogs with the added sodium. Our dependent variable was contraction, while the independent variable was the amount of sodium. 

First, we gathered three frog legs. We attached the first to our stimulus apparatus, also known as a transducer, and electrically stimulated it the first time without the added sodium (.1 ml in volume). We then, using the interface on the apparatus and our notebooks, recorded the results of the contraction. After this, our group removed the frog leg from the apparatus and injected the added sodium into the first frog leg’s gastrocnemius muscle via a Sharps needle. Our group then reattached the first frog leg to the apparatus and electrically stimulated it again. Using the interface of the apparatus and our notebooks, we then recorded the results of this contraction. Our group repeated these steps again with the other two frog leg gastrocnemius muscles, recording each of their respective results. We then used a one-tailed-T test to determine the statistical significance of the gathered data. 


Results:
We observed that the increased amount of sodium did not always cause stronger contractions [Figure 1] Our obtained p-value, .7037777, is not statistically significant. We also had a t-value of .438608, which told us that while there was some evidence against no significant difference, it was not enough evidence to quantify no significant difference. There is not a statistically significant relationship, in this experiment, between added sodium and contraction force.

Discussion:
The results did not confirm our hypothesis. The addition of the hormone sodium to the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg, on the whole, does not cause significantly stronger contractions. That said, these contractions enable the frog to leap away and escape from potential predators, showcasing how important the opening of sodium channels in the frog’s leg truly is to its survival. Sodium, alongside the hormone calcium, is still important in the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg, even if it isn’t an increased dose.  This also aligns with another study done on the effects of sodium on muscle contraction in humans; in that experiment too, “reduced sodium” caused a drop in contraction force [Clausen, 2003]. This information could be useful if a specific species of frog was ever to become endangered; perhaps they are suffering from a reduced volume of sodium and increasing their sodium intake could enable them to escape predators more efficiently and continue to reproduce.
