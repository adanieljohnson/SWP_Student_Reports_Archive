Title: The Behavior of Varyingly Colored Betta Fish

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. In our experiment, using ethology, we tested whether the color of a betta fish, red or blue, correlates with the aggressiveness of the fish. We assigned the signs of broadside and facing aggression numerical values of 1 through 3. We then recorded the aggressive behavior of the fish, took the median value of the highest trial of aggression, anf then created a box and whisker plot for that fish’s trial.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior. It brings together observational skills from natural history, laboratory method, and insights and theories from ecology. Ethology has been used in the past to help understand the physiological purpose behind the behaviors of silk moths and dogs. The quality of behavioral research is closely associated with a researcher’s knowledge of their animals. This is a product of long periods of patient observations, usually both in the field and the laboratory. To understand a small part of the behavior of fish we watched their responses to a stimulus. We studied the behavior of Betta splendins (betta fish), a common aquarium fish from Asia. We used betta behavior because of their colorful displays in the presence of other members of their species. This colorful display is an example of intraspecific behavior. These displays can be divided into two types: broadside movements and facing movements. Types of broadside movements in order of increasing aggressiveness are: pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail flashing. Other agnostic or aggressive behaviors a betta may perform include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, darting, biting, and nipping an opponent. The fish who did not initiate the aggressive interaction can choose to escalate by showing another agnostic behavior of higher intensity. These betta fish behaviors respond to habituation where after repeated frequent exposure to a male betta separated by a clear screen, they would eventually stop attacking due to the repeated exposure [Peeke: 1970] and bettas even respond to classical conditioning, responding aggressively to light which was shown in previous trials of aggressive interactions between the betta and another fish [Thompson: 1965]. In our experiment, we tested whether the color of a betta fish, red or blue, correlates with the aggressiveness of the fish.

Materials and Method:
We assigned the signs of broadside and facing aggression numerical values of 1 through 3. For broadside: (1) pelvic fin flicking, (2) tail beating, (3) tail flashing. For facing: (1) erect pectoral fin, (2) spreading of gill cover, (3) protruding the bronchiostegals. We then ran trials on 6 fish. 3 of each color: red and blue. 2 trials for each fish. 
Each trail consisted of a single fish being exposed to a betta decoy for 5 minutes. We then recorded the aggressive behavior of the fish, took the median value of the highest trial of aggression, and then created a box and whisker plot for that fish’s trial.


Results:
As seen in Figure 1, it was found that the level of aggression displayed by each fish per trial of highest aggression was extremely variable.

The variation between red and blue fish were not significent (t_stat = 0.707107; d.f. = 4; 2-tailed P = 0.518519).

Discussion:
The results show that variation between red and blue fish is not significent, seen in Figure 1. This means that one color of fish did not show aggression a significent amount more than another fish of a different color. This may be due to the lack of reciprocation of aggression by the beta fish decoy used in the experiment. It could be because of habituation towards the decoy where after a while of not responding to aggression, the betas simply gave up trying to provoke it [Peeke: 1970]. However, this would not explain why Red Fish 2 and Blue Fish 3 showed no aggressive response to the decoy. An interesting experiment for future study would be to have a decoy in the presence of two fighting bettas and then see if this eventually conditions the betta to become aggressive around the decoy through classical conditioning [Thompson: 1965].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1.  Box and whisker plots of the 6 fish from each fish’s trial where the highest level of aggression was displayed. Red Fish 1 had a median, quartile 1 and 3 value, and minimum of 1 and a maximum of 2. Red Fish 2 showed no aggressive behavior. Red Fish 3 had a minimum aggression level of 1, a quartile 1 level of 2, and a median, quartile 3, and maximum of 3. Blue Fish 1 only displayed an aggressive level of 1. Blue Fish 2 showed a minimum, quartile 1, and median aggression level of 1, a quartile 3 level of 2, and a maximum level of 3. Blue Fish 3 showed no aggressive behavior.
