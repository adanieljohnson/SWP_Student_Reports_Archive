Title: Effects of Tetraethylammonium on Rania Pipiens Gastrocnemius Muscle Relaxation

Abstract:
A chemical known as tetraethylammonium demonstrated potassium-blocking properties in a previous experiment. Additionally, previous experiments have administered an electrode stimulus in the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rania Pipiens, causing muscle contractions. Based on these experiments, the group hypothesized that if 0.1 Ml of tetraethylammonium (100 mM) was injected into the Gastrocnemius muscle of the Rania Pipiens, the relaxation period of the muscle contraction would be longer than when it was under controll circumstances. The group gathered 3 individual legs and placed electrodes into the Gastrocnemius muscle. A controll voltage was administered for both controll and treatment groups, each consisting of 5 trials.  It was discovered that the average relaxation period for treatment trials was longer than that of the controll for all 3 legs. This is shown by a greater mean relaxation period for the treatment group.  However, data was not statistically significent from a two-tail, paired t_test.  Overall, the alternate hypothesis was partially supported.  This may be due to tetraethylammonium delaying potassium influx, which would cause delayed repolarization of the neurons in action potentials and therefore a delayed muscle relaxation.

Introduction:
Neurons transmit their signals through what are known as action potentials.  This action potential is initially caused by the release of acetylcholine from the presynaptic nerve terminal which then binds with receptors on the membrane of a muscle fiber.  This is because the binding of acetylcholine to postsynaptic receptors allows sodium ions to enter the cell through voltage-gated sodium channels and potassium ions to leave as the cell begins to depolarize.  This is followed by the opening of voltage-gated potassium channels that allow potassium to come back into the cell and sodium flows back out, contributing to repolarization.  This occurs in local currents all the way down an axon of a neuron until the action potential arrives at a neuromuscular junction within muscle fibers.  The action potential causes the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The release of calcium ions activates contraction of the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2018].  Furthermore, in a previous study, a group of scientists explored the function of a chemical called tetraethylammonium on molluscan neurons.  Their results indicated that this chemical may have an effect on the action potentials of neurons by delaying potassium from both leaving and re-entering the cell [Hermann: 2018].  In Rania Pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog, the neuromuscular junction lies in the leg of the frog between the Sciatic nerve and the Gastrocnemius muscle.  This is where nerve impulses that will stimulate the gastrocnemus muscle to contract will pass through.  Frog muscles have been stimulated using external electrodes in the Gastrocnemius muscle by other scientists [Johnson: 2018].  Our group’s experiment wants to mimic the action potentials and contractions just as these scientists have done while also testing the effect of tetraethylammonium on the contraction and relaxation of the gastrocnemus muscle.  If a controll voltage (specific to each Rania Pipiens leg) and 0.1 Ml of tetraethylammonium (100 mM) are administered to the Gastrocnemius muscle, the group hypothesizes that the relaxation period following muscle contraction will take longer than one without tetraethylammonium.  This would most likely be due to tetraethylammonium slowing the influx of potassium back across the cell membrane during repolarization.  The Rania Pipiens is the preferred organism for this experiment due to the time it takes to dissect and prepare along with its consistency in producing measurable muscle contractions.

Materials and Method:
First, the group gathered 3 amputated Rania Pipiens legs and cut off outside skin.  The group then prepared the Gastrocnemius muscle in each leg by cutting connective tissue to free up the Sciatic nerve and other parts of the muscle.  The cut end of the Gastrocnemius muscle was tied by a string to an FT-302 force transducer at a length with no slack and the other end was pinned to the base work station for stability.  Electrodes were lightly inserted into the muscle and connected to the FT-302.  The group calibrated the machine and then administered impulses at various voltages for the first frog leg in order to view what voltage would yield the most consistent contractions, therefore deeming this voltage the controll voltage for that specific leg.  The contraction and relaxation times (in milliseconds) were recorded for five trials at this controll voltage.  The group then injected 0.1 Ml of tetraethylammonium (100mM) via syringe into the Gastrocnemius muscle, waited, and then administered the controll voltage for five different trials.  In total, the contraction periods, relaxation periods, and amplitudes of every muscle contraction in both controll and treatment groups were recorded and compared as this procedure was repeated for the other two frog legs.  The average relaxation periods for each Rania Pipiens leg in both controll and treatment trials were calculated and graphed.  These values were inserted into a two-sample, paired T-test.  The group’s significance cutoff value was a P-value of 0.05.

Results:
The average relaxation period for leg 1 after treatment was 52 milliseconds longer than the controll.  This average relaxation time was also 25 milliseconds longer post-treatment for leg 2 and 86 milliseconds longer for leg 3.  Each required a different controll voltage to be administered and varied in age and size.  Figure 1 shows that the average relaxation period for all 3 frog legs was greater following the injection of tetraethylammonium than it was under controll circumstances.  The overall average relaxation time of the 3 legs was 122 milliseconds under controll circumstances and 176.33 milliseconds post-treatment.  The average population standard deviation for controll was +/- 8.75 and average population standard deviation for treatment was +/- 22.07.  Two sample, paired T-test results yielded a mean of the treatment data that was higher than the mean of the controll data.  The P-value was 0.09, degrees of freedom were 2 and the T-value was 3.07.

Discussion:
As a previous study demonstrated that tetraethylammonium had a delaying effect on both the exit and re-entry of potassium ions, it is possible that tetraethylammonium had a similar effect on our group’s data as well [Hermann: 2018].  If tetraethylammonium does, in fact, delay potassium ions by slowing their influx across the membrane back into the cell, this would most likely affect the action potentials of neurons and therefore the corresponding responses in organ fibers such as muscles.  The group hypothesized that, given the potential potassium blocking properties of tetraethylammonium, the muscle contractions of the Rania Pipiens’s Gastrocnemius muscle would take longer to go through their relaxation period.  This would, theoretically, be due to the prevention of potassium ions from being allowed to re-polarize the action potential at a normal rate.  After analyzing our data, it is fair to say that the group’s alternate hypothesis is partially supported and that the null hypothesis is rejected.  While the relaxation times varied significently between frog legs, they all demonstrated a longer average relaxation period following tetraethylammonium injection.  Additionally, this variance of values between frog legs may be attributed to their different sizes, ages, and other properties.  No two frog legs are the same.  The group’s T-test results indicate that the mean relaxation period following treatment was longer than the relaxation period of the controll trials.  However, the T-test does not demonstrate that the data is statistically significent and there is a possibility that this occurred due to chance.  This could possibly be further explored by testing more frog legs.  In terms of possible error, there may not have been exact 0.1 Ml doses of 100 mM tetraethylammonium given across the board.  Additionally, it is reasonable to mention that the process in which the group determined a controll voltage to administer to each individual frog could have seen some form of human error.  The next logical step in this experiment would be to repeat these steps given another set of frog legs in order to reaffirm the group’s findings.  Another logical step would be to test different quantities of tetraethylammonium and their corresponding effect, along with testing this chemical on the relaxation periods of other muscles in different organisms.  This would open the door for a broader analysis of both tetraethylammonium as a potassium-blocking chemical and on the neuromuscular responses that occur in various organisms.  Overall, the responses of neurons and muscles to chemicals such as tetraethylammonium are very complex and were explored in a highly-specific and isolated setting during this experiment.
