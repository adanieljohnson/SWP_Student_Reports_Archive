Title: The Stunting Effect of an Ecdysterone Blocker on the Development of Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
Ecdysterone is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting in developing insects.  We hypothesized that blocking ecdysterone would cause Manduca sexta to not pupate.  To find this out we created two groups and added the ecdysterone blocker to one group’s food and watched their growth over the course of two weeks.  We saw not only did the experimental group not pupate, but there was a significant difference in the average change in weight for the control and experimental groups, with control being significantly higher.  

Introduction:
Hormones are used by organisms to perform various bodily functions, such as thermoregulation, body maintenance, and growth and development.  Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm exist as a moth in their final developmental phase, or adult phase.  However, they exist as a caterpillar during their larva phases, of which they have five instars, or phases; they also exist as a pupa, the stage between the last larva instar and the adult moth phase.  These larva and pupa stages are the developmental phases of the Manduca sexta.  There are two hormones that work in conjunction to regulate the growth and development during the instar and pupa phase: Ecdysterone, E20, and Juvenile Hormone, JH.  Past research into ecdysterone has shown that ecdysterone affects the timing of pupation in the final instar of the Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1976].  With a synthetic IGR, an insect growth regulator, that will work to block E20 from affecting the caterpillar, we hypothesize that there will be fewer caterpillars that pupate, from the final instar to a pupa, in the presence of the E20 blocker.

Materials and Methods:
First, we took our eight caterpillars and separated them into two groups, one a control and one the experimental group.  After separating the groups, we weighed each individual caterpillar and placed them into our marked containers.  The food we provided for the control consisted of a normal Manduca sexta diet, mixed with 10 drops of water, while the experimental group’s food consisted of a normal diet, but with 10 drops our E20 blocker per 10 grams of food.  We then measured the growth of both groups every day, noting differences in the color to see if any caterpillars had pupated, for two weeks.  We provided fresh food when necessary for the caterpillars, mixing to the same ratio as before.  After the two weeks, we noted how many of both groups had pupated, and we performed a one tailed two sample t-test on the caterpillars from the starting weight to their max weight, where after they would either pupate or die.  

Results:
Our results showed that we had an average change in weight of 5.025 ± 1.54, in grams with standard deviation, for the control group with and average change in weight of 1.413 ± 0.27, in grams with standard deviation, for the experimental group, shown in figure 1.  The trend we see is that the control group had a much larger change in weight, growing over three times as much as the experimental group.  We also should note that all four of the control caterpillars pupated while three of the four experimental caterpillars died, with the lone survivor looking similar to a caterpillar in the 5th instar.  Our one tailed two sample t-test showed there was a significant difference between the two groups (t-stat= 4.61, df= 5, P= 0.002).

Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis, that the blocking of E20 in the caterpillars would lead to fewer caterpillars who pupated in that group, compared to the control group.  All four of our control caterpillars were healthy and pupated before the end of our two weeks of observation, this would indicate that E20 plays an important role in the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, which is in line with previous research, which determined that E20 was a key hormone in the development and decision to pupate in the caterpillars [Nijhout: 1976].  We can see that the caterpillars need the influx of E20 to even have a chance of survival in the long term.  Biologically, all the results we have fall in line with what would have been expected, from the level of blocking a hormone will produce some affect that most likely will be averse to the health of the organism, to the level that E20 specifically affects the pupation rate of the Manduca sexta.  Our only source of error would be something we couldn’t control, but the experiment took place during a hurricane, which prevented us from feeding the caterpillars.  We suspect one of our caterpillars died during the storm, and if we could have fed the caterpillar it might not have died.  This is important because in some fertilizers and pesticides there are chemicals that act just as E20, or other growth hormones, and as blockers of these hormones.  Understanding how these hormones and hormone blockers work, one would understand how the fertilizers and pesticides they are using affect not just the target organism, but other organisms that come into contact with them.  This would have an effect on how large agriculture centers apply fertilizers and pesticides to not affect more than the target organism, or to avoid those products that have these effects.
