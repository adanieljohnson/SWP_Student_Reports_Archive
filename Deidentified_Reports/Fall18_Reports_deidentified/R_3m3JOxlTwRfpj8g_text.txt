Title: Effects of Temperature on Resource Allocation in Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum)

Abstract:
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a common agricultural plant in temperate environments. This experiment was conducted to find out the effects that different temperatures have over root:shoot ratios in length and weight of two-week old seedlings. This ratio is indicative of the resource allocation in the buckwheat. Resource allocation is how plants create stable living environments within based on their current external environment. A root:shoot ratio allows this to be measured physically. There was no significant difference found in this ratio for length or width at temperatures of 20°C and 28°C 

Introduction:
We will be observing the effects of temperature on buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum). We will determine this by the manner in which these plants allocate their resources in a cold temperature environment and a warm temperature environment. Energy allocation can be measured phenotypically by taking the weight and mass of the roots and shoots of each plant and calculating a root:shoot ratio. These phenotypic, or physical changes, are representative of the phenotypic plasticity, the organism’s ability to change its growth pattern over time. We will see whether temperature has an effect on these plants’ growth over the course of two weeks. If the Fagopyrum esculentum is grown in a cold environment we expect to see a larger root to shoot ratio when compared to Fagopyrum esculentum grown in a warm temperature. A temperature of at least 7-8°C is required for germination of buckwheat seeds to begin and the highest temperature for seedling success has been found at a peak of 45°C [Gładyszewsk:2009].

Materials and Methods:
For the experiment on the effects of temperature in Fagopyrum esculentum, we first obtained 36 individual buckwheat seeds and set them aside. Then, we collected four black plastic planters to use as pots and enough vermiculate to fill each one approximately three-quarters of the way full. After the vermiculate was obtained we placed it into the pots and used a single finger to poke nine holes into the mixture. Each hole was approximately an inch and a half deep. Once we had created all of the holes in each planter, we placed a single seed into each of the holes and covered them with a small amount of vermiculate and packed it down gently. Once all the seeds were planted we obtained 200 mL of water and 100 mL of Miracle Grow for each of the planters. We watered each planter with these amounts pouring slowly so as not to flood the planters and to allow the liquids to soak into the vermiculate. We left these planters to sit for approximately five minutes and while we waited we obtained two black plastic trays. We also created labels for each of the planters, two identified as cold treatment and the remaining two identified as warm, these were affixed to the sides of the planters. At the end of the five minutes we placed two cold treatment planters in one tray, and the other two warm planters in another tray. We then set the tray containing the cold treatment seeds into the windowsill, so that sunlight is available for photosynthesis, of our lab room which is kept at 20°C. We placed the tray containing the warm seeds in a greenhouse with a temperature of 28°C. Starting the following day, and continuing every day for two weeks, we returned to each location and watered each of the planters with 100 mL of water. After the two weeks had elapsed we brought the trays back into the lab and placed them on our table. We then obtained a plastic tub containing water up to about two inches deep. Beginning with the treatment group, we washed the vermiculate off the roots of 12 seedlings in the tub of water, careful not to break the roots from the shoots. Each seedling was patted dry and placed onto a paper towel which we labeled with the treatment and a number to indicate which seedling each was. After collecting 12 seedlings we cut each one at the root-shoot junction and placed them onto their original paper towels. We measured the lengths of each root and shoot and recorded them in a table. After all data was collected for the group we calculated root:shoot ratios for each plant. We repeated this process of measurements with the weight of the treatment group, recording the data into a table. After recording all of the data for the treatment group we repeated this process with our buckwheat grown in the warm temperature. We only collected 10 seedlings for the warm environment because that was all that survived of our group. The average root:shoot ratios for length and weight of each group are what we will use to determine a difference between the groups. These will be tested using a two-sample t-test. 

Results:
The average root:shoot ratio for length of the buckwheat grown in cold temperature, 0.472 ± 0.173, was not significantly different from the average root:shoot ratio of length of the buckwheat grown in warm temperature, 0.567 ± 0.239 (Fig. 1, t-stat = 1.08, df = 20, P = 0.146). The average root:shoot ratio for weight of buckwheat grown in cold temperature, 0.128 ± 0.031, was not significantly different than the average root:shoot ratio for weight of buckwheat grown in warm temperature, 0.118 ± 0.044 (Fig. 2, t-stat = 0.63, df = 20, P = 0.268). The plants grown in a warm temperature showed a red coloring on the majority of the length of their shoots. 

Discussion:
Our results did not show a significant difference for the root:shoot ratio of length in buckwheat grown in cold temperature and buckwheat grown in warm temperature (Fig. 1). This is likely due to a low temperature difference between the environments of the two groups, a mere 8° C. This temperature difference could also explain why there is no significant difference between the root:shoot ratio for weight between the two groups (Fig. 2). The temperature range that buckwheat grows optimally at is between 20-26°C and the lowest temperature at which it can survive has been estimated at approximately 3°C [Gładyszewsk:2009]. Our experimental temperatures could be varied to a higher extent and yield different results. Another possible explanation for the lack of a significant difference could be that we did not have an equivalent number of seedlings to measure in each group thus giving a misleading average. In our procedure different individuals watered the planters each day with 100mL of water. Because every individual is human there is room for error in the measurement of the amount of water added and this can cause an effect on buckwheat growth as it requires a steady amount of soil moisture to survive. Flooded soil, -5kPa, and soil under drought conditions, -90kPa, lead to a sever deficit in normal plant growth for buckwheat [ Yoon:2004]. Based on our data our null hypothesis was accepted. This rejects our alternate hypothesis that buckwheat grown in cold temperature will have a greater root:shoot ratio than buckwheat grown in a warm temperature. Our next experiment should be with larger groups of seedlings at temperatures that have at least a 15°C difference to ensure significant data. If the number of plants in each group are equal when measured and the temperature difference is greater then root:shoot ratio for length of plants grown in a cold temperature will be greater than that for those grown in warm temperature.
