Title: The Effects of Temperature on the Agression of Betta splendens 

Abstract:
Betta Splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are fish that are notorious for exhibiting aggressive behavior when exposed to another Betta. They are ectothermic vertebrates, which means they are dependent on external sources for body heat. I hypothesize that when a pair of Betta fish is placed into cold water, they will take longer to exhibit aggressive behavior by touching each other than when placed into room temperature water. This is because they will need to conserve more body heat in cold water. To test this hypothesis, I obtained 6 Betta fish and placed them into three pairs. All three of these pairs were exposed to both the room temperature condition and cold-water condition. To evaluate the collected data, I used a paired t-test. My results were not statistically significant, but the overall trend of the data supported my hypothesis. On average, the Bettas placed in colder water took a longer amount of time to exhibit agnostic behavior. This was because in cold water, the fish needed to conserve their energy and heat. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendens, are among the most beautiful and fascinating of all aquarium fish. They are very territorial and the people of their native country of Thailand traditionally place males together and wager bets as to who will be the winner. [HARLIOĞLU: 2008]. These territorial and aggressive behaviors are also called agnostic behaviors. These agnostic behaviors include broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a Betta turns on its side toward an opponent [Johnson: 2018]. The facing movements include erecting the pectoral fin, spreading the gill coverings, called opercula, and protruding the branchiostegal membranes, creating a red mane [Johnson 2018]. Bettas respond to other’s agnostic behaviors in many ways. They can ignore it, math it, flee, submit, or escalate [Johnson 2018]. 

Betta Splendens are considered to be ectotherms. This means their internal temperatures are usually very close to that of the external environment [Bhuria: 2017]. Environmental temperature varies spatially and temporally, affecting many aspects of an organism’s biology. In ectotherms, variation in environmental temperature can cause parallel changes in skeletal muscle temperature, potentially leading to significant alterations in skeletal muscle performance [James: 2013]. Alternations in skeletal muscle temperature can affect contractile strength in ectotherms, changing the rates of force generation [James: 2013]. Since temperature has a profound effect on ectothermic animals, they regulate their internal temperature by relying on external heat sources [Forsatkar: 2016]. Therefore, I hypothesize that when placed into colder water, the Betta fish will take longer to exhibit aggressive behaviors by physically touching in order to conserve energy and heat. 


Materials and Methods:
To test my hypothesis, I first obtained six male Betta Splendens and grouped them into three pairs. Each pair of fish was test under two conditions: room temperature water (18°C) and cold water (15°C). During each trial, the pair of fish were placed into a tank without a divider. Then, I measured the amount of time it took for the fish to exhibit agnostic behavior by touching each other. After the fish touched, they were placed in separate, visually isolated tanks to rest for five minutes. Then, I repeated this exact procedure for the next experimental condition after the rest period. In order to confirm that the cold water did not affect the behavior of the Bettas in room temperature, I preformed the room temperature test first. Lastly, to evaluate the collected data, I used a paired t-test because I placed the same pair of fish in the room temperature water and the cold water. This will test whether the mean different in the pairs is different from zero. 


Results:
Figure 1 demonstrates that the mean amount of time it took for a pair of Betta fish to touch in cold water (143 ± 28.02) is higher than the mean amount of time it took for a pair of Betta fish to touch in room temperature water (122 ± 24.76 seconds). The paired t-test concluded that the mean amount of time for a pair of fish to touch in cold water was not statistically significantly greater than that of the mean in room temperature water (t-value = 1.29, df = 2, p-value = 0.325). Although the statistical test was not significant, the general data trends demonstrate that it did take longer for the fish in cold water to come into contact with each other. 

Discussion:
Based on the paired t-test, my results were not statistically significant, but based on the data trends, I was able to support my hypothesis. The Betta fish took longer to come into contact with each other when placed into cold water, therefore they took longer to exhibit the highest form of aggressive behavior. That delay in aggressive behavior can be attributed to the fact that the Bettas need to conserve energy and heat when in a cold environment. In study similar to mine, Betta fish were exposed to room temperature and then the same fish were exposed to warmer water. They concluded that in warmer water, the Betta splendens were more active, and that behavior reflected and increase in aggression in ectotherms [Forsatkar: 2016]. Clearly water temperature can affect the attack response. In another study, temperatures of 28°C led to consistently more responses than if a temperature of 22°C was used. Thus, aggressive behaviour in fish has a correlation with some environmental factors [Bambang: 2006]. 

Unfortunately, there was not a significant enough difference between the amount of time it took for the pairs of fish to touch each other in each treatment group. I conducted this experiment with three pairs of fish because that was all I had access to due to resource limitations. Next time, I would repeat the experiment with more than three pairs of fish, to determine if the results will be statistically significant with more repetitions.
