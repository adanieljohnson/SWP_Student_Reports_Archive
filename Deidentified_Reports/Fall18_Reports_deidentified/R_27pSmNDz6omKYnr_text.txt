Title: The Effects of Light Exposure on Field Peas Observed though Resource Allocation

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an important aspect in determining how plants react to different abiotic factors. In this study, we were able to observe how field peas, Pisum sativum, allocate energy into their roots and shoots when placed in environments with different amounts of available light. We predicted that the plants growing in the dark condition in the cabinet would have a larger root to shoot ratio than the plants growing in the light condition. Our data did not show a significant difference for the root to shoot ratio of weight for pea plants; however, there was significant data for difference in shoot length as well as the mean root to shoot ration for length. Our results suggest that the roots of the plants growing in darker environments with limited access to sunlight are shorter than those growing in the open with ample access to sunlight, as the plants in the dark allocate their energy into growing longer shoots in order to reach for any possible source of light. This reaction to different abiotic factors helps explain how plants growing in different environments are able to allocate energy into different plant parts in order to collect the necessary resources for survival. 

Introduction:
This experiment examines the effects on Pisum sativum growing in both light and dark conditions. Under different conditions and when living in environments with varying abiotic factors, plants allocate their energy in different ways in order to obtain the necessary resources for survival, such as growing longer roots to locate a water source or growing longer shoots in order to capture the most sunlight [Johnson: 2018]. Abiotic factors such as wind, temperature, and light availability influence a plantâ€™s ability to capture energy, maximize fitness, and reproduce successfully [Johnson: 2018]. Because there is a limited amount of resources, plants must use their roots, shoots, and leaves to collect as many available resources in order to compete with other surrounding plants to ensure survival. As the amount of resources a plant captures increases, the energy it must spend to obtain these resources also increases, and in response, species have evolved to allocate in a pattern [Johnson: 2018]. This pattern determines where a plant is most likely to grow successfully [Johnson: 2018]. The expectation was that the field pea plants growing in the dark condition without a light source would have a larger root to shoot ratio than the field peas growing under the light condition. The independent variable is the amount of available sunlight and the dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
Four pots of vermiculite were obtained and field pea seeds were planted in the pots. Nine holes were made in each pot with 2 seeds in each hole. Two of the pots would be placed in the dark condition in a cabinet and two in the greenhouse in the sun. The plants were watered and monitored daily for two weeks. After two weeks, the pea plants were removed from both conditions, separated from the vermiculite, washed, and dried. Ten plants from each condition were selected for measurements. The roots were separated from the shoots. The height of the roots and shoots (in cm) for the pea plants under both conditions were calculated and recorded, and then the mass of both the root and shoots (in grams) were calculated and recorded. Then, the root to shoot ratio was calculated. A one-tailed two sample t-test was used to test if there was significant difference between the average root to shoot ratio for pea plants in light conditions compared to those growing in dark conditions. 

Results:
The root to shoot ratio for the weight of pea plants growing under the light and dark conditions was not significantly different (T-stat = 1.68, df = 16, P-value = 0.06). The shoots for plants in the dark grew very long (38.17 +/- 8.87 cm) however, the roots were very small (6.81 +/- 3.07 cm). When we compared the length of the shoots in both conditions, we found that the shoots growing in the light were significantly shorter (T-stat = 5.23, df = 16, P-value = 0.00). Figure 1 illustrates that the mean root to shoot ratio for length of the plants growing in the light compared to those growing in dark conditions was statistically significant (T-stat = 6.45, df = 16, P-value = 0.00). The shoots of the pea plants growing in the dark were white, weak and the leaves were yellow and very small. In contrast, the shoots of the pea plants growing in the greenhouse were very green and not as long as those growing in the dark with an average of 17.33 +/- 5.47 cm, and their leaves were abundant and supple. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis for the root to shoot ratio of weight for field pea plants was not supported, as the plants in both light and dark conditions grew similarly. One weight of a root had a value that was very different and higher than the other weights for the plants growing in the greenhouse, which could have affected our results. The shoot length of plants growing in the light and dark were statistically significant, as the shoots growing in the dark were much longer. This can be explained because the plants in the cabinet had to put their energy into growing long shoots in order to obtain the small amounts of light shining in through small cracks. Because of this, the roots growing in the dark environment were a lot shorter than the shoots of the same plants growing in the dark environment, as these plants were allocating their energy into growing shoots to capture any available light, rather than growing roots to reach a water source. Previous studies testing the effect of light exposure on vegetative or reproductive capabilities of tobacco and soy bean plants found contrasting results, as short exposure to sunlight resulted in smaller, more slender plants [Magness: 1920]. This could be due to the fact that the plants were not in complete darkness or that different species were tested. The mean root to shoot ratio for length was statically significant, as the plants growing in the dark environment had a larger root to shoot ratio than those growing in the greenhouse because there was a limited amount of resources available in the dark. If we were to further explore resource allocation in field peas, we would increase the number of plants we measured and weighed in order to get more accurate results. Understanding how the same type of plant allocates its resources differently when placed in environments with varying abiotic factors helps to explain how plants in different environments growing in the wild are able to adapt and survive under contrasting conditions.
