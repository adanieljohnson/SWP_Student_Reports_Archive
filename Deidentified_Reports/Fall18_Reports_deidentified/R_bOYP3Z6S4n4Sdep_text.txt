Title: The Effect of IGR on the Weight of Manduca Caterpillars

Abstract:
The effect of JH and IGRs have not been fully researched; there is still more to find out about them. JH has a key role in the development of insects, so we decided to look at the effect JH and IGRs have on the growth of Manduca caterpillars. We expected that if we added IGR into the diet of the caterpillars, then they would continue to grow and their weight would increase to more than that of the caterpillars without the added IGR. Our data showed a significent difference in the weight of the experimental and controll groups. This means that IGRs mimic the process of JH and do not let the caterpillars transition from juveniles to adults.

Introduction:
Many hormones, like juvenile hormone, take part in the development of insects. Before metamorphosis, juvenile hormone inhibits molting to an adult [Wyatt: 1996]. When the JH levels drop, the insect is ready to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. This means it is molting from a juvenile to an adult. IGR is an insect growth regulator and affects JH. It can either block or over-activate JH. The IGR mimics the functions of JH [Tunaz: 2004]. In this experiment, the Manduca Sexta was used. It is a type of moth that has many common names, like tobacco hornworm and sphinx moth. We hypothesized that if we increase the levels of IGR in the insect, then the weight of the caterpillars will increase. The dependent variable in this experiment is weight and the independent variable is the IGR in the food. 

Materials and Method:
Initially, we obtained eight Manduca caterpillars and split them into two even groups. We designated four caterpillars to be the controll group and the other four to be the experimental group. WE then obtained 10 g of food per caterpillar (80 g total, split into 8 groups); we added 5 drops of IGR per 10 g of food into the food of the experimental group and five drops of water into the food of the controll group. The caterpillars in a fridge to maintain their environment. The caterpillars were checked every day and weight and observations were recorded. The food needed to be replaced when it turned dry and brown. 
Statistical Analyses: One-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine the average change in weight between the controll and the experimental caterpillars. The difference in weight between all caterpillars was found by subtracting the initial weight from the maximum weight. The difference of the controll caterpillars was averaged. The difference of the experimental caterpillars was averaged. These two numbers were used for the two sample t test. 


Results:
The average weight of the controll group was 6.3975 g. The average weight of the experimental group was 13.7775 g (refer to chart 1). The p value for the one-tailed two sample t test was 0.008045. The standard deviations were 4.26 and 1.27 for the controll and experimental groups, respectively. The controll caterpillar numbered 3 died around day one. Throughout the experiment, the controll was darker green and blue in color. These caterpillars pupated around day 12. The experimental group was lighter, kept increasing their mass, and did not pupate. Overall, the experimental caterpillars were larger in weight than the controll.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the introduction of IGR would increase the weight of the caterpillars. This hypothesis was supported. Our p value from the one-tail two sample t test was significent. This means that the introduction of our IGR increased the weight of the experimental caterpillars and that this weight difference is not due to chance; the average weight percent IGR was higher than the average weight of the controll. The IGR mimics JH in the Manduca, so the caterpillars eating because they think they are not ready to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. The controll caterpillar 3 died very early on, so the average weight did not affect the mean change in weight of the controll group. JH is not fully researched, but with more advanced techniques, more information can soon be discovered about this hormone [Wyatt: 1996]. If repeated, we could decrease the number of drops of IGR and see if only a little amount still delays pupation to try to find the threshold.
