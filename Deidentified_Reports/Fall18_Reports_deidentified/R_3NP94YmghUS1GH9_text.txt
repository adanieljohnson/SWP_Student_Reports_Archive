Title: Lidocaine Acts as a Sodium Channel Inhibitor in Rana pipien Legs

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system in animals allows for rapid intracellular communication and permits organisms to move by process of muscle contraction. Muscle cells (myofibers) and nerve cells (neurons) make up this system and interact at neuromuscular junctions where neurotransmitters and ions act as signaling molecules between the cells. Sodium ions serve the purpose of depolarizing neurons and myofibers to generate action potentials. Lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, inhibits the flow of sodium into the cells and prevents depolarization. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that if a Rana pipien leg is injected with lidocaine, then the amplitude of the muscle contractions of the leg will be smaller than the amplitude when there is no presence of lidocaine. To measure this, we used a force transducer to detect the amplitude of the muscle contraction for both the control and experimental data. However, this experiment determines that there was no significant difference between the experimental data of the leg after being injected with lidocaine and control data of the leg before injection because the p-value was 0.208. Further experiments would be needed to completely demonstrate the effects of lidocaine, or other sodium channel blockers on muscle contraction in Rana pipien legs.

Introduction:
Rana pipiens is a species of leopard frog found in Canada and the United States, and will be used in our experiment to test lidocaine’s effect on neuromuscular communication. Neuromuscular communication is a form of rapid intracellular transmission that is unique to animals. The neuromuscular system of animals consists of nerve cells and muscle cells working together to allow an organism to respond to its internal and external environments. Skeletal muscle consists of thousands of cylindrical, multinuclear, fused aggregates of cells called myofibers, which are bound together by connective tissue to form a muscle [Johnson:2018]. Cell bodies of motor neurons are found in the gray matter of the spinal cord and have axons that branch out to several individual myofibers at neuromuscular junctions [Johnson:2018]. When these nerve cells generate an action potential, the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is released into the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholine then binds to sodium gated ion channels on the postsynaptic cell. Sodium rushes into the muscle fiber, depolarizing it, causing the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions then allow for the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. Ions, especially sodium, play a major role in the muscle contraction process. In individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease, the myelin sheath that insulates axons of nerve cells are damaged, causing many severe symptoms. An experiment was conducted to test how lidocaine, a sodium channel blocker, could alleviate positive symptoms (painful tonic seizure, dysesthesia, etc.) of MS patients by further reducing the action potential in demyelinated areas of the axon and blocking conduction [Sakurai:1999]. The experiment found that Lidocaine was successful in almost eliminating painful tonic seizures, neuralgic attacks, paroxysmal itching, and Lhermitte’s sign, showing lidocaine’s effectiveness in inhibiting depolarization by blocking sodium channels [Sakurai:1999]. Therefore, if a Rana pipiens leg is injected with lidocaine, then the amplitude of the muscle contractions will be smaller than the amplitude when there is no presence of lidocaine because blocking sodium channels would inhibit depolarization of both the neurons and myofibers and in turn, keep the muscle from contracting as much.    

Materials and Methods:
To test our hypothesis, three Rana pipien legs were collected and prepared by exposing the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle and keeping the leg moist with frog ringers’ solution as needed. We then connected the leg to the force transducer using pin electrodes, which were in contact with the sciatic nerve. We set constants of 1.2 volts for pulse amplitude, 1 Hz for frequency, 5 milliseconds for pulse length, and a number 5 pulses on LabScribe. Then, we stimulated the leg with pulses to the sciatic nerve and measured the amplitude of the five muscle contractions and averaged them together. After we collected data for the leg’s control, we injected the leg with 0.1 mL of 25 millimolar lidocaine and waited five minutes to collect experimental data for the leg. Using the force transducer again, we measured the amplitude of the five muscle contractions and averaged them together. We then repeated this process for two other legs and took the amplitudes of the muscle contractions for the control and experimental data of each leg. Using a paired, one-tailed t-test, we compared the results of the control group and experimental group. 

Results:
The data we collected shows that the control group had a greater amplitude of muscle contraction than the experimental group. Leg number 1 experienced the greatest difference in amplitude while leg number 2 experienced the least difference in amplitude. Figure 1 shows that the amplitude for leg number 1 was 0.934 volts for the control data and 0.0458 volts for the experimental data. The amplitude for leg 2 was 0.287 volts for the control data and 0.087 volts for the experimental data. Leg three showed amplitudes of 0.202 volts for the control data and 0.0158 volts for the experimental data. With 2 degrees of freedom and a t-value of 1.833, the one-tailed p-value was 0.208. Therefore, the difference in the control group and experimental group amplitude of muscle contraction was not statistically significant.

Discussion:
These statistically insignificant results lead to the conclusion that Rana pipiens legs being injected with lidocaine did not cause the amplitude of muscle contractions to be less than the amplitude of muscle contraction when there was no presence of Lidocaine, which rejects our alternate hypothesis. Even though there was an observed difference between the experimental data and control data, more experiments would need to be done to determine the effects of sodium channel inhibitors on muscular contractions either by increasing the lidocaine dosage or using a different sodium channel blocker. In the MS study, lidocaine was found to be useful in urgent relief for pain and positive symptoms for MS, but it is metabolized quickly, which means it must be continuously for long-term therapy for MS outpatients [Sakurai:1999]. Mexiletine, an analogue of lidocaine, nearly abolished painful tonic seizures in patients it was orally administered to and is not metabolized as quickly as lidocaine, so it can be used for a longer-lasting treatment [Sakurai:1999]. A better understanding of sodium channel inhibitors could give insight into more therapeutic agents that can be used in treating chronic pain or diseases, such as Multiple Sclerosis. In addition, the neuromuscular system could be studied more in depth by doing other experiments using varying concentrations of other signal molecules to gain a wider perspective of the interactions between muscle cells and nerve cells and their role in neuromuscular coordination.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: The average amplitude of muscle contraction measured in volts of three different Rana pipien legs. Each leg was stimulated without the presence of lidocaine (control) and then stimulated with lidocaine (experimental). The sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle of the legs were exposed, and the sciatic nerve was directly stimulated to collect the control data. Then, each leg was injected with 0.1 mL of 25 millimolar lidocaine and stimulated after waiting for five minutes. The average amplitude of muscle contraction was greater for the control than that of the experimental group for each leg. Each bar represents average amplitude of muscle contraction for one of the legs (1, 2, or 3) control data (blue) or experimental data (red). *************************************************************************
