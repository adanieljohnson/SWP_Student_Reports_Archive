Title: The effects of the Juvenile Hormone, Methoprene have on the growth and development of Manduca Caterpillars

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is easily affected by its hormone levels. Hormones such a Juvenile Hormone, prothoracicotropic hormone, and ecdysterone work together in the development of the caterpillar, through its 5 instar larval stages, and pupation. In this experiment, 4 caterpillars were assigned to the controll group, where there were fed 10 g of food mixed with DI water and 4 caterpillars were assigned to the experimental group, where they were fed 10 g of food, mixed with the juvenile hormone, methoprene. The caterpillar’s weight and observations were recorded over a 9 day period. After analyzing our data, our hypothesis was supported, (p=6.31x10^-50), which was that the caterpillars in the experimental group that were given the juvenile hormone would increase in weight each day, but they would never be able to molt and reach the pupation stage. This was supported because the 4 controll caterpillars entered the pupation stage and had an average change in weight of 4.615 +/-0.3395 grams, whereas the experimental group did increase in weight each day with an average change of 4.615 +/-0.3395 grams, but never entered pupation. This difference in weight is due to the juvenile hormone interfering with the natural decline in JH that is supposed to happen in order to begin pupation

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is a caterpillar that is in Order Lepidoptera. The life cycle of the Manduca caterpillar is about 39- 48 days long and includes the stages of eggs, 1st through 5th instar larva, pupation, and then it finally becomes an adult moth. [Johnson: 2018] Through its development, insect growth hormone regulators, also known as IGR are used to alter the effect of the normal development of insects and their offspring.  During the final larva instar, the juvenile hormone inhibits the secretion of the prothoracicotropic hormone. [Nijhout: 1974].  This evidence was found in a similar study where caterpillars that were injected with a Juvenile growth hormone, C18 Cecropia, were found to have a delayed in the pupation process because the release of PTTH was inhibited. [Nijhout: 1974]. When the juvenile hormone is ingested through the caterpillar’s diet, it inhibits PTTH to be released which is produced by the corpus cardiacum and inhibits the release of ecdysterone, a hormone which regulated the timing of molting during insect development. Molting is the process by which the caterpillar changes sizes and sheds its cuticle and a new one is produced in order to change in size and prepare for metamorphosis. [Johnson: 2018] Without the ability to perform this task, the caterpillar will never be able to develop fully and enter into pupation. In this lab, we are studying the effects that the juvenile hormone, methoprene has on four Manduca sexta caterpillars by analyzing their weight gain and general development over a 9-day period. Our dependent variable is the mass (grams) of the caterpillars we record each day and the independent variable is the JH hormone, methoprene that we are giving to the caterpillars. We will also have a controll group consisting of four Manduca sexta caterpillars that are not given the insect growth regulator, so that we have a baseline to compare our results to. We want to find out the extent to which their weight (g) and development is altered and how it affects their overall rate of entering into pupation. This is important to know because it will allow biologist to determine the effects that IGR have on caterpillars which could also be related to real-world​ problems, such as if the ingredients in insect repellent and if they are effective or not. The Manduca sexta caterpillar was a good model organism to use in this experiment because they are readily available, grow rapidly from egg to pupa in about two weeks, and lastly, they have easily measurable traits, such as weight, that we can measure and track each day using a scale. We hypothesize that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are exposed to a juvenile hormone (methoprene), then they will increase in mass each week, but they will never have the ability to reach pupation. 


Materials and Method:
In order to complete this experiment, we obtained 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars and recorded their initial weight in grams. We separated them into 2 groups, 4 controll caterpillars and 4 experimental caterpillars and fed each of the caterpillars 10 grams of food, but we added 5 drops of distilled water to the controll group’s food and 5 drops of the Juvenile growth hormone, methoprene to the experimental group’s food. Each day, over a 9-day period we would record the weight each of caterpillar in grams and look for new observations such as a change in color, size, presentation, or appetite based on their conditions. The caterpillars are stored in plastic containers in a 12-hour light, 12-hour dark incubator kept at 25 degrees Celsius. Each day when we weighed caterpillars we would also check to make sure that food supply was full and moist. For this experiment, we will be using a one-tailed two-sample t_test in order to evaluate the difference in weight gain between the controll and the experimental groups. We will take the difference in weight from the caterpillars on the last day of the study and subtract that from their initial weights. We will then average this difference between the controll group and the experimental group and use this data to find our standard deviation, p_value, t value, and degrees freedom using Microsoft Excel. The P value will tell us if the comparison between the difference in weight between the controll group and the experimental group is statistically significent.

Results:
We observed that the experimental group ate more food than the controll group, that the controll group began to enter the commitment pulse, which included them losing weight and having a dark cuticle down their backs, 2 days before they began pupation. Also, we observed that the weight of the experimental group consistently increased over the 9-day period. The average change in weight of the controll group over a 9-day period (September 9- September 13) was 4.615 +/-0.3395 grams and the average growth of the experimental group over the 9-day period was 11.61 +/- 1.569 grams, which is depicted in figure 1, which is a bar graph of the difference in weight gain between the controll and the experimental group. The experimental group had a significently greater change in mass over the 9-day period.   We used a one-tailed two-sample t_test and out p_value was 6.31x10^-5. Our degrees of freedom was 6 and our t value was 8.7155. 

Discussion:
Based on the results of our experiment, our hypothesis is supported. Our hypothesis was that if we expose Manduca sexta Caterpillars to the juvenile growth hormone, methoprene, then they will continue to grow in size over a 9-day period, but they will never be able to reach pupation. This is supported because our experimental group had constant growth over the 9-day period and they never reached the pupation stage as our controll group did. Additionally, our low p_value allows us to conclude that what we changed, providing the caterpillars with the JH hormone did not happen by chance, and the differences between the groups are statistically significent. The reason that the caterpillars in the experimental group did not enter the pupation stage is because its growth and development are due to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone, and juvenile hormone which work together. During the 5th larval instar, also known as the commitment pulse, the JH levels drop very low which then start the molting and pupation stage. [Johnson: 2018]. The experimental group had an increase in the levels of JH hormone, thus it did not properly work together with the ecdysterone, failing to put the caterpillar into the pupation phase. The ecdysterone and the JH hormone would normally work together, as seen in the controll group, because the ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and the JH hormone regulates the type of molting that occurs. Together their concentration ratios will determine what their effects will be on the development of the caterpillar. [Johnson: 2018] In a similar experiment by Frederick Nijhout and Carol Williams, concluded that when the 5th larval instar begins and the caterpillar’s weight about 5 grams, the corpus allata is shut off, which results in the stoppage of JH hormone secretion. [Nijhout: 1974]. After reviewing our data, our controll group had a weight around 5g on the day before they began to enter the pupation stage because their levels of JH hormone have decreased significently. This further explains why our experimental group never entered the pupation stage, because the level of JH hormone being produced was never shut off, it was given to them continuously through their food. If I were to complete this experiment again I think it would be interesting to compare the effects on growth and development of different insect growth hormone regulators in pesticides, such as methoprene also known as Precor and hydroprene, also known as Gentrol. I would like to observe how fast the pupation stage is cut off. This would give insight to chemical pesticide companies on how to make their product the most successful, without significently damaging the environment.
