Title: Changes in Frog’s Leg Sciatic Nerve Response When Treated with ACH Blockers

Abstract:
The experiment’s main objective was to discover if acetylcholine blockers would decrease sciatic nerve responses’ dissected from frog legs. The control group was untreated sciatic nerves and the experimental group was sciatic nerves treated with 0.1 mL of ACH blocker. Both groups contained legs of similar size. The results found that the control group had an average response of 0.567 Volts and the experimental group had an average response of 0.462 Volts. A paired t test found that there was a statistical difference in the two groups. In conclusion, the ACH blocker decreased sciatic nerve response.

Introduction:
Nerves in dissected frog legs show good representations of sciatic responses from electrical stimulation. For this reason, the sciatic nerve from a frog’s will be used in this experiment. The main purpose of this lab is to determine the difference in sciatic response at various amounts of stimulation between untreated nerves and nerves treated with an acetylcholine blocker. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that binds to receptors and sends a chemical message to the brain and activates muscle movements. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter that controls the muscular system, however excess acetylcholine can cause many muscular issues [Britannica: 2018]. ACH blockers inhibit acetylcholine by binding to the receptors, therefore less acetylcholine can bind to receptors and send chemical messages [Cafasso: 2018]. Determining how ACH blockers affect nerve response can allow new drugs to be developed for people with muscle spasms and other medical conditions caused by excess acetylcholine. The hypothesis of this experiment is that sciatic nerves in frog legs when treated with ACH blockers will have a lower sciatic response than untreated nerves.

Materials and Methods:
The sciatic nerve was dissected from the frog leg by exposing the gastrocnemius muscle by pulling off the skin with forceps.The muscle was then separated from the muscle. 3 nerves were collected from 3 seperate legs of similar size. Each leg was sprayed in ringer’s solution. Each nerve was stimulated at 1 Volt, 2 Volts, and 3 Volts using lab scribe. After, each nerve was injected with 0.1 mL of ACH blocker and 2 drops of blocker were put on the outside of the nerve. After 5 minutes these nerves were tested at the same voltages. The control group was the untreated legs and the experimental group was the legs injected with ACH blocker. A paired t-test was used to determine differences between the 2 groups.

Results:
The data shows trends that the sciatic response for the experimental group was consistently lower than the experimental group as seen in graph 1. A p value of 0.058 was calculated. The two groups are statistically different when the p value is compared to an alpha value of 0.1.


Discussion:
From the results in this experiment, the hypothesis that ACH blocker decreases sciatic response is supported. ACH blocker inhibits acetylcholine by binding to the receptors, decreasing the strength of the response. Other researchers found that certain ACH blockers decreased nerve responses in rabbits [Fredericks: 2001]. The similarities in results between the two experiments shows promising results. By seeing a decrease in nerve response in frog legs and in rabbitts means ACH blockers could possibly work in humans. This discovery could allow doctors to make new drugs to increase quality of life in humans with muscular diseases. ACH blockers can be used to create medicine that can stop muscle spasms. This could be especially useful for lessening the severity of symptoms for patients with parkinson’s disease. The results of this experiment showed that ACH blockers limit nerve response.
