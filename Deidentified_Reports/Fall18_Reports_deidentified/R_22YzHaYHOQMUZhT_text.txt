Title: The Impact of Herbicide Inhibition in Chloroplast Samples of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
In our experiment, we tested a dilution of DCIP, an electron carrier, with homemade herbicide, store bought herbicide, and an acid rain dilution. The main objective was to observe these inhibitors on photosynthesis on Spinacia oleracea and measure the percent change in absorbance over a 30 minute period broken up into 3 sets of 10 minutes. We hypothesize that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the chloroplasts without herbicide. We also hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes. The results conclude that the synthetic herbicide showed the least percent change of -19.22%, demonstrating the most inhibition of photosynthesis. Using an ANOVA test, the p_value for our data was 0.295 showing the inhibition was not statistically significent. 


Introduction:
All living organisms need a source of energy to survive. This energy comes directly or indirectly from an external source, and plants (also some protists and bacteria) capture and store energy from the sun in a process called photosynthesis. During this process, chlorophyll molecules within the chloroplasts absorb solar radiation. This solar radiation excites electrons to leave their carrier molecules which causes a chemical reaction that cleaves water to generate a proton gradient [Johnson: 2018]. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP, the energy currency in cells.  With the solar energy transformed into usable energy, the ATP synthesizes the final product of photosynthesis, a 6-carbon glucose [Johnson: 2018]. Once an organism obtains and stores energy, it is needed to be broken down and used within the cells to make more ATP. This stored energy is broken down into ATP by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and then respiration, which occurs in mitochondria [Johnson: 2018]. Together, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two of the most important metabolic processes carried out by living things.
In our experiment, we use our knowledge of the process of photosynthesis to simulate how environmental factors can affect the electron transport chain and the efficiency of photosynthesis. Early experiments on photosynthesis showed that electron transport chains will pass electrons to other electron acceptors besides NADP+ [Johnson: 2018]. The general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light is called the Hill reaction [Johnson:2018].  Knowing this, we decided to use an alternative electron acceptor known as 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP) [Johnson: 2018].  When oxidized, DCIP is a dark blue compound; however, when reduced, DCIP turns from dark blue to colorless. Due to this color change, DCIP reduction can be measured using a spectrophotometer by calculating the absorbance. The DCIP assay can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis.
Our experiment looks at the effects of different herbicides on photosynthesis of Spinacia oleracea.  Spinacia oleracea is an edible plant in the family Amaranthaceae, and is ideal to be used to study photosynthesis because of its easy accessibility and strong photosynthesis effects [Roberts: 2016].  In our lab, we test the effects of acid rain, homemade herbicide, and common store bought herbicide (Round-up).  Herbicides are known to disrupt the process of photosynthesis.  The first herbicide, acid rain, has been an environmental problem, affecting plant survival in its damage towards plant photosynthesis [Zhang: 2018]. It is seen in Zhang’s study that treatments of acid rain reduced the rice chloroplast ATPase activity and gene transcription level [Zhang: 2018].  The second herbicide, the home-made herbicide, made up of vinegar and a clove oil product is previously examined in Evans’s study as a use for weed controll in sweet corn, potatoes, and onions [Evans: 2008].  It is shown that the herbicide stunted growth of weeds in all three vegetables, particularly at high concentrations, due to manipulated inhibitions in the chloroplasts [Evans: 2008].  The last herbicide, glyphosate or commonly known as Round-up, is shown in Gomes’ study to show damaging effects on photosynthesis, respiration, and pigment concentrations due to glyphosate inducing oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide accumulation [Gomes: 2016].  Glyphosate can induce oxidative stress in all plants by targeting the mitochondrial ETC, specifically an inhibition of mitochondrial ETC Complex 1 [Gomes: 2016].
In the experiment, we look at how different herbicides affect photosynthesis under blue light.  Blue light has a positive influence on both genomes, nuclear and plastid, in chloroplast development in plant cells [Poudel: 2008]. Blue light also was responsible for the highest number of stomata in all the genotypes with a significent difference compared to red light [Poudel: 2008]. Due to this, we decided blue light would be the best option to promote maximum photosynthesis. Looking at all these factors, we look to test what effects different herbicides have on photosynthesis over time under blue light, and what kinds of different impacts the pH of the herbicide and different herbicide mixtures have. We can answer this question by comparing the different herbicides mixed with enriched chloroplasts to each other and to a mixtures of enriched chloroplasts with no herbicide.  We hypothesize that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the chloroplasts without herbicide.  We also hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes.  This hypothesis is based off of research that indicated the effects of acid rain, an extremely acidic solution (pH 4), affects more than just the electron transport chain. Acid rain is seen to completely destroy the plant cells as the high acidity is so low in pH that it begins to break plant cells apart from chloroplasts to the cell wall [Zhang:2018].


Materials and Method:
Five medium-sized spinach leaves were used in this experiment.  Each leaf had the large central veins removed, then the leaves were rinsed and put into a mortar and pestle with 10Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  These leaves were then grinded to a thick paste, and then an additional 10Ml of cold grinding buffer was added and then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.  This remaining green liquid was then put into a 50Ml tube and centrifuged for 13 minutes.
        	Before adding the spinach paste, reaction mixtures were prepared to go into 16 large test tubes.  Test tube 1 was the blank containing 8Ml of water, 2Ml of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100Ml of the enriched chloroplasts.  The no chloroplasts test tubes were tubes 2-4 and these were prepared with 6Ml of water, 2Ml of DCIP (130mM), and 2Ml of reaction buffer.  The chloroplasts with no herbicide were test tubes 5-7, and these tubes were prepared with 6Ml of water, 2Ml of DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer, and 100Ml of the enriched chloroplasts.  Then the chloroplasts with acid rain (tubes 8-10) were prepared with 1Ml of 25% nitric acid, 5Ml of water, 2Ml of DCIP, 2Ml of reaction buffer, and 100Ml of the enriched chloroplasts.  The chloroplasts with homemade herbicide (tubes 11-13) had the same mixture as the acid rain but were mixed with 1Ml of the home-made solution (4Ml white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2Ml of clove oil) instead of the nitric acid..  The chloroplasts with synthetic herbicide (tubes 14-16) were mixed the same way as well but were mixed with 1Ml of RoundUp instead of nitric acid or the home-made solution.  Each tube was mixed after adding the chloroplasts and was transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes.
        	After we blanked the spectrophotometer, the absorbance for all of the samples at 600nm was recorded as the time zero data.  All of the samples were placed in a rack under a blue light, and the same absorbance measuring process was repeated at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for all samples.  After getting the data and calculating the percent changes after each absorbance, an ANOVA test will be used to test our data for significance.  The legitimacy of the ANOVA test is ensured by running it with our negative controll. The ANOVA test will compare the absorbances of the groups with chloroplast to the groups with chloroplasts plus the different herbicides.


Results:
Our results gave us three absorbance readings from each of the five solutions we were testing to determine the reduction occurring in the system. With these absorbances, we found the percent change from time 0 to 10 min, 20 min, and 30 min as seen in Table 1. These figures were also graphed. Observable trends all, but the solution with no chloroplasts, have an increasingly negative percent change the greater the time as seen in both Table 1 and visually in Figure 1 where each series is differentiated to show the trend towards negativity. Our data had a p_value for the percent changes of 0.295 determined from an ANOVA test, which yielded no statistical significance.


Discussion:
After the results were analyzed, the data did not support our hypothesis that acid rain would be seen to inhibit photosynthesis the most. Instead, the synthetic store bought herbicide, Roundup, showed the most inhibition. When compared to the -44.46%+/-15 change in absorbance of the controll sample with just chloroplasts in it, all 3 inhibitors tested were shown to have been at least somewhat effective. The acid rain and home-made herbicide sample produced -29.63%+/-4.05 and -29.77%+/-7 change in absorbance, respectively. Inhibition was seen in both as they had a percent change in absorbance lower than the controll by about 14%. On the other hand, the store bought Roundup herbicide had an even greater effect on photosynthesis with a -19.22%+/-3.39 change in absorbance, over 20% lower than that of the controll. As mentioned in the introduction, we are allowed to correlate the change in absorbance to the amount of photosynthesis occurring due to our knowledge of the Hill Reaction as the enriched chloroplasts reduce DCIP, turning it from blue to clear. This reduction is supposed to simulate the reduction during the electron transport chain, an integral part of the photosynthesis process. Essentially, the less change in absorbance one observes, the more effective the herbicide is at disrupting the reduction of DCIP and therefore the process of photosynthesis.
In a previous study, a homemade herbicide was used to prevent weeds in the fields from destroying the crops. This mixture in the herbicide was a mixture of vinegar and clove-oil product. Different ratios of vinegar and oil were used for specific treatments on weeds in various crop fields. Trials were conducted in sweet corn, onion and potato. The observations of this allowed for isolation of what specific weed would be impacted the most in the three different fields. What was measured was the weed controll, biomass, crop injury and yield [Bellinder, Evans: 2008]. The dilution used for sweet corn weed controll was the greatest of the solution of 200-grain vinegar. This is a field application of preventing food destruction by weeds in various farms. It is the similar principle to what we used to creating our homemade herbicide and what we referenced to to get an idea of the ingredients needed and their effects on our spinach leaves. 	
Some possible sources for error could be attributed to smudges formed on the vials put into the spectrophotometer that could skew the absorbance numbers recorded. Further, it is also possible that human error occurred when using the pipettes to put the exact amount of each reagent into the test tubes. Different concentrations of each reagent could have affected the absorbance readings. However, since three trials were conducted, any human error for filling the tubes at slightly different concentrations can be ruled insignificent. 
Alternate explanations as to why the experiment gave us the data it did is that maybe the synthetic herbicide was much more potent than the acid rain and homemade herbicide as the specific concentrations of ingredients were not given on the bottle. This would be one possible explanation as to why the Roundup was seen to be more effective at disrupting photosynthesis. Further when the DCIP was added to the acid rain sample, it did not turn the solution as blue as the other samples. Since the acid rain started at such a small absorbance, any minute change in clarity appears to be a much greater percent change in absorbance than it actually was. Acid rain decreased in absorbance by only 0.005 over 30 minutes, but that small decrease was calculated to be a 29.63%+/-4.05 change in absorbance. On the other hand, the homemade sample decreased in absorbance by 0.039 over 30 minutes, producing close to the same percent change in absorbance at 29.77%+/-7. Our data’s p_value was 0.295. We know that our statistical test was accurate because we ran the test with our negative controll. The ANOVA test compared each of the average absorbances with chloroplast sample to the average absorbances of the different herbicides tested. Though this means our data is not statistically significent, we can still use it draw conclusions and interpret the results. We believe this statistical insignificance could come from errors in the way our assay or dilutions of DCIP and herbicides were conducted.
 A separate experiment offers some insight as to why we got the results we did. Specifically, looking at acid rain and its impact on plants and how environmental pollution can be attributing to this destruction of plant life. In this study, the focus was looking at a portion of the electron transport chain and how acid rain disrupts the protein responsible for generating ATP in eukaryotic systems, ATPase. Many of these samples of acid rain that were made to mimic  highly polluted areas and conditions where acid rain typically occurs: industrial factories in wet climates, or volcanic areas. The results of the study proved somewhat inconclusive as it was inconsistent when photosynthesis was inhibited and when it wasn’t. The different solutions of acid rain dilutions concluded different results. Some samples ended up reducing the ATPase activity and others caused similar to normal functioning of systems. [Zhang, Hu, Wang, Zhou, Huang: 2018]. This directly relates to our experiment through our initial hypothesis being disproved. The dilution of 1:4 Nitric Acid may have been an ineffective amount and may have contributed to a higher percent change. If we had done further examination into the chemical components of acid rain, we may have been able to yield better results. This is an alternate explanation that can be shown through a similar experiment on the effects of acid rain during photosynthetic processes, and understanding what may have actually happened in reality, especially in our lab specifically. 
The purpose of this lab was to determine what environmental factor or herbicide is the most effective at decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. Since our results pointed to the synthetic store bought herbicide as the most effective, the next step in determining the best solution to killing plants would be to run the same experiment comparing instead different brands and types of store bought herbicide. As we decided to use the blue light bulb from previous studies, another possible experiment could test the effect of different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis activity by comparing the chloroplast only sample under different colored light bulbs. If the lab was repeated again, more trials for each sample should be tested to increase the legitimacy of the results and decrease the effect of outliers. 
Looking at this lab in the scope of the real world, herbicides are composed of a number of components that disrupt metabolic pathways or photosynthetic ones. Many industrial farming operations use herbicides on weeds to prevent crop damage. Even everyday home owners use weed killer to maintain yards by spraying herbicides directly onto weeds to inhibit growth. This experiment was a close up look of the process of inhibition on plant life by specifically focusing on the disruptions of photosynthesis. This allows us to have a better grasp of what components of herbicides impact certain aspects of photosynthesis or respiration. Finally, this experiment can be used for better environmental effects on nature, like what acid rain does compared to what an herbicide is designed to do. In a bigger picture way of thinking, this lab can be extended to environmental awareness and the effects of pollution, as may acid rain climates are due to lack of environmental protection.
