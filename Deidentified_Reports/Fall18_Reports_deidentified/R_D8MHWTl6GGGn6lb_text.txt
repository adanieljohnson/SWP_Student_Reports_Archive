Title: Neomycin effect on signaling of Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum (Physarum) is a slime mold that uses signaling transduction pathways. Physarum uses signaling in three separate steps: a stimulus activates a receptor, which releases a second messenger, which binds to an effector enzyme to trigger a response to the initial stimulus. PLC is an effector enzyme for IP3, a second messenger. The objective for this lab is to see how increasing concentration of neomycin, a PLC inhibitor, will affect chemotaxis motility toward glucose. By introducing Physarum into the middle of a petri plate containing 2% agar in water, placing glucose on opposite ends of the petri dish, and introducing different concentrations of neomycin to one of the sides, we compared the rate at which the chemotaxis traveled to the concentrations of neomycin. Since neomycin is a PLC inhibitor, we hypothesized that increasing its concentration would decrease chemotaxis motility toward glucose. We did not find this to be statistically true, however did find general trends to support this. 


Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a type of slime mold that is a multinucleate syncytium, which means that it contains multiple nuclei in a single plasma membrane. By using Physarum we are able to see cell level processes without having to look through a microscope. Physarum uses similar transduction pathways as humans. Rather than relying on a nervous system or hormones to sense and respond to an environment, Physarum uses three signaling steps. A stimulus activates a receptor, which releases a second messenger, which binds to an effector enzyme to trigger a response to the initial stimulus. The behavior of Physarum depends on G-protein coupled receptors and ion-coupled receptors. Phospholipase C (PLC) is an effector enzyme that helps produce IP3, a second messenger for G-protein coupled receptors. When IP3 binds to a receptor it opens Ca+2 channels which bind to calcium regulated proteins. This process either stimulates or inhibits activity [Johnson: 2018]. The goal for this lab is to see how increasing concentration of neomycin, a PLC inhibitor, will affect chemotaxis motility toward glucose. In an experiment conducted by N. Mateeva, V. Teplov, and S. Beylina, they looked at the affect that neomycin had on the chemotaxis movement toward glucose. They discovered that neomycin suppressed chemotaxis toward glucose [Mateeva: 2011]. This study leads us to believe that neomycin would act in a similar way in our experiment. We hypothesized that increasing concentration of neomycin would decrease chemotaxis motility toward glucose. By conducting this experiment, we can understand more about signaling pathways in PLC.


Materials and Methods:
We started off by attaining nine 100mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water. Then we labeled the backs of plates with three separated 1x1 cm labeled squares (labeled: “blank”, “starting point”, and “+”). On three of the plates we inserted glucose, the culture, and the blank with 5 mg/ml concentration of neomycin inhibitor. On three other plates we did the same, however, with 2 mg/ml concentration of neomycin inhibitor. And then on the last three plates, we again did the same except we used 1 mg/ml concentration of neomycin inhibitor. After each step, we sterilized the forceps and spatula so that we would not infect or alter the plates. Then, we taped the lid, covered it with foil, and placed it in a dark drawer. After 24 hours, we retrieved the plates in the dark drawer and measured the distance migrated and recorded the direction of motility. If the chemotaxis traveled towards the side with neomycin the distance was positive and if it traveled away the distance was negative. We compared the rate of growth of the chemotaxis for each of our data points by using three separate one-tailed t-tests. In each t-test we compared our data from 1mg/ml with 2 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml with 5 mg/ml, and 2 mg/ml with 5 mg/ml.


Results:
For our three statistical tests, none of our results were found to be statistically significant. The p-value comparing 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml was 0.069. The p-value comparing 1 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml was 0.087. The p-value comparing 2 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml was 0.177. Because all of these values are greater than 0.05, our data is deemed statistically significant. This means that there are no statistical differences between concentration of neomycin and rate of hourly growth of the chemotaxis. General trends show that data from 1 mg/ml of neomycin were the only ones to have its chemotaxis grow toward neomycin. Data from 2 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml both grew away from the neomycin, however, the samples with 2 mg/ml on average grew further away from the starting point. As seen in figure 1, the rate of hourly growth decreases from 1 mg/ml to 2 mg/ml and slightly increases from 2 mg/ml to 5 mg/ml. For each concentration of neomycin there was one sample that we recorded to have no growth. For each of these samples, the chemotaxis appeared to grow down into the Physarum plate rather than toward either glucose.


Discussion:
Since all our p-values were less than 0.05, our data was statistically insignificant. This means that our data statistically rejects our hypothesis that increasing concentration of neomycin would decrease chemotaxis motility toward glucose. However, several small trends support our data. For example, our samples with 1 mg/ml of neomycin were the only samples to average growth toward the neomycin. Samples with 2 mg/ml and 5 mg/ml both grew away from the neomycin. This would support our hypothesis that higher a concentration of neomycin would decrease its motility toward glucose. In a study conducted by W. Engelmann and B. Antkowiak, they experimented to see the effect that neomycin had on contractile activity in Physarum. They found that neomycin completely stopped contractile oscillations for 10-30 minutes [Engelmann: 2014]. This study suggests that neomycin effectively works at blocking signal pathways and for that reason contractions were prevented from occurring. This agrees with the trends in our data, because in most samples, especially with high levels of neomycin, the chemotaxis did not travel towards the side with neomycin. In another experiment run by Todd Clapp, Ruibiao Yang, and Cristi Stoick, they investigated the importance that PLC plays in signal transduction pathways. They tested rat taste buds and used neomycin to inhibit PLC pathways. They found that after neomycin was administered most rats lost their sense of taste [Capp: 2003]. This agrees with our hypothesis because neomycin prevented signal transduction pathways from going through since it inhibits the effector enzyme, PLC. This experiment helps us learn a little more about how signal transduction pathways work. Specifically, it helps us learn more about the role PLC plays as an effector enzyme. In the future, our experiment could be improved by making sure we are more precise in cutting squares and setting up the Physarum plates. It is possible that we were not precise enough and received poor data, especially for the data that we saw not results at all for.
