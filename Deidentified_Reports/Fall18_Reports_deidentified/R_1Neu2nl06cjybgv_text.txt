Title: Azadirachtin as an insecticide for Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones disrupting metamorphosis could be a better option for an insecticide on crops. Azadirachtin can replicate the Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars by inhibiting ecdysone, which starts the pupation process. Four of our caterpillars were given 10g each of control and another four of our caterpillars were given 10g each of food with Azadirachtin for 14 days. We hypothesized if the caterpillars were given azadirachtin, then the pupation process would be inhibited, and they would lose weight. The results were not significant and did not support our hypothesis and the experimental caterpillars did eventually pupate. The dosage of azadirachtin was too low to disrupt the metamorphosis. Moving forward, more experiments need to be done to see what dosage of azadirachtin is the correct amount. 

Introduction:
Hornworm (Manduca sexta) caterpillars release a hormone called Juvenile Hormone (JH), which keeps them in the larva stage. The caterpillars also release a hormone called Ecdysone to initiate the pupal stage. These insects are generally pests for anyone working with crops. Insecticides are not necessarily ideal as they put toxins on our crops, so what if there was a better way to eliminate more of these pests? Azadirachtin is a hormone that inhibits ecdysone, thus replicating JH and delaying the pupal stage from beginning. If given the correct amount, the Manduca Sexta could potentially never reach the pupal stage, which would get rid of the pest without having to spay insecticides on the crops. Part of the steps of metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta is the caterpillar's weight will gradually increase. If the Manduca sexta is given Azadirachtin, which will inhibit ecdysone, then the weight will decrease. 

Materials and Methods:
My lab partners and I divided a group of 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups. One group was the control and one group was the experimental. The two groups were put into two separate containers that each have four compartments for each caterpillar. We labeled each compartment control/experimental 1, 2, 3, or 4 and poked two holes for each caterpillar. We weighed and recorded the weight for each caterpillar before putting them in their containers. Then, my group wrote down initial observations of the caterpillars. We took 80g of food and divided it into two 40g piles. One pile was set aside for the control and then received 16 drops of deionized water and mixed well. For the other 40g, 16 drops of Azadirachtin with a ratio of 1:1250 were added and mixed well. Four caterpillars were given 10g each of the control food and 4 caterpillars were given 10g each of the food with the Azadirachtin. The caterpillars were weighed everyday for 14 days before being fed. Then, observations of how much food had been eaten and how the caterpillars appeared were recorded for 14 days as well. A two sample t-test was used to calculate the t-score, p-value, and DF number.

Results:
The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than the mean experiment group (t-stat= 0.93712, p-value= 0.384867, DF = 6). 

Observations: No difference in days 1-3. 
Day 4- all experimental caterpillars are small, and lethargic, eaten less food than control, and feces are smaller and much less. All control caterpillars are very fat, squishy, and barely moving.
Day 5- Control number 1 is very active and skin is translucent and darker not as soft as other controls. Experimental smaller more lethargic and greener than control.
Day 6- all control caterpillars are fat and lethargic, seem greener than experimental. experimental are small and lethargic as well, colors are much brighter, 4 is bright blue.
Day 7- control caterpillars are much more lethargic and greener than experimental, feel stiffer than experimental, and seem to have eaten less than experimental. Experimental 1 and 3 are starting to turn greener, but 2 and 4 are still bright blue. All caterpillars seem to have lost weight. 
Day 8- all experimental have reached commitment pulse, as with all of control. Experimental 2 is still bright blue, rest are turning yellow. 

Discussion:
The results did not support our hypothesis, since the results were not significant. However, most of the control caterpillars were still bigger than the experimental. The most likely reason that this is happened is not enough azadirachtin was given to make a difference in the metamorphosis. The azadirachtin put in the food was at a ratio of 1:1250. As seen in another study, low doses still permitted pupation to occur in most of the cases, but caterpillars given higher doses usually did not fully complete development (Schlüter, U., et al. 1985). However, the same study showed that the resulting pupae of the low doses were defective for the most part (Schlüter, U., et al. 1985). So, this low of a dosage could perhaps still be beneficial as an insecticide. Moving forward, the experiment should be repeated, but with higher doses of azadirachtin to see what a more effective dose of azadirachtin would be.
