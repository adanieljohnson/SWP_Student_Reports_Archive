Title: Role of Azadirachtin in Manduca sexta pupation

Abstract:
Hormones, including Juvenile hormone and ecdysone are important in the regulation of larval instars and pupation in insects. Understanding hormone regulation can be beneficial in fields such as agriculture where disrupting the life cycle of certain pests can reduce damage to crops. Our experiment examined the role of insecticide azadirachtin, an ecdysone blocker, on the molting and pupation of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
	Hormones are responsible for the physiological processes that regulate the larval instars, molts, and pupation of holometabolous organisms. The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is such an holometabolous insect whose larval and pupal stages are controllled by the release of Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone. JH determines the type of molt a larva will undergo, essentially keeping the larva in a juvenile state from molt to molt when concentrations are high. When JH production is drastically reduced in the fifth larval instar, metamorphosis will be uninhibited. Ecdysone, on the other hand, regulates the timing of each molt. A commitment pulse occurs when a rise in ecdysone occurs simultaneously with low JH levels, indicating to the caterpillar it has sufficient resources stored and can begin pupation (Nijout: 1976). Administration of artificial hormones can alter the normal life cycle undergone by Manduca sexta larvae, which can be useful in agricultural practices to aid in pest controll. Interruption of larval maturation can keep Manduca sexta in its juvenile form where it poses no threat as a pest. There is an insecticide, azadirachtin, that blocks the signaling of ecdysterone hormones, which, if used on Manduca sexta should leave only Juvenile hormone acting on the larvae and prevent transition between larval instars and pupation. We predicted, therefore, that Manduca sexta given food mixed with azadirachtin would cause greater larval growth and prevent the larvae from pupating, compared to those that receive food not treated with azadirachtin.

Materials and Method:
We placed each of eight Manduca sexta larvae in containers separate from each other, with four in a controll group and four more in an experimental group. The four caterpillars in the experimental group received 10 grams of food each, mixed with 6 drops of azadirachtin per 10 grams of food. The controll group also received 10 grams of food each, but mixed instead with 6 grams of distilled water per 10 grams of food. All larvae were incubated and observed for 14 days. We found the mass (in grams) of each caterpillar daily, with the exception of three consecutive days in which weather prevented our access to them. We replaced the larva food as it ran low or dried out, following the same procedure as described above. After data collection analyzed our results with a two-sample t_test.

Results:
Both groups of larvae, one fed azadirachtin and the other not, entered pupation by the end of the experiment. This is accept for larva E1, which did not enter pupation, but displayed signs of a commitment pulse by the end of the experiment. All larvae but C1, E2, and E3 experienced a gain in mass before declining and entering pupation. It was noted that the controll group all pupated at the same time, accept for C1, which pupated on day four. The average change in mass of the controll group was 1.0175 g ± 1.19, and the average change in mass of the experimental group was -1.4325 g ± 0.36 (Figure 1). Thus, the data indicated a significent difference between the change in mass of the Manduca sexta larva fed azadirachtin and those not (t_stat = 3.94, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0076).

Discussion:
Based on our data, our initial hypothesis must be rejected. The larvae fed azadirachtin pupated and showed a trend in a net loss of mass over the experimental period. At the same time, our controll group trended in a net gain in weight. One study found that the administration azadirachtin at low doses resulted in pupation occurring, but where the pupae were mostly defective, while high doses caused incomplete development (Schluter U: 1985). The azadirachtin did not prevent pupation as we hypothesized, but perhaps it caused the pupae that did form to be defective.
