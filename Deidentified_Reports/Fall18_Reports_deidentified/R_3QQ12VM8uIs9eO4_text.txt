Title: Determining ATP production rate in spinacia oleracea chloroplasts exposed to various wavelengths of light by measuring the reduction of DCIP

Abstract:
The production of APT is arguably the most important process that any organism must do. The production is ruled by complex mechanisms that require the movement of protons and electrons to establish protons gradients that complete redox reactions. To measure the production of ATP in chloroplasts, DCIP was used as an electron acceptor in chloroplasts that were exposed to different wavelengths of light. The maximum amount of photosynthetic activity was observed in chloroplasts exposed to green wavelengths of light. 

Introduction:
The production of energy is one of the most crucial life processes that organisms utilize to carry out metabolic and homeostatic processes. In plants, the conversion of solar energy to chemical energy is monitored by a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is split into two main systems – photosystem I and photosystem II – that carry out chemical reactions via the movement of electrons in the presence of sunlight. The outcome of these systems is to create ATP, the energy format that most organisms use to carry out metabolic activity. 
Photosynthesis is summarized by the following equation:
6 CO2 + 12 H2O  C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O 

Part I: Light Reactions
This entire process is ruled by a series of reduction-oxidation reactions that occur in the chloroplast of a plant cell when it is exposed to sunlight. When a chloroplast absorbs sunlight, photons from the light source will excite electrons in the system from the ground state to the higher energy state, the excited state – this will occur in both photosystem I and II; i.e., both photosystems will work together to move the electrons to a state where they have more energy. More specifically, these light-dependent reactions will occur in a membrane inside of the chloroplast called the thylakoid lumen; the two photosystems are integral membrane proteins that are located in the membrane that separates the thylakoid lumen from the chloroplast stroma [Savada et al., 2012]. 

Photosystem II 
Inside the thylakoid lumen, light can enter either of the photosystems; this will determine what is reduced and what is oxidized first. If light enters through photosystem II (PSII), a pair of two excited electrons will move to an electron acceptor (PQB) that will then transfer it to the plastoquinone. As this occurs, PSII will oxidize two water molecules to molecular oxygen; thus, PSII will gain two electrons and four protons. The two electrons in the electron acceptor and the cleaved electrons from the oxidation of water will then be pumped into the plastoquinone. When the plastoquinone (PQ) complex accepts two electrons and two protons, it is reduced to plastoquinol (PQH2). The plastoquinone is also reduced by accepting the electrons from the electron acceptor, which will produce another molecule of PQH2. Each of the plastoquinol compounds will then move and bind to cytochrome b6f; in this complex, plastoquinol will donate two of its electrons and protons – the protons are pumped back into the thylakoid lumen. The electrons are then transferred to the plastocyanin (PC) and then finally, photosystem I (PSI). The two electrons will then be pumped from PSI into the stroma. 

Photosystem I
Unlike the second photosystem, photosystem I uses a different mechanism to complete the redox reaction. This is the system that reduces NADP+ to NADPH.
Light absorbed by photosystem I (PSI) excites electrons that are then transferred to an electron acceptor. This electron acceptor will donate this electron to ferredoxin, a complex that will pump three other electrons into the stroma. Then, using the two electrons that are situated in the stroma (from the reactions in photosystem II) plus the four electrons that came from the ferredoxin complex, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH.  (This process is also known as the Hill reaction)

Part II: ATP Production
The higher proton concentration in the thylakoid lumen will cause protons to move from the lumen (higher concentration) through the ATP synthase to the stroma (lower concentration). This movement of protons activates the phosphorylation of ADP to produce ATP. [Karp, 2016]

Part III: ATP Production and Light
All the complex mechanisms involved in the production of ATP and electron transport chains can be altered by the environment that the chloroplast is exposed to. The spinach (spinacia oleracea) leaves used in this experiment contain green pigments, chlorophyll, that best absorb wavelengths in the violet (450 nm), blue (475 nm), and red (675 nm) sections of the color spectrum. Out of these wavelengths, chlorophyll best absorbs wavelengths in the blue and red sections; it least absorbs green; it reflects it instead. In certain species of alpine plants, the maximum level of photosynthetic activity corresponds with the time of day. In the morning hours, when the most abundant wavelength emitted by the sun is closer to the red spectrum, there tends to be a higher rate of photosynthesis than at midday. [Rabinowitch, 1945]. Similarly, another study showed that for certain tree seedlings, photosynthetic activity during the summer months peaked during two different times of day. The first peak occurred in during the earlier morning hours, when the photons emitted by the sun are closer to the red wavelengths. The second peak occurred towards sundown, when the photons emitted by the sun are towards the blue wavelengths. [Hodges, 1967]. 
In this experiment, spinacia oleracea (spinach) leaves will be exposed to red (780 – 622 nm), blue (492 – 455 nm), and green (577 – 492 nm) light to determine the optimal wavelength of ATP production. Additionally, there will be a group of leaves that will be exposed to fluorescent light, which contains all wavelengths. To determine rate of photosynthesis over a period of thirty minutes, an electron acceptor similar to NADP+ will be used in the Hill reaction. This reducing agent will be 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), a blue compound that once reduced to DCIPH2, becomes colorless. The Hill reaction is shown below; DCIP is a known compound that is used as an electron acceptor in the Hill reaction, it best reacts at a wavelength of 600 nm. [Walker, 2002]
 
The aforementioned studies suggest that red and blue wavelengths are of significent importance in the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis can be maximized by exposing plant chlorophylls to a specific wavelength of light, blue light should be the one that maximizes the rate of photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Method:
Photosynthetic activity in the spinach chlorophyll was tabulated through the observation of the reduction of DCIP in various wavelengths of light. The first step to extract the chloroplast from the spinach leaves. Before performing this, however, the instruments used had to be placed on ice to cool; these instruments included a mortar and pestle, a 250 Ml sized beaker, and three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes. Also, the large central veins were removed from 12 fresh spinach leaves, and then rinsed and dried. After five minutes, 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer in pH 8) was added to the mortar along with spinach leaves. This mixture was grinded until the spinach and buffer formed a thick paste, and then another 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the paste. After mixing, the paste was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the beaker. From the strained liquid, 200 µL were transferred from the beaker to a microtube labeled “Sample A” and then stored on the ice. The remaining liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A” and spun in the RT-7 centrifuge at 200  G for 3 minutes at 4 C. Without transferring the debris from the centrifuge tube, A, the supernatant was transferred into another chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B”. From this tube, 200 µL were transferred to a microtube labeled “Sample of B” and then stored on ice. Centrifuge tube B, the one containing the chloroplast suspension, was spun in a centrifuge at 1,000  G for 10 minutes at 4 C. This final supernatant was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “C” (without transferring the plant debris at the bottom). Also, from centrifuge tube B, 200 µL were collected into a tube and 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to form a suspension; this tube was labeled “Sample of B pellet” and was used to perform the Hill reaction.
In the second part of the experiment, the Hill reaction was utilized to determine the photosynthetic reduction activity of the spinach chloroplasts. For this reaction, 13 test tubes were utilized along with a spectrometer set at a wavelength of 600 nm to quantify the absorbances. The following table summarizes the use of the tubes along with the reagents added to each: 
To begin the Hill reaction, 100 µL of the enriched chloroplasts were added to all thirteen test tubes, mixing the tubes immediately after the addition of the chloroplasts. After the chloroplasts have been added and thoroughly mixed, a small amount is then transferred from each of the tubes into thirteen cuvettes. Data collecting begins by measuring the first absorbances given by the cuvettes placed in the spectrometer. Three of the test tubes (#1-3) were exposed to fluorescent lighting, three other test tubes (#4-6) were placed under a lamp with a red light bulb, another set of three test tubes (#7-9) were placed under a lamp with a blue light bulb, and finally, the last set of three test tubes (#10-13) were placed under a lamp with a green light bulb. After every ten minutes, the cuvettes were removed from their respective environments and the absorbance was recorded. This process was done for a period of 30 minutes and the percent change in each of the absorbance values was calculated using the following equation:
\mathrm{%\ change\ =\ }(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time "N")Absorbance at time zero × 100
		where “N” represents the time intervals of 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes
A two paired t_test was conducted for the data analysis of the final and initial absorbances. Error bars were calculated using the standard deviations of each of the averages. Graphs were utilized to show rates of photosynthetic activity and for the comparison of absorbances for the different wavelengths.


Results:
The highest rate of photosynthetic reduction of DCIP was observed in the chloroplasts that were exposed to the green-light bulbs. From the twenty-minute time point to the thirty-minute cutoff, the DCIP in the cuvettes was almost completely reduced to the colorless DCPH2 compound. This increase in activity can be observed in Figure 3; the chlorophyll activity showed a steeper increase while the activity for the other wavelengths decreased. The second highest rate of photosynthesis was seen in the chloroplasts exposed to the red-light bulb. It also showed a similar increase in rate during the last ten minutes of the experiment, but the change was not as dramatic as those values of the green light. The controll group, the fluorescent light and the blue light showed similar percent changes, with the fluorescent green group being reduced 
Initially, the chloroplasts began with similar absorbances for all the wavelengths. After being exposed to the different wavelengths for a period of thirty minutes, the green-light chloroplasts reduced DCIP to a final absorbance of -0.001±0.112 (p  0.05, t = 26). The red-light chloroplasts had the second highest rate of reduction, at a final absorbance of 0.046±0.164 (p  0.05, t = 12). The blue-light chloroplasts had the lowest rate of reduction, and only reduced half of the original DCIP content and a final absorbance of 0.168±0.218 (p &gt; 0.05, t = 2). The chloroplasts that were exposed to the fluorescent light also showed the same reduction of DCIP as that of the blue-light group; the final absorbance was instead 0.184±0.234 (p &gt; 0.05, t = 2)

Discussion:
The results deviated from the hypothesis: the blue light did not reduce DCIP to the extent that it was hypothesized. The chloroplasts exposed to green-light reduced the DCIP completely; therefore, it was producing the highest rates of ATP. Green light receptors in the axial sides of plant leaves are known to increase the photosynthetic activity [Wang, Noguchi, & Terashima, 2011]. However, for most plants, the highest photosynthetic activity is observed in the blue regions of the spectrum. In this experiment, the decrease in photosynthesis displayed by the blue-light chloroplasts suggests that there were experimental errors in the procedure. When collecting samples, the blue group was always measured first whereas the green group was measured last. This perhaps gave the green sample more time to reduce the DCIP by the time that it was measured in the spectrometer. The blue sample also produced results similar to the controll group; this suggests that the blue wavelength may be the only one that is primarily used during photosynthesis. This still contradicts the founding information, however. The results for the red-light group can be explained by the second peak that is observed in the red regions of the spectrum; the production of ATP should not decrease over time. 
This experiment can be applied to the growing concerns over climate change and the growth of plants. If the optimal wavelength of light for photosynthetic activity can be found, then crops can be grown at faster rates.

Figure 3. Effect of Various Wavelengths on the Reduction of DCIP
Chloroplasts exposed to green light showed the most photosynthetic reduction of the DCIP; at the twenty-minute mark, there was a sharp increase in the reduction of DCIP. The same behavior can be observed in the red-light group, but the reduction was not as large. The chloroplasts exposed to the blue light decreased the DCIP the least; the photosynthetic reduction began to decline at ten minutes. The blue chloroplast group showed almost the same percent change behavior as the fluorescent light (controll group)
