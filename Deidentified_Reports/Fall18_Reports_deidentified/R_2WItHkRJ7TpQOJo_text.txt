Title: Lanthanum trichloride affects migration distance of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The IP3-mediated pathway is a major signaling pathway that involves the production of secondary messengers that bind to a receptor and trigger Ca2+ channels to open. This allows for Ca2+ to bind to calcium-regulated proteins that can stimulate or inhibit a response to the initial stimulus. In this experiment, we studied the effects of Lanthanum trichloride, a calcium channel antagonist, on the growth of Physarum polycephalum. We hypothesize that due to the IP3-mediated pathway, and the necessary presence of Ca2+ for a stimulus response, Lanthanum trichloride would inhibit the growth of Physarum polycephalum. Our hypothesis was neither rejected nor supported as the experiment did not yield viable results due to a systemic problem with the Physarum. This data is important because analyzing the signaling pathways of Physarum polycephalum in response to external stimuli allows for more research to be done on signaling pathways in other organisms with more complicated, and complex systems.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum, a large multinucleated plasmodium that behaves like a single cell, is a model organism whose signal transduction pathways allow the cell to respond to external and internal environments [Guttes: 1961]. This organism behaves as a single giant cell through nuclei synchrony. Although it does not have a nervous system, the network balances the distribution of cellular resources, so the network can maximize the uptake of available nutrients [Ueda: 1976]. Physarum was chosen for this experiment as it is a suitable organism for studying behavior such as chemotaxis as the cell-level processes do not require a microscope for observation [Johnson: 2016].
	In most organisms, most signaling events trigger three specific steps. First, the external or internal stimuli activate a receptor or other protein that acts as a sensor for the stimulus. Secondly, the receptor or other molecules activated during early steps of a signaling pathway cause formation or release of a second messenger, which is a molecule or ion inside the cell that actually triggers the response pathway. Lastly, the second messenger binds to an effector in order to trigger the cell to actually change its behavior and respond to the initial stimulus. Much of the behavior of Physarum is regulated by two major families of receptors, the G-protein coupled receptors and the ion-couple receptors [Johnson: 2016]. The first major signaling pathway is a Ca2+-activated signaling pathway that begins when ions from the external environment diffuse into the cell through the plasma membrane. Many cells have Ca2+ channels on the plasma membrane that open in response to external stimuli. Similarly, in the G-protein coupled signaling pathway, an extracellular event will stimulate a membrane bound receptor that can activate a G-protein complex [Johnson: 2016]. This complex would make a subunit leave and activate an effector enzyme that generates a second messenger, which can diffuse to other sites and activates other enzymes that respond to the initial stimulus. [Ueda: 1976]. Another major signaling pathway is a G-protein coupled pathway, also known as the IP3-mediated pathway. The IP3-mediated pathway involves phospholipase (PLC) which will cleave a membrane phospholipid to produce two second messengers and activate protein kinase. IP3 will then bind to a receptor on the smooth ER and trigger a Ca2+ channel to open and bind Ca2+ to calcium-regulated proteins that either stimulate or inhibit their activity [Johnson: 2016].
	Lanthanum trichloride is a calcium channel antagonist that is responsible for blocking the activity of specific cation channels [Knight: 1997]. In this experiment, the growth of the Physarum will be analyzed to determine if blocking the calcium channels, so that Ca2+ does not enter the cytoplasm will affect the growth of Physarum polycephalum. We hypothesized that Lanthanum trichloride will block Ca2+ from entering the cytoplasm, as described in the IP3 pathway, and will ultimately inhibit the growth of Physarum polycephalum, which we will measure through the use of oatmeal as a food source. 

Materials and Method:
First, we diluted the 20X stock to 1X of Lanthanum trichloride by adding 1 Ml of lanthanum trichloride to 19 Ml of water. 3 water-agar plates were then soaked in the solution for 10 minutes. It is important in this lab to sterilize the forceps and spatula after each use, so a tube of ethanol was prepared. On the back of the plates, a line dividing the plates in half and one large square were drawn. Using the spatula as a scoop, a block of agar was cut and removed from the plate, and the forceps were placed back in the ethanol to re-sterilize. Next, half of the Physarum stock plate was cut into 2 cm blocks and placed in the cut-out blocks of the agar plates. Once the blocks are transferred and securely placed in the agar plates, approximately 5-6 flakes were gently tapped out onto the surface of the water agar. It is important that the oat flakes are spread uniforMly between each plate. Each plate was then taped, wrapped in foil, and placed in a black bag for 24 hours before analyzing the distance that Physarum migrated. Finally, we analyzed our results using a two-sample t_test comparing the controll group, agar plates without lanthanum chloride, and the experimental group

Results:
Figure 1 represents the average distances travelled in the presence and absence of Lanthanum trichloride. In this lab, we expected to observe an inhibition in the growth of Physarum in the presence of Lanthanum chloride, and normal growth in the controll group, however, our results were inconclusive. If our hypothesis was correct, we expected to see a significent difference in distances travelled in the controll group and the experimental group. Hypothetically, if the experiment supported our hypothesis, we would expect the Lanthanum trichloride plates to show a significent decrease in average distance travelled than the Physarum in the water-agar plate. The experimental group, the presence of Lanthanum trichloride, had an average distance travelled of 0.5 mm +/- 0.153. The controll group, the absence of Lanthanum trichloride had an average distance travelled of 1.4 mm +/- 0.20. These results depicted a significent difference (Figure 1).

Discussion:
We hypothesized that the growth of Physarum polycephalum towards a food source, such as oatmeal, would be inhibited by Lanthanum trichloride. However, we were unable to determine if our hypothesis was proven or rejected, as the data was inconclusive.  
	Lanthanum trichloride is a calcium channel antagonist that blocks the cation channels so that Ca2+ does not enter the cytoplasm. In the IP3-mediated pathway, the opening of Ca2+ channels are an essential trigger for a response to an external stimulus. In this signaling pathway, a second messenger is produced from the cleavage of a membrane phospholipid by a phospholipase enzyme, which activates a protein kinase. IP3 binds to a receptor on the smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum and triggers Ca2+ channels to open. To produce a response to the stimuli, these cations bind to calcium-regulated proteins that either stimulate or inhibit their activity. Therefore, we believed that due to the presence of a Ca2+ inhibiting chemical, Lanthanum trichloride, there would be less influx of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm to respond to the stimulus of the food source, and growth of Physarum towards the oatmeal would have been consequently decreased.
	In this experiment, a systemic problem occurred in the Physarum cultures that inhibited normal growth and did not yield viable results. There are several factors that could have affected the growth in the Physarum cultures. One factor that impacted the distance travelled could be the movement of the agar plates in and out of the incubator. Light affects the growth of Physarum, and the movement of the culture in and out of the light could have caused the Physarum to shut down. Specifically, Physarum has been shown to alternate between inactive and active conformations when at different light wavelengths [Starostzik: 1995]. In our experiment, the movements of the plates in-and-out of the incubator, specifically the fluctuation of light and different wavelength environments could have impacted normal growth to shut down. Likewise, the temperature of the incubator could also affect Physarum’s normal growth. In fact, it has been shown that temperature controll is essential for the maintenance and synchrony of Physarum growth, so that the agar plates would need to be stored in an environment that eliminates the localized temperature differences [Mohberg: 1969]. Although we believed the agar plates were sedentary in the incubator throughout the 24 hours, all 6 plates were moved in and out of room temperature and cold temperature that would have affected the overall growth. Other factors that could have contributed to the systemic issue with the culture include the concentration of Lanthanum trichloride. The amount of Lanthanum trichloride in the culture could have been too much for the Physarum to survive in and would shut down growth. In a separate study, Physarum was shown to shut down growth in the presence of high concentrations of other chemicals, therefore it is possible that Physarum did not move due to the amount of Lanthanum trichloride soaked in the agar plate [Knowles: 1978]. Lastly, Physarum could have entered the rest phase in which normal growth would not occur. This could be due to the outside environment, or the internal conditions of the agar cultures.
	Figure 1 shows the expected data if our experiment had been successful. The experimental group had an average distance travelled of 0.5 mm +/- 0.153, compared to the average distance travelled of the controll group, 1.4 mm +/- 0.20. If the results supported our hypothesis, we expected to yield results that showed a significently decreased average distance travelled of Physarum in the experimental group, plates with the presence of Lanthanum trichloride, and the controll group, plates without Lanthanum trichloride (Figure 1). With that said, it is possible that our results were inconclusive due to the lack of Physarum on the stock plates. For future experiments, it is necessary to ensure there is enough Physarum on the stock plate so that there is enough Physarum on the cube that is transferred to the agar plates. If there is not enough Physarum, then the experiment can result in inconclusive or insignificent data.
