Title: The impact of adding additional juvenile hormones to the food of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is found commonly in the American continents. The full life cycle of a tobacco hornworm is about 19-23 days; traveling through the stages of egg/embryo, larva, pupa, and finally the adult stage in which they become moths. It is considered a pest as an larva. Hormones control the life cycle of living organisms and informs the organism when and when not to move onto the next stage of life. We hypothesized that by giving the hornworms more juvenile hormone, methoprene, it would prevent them from pupating and becoming adults while causing them to gain weight faster than those without the juvenile hormone. We used eight tobacco hornworms in total, and split them into two groups; one group received a diet of food with JH, the other received a diet of food with water. The hornworms given the additional JH gained more weight than those that did not receive the JH. Those hornworms also did not pupate, giving us a p-value of 0.037 and supporting our hypothesis.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta hornworms, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, are a species that thrive off of mainly tobacco farmland. As a larva, the Manduca sexta is a pest that can be very dangerous to the growth of the tobacco plant as it will eat the leaves of the plant, leaving not much product left for the farmer. In order for the tobacco hornworm to mature into a moth, they must go through 5 instars and then pupation, which requires juvenile hormone (JH) levels to drop low. JH is produced by the corpus allata, which are a pair of glands in the gut.  JH is the hormone responsible for regulating what type of molt that the hornworm undergoes. In a previous study done, JHE, an enzyme that breaks down the JH, was increased and the Manduca sexta pupated much quicker than those that did not have the JHE increased [Vince :1977]. The JH levels typically drop during the last larval instar, and this drop in JH is in tandem with a rise in ecdysteroids [Vince :1977]. In nature, the hornwormâ€™s JH levels drop normally, and they begin to molt and continue into pupation. We hypothesize that if their food is injected with the JH, preventing the natural drop of JH levels, then the tobacco hornworm will not pupate and will weigh more as a larva than the hornworms not fed the JH injected food.


Materials and Methods:
We separated eight tobacco hornworms into two groups of four and kept them seperate throughout the experiment. Each hornworm was given 10 grams of food as needed, whether the food supply was low or dried out. For the experimental group, we added five drops of methoprene, the JH simulant, for every 10 grams that was supplied to the hornworm. For the control group, they were given 5 drops of water from a pipette for every 10 grams that was supplied. The hornworms were stored in an incubator and were only taken out to be fed and inspected. We weighed the hornworms daily and stopped recording data on the individual as soon as the hornworm had undergone pupation or had died. We used a two-tailed two-sample t-test with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the significance of our data.

Results:
We took the average change in weights of each hornworm before they started pupating and used that as our database. Our control group had an average weight increase of 3.0875 grams and our experimental group had an average weight increase of 8.425 grams. The standard deviation for the control group was 3.71g +/- and was 1.538g +/- for the experimental. We had a t-value of 2.126 and a df value of 6.Our p-value came out to 0.037.


Discussion:
We were able to reject the null hypothesis with a statistically significant result and support the statement that the addition of the JH increased weight gain and prevented pupation from the tobacco hornworms. The addition of the JH caused the tobacco hornworms to not start their pupation because the JH did not decrease as the ecdysone rose as would happen without artificial interference [Vince :1977]. Our experimental group never reached the commitment pulse stage of the 5th instar before they died due to the abnormally high levels of JH. There were some anomalies in our data; one of the control hornworms grew as big as the experimental hornworms; this could be because it accidently was given the JH or had a genetic predisposition that did not allow the production of the JH enzyme. The JH enzyme would break down the JH in the system of the hornworm, lowering its levels. The hornworms began to lose weight as they began to die, causing their weight before death to be lower than it had been previously. This could be countered by taking the highest weight, not the final weight, of the hornworms and using that in the averages. This study is important because farmers can use pesticides that include the juvenile hormone in order to prevent the hornworms from ever becoming adults because the addition of the JH would kill the hornworms, stunting the population growth. In further studies, the specific amount of JH that is most effective is something that could be heavily focused on.
