Title: The Negative Effects of Various Sizes of Betta splendins on Their Levels of Displayed Aggression

Abstract:
Betta splendins social interactions are based on the presence of other members of their species, interactions can be for reproduction or competing. Intraspecific behavior ensures their reproductive and overall success. Aggressive behavior can lead to selection for the most aggressive to have a successful betta in the end. We hypothesized that the size of the Betta splendins will affect the aggression levels displayed by each betta fish being observed when they feel a threat within their territories. This meaning the Betta of similar size will display more aggression than if they were to be one large and small fish competing. To test this, we obtained six male bettas and for five minutes had each fish exposed to a fish of similar size and then with two more of different sizes. The observations were recorded in thirty second intervals and later quantified in rankings of 0-6 to differentiate levels of aggression. the results showed to have significance, meaning our hypothesis was supported, there is a correlation between the size of the betta fish competitor and of the level of aggression that will be displayed. This can be used to have a better understanding on what characteristics are passed down in the betta species for the betta to obtain fitness and reproductive success.

Introduction:
Male Betta splendins social interactions are based on the presence of other members of their species, interactions can be with the intentions of reproducing or competing. In order to be successful within a population, male Betta splendins have to compete for their own territory to reproduce on. This competition is called intraspecific competition, through this competition levels of aggression can be displayed such as their color changing displays along with their facing and broadside movements and other levels of aggression. Their intraspecific behavior is to ensure their reproductive and overall success [Johnson:2016]. It is essential for the male betta fish to establish their territory where females can lay their eggs in, and to do so they need to be more aggressive and pass on that trait to their offspring to ensure their success. this propensity towards aggression led to artificial selection and sexual selection to have the most aggressive and more successful betta in the end [Snekser:2006]. Based on this my group wanted to see if there was anything in specific, like size or another physical trait that could potentially trigger various levels of aggression for a betta fish. This meaning the Betta splendins of various sizes having more aggression towards a specific size in comparison to another. Therefore, we hypothesized that the size of the Betta splendins will affect the aggression levels displayed by each betta fish being observed when they feel a threat within their territories. 

Materials and Method:
My group obtained 6 male Betta splendins. Two of the betta fish are relatively large. Two of the bettas were average sizes, and the last two were relatively small. First, we observed each fish’s behavior while being separated from each other with glass and with a white plastic to prevent them from seeing each other in the beginning. We then removed the white plastic from in between the two large fish but still leaving the glass barrier and for five minutes their behaviors were recorded in thirty-second intervals. Afterwards they were allowed a resting period of five minutes and the same process was done for the two average size fishes and the two small fishes. After allowing all the fish to have a resting period they were then observed how they would behave with different size fish, and we tried using the same three fishes to compare (one large, one average, and one small fish). First, we removed the white plastic from in between the large and small fish and observed for five minutes and behavior recorded for thirty second intervals, afterwards allowing a rest period. The same process was done for the large and average sizes, and average and small. The levels of aggression were recorded based on levels that my group categorized; 0= no reaction and normal behavior, 1= pelvic fin flickering, 2= dorsal fin, 3= tail beating, 4=tail flashing, 5= red mane exposed, 6= red mane and taping on the glass indicating the desire to attack. After quantifying the levels of aggression an Anova test and the Tukey-Kramer test was conducted to determine if there was a significance in the results and if so within what groups. 

Results:
The results are shown to be significent (p value= 0.000144). there was a correlation between size of the betta and the levels of aggression. Based on the data shown in figure 1., there seems to be more aggression towards the betta fish that is of similar size than if it is much larger or smaller, this being shown by the overall means of each pair compared (LxL: 7, std: 4.09, LxM: 8.6, std: 3.8, LxS: 8.5, std: 3.5, MxM 4.2, std: 3.3, SxS: 5.3, std: 2.4 MxS: 1.8, std: 1.07). when a Tukey-Kramer test was conducted the groups that showed to be significent were large versus average size and the average size versus small size groups.

Discussion:
	The hypothesis was supported. The results showed to be significent (p value= 0.000144), meaning that the size of the betta did have an effect their levels of aggression displayed.  As shown on figure 1., there seemed to be more aggression towards the betta fishes of similar size meaning there was more threat to them and need for competition than if it were a small fish and large fish were together. This assumption was also supported with the Tukey-Kramer test that showed the groups that did have significent values were the large versus average size betta and the average size versus the small size betta. Peeke, et. Al [1970] seemed to have results showing the lack of threat that fish of different sizes displayed, when observed various groups total display was measured the results were that fish habituate more rapidly with the presence of fish of different sizes. [Peeke: 1970]. Meaning that the groups with a larger difference overtime habituate, because the larger fish do not find it the smaller fish as threatening therefore do not display aggression as often, this potentially supporting our hypothesis. Some places of error that could have affected our results are with the selection in the size variation the betta fish; there were no drastically larger or smaller fish when choosing them for the experiment. Meaning they were all relatively similar in size and the results could have been more obvious or different had the sized been evidently different. This experiment helped explain the betta fish’s natural intraspecific agnostic behavior and what triggers their aggression at different levels when attempting to ensure reproductive success. This is due to the need for male betta fish to establish territories where they can build nests for the females to lay their eggs in [Snekser:2006]. Paternal care by the males is essential for the eggs, if male is removed, the eggs fail to develop or hatch [Johnson:2016]. This experiment is essential in explaining how reproductive success is achieved among the species of Betta splendins as well as what characteristics are favored for a betta to have in order to be considered fit and successful within the betta species. It also can help explain the evolutionary success of the aggression traits. In previous studies it has been shown that the aggressive displays in B. splendins are an honest indicator of male condition and/or motivation [Doutrelant: 2001]. More experiments testing ways to stimulate different levels of aggression can help further explain their intraspecific behavior.
