Title: The effect of caffeine on neuromuscular activity

Abstract:

In this experiment, we looked at the influence of caffeine on the neuromuscular activity. We did this by injecting 0.1Ml of the chemical in the gastrocnemus muscle, in the leg of the Rania Pipiens. We connected the frog leg to the iWorx TA data acquisition device and measured 5 pre- and post-injection contraction amplitudes. We executed this with three different legs. Our hypothesis was that the injection of caffeine will cause an increase in amplitude of gastrocnemus muscle contraction. As a result, the contraction amplitude in all three legs was higher after the caffeine injection, which supports our hypothesis because the statistic test was significent (the p_values of the three legs were respectively 1.04E-9, 1.25E-10 and 6.33E-7). This is because caffeine enhances calcium release from the ryanodine receptor. When calcium is released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds troponin and lets myosin and actin bind. This results in a muscle contraction. As long as calcium is present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle will stay contracted. Because of the large amount of caffeine injected compared to the size of the muscle, the calcium release was sustained, which preserved the muscle contraction

Introduction:

The Rania Pipiens, also called the northern leopard frog, is the amphibian we worked with in this experiment. We observed the influence of the chemical caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle, which is located in the frog leg. The organization of the somatic neuromuscular system is as follows: skeletal muscle consists of thousands of myofibers, which are aggregates of cells with a cylindrical shape and multiple nuclei. Those myofibers bind together with connective tissue to form functional groups. Motor neurons supply energy to the skeletal muscle, whose axons extend into a muscle and then branch out to trigger several individual myofibers. This happens at places called neuromuscular junctions. As soon as a nerve impulse reaches the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. The second step is the bonding of ACh with its receptor on the muscle fiber membrane. This connection opens the sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber by depolarizing it. The action potential will then spread in the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of Ca2+ stimulates the contraction of the muscle by uncovering the myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments. 
Caffeine is a chemical that is found in coffee, tea, and other products. This means a lot of people consume amounts of caffeine at least once a day. It is most commonly used to improve mental alertness, but it has many other uses and a lot of people get addicted to it. It is interesting to experiment with this chemical, because it is the most widely consumed central nervous system stimulant [Nehlig: 1992]. This study described several influences of caffeine on the central nervous system and the brain. Firstly, caffeine increases energy metabolism throughout the brain but decreases at the same time cerebral blood flow, inducing a relative brain hypoperfusion. Secondly, caffeine activates noradrenaline neurons and affects the local release of dopamine. Thirdly, many of the alerting effects of caffeine may be related to the action of the methylxanthine on serotonin neurons. The methylxanthine induces increases in locomotor activity in animals. The effects of caffeine on learning, memory, performance and coordination are rather related to the methylxanthine action on arousal, vigilance and fatigue. Finally, caffeine exerts obvious effects on anxiety and sleep. Unfortunately, the central nervous system does not seem to develop a great tolerance to the effects of caffeine although dependence and withdrawal symptoms are reported. Our hypothesis is that the injection of caffeine will cause an increase in amplitude of gastrocnemus muscle contraction, because it induces the release of dopamine (as cited above), which leads to more signals to the muscles. Secondly, caffeine helps our physical awareness, which is why we think it would increase the muscle contraction because they have to sustain this awareness.

Materials and Method:
By dissecting the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve of the Rania Pipiens, we were able to measure the neuromuscular activity. We did this by connecting the frog leg to the iWorx TA data acquisition device. In the first place, we looked for the threshold. In the second place, to record the summation, we gradually increased the frequency. We measured the neuromuscular activity at 4, 5, 25, 50, 75 and 100 Hz. The number of pulses was 0, the pulse width 5msec and the amplitude between 0.4V and 1V. After this, we injected 0.1Ml of caffeine while recording the neuromuscular activity on the computer. The injection happened in different spots in the leg, so the caffeine was well spread out over the entire muscle. After recording the twitch threshold, we added 0.50V to the threshold value and used the result as the stimulus amplitude for the recording of pre- and post-injection contraction amplitude values. We calculated 5 pre- and post-injection values. We repeated this for two other legs and ran a paired t_test.

Results:

In the first leg, the average of the contraction amplitude before the injection of caffeine is 0.4538+/-0.005020V. After the injection, the average is 0.7558+/-0.002683 V. For the second leg, the average of the contraction amplitude before the injection of caffeine is 0.0472+/-0.004658 V. After the injection, the average counts 1.022+/-0. In the third leg, the average of the contraction amplitude before the injection of caffeine is 1.3408+/-0.02066 V. In all three legs, the contraction amplitude was higher after the caffeine injection. The p_values of the three legs were respectively 1.04E-9, 1.25E-10 and 6.33E-7. The t-values counted respectively 275.6870, 467.9190 and 55.4465. The degrees of freedom were 4 in all three legs. A general trend is that the amplitudes stayed nearly similar throughout the 5 measurements for the pre- and post-injections. That’s why the standard deviations are small. A major observation is that the muscles got really hard after the injection of caffeine.


Discussion:
The statistical test was significent, because the p_value is lower than 0.05. This means the null hypothesis can be rejected. Our hypothesis was supported because the amplitude of muscle contraction increased after the injection of caffeine. We made two mistakes in our experiment. Firstly, we didn’t increase the threshold potential with 0.50V to use as the stimulus amplitude in the second leg to measure the pre- and post-injection values, but we used the threshold value for these measurements. Secondly, not all of the 0.1Ml caffeine got inside the muscle during the injection of the second leg, because some dripped on the outside. Caffeine can enhance contractile force during submaximal contractions by potentiating calcium release from the ryanodine receptor [Tarnopolsky:2008]. When calcium is released in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, it binds troponin and lets myosin and actin bind. This results in a muscle contraction. As long as calcium is present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle will stay contracted. This is why the muscle got so hard, because the caffeine caused a sustained contraction and there was such a big amount of it, that every part of the muscle contracted. The ergogenic effect of caffeine on endurance exercise performance is multifactorial; however, there is evidence for an effect on both the central nervous system and the excitation–contraction coupling of skeletal muscle. Studies have also shown that caffeine can have a direct effect on skeletal muscle that could be ergogenic. Furthermore, the potentiation of force during submaximal electrical stimulation is identical in habitual and nonhabitual caffeine consumers [Tarnopolsky:2008].
