Title: The extent to which the pupation process is hindered in Manduca sexta that have been treated with azaguard. 

Abstract:
Pest controll is a significent topic to be discussed in the agricultural realm of biology. In order to most effectively regulate the growth of insects, it is necessary that biological knowledge is used to reduce the pest population in a humane and safe manner. Two main hormones affect the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, juvenile hormone and ecdysterone. Here we observe the effect that azaguard has on the development of this insect, where the expectation is that it inhibits the molting process and hinders the progression into adulthood. Our data showed a significent difference in the growth of the controll Manduca sexta as compared to that of the Manduca sexta treated with azaguard. This significance, along with the qualitative observations of the insects’ physical states, suggests that the azaguard prevents the development of the insect into the pupal phase. This is a beneficial finding as it provides evidence of the efficacy of azaguard as a pest growth regulator. 

Introduction:
The main focus of this experiment is hormones and how such chemicals affect the development of insects. In mammals, a multitude of hormones contribute to the growth and development of the organism. When hormone levels allow, the mammal progresses into a maturing process known as puberty, which allows the body of the mammal to make biochemical changes so that it may function as an adult. A parallel process to puberty is scene in insects, which is called molting. The Manduca sexta is an insect that develops through a holometabolous cycle, which makes it a model organism to study the effects of different levels of hormones. Such a cycle is “characterized by a dramatic modification of morphology, diet, and partition habitats between adults and juveniles, occurring when individuals become reproductively mature” [Nel:2007]. Throughout the duration of this process, there are five instars (each of which are achieved through molting), a pupa, and an adult moth [Johnson:2016]. In order to progress to each instar, the Manduca sexta is dependent on two main hormones, ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone. For the purposes of this experiment, the main focus will be on 20E, as the question being proposed is to what extent it the pupation process hindered in Manduca sexta that have been treated with azaguard? Ecdysterone is responsible for regulating the timing of molting during insect development. During the holometabolous cycle, the insect experiences periodic spikes in 20E levels which are necessary to progress them into the next stage of development. Azaguard is a chemical that acts as a 20E inhibitor by blocking the molting of a larvae into the next stage of development. According to a recent study conducted on infestation by aphids on celery plants, azaguard provides effective pest controll due to its ability to regulate the growth of the insects [Dara:2015]. I hypothesize that when six drops of azaguard are placed into the food of four Manduca sexta, those four caterpillars will not molt as quickly, if at all, as those four caterpillars that did not receive the azaguard treatment. 

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into two equal groups. Four caterpillars were placed into a plastic container with air holes, labeled “Control”, with four separate compartments for each caterpillar. The remaining four caterpillars were placed into an identical plastic container, labeled “Experimental”. The four controll caterpillars were fed 10g each of the Manduca diet, damped with 6 drops of water per 10g of food to ensure moisture. The four experimental caterpillars were fed 10g each of the Manduca diet, dampened with 6 drops of azaguard per 10g of food. All caterpillars in this experiment were kept in the same incubator environment. Data on each caterpillars’ appearance and weight were collected every day for 14 days. Each day, a new batch of food was prepared to ensure proper moisture of the food. A one-tailed t test was used to compare the weight gain of the controll group and that of the experimental group. 

Results:
There is an obvious trend of an overall growth of the controll group caterpillars and an overall stagnation in the growth of the experimental caterpillars. The mean weight growth for the controll group was 4.76g and the mean weight growth for the experimental group was 0.53g (Table 2). The standard deviation for the controll group weight growth was 2.41 and the standard deviation for the experimental group weight growth was 1.63 (Table 2). The results of this data are clearly depicted in a graph format (Fig. 1). A one-tailed t test was used to analyze the results of the data collected. The result of the one-tailed t test was that the mean of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat= 2.903418, d.f.=6, P=0.013606). When the two groups of caterpillars were observed on the final day, there was an obvious difference between the two groups. The controll group reached pupation, while the experimental group did not (and were all dead). 

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that when six drops of azaguard are placed into the food of four Manduca sexta, those four caterpillars will not molt as quickly, if at all, as those four caterpillars that did not receive the azaguard treatment, was supported. There was an observed significent difference, which suggests that the presence of azaguard in the diet of Manduca sexta negatively affects the development of the insect to the point where molting is not possible. Past studies have confirmed this finding, within the larger context of agricultural pest controll, supporting the fact that inhibiting the molting process will result in the reduction of the pest population [Dara: 2015]. This explains why each of the experimental caterpillars died by the end of the study, as they were unable to molt into the pupa phase due to the lack of ecdysterone in their bodies. Since the experimental caterpillars were unable to molt, they remained in a stagnant juvenile phase but were unable to be sustained in the juvenile phase long-term. It is unclear if the azagaurd specifically had an effect on the growth rate of the caterpillars. The weight growth data in the context of this experiment was only considered for the purpose of showing the approximate timing of the molting of each group. This is due to the fact that ecdysterone is the hormone responsible for the timing of molting not the actual growth of the insect [Johnson:2016]. A further experiment could test azaguard to this effect by more intensely measuring the growth of the Manduca sexta in weight, length, and percentage of food consumed over a longer period of time. In the broader context of agriculture however, this experiment proved azaguard to be effective in regulating the development of insects before they became adult pests. By hindering the development of adult pests, agriculturists are able to preserve their crops in a healthier manner, both in regards to environmental safety and consumer safety.
