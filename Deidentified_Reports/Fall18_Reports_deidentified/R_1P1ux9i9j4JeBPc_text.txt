Title: Acidity and neutral soil causing an increase or decrease on buckwheat’s root to shoot ratio growth

Abstract:
Under the concern of what would be the optimum pH of a soil for buckwheat to grown under, an experiment was conducted where two environments were provided, varying in pH. One being more acidic at approximately pH 3, and the other being neutral at pH 7. Soil pH often varies in natural environments as well as treated farmlands. PH itself often causes chemical disorder in the soil when not at an optimum level, in turn, affecting the nutrition availability for the plant. The varying pH levels chosen were used to represent two different habitats that occur outside of the laboratory. The most conducive environment between the two would provide the highest availability of nutrition. It was then predicted that the more acidic domain would result in a lower root to shoot ratio, after concluding that it provided the better catalyst for nutrient absorption in the roots. To test that hypothesis, it was necessary to expose multiple pots of buckwheat solely to the acidic environment. To accomplish this, a pH 3 solution was used to hydrate the buckwheat pots. To test the neutrally grown buckwheat, they were required to be hydrated with water, as it is a neutral liquid. Although, the end results were not numerically significant, there was a slight difference in the root to shoot ratios of the tw

Introduction:
In order to learn what soil conditions provides the best outcome for buckwheat growth, two separate environments were created to expose the plant to different settings. Buckwheat acts as a suitable candidate due to its durability and growth results when planted in soil with more aeration, instead of tightly packed; which for this environment, coordinates appropriately. The deciding factor of what environmental pH produced the most vital organism, the root to shoot ratio was applied. The root to shoot ratio is credited by the knowledge of nutrient and resource distribution by the plant. Plants are organisms that optimizes their total growth depending on their environment [Agren: 2003]. Environmental cues lead to the plant allocating its resources to the developmental stages that will produce the highest possibility of survival and reproduction [Bennett, Roberts, [Wagstaff: 2012]. When resources aren’t as readily available above ground, the plant is forced to direct a more substantial portion of its materials towards its roots, allowing them to expand further to provide the adequate supplements to sustain the plant. In habitats that are nutrient rich or provide substantial resources above ground don’t require the plant to allocate its resources towards its roots, instead, it can allow growth of the shoot. In the concern of whether acidic conditions would provide a higher availability of nutrients for absorption, the two environments that were generated consisted of a neutral soil base at a pH of 7, the control, and an acidic soil base of approximately pH 3, the independent variable. To determine whether the acidic or neutral soil provides a better domain for the root maturity, it is possible to compare the resulting ratio of the lengths of buckwheat roots and shoots. The soil that is more conducive will have a lower root to shoot ratio because the buckwheat won’t be required to allocate resources to the development of its roots. It has also been found that buckwheat absorbs more nutrients, such as P_2 O_5, Nitrogen, and K_2 O when it’s grown under more acidic circumstances [Cornell University, 2009]. Due to these results, it was hypothesized that buckwheat would have a lower root to shoot ratio when grown in soil possessing approximately a pH 3 rather than a pH of 7. This would mean, the buckwheat grown in acidic conditions would more readily available nutrients than buckwheat grown under neutral conditions as a result of the more acidic environment not having to allocate its resources towards root growth.

Materials and Methods:
The experiment began by pre-soaking the buckwheat seeds in water for thirty minutes as the planting pots were prepared. Because it is necessary to have multiple sources to draw information from, three 4x 4-inch pots were made for each pH environment, resulting in a total of six pots of vermiculite, the chosen soil. After labeling the pots appropriately by the intended pH, the pots were watered, and each had 50 mLs of miracle grow added to the vermiculite.  In each pot, twelve indentations approximately three times the size of the buckwheat seed were made in the vermiculite in three rows of four. A seed was placed in each indentation of each pot before being covered with vermiculite. Two large black trays constructed with holes in the base were used to hold the two separate pH domains.  The following two weeks, once a day, the pots were watered, the pH 7 control with neutral water and the acidic environment with a solution of a 3.6 pH. After the week had passed, the plants were collected. From each pot, nine buckwheat plants were removed with care to not damage the roots or shoots of the plant. After the dirt was removed, each individual plant was weighed. After recording the data of the whole individual organism, the plant was separated where the root connected to the shoot of the plant. The shoot was then weighed. Using the recorded shoot weight, it was possible to calculate the root weight as well. From each set of nine from each pot, the maximum root and shoot length were then recorded to the nearest mm. To conclude whether the more acidic environment produced significant results compared to the neutral environment, a two-sample t-test was applied to the average root and shoot lengths of the buckwheat. 

Results:
The results of the root to shoot length ratio of the neutral environment was found to have a mean of 0.45830, and a standard deviation of 0.13592. The more acidic environment produced a mean of 0.56342 for the root to shoot ratios with a standard deviation of 0.10750. The p value of root to shoot length ratios is 0.206989 and its t value is 1.022786.

Discussion:
As seen in the results, there is a slight difference in in the root to shoot ratio of buckwheat found in the two separate environments of the vermiculite. The ratio found with a pH of approximately 3 is slightly lower than that of pH 7 as hypothesized, but when evaluating the p-value, the results show there is no significance difference. Therefore, the stated hypothesized is not supported, despite the slight variation. The variation more than likely developed from the slightly more efficient absorption provided by the acidic domain [Cornell University, 2009]. Possible explanations as to why it didn’t produce a significant difference and support the hypothesis could result from the acidic solution being to strong; in other words, the pH was too low to cultivate a root to shoot ratio that was expected by preventing optimum nutrients absorption. This could have resulted from the acidic environment disrupting the chemical composition of the soil, lowering the nutrient availability. From this knowledge, it seems there could be a pH threshold for the absorption. To determine the threshold for optimum nutrient availability, there would be a necessity for more buckwheat plants exposed to a wider range of pHs. In the future, it would be beneficial to provide addition subjects that are exposed to varying pHs between the two chosen, approximately pH 3 and pH 7, to allow insight as to if the solution was truly too acidic to allow optimum nutrient absorption and result in a lower root to shoot ratio. From the data collected, based on the resulting root to shoot lengths, it shows there’s not a significant variation in resource allocation between the two environments.
