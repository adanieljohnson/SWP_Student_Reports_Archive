Title: Effect on weight for Manduca sexta by added JH hormone to Food

Abstract:
The regulation of maturation in animals and insects is usually controlled by hormones. Juvenile hormone (JH) is a hormone that is involved in the metamorphosis of a caterpillar known as Manduca Sexta. According to previous research if JH levels do not drop a caterpillar will only grow into the 5th instar larva stage but not pupate. Our experiment shows the effect of external JH on the weight on Manduca Sexta. We hypothesized that that the experimental group will not pupate and will continue to grow much larger in size compared to the control group. We used eight caterpillars, four in the control and four in the experimental. Both groups were put in the same conditions, of temperature, space and amount of food. The only difference was that the experimental group had 4 drops of JH in their food and the control did not. We recorded their weight over 2 weeks as well as any observations on activity level, food consumption and appearance. Our data supported our hypothesis and based on the two-sample t-test we ran, our results for the average increase in weight in the control vs. the experimental were statistically significant. This conclusion came from our calculation of P-value with a 95% confidence interval utilizing the t-test.

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in the growth and development of organisms. A change in hormone levels has proven to have varying effects on organisms. For example, a caterpillar, also known as the Manduca Sexta, goes through a series of molts and stages before becoming a moth. Each of these stages is regulated by the varying levels hormones, one that is particularly important is called the juvenile hormone (JH). In a caterpillar JH is naturally secreted fluctuating at different points in the its life. When the caterpillar is at the 5th instar larva stage and has grown enough, it undergoes through the commitment pulse in which JH levels drop and the caterpillar molts into a pupa. The presence of JH prevents the caterpillar from going from larval to pupal stage. In a previous experiment done on Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster, it was discovered that when external JH was added at a critical time the molt from larvae to pupal will not occur [Riddiford: 2003]. Our group was very interested in this phenomenon and we wanted to expand on this. We wanted to see the effects of external JH had on a caterpillar if it was given consistently throughout its growth. Therefore, we propose an experiment where we give our experimental group a consistent source of external. We hypothesized that the experimental group will not pupate and will continue to grow much larger in size compared to the control group.


Materials and Methods:
We started off by separating eight caterpillars into two groups; control or experimental, four caterpillars in each group. In the control group we numbered the caterpillars one through four and placed in each one in its own labeled compartment in a divided container. For the experimental group, we did the same thing except we numbered the caterpillars five through eight. Then we weighed each caterpillar to measure the starting weight (Day 0) of each and recorded a total of eight weights. Each caterpillar received five grams of food, but the experimental groups food had 4 drops of JH hormone mixed into their food and the control did not. All other variable between the caterpillars remained consistent including; temperature, space, and amount of food. Over the next two weeks, each day we remeasured five grams of food for each caterpillar and recorded the weight for each. We also recorded any observations in color, activity level, and whether they were all still alive and if they were pupating. We did make a change to this routine was on Day 6 each caterpillar ate all of their food by the time we came to remeasure the food, therefore we changed from five grams of food to ten grams of food. We still gave the experimental group four drops in their food, but now there was ten grams instead of five grams of food. Therefore, we changed the concentration of JH in the caterpillars food. Due to external circumstances, we did not record weights on days four and ten through twelve. The last day of the experiment was day 14 in which we obtained a final weight. With the weight collected we used this data to calculate; the average weight of the control group vs. the experimental group and the average growth per day of the control vs. the experimental. To test is our results were significant or not we used a two-sample t-test comparing the average growth between the two groups. The alpha value we compared our results was .05, meaning any p-value of under .05 meant that the results were significant.


Results:
Our data showed 2 things; an overall higher increase in weight in the experimental group and a higher weight day by day in the experimental group. We ran one two-sample t-test on on Fig.1 which showed that our results for the overall increase in weight were significant. Our statistical test showed (t-stat =5.58, df =6, P&lt; 0.005). Our control group had an average weight growth of 9.74g and the experimental group averaged 16.77g, making the difference between the two group 6.98g. Our day by day growth comparison shown in Fig.2 shows a higher difference in weight between the control and experimental group on Day 5 and continuing until the end of the experiment. We did not run a statistical test on this figure, however it shows a similar trend to the one seen in Fig.1. Our observations taken down during the study focused on their activity levels, amount of food eaten and feces. Up until day 4 all the caterpillars were very inactive and were not moving unless picked up. However as the days progressed the control group seemed to be much more active then the control. Also the experimental group usually ate all if not most of their food whereas the control group ate less. We also noticed a color difference, on day 8 the control group had darker markings on their backs while the experimental group were very bright blue. Lastly the control group actually pupated and were in their cocoons by the end of the experiment, on Day 9 caterpillars one and two began to turn brown and by day 14 all of the control group caterpillars were in cocoons. None of the experimental caterpillars puapted and still had bright blue color with no visible signs of darker markings on them.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by our data, because none of the caterpillars in the experimental group pupated and they had a higher average change in weight. Our results, after statistical testing using a two-sample t-test with the basis that of a p value lower than .05, showed that our data was significant for the overall average weight of the control group vs. the experimental group Meaning, that overall, the average weight of the experimental group was much higher than the control and that data was significant. Therefore, we can conclude that the external addition of JH in the food of a group of Manduca sexta significantly increase their weight, over a 2-week period, compared to a group that does not have JH added. In figure 2. we see that the experimental group weight showed a positive trend while the control group weight increased at a much slower rate than the experimental and then the weight of the caterpillars in the control begins to decrease. Some anomalies during our experiment was that our experiment lasted 15 days but we only recorded weights for 11 of those days. To improve this experiment in the future we would like to record the weight every day to combat any issues of loss data due to random circumstances. This experiment focused on the weight of the Manduca Sexta, however previous research has been done where data is collected on a molecular basis. Physiological factors are very important, but a step further would be looking at the molecular level and seeing the effects of JH and potentially other hormones [Riddiford:2003].
