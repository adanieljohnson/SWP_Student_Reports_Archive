Title: Effect of pH on light absorbance of the chloroplasts of [Spinacia oleracea]

Abstract:
In this lab we studied the effects of varying pH on the photosynthetic rate of the chloroplasts derived from [Spinacia oleracea]. We hypothesized that if the chloroplasts are placed in an acidic environment at a pH of 5, then absorbance of light will decrease over time and if they are placed in a basic environment of pH 10 then absorbance of light will decrease. We grinded the chloroplasts up and made four assays of no chloroplasts, neutral chloroplasts, basic chloroplasts, and acidic chloroplasts to which we put in the mass spectrophotometer to measure absorbance of light which is an indication of the chlorophyll activity and a proxy of photosynthetic rate. We found that our results were insignificant as our p value was 0.704 at three degrees of freedom which was larger than our alpha value of 0.05. Therefore, our hypothesis was not supported most likely because of the tendency of the chloroplasts to alter their absorbances in order to maintain homeostasis. We will repeat the experiment with more pH`s and eventually test other factors that affect photosynthetic rate.

Introduction:
The plant`s chloroplasts are responsible for the absorption of light through the presence of the chlorophyll pigment within them [Sudhir: 2004]. This pigment is used to absorb light energy and contributes to the photosynthetic rate as the more light absorbed the faster photosynthesis can proceed [Sudhir: 2004] Photosynthesis takes place in the plant-specific organelle chloroplast, with the light dependent reactions taking place within the thylakoids and the light independent reaction taking place within the stroma [Scheibe: 2005]. In the light-dependent reactions the water is split into electrons which help reduce NADP+ to NADPH and a proton gradient activates ATP synthase which phosphorylates ADP to ATP [Scheibe: 2005]. In this experiment we will be using spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea, as their chloroplasts will be easily isolated and are easily torn in order to remove the veins. Photosynthesis is a process central to many organisms due to its products of glucose and oxygen, which aerobic organisms need [Scheibe: 2005]. However, there are many different factors that may affect photosynthetic rates of a plant from the temperature, the salt concentration of the soil, and the accessibility of light/water [Scheibe: 2005]. We are most interested in how the pH affects the chloroplasts` rate of photosynthesis or primary productivity as we already know that a neutral pH of about 6-7 is ideal for plants [Xu: 2017]. This is because at this pH there is a steady amount of hydrogen ions in the lumen and stroma of the chloroplasts which would allow for the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and for ADP to become ATP through the H+ concentration formed [Xu; 2017]. If it is too acidic then the plant would die and if too basic the same effect due to lacking H+ ions which would prevent photosynthesis from occurring [Xu: 2017]. We will be using the amount of light absorbed by the chloroplasts to determine the rate of photosynthesis as the greater the absorbance the greater the rate of photosynthesis. We predict that if the chloroplasts are placed in an acidic environment at a pH of 5, then the change in absorption will decrease over time and if they are placed in a basic environment of pH 10 then change in absorption will decrease.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we split our methods into two exercises. For our first one we started by cooling a mortar and pestle, acquiring a medium beaker (150-250 mL), and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes in crushed ice. While the mortar and pestle was cooling we removed the large central veins from four medium sized spinach leaves. We then blotted the leaves and put them into the mortar and pestle. After this we added 10 mL of cold grinding puffer and grinded it until a thick paste was formed. We once again added 10 mL of grinding buffer and strained it through three layers of cheesecloth in to the medium breaker. From this we transferred 200 uL into a microtube labeled sample of A and stored it on ice. With the remaining green paste, we placed it in a chilled 50 mL centrifuge marked “A” and spun it at 1200 rpm for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. After it was centrifuged we poured the supernatant out of the tube into a second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. We then removed 200 uL of the liquid from the 50 mL tube marked “B” and placed it in a microtube labeled “sample of B” and stored on it on ice. We then centrifuged the 50 mL. tube “B” at 2800 rpm for 10 min. at 4 degrees Celsius. After it was spun we poured the supernatant into a 50 mL tube marked “C” and placed tube “B” on ice. We added 15 ml. grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. We transferred this resuspended pellet in to three 5 mL. volumes and put these volumes into three conical tubes. We then added 5 mL of pH buffer to each tube and spun again at 2800 rpm at 10 min. at four degrees Celsius and resuspended the pellets in 3 mL of grinding buffer after spinning. For the last part of this exercise we removed 200 uL from tube C and placed it in a microtube labeled sample of C and stored it on ice.
For exercise two we first labeled thirteen large test tubes and placed them in a tube rack. In one tube we made a blank which just had 8 mL. of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. We then made three tubes which had no chloroplasts, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. We made three tubes of neutral chloroplasts with 6 mL. of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. We made three tubes of acidic chloroplasts with 5 mL. of water, 2 mL. of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL. of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 1 mL. pH buffer 5. Lastly, we made three tubes of basic chloroplasts with 5 mL. of water, 2 mL. of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 1 mL. of pH buffer 10. We started the assay by adding 100 uL of enriched chloroplasts to the blank tube and tubes 4-12 (everyone except the no chloroplasts group). We then mixed them and transferred them to spec. cuvettes. We immediately blanked spec at tube 0 and measured absorbances of all samples followed by placing them under grow light. After ten minutes we blanked the spectrophotometer and recorded all absorbances at 600 nm. We then placed our samples under grow light again and repeated this process after twenty minutes (cumulatively) and thirty minutes (cumulatively).
We then used an ANOVA test for our statistical tests using the averages of the percent changes for each group, turning negative percentages to positive, at three degrees of freedom and then used a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis to determine significance using 0.05 as our alpha value.


Results:
Other than the no chloroplasts, which stayed relatively the same, decreasing slightly, throughout the thirty minutes the rest of the groups had a trend similar to an exponential decay. The acidic chloroplasts started at 178.6%, then went to 2.08%, and at the end was 0.521%. The basic chloroplasts started at 67.06%, went to 24.65%, and at the end was 7.101%. The neutral chloroplasts started at 95.2%, then went to 6.5%, and at the end was 1.41%. Our assay with no chloroplasts started at 3.05%, went to 2.22%, and at the end was 0.831%. We used an ANOVA test to determine that at 3 degrees of freedom we had a p-value of 0.704 which was over our alpha-value of 0.05 so our results were not significant.

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis as our results were not significant and therefore there was not a large enough difference between our results of the four groups to determine whether one pH elicited a greater or less effect on percent change in absorbance. It is already established that the most efficient pH to place plants in is neutral conditions and that putting them under acidic and basic conditions would eventually lead to plant death [Xu: 2017]. However according to figure 1, absorbance of acidic chloroplasts had the greatest percent change and neutral was in between acidic and basic in terms of its percent change. According to the article, the percent change should be greatest in neutral and should steadily increase as the more time that elapses the more time the leaf has to photosynthesize and therefore absorb [Xu: 2017]. While the basic and acidic should have a steady decrease in absorbance and not have as great a change between the first two time intervals [Xu: 2017]. A potential reason for this change is the tendency of chloroplasts to try to maintain homeostasis and therefore the chloroplasts, depending on the pH they were placed in, changed their absorbance to compensate for the varying pH. As stated before plants like a pH of seven in most cases because that allows for a steady flow of hydrogen ions for the reduction of NADP+ and for ATP synthase to phosphorylate ADP [Xu: 2017]. However, during acidic conditions, the plant has too many H+ ions so it wants to increase photosynthesis as it is placed in low pH in order to maintain homeostasis [Scheibe: 2005]. This would help maintain homeostasis as if the chloroplasts increase absorption of light more photosynthesis would occur which would lead to more H+ ions being used for the purposes mentioned previously and therefore the pH would increase back to the ideal, neutral six to seven range [Scheibe: 2005]. This would explain why there was such a large increase in percent change at first with it increasing absorption 178.6% as the plant desperately needed to increase the pH quickly or else risk death from the great acidity it was in. The small percentage changes of 2.07% and 0.521%, as shown in figure 1, demonstrate that it achieved this homeostasis with the first increase of absorption as it did not need to change the amount too much after this great increase. As for basic conditions we saw change in absorption because the chloroplasts did not have the hydrogen ion concentration for reduction or to form water as a waste product which meant that photosynthesis would not occur at a great rate and therefore there is no need for the chlorophyll to absorb light [Scheibe: 2005]. Therefore, the basic chloroplasts greatly changed how much light they are absorbing as the light energy would not be able to be used for anything and therefore would be a waste to absorb [Scheibe: 2005]. After it established how much light should be absorbed in order to maintain homeostasis the basic chloroplasts started to decrease how much they changed their absorbance over time as they approached the amount of light they needed for homeostasis [Xu: 2017]. This explains the steady drop in percent changes in figure 1. If we repeat the experiment we would have a greater range of pH to test and we would do it over a longer time interval with more frequent checks on the absorbances in order to have more data and see more accurately the effect of pH on the percent change of absorbance. After we do this we can test other factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis such as salt, temperature, soil mineral composition to see how we can maximize plant photosynthesis as much of the organisms are aerobic and rely on plants ability to produce oxygen.
