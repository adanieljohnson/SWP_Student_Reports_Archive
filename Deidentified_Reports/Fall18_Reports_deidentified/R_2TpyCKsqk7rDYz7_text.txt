Title: The Calculation of Root-to-Shoot Ratios to Determine Resource Allocation Method in Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
With temperatures rising, water evaporating, and species disappearing, climate change continues to prove that increased human activity and exploitation of fossil fuels has its consequences. As a result, more and more of the global biosphere becomes susceptible to permanent destruction, particularly plant species, which take up a substantial amount of the earth's surface. This study works to explore how plants can allocate their resources in adjustment to temperature changes, and the extent to which phenotypic plasticity plays a role in a plant's ability to survive and adapt during these circumstances. Our study focuses on field peas, classified scientifically as Pisum sativun L., and states that if two pea plant groups are placed into two different environments, one containing normal conditions and the other containing the abiotic factor of increased temperature, then the pea plant group with the abiotic factor will have a larger root-to-shoot ratio. Using a greenhouse and an incubator, we grew two sets of plants that displayed results supporting our thesis. The field peas in the incubator had larger root-to-shoot ratios, showing the plant's adaptability to climate change. This conclusion can aid in the prevention of plant extinction as climate change progresses.


Introduction:
The 20th century experienced the strongest warming trend of the last millennium with average temperatures rising by about 0.6°C [Jones: 2001]. Temperatures are likely to exceed this, as predictions show an increase between 0.1°C and 0.4°C per decade [Huntley: 1991]. These trends are primarily in response to human activity. During the last two centuries, a large increase in the human population has led to the exploitation of fossil fuel reserves and the destruction of a substantial amount of the world's natural ecosystems [Huntley: 1991]. The levels of 'greenhouse gases' have risen at great speeds and are continuing their patterns at accelerating rates. A predicted consequence of climate change, among many others, is the global increased risk of extinction among species [Thomas: 2004]. A study exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a functional relationship with geographical range size predicts that, following average climate-warming scenarios, 15-37% of species in their sample species alone will be extinct by year 2050 [Thomas: 2004]. It if for this reason that it has become progressively more important for research to be conducted as to how particular species will respond to the earth's rising temperatures. This tends to raise questions such as: how are species currently adapting to the effects of climate change? and will these adaptations continue as the earth's temperature continues to rise, or will certain species fall victim to the fast pace of global warming? To address these questions, we focused on a specific species and gathered information from an experiment that could jumpstart a research project regarding the prevention of species extinction due to climate change. Vegetation is responsible for much of the biomass that exists on earth today. It is for that reason that we chose to study a plant species, as it will more accurately depict how the biosphere might respond to climate change of the projected magnitude in upcoming centuries. This report discusses the examination of phenotypic plasticity and resource allocation in field peas exposed to two distinct environmental conditions; in this case, differences in temperature.  For evolution to occur, variation on both the genotypic and phenotypic levels is necessary. Though genetically identical, two organisms of the same species can display notably different characteristics because of the environment in which they reside. The most phenotypically plastic organisms are plants; they have no controll over where their seeds are placed, and as a result must adapt to given conditions, which could range by several factors.  An element that allows for variation among plant phenotypes is temperature change, an abiotic factor that has become increasingly relevant in the study of evolutionary and ecological biology due to the alarming effects of climate change. For our research we narrowed our study to the examination of field peas in two different temperature environments. Field peas (Pisum sativun L.) are the most widely grown temperate grain legume in Europe and the second-most in the world [Iglesias-García: 2017]. They are a versatile and inexpensive protein source for animal feeding with a widely acknowledged beneﬁcial role in cropping system, making them a credible species on which to conduct research [Iglesias-García: 2017]. In addition, given our time constraints, their ability to grow and sprout quickly was also taken into consideration. The experiment presented an opportunity to discover how resource allocation differs within field peas depending on temperature changes in their environment, and what trade-offs are created for each group to exist and survive as successfully as possible. The independent variable in our experiment was the two field pea groups, and the dependent variable was temperature, which was regulated by a greenhouse for the controll group and an incubator for the experimental group. By being placed in an environment with higher temperatures, the experimental group would experience faster water evaporation. This would in turn cause the field peas in the incubator to grow larger roots than the roots of the group in the greenhouse to absorb enough water to prosper. If two pea plant groups are placed into two different environments, one containing normal conditions and the other containing the abiotic factor of increased temperature, then the pea plant group with the abiotic factor will have a larger root-to-shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment, we planted seedlings of field peas for two groups. First, we soaked the field pea seeds in water for thirty minutes. After soaking, we took twelve four-inch by four-inch pots which we split to have six containers for the controll group and six containers for the experimental group. We then placed six pots on a large black tray with holes in the bottom and repeated the same for the second set of six. We filled the pots to the top with vermiculite, then added pre-water and 50 Ml of Miracle Grow to each pot. We made an indentation in the vermiculite about 2-3 times the size of the field pea seeds, then planted at least three seeds in each hole. We covered the holes gently with vermiculite and watered each container. We labeled each tray and placed one in the biology lab greenhouse, which was set at a temperature of 23°C. We then placed the other in an incubator set at a temperature of 28°C. For the next two weeks, both the controll group and the experimental group were watered equally each day. They were on similar day and night cycles, as the incubator was set to mimic the amount of sunlight that would be received in the greenhouse environment. After two weeks, the plant groups were removed from the controllled and experimental environments and the root-to-shoot ratios were measured. Each replicate group had three plant shoots and their corresponding roots. They were weighed and measured in mm. 

Results:
The mean root-to-shoot ratio for the weight of the controll group was 0.94mm with a standard deviation of 0.14. The mean root-to-shoot ratio of the weight of the experimental group was 1.24mm with a standard deviation of 0.13. The root-to-shoot ratio of the height of the controll group was 0.48mm, with a standard deviation of 0.07. The root-to-shoot ratio of the height of the experimental group was 0.64mm with a standard deviation of 0.069. Based on these results, and our calculated two-tailed t_test, the results we gathered are statistically significent (Weight: p= 0.026, t= 2.726, d.f.= 4) (Height: p=0.024, t= 2.814, d.f.= 4).

Discussion:
Based on the results of our experiment, our hypothesis was supported. Due to the exposure to an increased temperature in the experimental group (5°C) the field peas in the incubator allocated their resources by growing longer roots than the plants in the greenhouse. This allowed the experimental group to adapt to the given environmental conditions and absorb enough water to survive efficiently. This caused the experimental group's root-to-shoot ratios to in turn be larger.  It is important to understand, especially in this day in age, how plants allocate resources depending on their exposure to climate change. As the planet continues to get warmer due to global warming and water becomes increasingly scarce, phenotypic plasticity in plants will be a deciding factor on which plants will be able to withstand the environmental patterns of the future and which will suffer. Directions that can be taken may include further research on which plants may be in danger of extinction due to climate change and what steps can be taken to prevent that from occurring. Climate change is multidimensional and simultaneous changes may occur as a result [Huntley: 2001]. Strict precautions to monitor the extent of future climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions are necessary [Huntley: 2001]. Limitations for this experiment could include discrepancies in the day and night cycles of the two environments and the amount of water given to each group.
