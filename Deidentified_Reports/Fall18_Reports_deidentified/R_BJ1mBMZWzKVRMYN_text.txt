Title: Effects of Sodium Channel Blocker on the Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius Muscle in Frogs

Abstract:
In this lab, the Na+ channel blocker Lidocaine was injected into Frog Legs to determine the effects of Lidocaine on the sciatic motor neuron as well as the gastrocnemus muscle. If Na+ channels are blocked in a motor neuron no action potential can be fired down the neuron and no signal is sent to the muscle to contract. Our hypothesis is that the injection of Lidocaine will decrease the resultant Voltage of the muscle contraction. Three Frog Legs were evaluated in this lab. The sciatic nerve was electrically stimulated at .3, .5, and 2V before and after the leg was treated with Lidocaine. The data was observed to not be statistically significent and the null hypothesis was not supported (P-Value of.1297 with 2 degrees of freedom). Based on this data the null hypothesis was not rejected and the strength of muscle contraction decreased on every leg after treatment with Lidocaine, which was predicted in the experiment. On every leg evaluated at 2V of stimulation the resultant contraction went down by .7V, .1V, and .75V on legs one two and three. 


Introduction:
The reason Lidocaine can affect muscle contractions is because Na+ channels in an axon are necessary for an action potential(AP) to be created in a motor neuron. If no action potential is created then no signal can be sent to the muscle to contract. Lidocaine does not affect the resting potential of the neuron, because this is established with an Na/K pump, but does effect the ability to reach a threshold in a neuron. [Kanai: 1998] in order for an AP to occur the threshold must be reached after a certain amount of Na+ channels open. An AP is started at the neuromuscular junction. When the AP reaches the presynaptic terminal Ca2+ enters the terminal which initiates the release of acetylcholine in vesicles. This vesicles fuse with the presynaptic terminal and acetylcholine moves across the synaptic cleft by the process of simple diffusion. The acetylcholine binds with the postsynaptic terminal at acetylcholine receptors. This causes voltage gated Na+ channels in the axon hillock to open. Our hypothesis is that the muscle contraction strength will decrease in Volts, because Lidocaine will affect some of the Na+ channels in the axon hillock and the AP will not be as strong or the threshold for an AP will not be achieved at all. If no AP is achieved then Acetylcholine is not release into the synaptic cleft and no Calcium is sent out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into the muscle, therefore it cannot contract. [Johnson:2018] Frog legs in this lab are being used as model organisms to determine the effect of the Sodium Channel Blocker Lidocaine and the strength of muscle contraction compared to the same leg treated with no Lidocaine[Johnson:2018].


Materials and Method:
3 Frog Legs were evaluated in this experiment after being skinned, and the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated by cutting the leg at the Achilles tendon. The Achilles was included in the cut so the string can be tied on more easily. The leg was laid on the table flat and the muscle is strung up so it was perpendicular to the table [Johnson:2018]. Enough tension was put in the muscle so the string doesn’t move too much. Each leg was tested with .3V, .5V, and 2V through Nerve Stimulation before and after being treated with Lidocaine. It was stimulated by placing the probe on the upper thigh muscle and laying the sciatic nerve across the probe with absolutely no metal touching the probe. Both controll and experimental legs were intermittently treated with Frog Ringer so the muscle is still able to contract. The leg was treated with Lidocaine with a syringe and is dropped on the sciatic nerve. 25 millimolar Lidocaine was injected directly into the gastrocnemus muscle at different places. The muscle is then stimulated to check for a response[Johnson:2018]. The data before and after the injection of lidocaine was analyzed with a paired T-test for the data collected at 2V. With a significance cutoff value at .05.


Results:
The predicted effect of Lidocaine on muscle contraction occurred with an obvious decrease in response in Leg one, two, and three at voltages 2V, .5V, and .3 V.  At 2V for example the response evaluated in Volts went down .7V, .1V, and .75V as shown in Figure 1. The muscle was also observed to puff up after being treated with Lidocaine but this has no effect on the data because the tension is consistent. Each leg was different but the largest leg which is labeled as frog 3 was shown to have a far more powerful contraction than the smaller legs. This may be a result of more powerful in the third leg. After the paired T-Test was performed a p_value of .1298 was calculated.


Discussion:
In this experiment data from different legs cannot be compared because each leg is different and the data is treated separately. The reason that Frog 2 was observed to have a smaller change than the other Frogs was as a result of more than just the isolated gastrocnemus muscle contracting which counteracts the observed contraction of the gastrocnemus. This countering of the muscles results in a smaller observed contraction and why Frog 2 data appears to be skewed. The third leg had a more powerful contraction as a result of stronger muscles. This may be a result of genetics or some other variation. The P-Value of.1297 shows that the null hypothesis was not rejected. Lidocaine does appear to have an effect on the contraction of muscles as well as an effect on the motor neurons based on Fig. 1 which shows a large change in response after treatment of at least .1V over all Legs and Responses. Na+ blockers have an effect on the ability of an AP to be created in the sciatic nerve. Lidocaine works because the high concentration of voltage gated Na+ channels found in the axon hillock are blocked and not able to pump Na+ into the axon so the AP is not passed down. If the AP is not passed then Acetylcholine cannot be release at the presynaptic membrane. If that does not occur no Ca2+ is release and the muscle is not able to contract as powerfully.
