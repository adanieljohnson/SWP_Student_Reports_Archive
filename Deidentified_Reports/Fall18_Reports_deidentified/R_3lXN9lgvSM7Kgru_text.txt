Title: No significant difference between the photosynthetic activity of C3 plant Spinacia olerecea and C4 plant chrysanthemum

Abstract:
C3 and C4 are two plant categories that are defined by their specific photosynthetic pathways. C4 plants have the same pathway as C3 plants; however, there is an additional pathway that allows them to adapt to changing environments and skip photorespiration, ultimately making C4 plants more photosynthetically efficient. In this experiment, our hypothesis was the C4 plant chrysanthemum would exhibit a greater photosynthetic activity than that of the C3 plant Spinacia olerecea. We extracted chloroplasts from the spinach and chrysanthemum leaved in order to measure their photosynthetic activity through the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence of DCIP when placed in light and dark environments. The p-value between the light and dark sample was 0.578 and the p-value between the two plants was 0.613. We determine that the results were insignificant and the hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process of transforming light energy from the sun into chemical energy that is stored in the form of glucose. Light is captured and used as an energy source to convert water, and carbon dioxide into glucose, with oxygen as a waste product. There are three types of plants based on their photosynthetic pathways: C3, C4, and CAM plants. C3 plants, the most common photosynthetic type, were named because the first product of their photosynthetic pathway is a 3 carbon molecule called phosphoglycerate [Ehlringer: 2002]. Rubisco, the enzyme that catalyses this carbon fixation reaction, leads to the creation of phosphoglycerate with CO2 as a substrate and another reaction with O2 as a substrate. When O2 is the substrate, there is less net carbon fixation, and in or make up for this loss, photorespiration is enacted, leading to the production of CO2. Photorespiration is the opposite process of photosynthesis, where O2 is fixed and CO2 is released in the process of producing more 3 carbon molecules. The effectiveness of C4 plants is due to the suppression of photorespiration through the development of another step in their photosynthetic processes [Peterhansel: 2010]. C4 plants actively elevate the CO2 concentration of the site for carbon fixation with the use of a biochemical CO2 pump. Carbon fixation occurs in two steps in which the the first is to form the four-carbon dicarboxylic acid oxaloacetate [Furbank: 1995]. A study done in 2012 compared the metabolic networks of Arabidopsis, a C3 plant, and maize, a C4 plant. The study suggested that the photosynthetic process of maize is more complex exhibits a faster and more efficient use of light and CO2 than that of Arabidopsis. It was found that the photosynthetic mechanism of maize is more capable of managing environmental changes, including access to water and the excess presence of carbon dioxide and oxygen [Wang: 2012]. 
In this experiment, our goal was to determine the difference in photosynthetic activity in C3 and C4 plants. Our C3 plant was Spinacia oleracea and our C4 plant was a chrysanthemum. Spinacia oleracea is a common annual cultivated plant and is known for its sources of vitamin A, D, E, K, and fiber. Chrysanthemum is a perennial flowering plant native to subtropical and temperate climates. These plants are used in this experiment because the chloroplasts of spinach oleracea and chrysanthemum are easily extracted through crushing the soft leaves and spinning them in a centrifuge. Due to the more efficient and complex photosynthetic process of C4 plants, we hypothesize that the photosynthetic activity in C4 chrysanthemum will be higher than that of the C3 Spinacia oleracea. In order to test this hypothesis, we will measure the absorption of chloroplasts in the C3 and C4 samples in light and dark settings in order to determine percent changes in photosynthetic activity.


Materials and Methods:
In this lab, we de-veined 3-4 spinach and chrysanthemum leaves and crushed them in their respective mortar and pestel with 10mL of grinding buffer to each. Once each sample was a paste, we added 10mL more of grinding buffer to each and mixed it in with the samples. We then spun each sample in a RT-7 centrifuge at 200 times the force of gravity. After spinning, we decanted the clear liquid from the centrifuge tubes, leaving the pellets of C3 and C4 chloroplasts at the bottom. We diluted the pellets with 10mL of grinding buffer each, mixing the samples. The two samples were spun in the centrifuge again, this time at 1,000 times the force of gravity. We decanted the liquid from the pellets again, and diluted the ending chloroplasts, now clear of debris, with 10mL of grinding buffer.
	In 14 test tubes, we added water, DCIP, 100mM of phosphate at pH of 6.5, and chloroplasts according to the reagent table given, adding the chloroplasts last. After the addition of chloroplasts, we measured the starting absorbance of each sample, then placed the tubes in their respective light and dark environments. After 30 minutes, we measured the absorbance of each sample to determine the change in absorbance and the photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts. We these values, we calculated the percent change of absorbance for each sample by subtracting the final absorbance from the initial, dividing this value by the final absorbance, and multiplying by 100%. We performed a two-way anova test in order to determine the significance of these percent changes in relation between light and dark and the spinach and chrysanthemum, in which the alpha value was 0.05.

Results:
In our experiment, there was not a significant difference in the average percent change of absorption between the C3 and C4 plants. In addition, the absorption percent changes were not consistent between trials. This is shown in Figure 2 by the error bars that represent the standard deviation of the resulting percent changes of absorbance in the experiment. The lack of consistency is most visibly illustrated by the chrysanthemum chloroplasts in the light environment. In some trials the absorption would increase, and in others of the same sample, the absorption would decrease. The p-value between the light and dark samples was 0.587 and the p-value between the C3 and C4 samples was 0.613. Because both p-values are higher than 0.5, both values are insignificant. Both p-values were insignificant because they were greater than the alpha value of 0.5.

Discussion:
In this experiment, we hypothesized that the C4 chrysanthemum would have higher photosynthetic activity than that of the C3 spinach. We measured the percent change of absorbance of each sample by determining the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence of DCIP. The lighter the sample, the more photosynthetic activity in the extracted chloroplasts. This hypothesis was not supported by our results due to insignificant p-values. We ran two two-way anova tests in order to determine the significance of absorption between the chrysanthemum and spinach, and another to determine significance of absorption between light and dark samples of the C3 and C4 plants. The difference between the light and dark samples of the spinach and chrysanthemum plants was insignificant. This is possibly due to the fact that both C3 and C4 plants have equivalent pathways. The difference between the two plants is that C4 has an extra pathway after initial photosynthetic activity that reduces carbon fixation, making the process of releasing oxygen as a product more efficient. Therefore, the photosynthetic activity we measured through the absorption of the chloroplasts was the same because the processes in C3 and C4 plants is equivalent in the first stages of photosynthesis that occur in the chloroplasts. In a study done comparing photorespiration abilities of the C3 plant P. oleracea and the C4 plant Streptanthus tortuosus, the results suggested that there was no difference in photorespiration activity due to chloroplast structure [Kennedy: 1976]. It is possible that the absorption of chloroplasts is not a relevant biological variable in the difference between photosynthetic pathways of C3 an C4 plants.
Our results in this experiment negate our hypothesis and contrast the results of many other studies comparing photosynthesis in C3 and C4 plants. In a study comparing the characteristics of the C3 L. esculentum and C4 F. trinervia, the presence of excess carbon dioxide increased the photosynthetic activity of L. esculentum, while it did not affect that of F. trinervia. It was concluded that this is the result of a more complex photosynthetic pathway that provides the ability to adapt to less than optimal environments so that the process is not negatively affected. The adaptation rate was determined by the measurement of compensation points, in which a lower compensation point corresponds with a faster adaptation. The compensation point for F. trinervia in excess CO2 was less than 1 l/l, while the compensation point for L. esculentum was 54 l/l, showing that the rate of adaptation to a different environment is faster for C4 plants [Ku 1983]. A future experiment in testing the photosynthetic activity of C3 and C4 plants would be testing the absorbance of chloroplasts in the presence and absence of oxygen. This is due to the difference between C3 and C4 plants that lies in the absence of photorespiration due to adaptation in the presence of oxygen. In similar, normal conditions, the C3 and C4 plants photosynthesize at a similar rate. However, when oxygen and carbon dioxide levels change in the environment, photosynthetic activity is affected. To further the experiment by Ku, other environmental changes could also be tested, including presence of water or other nutrients necessary for photosynthesis.
