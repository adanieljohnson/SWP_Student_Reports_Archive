Title: Aggressive behavior of Betta splendins is stronger in a clear water environment then in a murky environment. 

Abstract:
Studying the aggressive behavior of organisms in different environments can help us understand how and why they evolved to have the behaviors that they do. Aggressive behaviors help organisms have more access to mates or resources but usually incur some risk to the organism as well.  Our experiment seeks to examine the difference in aggression in Betta splendins exposed to murky or clear water. We hypothesize that the betta fish will in the clear water will be more aggressive towards each other than those in the murky water because the fish in the murky water will be less able to see and identify each other. We placed the male betta fish in both murky and clear environments and exposed them to another male competitor. Then we observed and quantified the aggressive behaviors of the fish using an escalating points system. Though there was a difference in trends in our data which supported our hypothesis, the difference was not significent. There should be more studies conducted comparing the aggression of bettas in their natural habitat versus a lab environment in order to understand how accurately the lab replicates their natural behaviors.

Introduction:
This experiment examines the influence of different environments on the aggressive behaviors of Betta splendins or the betta fish. Looking at how behaviors differ in different environments can help us understand how or why the organism evolved in the way that it did. 
Aggression typically involves a physical risk to the organism itself and the use of resources that could be directed toward finding more food or to reproduce. Because of this, the decision to engage in aggressive acts needs to have significent potential benefits for the organism itself in the form of reproductive potential or access to more resources (e.g. territory or food) for future use. 
Betta fish are indigenous to Thailand where they live in ponds, ditches, drains, rice patties and other still and muddy waters. Whereas domesticated betta fish are larger and more colorful, wild betta fish are typically inconspicuous until excited by the presence of a competing male, at which point they will flare their gills and fins and change color to a dark red or blue. Although domesticated betta fish have been bred to retain their bright colors permanently, they still demonstrate the same fighting behaviors as their wild counterparts [Johnson: 2016]. These fish have been chosen as the model organism for this experiment due to their easily identifiable aggressive behaviors. 
Specifically, we will be testing how the aggression of betta fish alters when they are exposed to different living environments: clear water and murky water. Male betta fish identify their opponents visually through unpatterned bodies and long fins [Tillberg: 2010], so if they are less able to identify one another then it is less likely that they would engage in aggressive behaviors. We hypothesize that the betta fish in the clear water will be more aggressive towards each other than those in the murky water because the fish in the murky water will be less able to see and identify each other. 


Materials and Method:
We used one fish tank and divided it into two sections with both a clear and an opaque barrier. We placed a layer of pebbles in the bottom of the tank to obscure the tank’s reflective bottom. First, we filled the tank with clear water and put two fish on either side of the barrier. We allowed them to acclimate for 2 minutes. Then we removed the opaque barrier and observed the fish for 5 minutes recording the aggressive behavior of the fish in the left side of the tank. One group member watched for pelvic fin flicking and erect pectoral fins which each received 1 point as the least aggressive behavior, another member watched for spreading of the gills and tail beating which received 2 points and a third member watched for the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane and tail flashing which received 3 points as the most aggressive behaviors. As we observed these behaviors we would tell our final group member who would record our data. We repeated this process 4 times total in the clear water with a new set of fish each time. Then we stirred vermiculite into the tank to simulate murky pond water and repeated the trial 4 more times in the murky water. We then took the total amount of points per trial and compared the two groups using a one-directional t_test with ⍺ = 0.05 to see if the fish in one environment were significently more aggressive than the other. 


Results:
	The average level of aggression for betta fish in clear water was 29 +/- 13.54, and the average level of aggression for betta fish in murky water was 16.25 +/- 13.62 [Fig. 1] The one-tailed p_value for the comparison between the two environments was 0.116 which was not statistically significent at ⍺ = 0.05. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the betta fish in a murky environment would exhibit less aggression than when in a clear environment,  was not supported. Although the trends in our data were as expected, there was no significent difference at ⍺ = 0.05 level between the groups. This was likely due to the large discrepancies in the amount of aggressive behavior per fish in the murky water. As Bronstine note’s, betta fish rely on the quality and duration of visual cues during fighting [Bronstine: 1982]. Instead of reducing aggressive behavior it is likely that the murky water simply reduced the amount of time it took the two fish to notice each other or increased the likelihood that the fish would stop fighting and take no notice of each other. This is further supported by Bronstine’s study which showed that male betta fish have only brief memories of aggressive behavior and the location of their opponent during a fight [Bronstine: 1982]. In the murky water, they had to get much closer to each other to engage in aggressive behaviors and may fight for less time. This could help them not waste time and resources fighting fish that are not actually a threat to their access to resources or mates in the wild, as murky water is their natural habitat [Tillberg: 2010].
Understanding how the beta fishes respond to different environments can help us piece together their how they evolved to their wild state and how they have evolved since in captivity. Lab studies on aggression in betta fish are usually conducted in tanks of clear, clean water, but because this is a different environment from the one they evolved to live in, it may have a large effect on their behavior. They could be less aggressive in general in nature then they are in a lab. We need to study how their behavior differs in different environments so we know how to better controll future experiments, and so we can start to understand how aggression can evolve to have its own checks in certain environments, which would make sure the organism didn’t waste their resources on unnecessary aggression.
