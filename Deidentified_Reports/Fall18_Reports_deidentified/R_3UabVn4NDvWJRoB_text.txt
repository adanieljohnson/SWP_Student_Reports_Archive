Title: An analysis on the affect of pH on photosynthesis in spinach

Abstract:
In order to determine the optimal pH range of spinach chloroplasts we decided to test purified chloroplast extract at multiple pH. We tested photosynthesis in spinach leaves at multiple pHs 4, 6.5, and 10. Their photosynthetic efficiency was tested using DCIP a dye which turns from blue to colorless as it becomes reduced by accepting electrons from photosynthetic enzymes. This absorbance was measured at time 0 and 10 minutes later using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm for our solutions of chloroplasts at differing pH. The absorbance saw a statistically significent reduction in absorbance for pH 4 and 6.5. However pH 10 saw no significent reduction in absorbance after 10 minutes of reacting. Our data indicates that a near neutral pH of 6.5, and even a slightly acidic pH is better for photosynthesis than the alkaline pH of 10. 

Introduction:
Plants conduct photosynthesis in their chloroplasts, they do this in order to harness energy from the sun and convert that light energy into chemical energy to be stored in the form of glucose. This process involves multiple enzymes to function properly including RuBisCO [Farazdaghi H 2011]. Enzymes such as these have multiple regulatory molecules and thus function optimally in certain environments [Jin Jiang 2004]. The molecular environment we decided to test was pH. This is because many plants are very sensitive to pH, a colorful example of this being hydrangeas. But more significently with the increasing frequency of acid rain, crops to face a more acidic environment. Determining whether acidic pH’s will possibly harm crops like spinach is incredibly valuable for the agriculture industry, and maintaining global food supplies. Thus we decided to test the efficiency of photosynthesis in spinach leaf chloroplasts at acidic and alkaline pH, by measuring the light absorbance in a spectrophotometer after the reaction had preceded with a product dependent dye . We chose spinach leaves to do their relative abundance and accessibility. We hypothesize that an the optimal pH will result in with lower absorbance at 600nm as the dye DCIP becomes clear when it is reduced by photosynthesis [Huber S 1979]. 

Materials and Method:
We required a centrifuge and the ground extract of several spinach leaves in order to acquire purified chloroplasts for our experiment. This was done by grinding up spinach leafs, and centrifuging them for around 10 minutes. The pellet of this solution was then extracted and placed in an appropriate pH buffer. We tested with buffers at ph 4, 6.5 and 10. This was repeated until we found the solution that was the most rich in chloroplasts. The pellet that we determined to be the most chloroplast rich was the one we decided to test our hypothesis on.  The dye we used was DCIP which becomes reduced during photosynthesis by having a higher affinity for electrons than ferredoxin (the typical electron carrier) and turns colorless.

 We  tested absorbance with a  spectrophotometer set to read at 600nm. The solutions going into the tubes were as follows. Tube 0 was the blank and it got 8Ml of water, and 5Ml of the 100mM reaction buffer. Tubes 1-3 got chloroplasts 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mM DCIP, 5Ml 6.5 ph reaction buffer. Tubes 4-6 got chloroplasts 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130mM DCIP,2Ml of ph 4 reaction buffer. Tubes 7-9 got chloroplasts 6 Ml water, 2 Ml 130mM DCIP, 2 Ml ph 10 reaction buffer. Tubes 10- 12 were our controlls and they got no chloroplasts 6Ml water, 2 Ml 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml 6.5 ph reaction buffer.Next we  prepared 3 replicates of each of the reaction mixes. With only 1 replicate of the blank. We began the assy by adding 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts  to the blank tube, and to Tubes #4-12. Followed by  mixing each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts. Next we transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. We then  IMMEDIATELY blank the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 0. Then immediately measure the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. These were are Time Zero data points. Then we placed all our samples in the sunlight for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, we blank the spectrophotometer with Sample 0. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm.  Then we Recorded our results and compared them with two tailed t_tests.


Results:
As our graph shows, we tracked the change in absorbance over time for our solutions. The change in absorbance statistical significance was determined using a two sample T-test, comparing the absorbance at time 0 and time 10. With a null hypothesis that of H0 : U1 = U2  (The absorbance would not change) and an alternate hypothesis of Ha : U1 &gt; U2 (the absorbance after 10 minutes would be lower than at time 0). This was tested with a p value of .01 and the results are as follows. For 4 pH the resulting p value was .006, t=5.2, d.f.= 3.03 this indicates that the  absorbance was significently lower after 10 minutes for the ph 4 group. For the 6.5 pH group the results were p=.002, t= 5.9, d.f.=3.83 This indicates that the absorbance was significently
 lower after ten minutes for the ph 6.5 group. Interestingly the pH 6.5 had less absorbance than the more acidic pH 4 group.  pH 10 however had no significent decrease in absorbance, in fact its absorbance increased after 10 minutes.


Discussion:
We determined that the absorbance was significently lower after 10 minutes for the 6.5 and ph 4 groups. This means that the solution was more clear and thus had more reduced DCIP. This increase in reduced DCIP comes from an increase in electrons produced during photosynthesis. This means that photosynthesis was statistically more efficient at acidic pH of 4, and the neutral pH of 6.5, than at the alkaline pH of 10. This is in accordance to our hypothesis that an optimal pH range would present with reduced absorbance. At pH 6.5 the enzymes were functioning most optimally, in this still effectively neutral range. At pH 4 in an acidic range the enzymes appear to have operated less efficiently that the neutral range but still better than the akaline pH 10.  It is possible due to the the enzymes becoming denatured at extreme pH  such as the acidic 4 and akaline 10. Although it makes somewhat more sense that the enzymes were able to better perform in pH 4 solution than pH10 solution. Also an increase in H ions associated with lower pH may somewhat aid in the proton gradient that is conducted in photosystem 1 in photosynthesis. A better adaption towards acidic pH than akaline pH may be an evolutionary trait. Magnesium (an element critical for photosynthesis to occur) [Schwartzkopf C 2017] commonly found in the form of magnesium sulfate MgSO4 reacts to produce slightly acidic conditions when the magnesium ion is released to be used in photosynthesis [Huber S 1979]. Spinach is a leafy green and is typically loaded with magnesium. Thus having enzymes that can tolerate slightly acidic conditions would be a massive evolutionary advantage for spinach. Still it is strange that the chloroplasts would appear to operate so well under acidic conditions as RuBisCO in particular has an optimal pH that is alkaline around 8-10[Farazdaghi H 2011]. Further tests would likely be able to determine why our results were so counterintuitive. Running the same experiment again but with a different type of plant, perhaps one that is not magnesium rich would be a good start. I believe  that it would also be beneficial to redo our tests with greater sample sizes and never frozen spinach leaves to validate our results somewhat. Knowing how such acidic pH’s will affect our crops will be invaluable to the agriculture industry, and the global food supply, with the threat of acidic rain ever present in our changing climate.
