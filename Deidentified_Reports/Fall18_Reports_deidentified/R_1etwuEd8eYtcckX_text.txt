Title: The implementation of azadirachtin in the diet of manduca sexta does not significently affect weight gain. 

Abstract:
Hormones are largely responsible for the maturation and development of insects, such as the manduca sexta, which was studied in this experiment. The results of supplementing azadirachtin, a 20E blocker, into the diet of maduca sexta larvae was studied in conjunction with weight gain. We predicted the experimental group, whose diet included azadirachtin, would gain more weight than the controll group. After feeding and weighing the caterpillar groups for 7 days, the averages   of weight difference found in the two groups were not statistically different, although the controll group’s average weight gain was larger. The null hypothesis was accepted, and results led to the conclusion that azadirachtin is linked to feeding inhibition, through disrupting the hormonal balance in the caterpillar. Therefore, feeding inhibition is possibly the cause of the difference in average weight gain shown. Further research on the effects of hormone blockers, such as azadirachtin can lead to an effective pest solution, increasing agricultural crop yield. 

Introduction:
Hormones play a crucial role in the development and regulation of metamorphosis in insects, like the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Excess or the absence of certain hormones can disrupt the molting process and the insect’s transition to adulthood. In insects, the ratio of hormones such as Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) is crucial to maturation. 20E is a steroid hormone secreted by the prothoracic glands that regulates timing of molting during insect development. Absence of 20E would disrupt the timing of molting, possibly resulting in the insect remaining in the juvenile stage [Johnson: 11]. In this lab, we will test the effects of the presence of azadirachtin, a chemical compound that blocks the production of 20E, on weight gain of larvae. A better understanding of the relationship between 20E inhibitors, such as azadirachtin, could aid in pest controlls, by safely interrupting pupation and metamorphosis. The presence of azadirachtin has been linked to molting inhibition in Locusta migratoria [Sieber 1983]. Will the same relationship be found when the Manduca sexta caterpillar is exposed to azadirachtin, and how will it affect its weight gain? Larvae unable to pupate would remain in the same instar but continue to eat. In our experiment, the dependent variable is the weight of the caterpillars, and the independent variable was the quantity of azadirachtin fed to the caterpillars. If an experimental group of larvae is given food with azadirachtin for 7 days, then they will gain more weight than the controll group that is fed normal food.

Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, 8 caterpillar larvae were separated into two groups of 4. One group was the controll group and was fed normal food, while the experimental group was given drops of AzaMax on their food, which contains azadirachtin. The groups were placed into two different plastic bins, with each caterpillar in their own corner and food. Both groups were given 10g of food per caterpillar, with 7 drops of water on the controll group’s food and 7 drops of AzaMax on the experimental group’s food. For 7 days, the weight of each caterpillar was recorded, observations were made, and living spaces were cleaned daily. The food was replaced as necessary, and it was mixed and softened with a spoon to aid in food consumption. 

Results:
There was an initial increase in weight gain across both groups that eventually led to continuous weight loss. The decrease in weight was sharp for the experimental group while the controll group’s weight maintained high for a longer duration and the weight loss was more gradual. Over the seven days, the average weight difference for the experimental group was +1.5g, while the average weight difference for the controll group was +4.15g. For the controll group, the lightest starting caterpillars gained the most weight and the heaviest caterpillars at the beginning gained the least amount of weight. The experimental group displayed a similar trend and the heaviest experimental caterpillar, number 4, was the only caterpillar to have a net loss in weight. On day 4, a black pulsing line along the back of the controll caterpillars was observed, indicating they were undergoing the commitment pulse. On day 7, the controll 3 caterpillar pupated. A one-tailed p test was done and 0.054 was the calculated value, signifying that there is not a significent difference in the results. 

Discussion:
Based on our results, the null hypothesis, that the experimental group fed azadirachtin will not gain more weight than the controll group, can be accepted. Although the data did not provide a statistical difference in the average weight gain between the two groups, it resulted in the controll group showing a larger average weight gain than the experimental group. The lack of normal weight gain over the 7 days exemplified by the experimental group raises questions about the effect of azadirachtin on feeding habits. In Rhodnius prolixus, the presence of azadirachtin has been linked to indirectly cause feeding inhibition through the disruption of the endocrine system [de Souza Garcia: 1984]. Due to the ability of azadirachtin to block 20E, the ratio of JH to 20E is imbalanced in the juvenile caterpillars [Johnson: 2016]. This imbalance in hormones disrupts the caterpillar’s feeding and causes them to eat less. Therefore, the lack of appetite in the experimental group, caused by azadiracthin, led to decreased weight gain and even weight loss over 7 days. Another impact of the effects of azadirachtin on the experimental group was the absence of a commitment pulse or pupation. The blockage of 20E disturbs maturation by disrupting the timing of molting and not allowing pupation [Johnson: 2016]. In the future, another study can be done with multiple experimental groups all receiving different amounts of azadirachtin in their diet, in order to better understand the relationship of its quantity provided to the effects shown. The results would help us understand the feeding inhibition result of azadirachtin. The sample size should be larger than this lab to increase the chances of showing statistically significent results. Due to the importance of hormones in the development and metamorphosis of insects, understanding the effects of chemicals that block the hormones and manipulate the development of juveniles to pests is extremely useful in agriculture. Mastering the most efficient, safe, and effective way to disrupt the metamorphosis of insects into adult pests, will maximize crop production.
