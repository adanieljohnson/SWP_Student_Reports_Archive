Title: The effect of color variations on level of aggression in Betta splendins

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior brings together many different skills in the laboratory: observational, theories across different sciences, and especially experimental. It is important to understand how abiotic factors affect the behavior of animals, specifically aggressive behaviors, because it can help us better prepare for changes in the environment and what that will mean for different species. In this experiment, we tested how changes in color of water affect the level of aggression in Betta splendins. We monitored their behaviors in these differenet colored environments, as well as their behaviors with a glass divider between the two fish and without a glass divider. The expected result was that there would be a significent difference in their level of aggression but the results showed that there was no significance. However the data suggested that there was a trend towards higher levels of aggression when there was no glass divider between the aquariums, regardless of the color.

Introduction:
Betta Splendins are common aquarium fish also known as Siamese fighting fish are known for their high levels of aggression. It is well known that these fish must live in isolation due to their intense agnostic behaviors towards other Bettas. In this experiment we will test the effects of changing water color on the agnostic behavior of Betta fish. Additionally, we tested the change of color in two conditions: where a glass divider separates the Betta fish and where the glass divider is removed. We predicted that color will increase their levels of aggression in both separation and in isolation. We tested these conditions to show that escalation is a key component of agnostic behavior because Bettas are known for their quick levels of escalation [Johnson: 2018]. The trends of this experiment will bring us closer to understanding how abiotic factors affect agnostic behaviors especially among Betta Splendins. 

Materials and Method:
To test this experiment, we had an aquarium that, in each treatment, was filled with a different color of water (red and/or green) as well as one aquarium filled with normal uncolored clear water. First, we placed two male betta fish into two sections of the aquarium separated by a glass divider so they cannot physically interact but they can easily see the other male. In each treatment of a different color of water, we observed the betta males interact for five minutes with this glass divider in place, then we let them rest, and then subsequently removed the glass partition and we observed them under that condition in addition to the varied color. We repeated the same process in both colored waters. Our independent variable is the color of water and the dependent variable is the aggressiveness of the males together. To measure this, we will record the behaviors based on a scale of 1-5, from least aggressive to most aggressive: 1. No aggressive behavior 2. Broadside: pelvic fin flickering; facing: erect pectoral fins 3. Broadside: tail beating; facing: spread opercula 4. Broadside: tail flashing; facing: protrude branchiostegal membrane 5. Agonistic behavior: raising dorsal fin, lowering head, arching back, darkening skin, darting, biting/nipping. We conducted a trial for each color of water both with the glass partition and without the partition and recorded the level of aggressiveness of each fish in each treatment. Then, we used an ANOVA test to find out if the results were significent. 

Results:
The results showed that color had little effect on animal behavior in betta fish. The mean levels of aggression for all four fishes with glass divider in every condition was not statistically significent (F(11)=0.842, p=0.462). This was similar for the no glass divider results which were also not statistically significent (F(11)=0.206, p=0.818). Even though their level of aggression wasn’t impacted by the color of water, Figure 1 shows a trend of higher levels of aggressiveness when the fish were not separated by the glass divider. The data suggests that the color of water isn’t significent to the agnostic behavior of bettas but it does suggest that level of separation impacts their aggression.

Discussion:
The trend reveals that there is very little correlation between color and level of aggression. There was not a significent difference between clear, red, and green colors thus rejecting the original hypothesis that color would increase the level of aggression. While there was no significent difference between colors in an aquarium, the trend revealed that the betta males were more aggressive when put in a tank without a glass divider, regardless of the color. Overall, this suggests that the betta fish are more likely to attack each other when there is no separation because they were able to reach a 5 much quicker than they had when they were separated. This also reiterates the idea that escalation in agnostic behaviors is important to observe because even something as small as removing the glass divider between the fish greatly escalated their aggression. This experiment on Betta splendins is just a small step in understanding animal behavior. Even in just this one trial it was easy to see that each pair of fish varied in their levels of aggression from others. However, betta fish are clearly very agnostic animals even though this current experiment did not show that color increased this aggression. In a similar experiment on Nile tilapia, it was founded that color didn’t affect their levels of aggression because tilapia are not naturally aggressive fish, however it was found that color greatly impacted their levels of reproduction. Blue light increased the levels of reproduction and made the reproductive counters much more intense in contrast to just normal white light [Volpato: 2004]. This suggests that there is a lot of work to be done in the field of animal behavior because so little is known about what will impact animal behavior and how those consequences will be revealed in other aspects of their lives and the future of their species.
