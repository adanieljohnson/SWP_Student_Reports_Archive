Title: Developmental Effects of the 20E inhibitor Azaguard on Manduca Sexta Larva

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effects of a 20E inhibitor where tested on insect larva to determine the impact on growth and development. Our hypothesis was that if there is a decrease in the amounts of 20E production due to a 20E inhibitor, then the Manduca sexta will not develop correctly and will be unable to reach the commitment pulse; ultimately, causing the caterpillars to be smaller in weight and unable to pupate. Manduca sexta (tobacco hornworm) is a large common insect that feeds on plants to gain energy in order to go through 5 stages (instars) to develop into a fully grown moth.  The Manduca sexta was used for this experiment because it's molting process has been heavily studied, allowing for a solid understanding of its growth hormones of Ecdysteroids (20E) and juvenile hormone. Ecdysteriods and Juvenile Hormone work together to regulate the instars of caterpillars growth. By inhibiting 20E, the Manduca sexta will not develop correctly according to our hypothesis. The experiment was conducted by placing the 20E inhibitor, Azaguard, into the food of the caterpillar. The 20E inhibitor would be ingested with the food and the caterpillars displayed the effect. There was a clear difference between the health and development of the experimental caterpillars when compared to th

Introduction:
In insects, hormones are responsible for the transition from a larva to an adult in a process called molting. Molting is when an insect's epidermal skin cells secrete a new outer layer or cuticle and the old cuticle is shed [Laboratory Manual, 2018]. The two main hormones that affect the growth rate and development of Manduca sexta are ecdysteroids (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) [Johnson: 2018]. Manduca sexta is the organism observed in this experiment. The Manduca sexta was selected for this experiment because it is very easy to work with and a lot is known about the organism. The organism grows through multiple stages called instars in which Juvenile Hormone plays a large part in its development until about the 5th instar, which is where ecdysteroids rise and cause the organism to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. Ecdysteriods effects are seen throughout each stage of the caterpillar's development. But 20E is known to have greater effectiveness towards the later development stages due to its importance in pupation [Schwartz: 1983]. Within this experiment, the caterpillars are treated with a 20E inhibitor and are observed as they develop over a 2 week period of time with their weights and appearances recorded each day. Our hypothesis was that if there is a decrease in the amounts of 20E production due to a 20E inhibitor, then the Manduca sexta will not develop correctly and will be unable to reach the commitment pulse; ultimately, causing the caterpillars to be smaller in weight and unable to pupate.

Materials and Method:
Select 8 Manduca sexta caterpillars of similar size and then record the weight of each. Then prepare 2 separate four pocket containers ensuring each caterpillar has its own separate area. Poke two holes in each side of the container and label the containers. One container with a set of four is the controll and the other set of four is the experimental group. Ensure each caterpillar is designated with a different number 1-8. Next measure 10 grams of food for each caterpillar. For the controll food, add four drops of water to four of the eight 10 gram clumps of food. For the experimental food, add four drops of 20E inhibitor (Azaguard) to the remaining four 10 gram clumps of food. The 20E inhibitor will be ingested through the caterpillars' food, so ensure the same amount of Azaguard is given each time the caterpillars are fed. Take and record measurements and observations on appearance and size every day for two weeks. Each day check the food and ensure each clump is not dried out. Make sure to clean up after you are done in the lab. After obtaining the data, then run a one-tailed t_test to determine how the mean weights of the experimental caterpillars compared to the controll. 

Results:
The growth rate of the controll caterpillars remained very similar for all four. During the first six days the controll caterpillars grew rapidly but after the 6th day, their weights all dropped rapidly as seen in Figure 1. The experimental caterpillar grew constantly but slowly and then dropped slowly as well. The standard deviation for the weight of the controll caterpillars was 0.78 and the standard deviation for the weight of the experiment caterpillars was 0.92. The mean weight of the experimental group was significently smaller than the mean weight of the controll group (t_stat = 3.13, d.f. = 6, P = 0.0102). The controll group appeared to be much healthier and growing normally. By the end of the experiment, all 4 controll caterpillars had pupated and were enclosed in a brown cocoon. The experimental caterpillars were much smaller and did not look as healthy. By the end of the experiment, one of the experimental caterpillars had died and the other three were still very small and had not pupated. Overall, the controll and experimental caterpillars had different growth rates.

Discussion:
Our Hypothesis that the Manduca sexta, when given a 20E inhibitor, will be smaller in weight than the non-treated Manduca sexta was supported. The 20E inhibitor slowed the growth rate of the experimental group and caused them to never reach the commitment pulse, thus never pupating. Since we saw a difference in the growth rate of the caterpillars, it suggests that if 20E was added into the food of Manduca sexta then the caterpillars would not be able to mature and change to adult. The 20E inhibitor restricts there normal growth hormones. Another aspect to note is that Juvenile Hormone prevents multiple process that allow for the larva to develop into an adult. Since Juvenile Hormone restricts these process, the rise of 20E and decline of JH combine to allow the insect to begin pupating [Keshan: 2006]. But since the 20E is inhibited, the environment need to promote growth and development was never reached. Based on the results, the 20E inhibitor caused the Manduca sexta to be unable to grow through the instars which are necessary to reach pupation.
