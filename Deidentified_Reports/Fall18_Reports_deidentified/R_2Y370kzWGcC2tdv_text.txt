Title: Effects of Herbivory on Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) Root:Shoot Ratio 

Abstract:
Competitiveness is fundamental in the natural world, especially among plant species, who must compete with both biotic and abiotic factors in order to obtain the necessary resources for survival. Expressing certain phenotypic characteristics in order to drive is common among plants, especially through changes in their root-to-shoot ratio. These ideas were the center of study in this experiment through the use of the buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plant species. The experiment strove to answer whether or not the species would experience a decrease in R:S ratio in order to accommodate for the loss of leaf area/photosynthetic activity after a period of two weeks where it was subject to herbivory. After clipping the leafs of the species for this period to simulate herbivory, the plant did not demonstrate a significant decrease in R:S ratio. This does not support the idea that herbivory will lead to a decrease in R:S ratio. 

Introduction:
Plants are often competing in nature for the valuable resources that they need in order to thrive. With regards to competition, these organisms often compete with both biotic and abiotic factors. They then express phenotypic characteristics in order to adhere to their environmental conditions and continue to thrive. Root to shoot ratio is one of these examples as plants shift resources to either their roots or shoots in order to combat difficult environments and competition. Biomass can be used to measure this ratio and determine how a species has shifted resources in order to account for difficulties and ultimately, thrive. Researchers like Sharon Y. Strauss, et.al., Jingying Jing, et.al., Matthias Erb, et.al., Maria Laura Peschiutta, et.al., Yu-Ling Na, et.al. have studied the effects that herbivory have on plants and the mechanisms that plants have developed in order to combat this behavior and coevolve with insects. Specifically, in his article, Jingying Jing explains the significant changes that biotic factors like herbivory can have on plant species, especially with regards to R:S ratio as this is one of the greatest mechanisms utilized by plants with regards to adapting to a challenging environment [Jing, et.al 2015 ]. This experiment is based on this idea of insect behavior and uses the buckwheat plant (Fagopyrum esculentum) in order to test how a plant species can accommodate for a competing biotic variable through shifts in root to shoot ratio. Regarding the control group of the experiment, five plans will be grown from seeds in a controlled environment that simulates the natural environment without herbivory (2 weeks). The experimental group will include five buckwheat plants grown in the same conditions with the added variable that they will have their leafs clipped throughout the 2 weeks as they begin to sprout and flourish. It is expected that plants that experience the effects of herbivory will accommodate for such conditions but shifting resources to their shoots to offset loss in leaf area. We plan to carry out the experiment with the following hypothesis in mind: if a buckwheat plant is exposed to simulated herbivory, then it will have a lower root to shoot ratio than buckwheat plants not exposed to herbivory. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out the lab, students planted a total of 10 plants by embedding seeds into separate containers filled with soil. Five plants were designated to serve as the control, while the other five served as the experimental. Plants were placed in sunlight and watered every day for two weeks. The experimental group also experienced an added variable as its leaves were clipped in order to simulate the herbivory factor, which the control group did not experience. After two weeks, the plants were removed from their soil, washed, separated and cut at the root/shoot junction as students then weighed and measured the lengths of the plants. Root to shoot ratios were calculated in order to test for differences between control and experimental groups with the use of a one-tailed, two sample t-test.

Results:
The experimental group yielded a higher R:S ratio in term of mass as compared to the control group. This data produced a p-value of 0.35, (df=30), and a t-value of 0.38. The experimental group also yielded a lower R:S ratio in terms of length. This data produced a one-tailed p-value of 0.08 (df=30), and a t-value of 1.45. 

Discussion:
Regarding our results/data, It is clear that the experiment did not support our hypothesis. We predicted that the experimental group would experience a significantly lower R:S ratio due to loss of leaf area from the simulated herbivory. However, our data did not produce significant statistics when comparing each of these two groups as neither p-value was below 0.05. As a means of interpreting these results, it seems that the buckwheat species could have found other means of accommodating for the loss in leaf area. For example, plants also acquire valuable resources through their roots. It is possible that the plant was able to extract extra resources from the soil in order to offset the loss of resources from the loss in leaf area and therefore, photosynthetic activity. It also seems possible that the simulated version of herbivory used in this experiment did not match well with the natural herbivory that plants experience in nature. It is likely that in natural conditions, herbivory is more intense as insects eat a significant amount of leaf area. The increased loss of leaf area caused by real insects could lead to a significant shift in R:S ratio (decrease) as the plant attempts to offset the loss of lead area/photosynthetic activity. Conducting this experiment again with a significant increase in herbivore activity could help explore this idea and therefore, reflect the findings published in the article by Jing, et. al, which supports the idea of large R:S changes through herbivory. In this sense, it may be likely that R:S ratio is affected by herbivory but in the sense that it increases and not decreases [Jing, et.al 2015]. Testing this idea on different species of plants could also help explore how variations of species respond to these sorts of pressing biotic factors in nature.
