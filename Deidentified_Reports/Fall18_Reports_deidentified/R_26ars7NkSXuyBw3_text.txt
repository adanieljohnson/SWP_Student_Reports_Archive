Title: The presence of food and varying levels light exposure and their effect on the behavior of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to their internal and external environment. Our model organism for this experiment is Physarum polycephalum.

Introduction:

Signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to their internal and external environment. Our model organism for this experiment is Physarum polycephalum. What is unique about the slime mold is that it has multiple nuclei within its plasma membrane. We can use Physarum polycephalum to observe basic cell processes because of this. And possibly give us further insight into the biological nature of decision making in more complex organisms and the molecular cascades in their respective signal transduction pathways. Even without a nervous system, Physarum polycephalum can search for food and retract from everywhere in the maze, connecting the shortest route to the food source. First the syncytium spreads out and connects all the food sources. It then expands or reduces the number and size of the strands based on the amount and quality of the food [Carlile: 1970]. The final network balances distribution of cellular resources for maximum uptake of available nutrients. Physarum spends most of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage and prefers to live in damp and dark environments. It crawls by extending its leading-edge using actin microfilaments [Ueda: 1975]. The cytoplasm inside the thin strands flows bidirectionally. The direction changes frequently, which suggests there is a signaling mechanism that controls flow reversal and thus behavior of the Physarum. Physarum remains a multicellular plasmodium as long as it remains in darkness with high humidity. If food is unavailable or humidity drops, the plasmodium hardens to form a suspended stage called a sclerotium, a hibernation state [Guttes: 1961]. Every response must be controlled and coordinated by one or more of their intracellular signal transduction pathways. All cells have receptors that sense molecules in their environment. These receptors trigger signaling cascades that cause the cell to respond appropriately to those external molecules [Haastert: 1982]. In phototaxis, small masses of plasmodium may migrate away from light, called negative phototaxis. Plasmodium can also will move towards light, which is called positive phototaxis. In chemotaxis, Physarum also undergoes positive and negative chemotaxis. It can sense molecules in its environment, then respond by crawling toward or away from their source [Latty: 2010]. In this experiment, we will be observing Physarum polycephalum’s behavior in the presence of light, phototaxis, and its behavior in the presence of food or glucose, chemotaxis, and hypothesize that Physarum polycephalum will prioritize chemotaxis, and move towards food, even in the presence of light.

Materials and Methods:
We set up three plates completely covered in foil, the Control-Dark samples, three plates with no foil, fully exposed to light, the Control-Light samples, and three plates with foil only covering the Physarum polycephalum, with the food source, glucose, exposed to light, the Test samples. To make the glucose plate, we melted 1% water agar in the microwave. Mixed 20ml of agar with 1 ml of 20X compound. Let cool to 50 C. Poured the mix in a 100 mm petri plate to cool and harden. Cut slabs and placed them on plates. For the chemotaxis portion of the lab, we took the 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water back to your table. We cut 2, 1 cm x 1 cm squares into the agar of the water agar plates. We removed the block of agar on the left side, which is where the glucose block was placed and the right, where culture will go. We then cut, 1 x 1cm square slabs from the glucose plate, and inserted one slab into the water agar plates. Using sterile forceps, we transferred pre-cut blocks of Physarum culture from the stock plate to the right side of the water agar plate. We then taped the lid of each plate to hold it in place and wrapped all plates completely in the appropriate foil configuration, then placed the covered plates into the side cubby overnight (18-24 hours) and the light under the lamps. To score the chemotaxis and phototaxis plates, we removed the plates and used a millimeter ruler to measure the distance that the slime mold migrated from the initial blocks towards the glucose or away from it. If the slime mold migrated away from the block of test substance, indicate that in the table, as a negative value. We then ran a one-tailed two-sample T-test on the average distance travelled of dark plates and test plates, light plates and dark plates, and test plates and light plates. Our significance level, or alpha, is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, and was set to 0.05.

Results:
As shown in Figure 1, the trend observed was that on average, the three replicates of the Physarum polycephalum in total light environment travelled the least distance towards the glucose, 1 mm +/- 0.816, followed by the Physarum in total darkness, 6.33 mm +/- 6.018, and then the Physarum when light was shown only on the glucose food source travelled the most distance, 6.66 mm +/- 1.69. The movement towards the food source is used as an empirical measure of chemotaxis, and thus the preference of food over light in certain conditions. The one-tailed two-sample T-test on the average distance travelled of the three replicates resulted in: Control Dark-Test: (T-value = 0.075, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.471) Control Dark-Control Light: (T-value = 1.24, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.0141) Control Light-Test: (T-value = 4.25, degree of freedom (df) = 4, p-value = 0.0065).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that Physarum polycephalum will prioritize chemotaxis, and move towards food, even in the presence of light, was supported by our results. When looking at the distance travelled by the Physarum polycephalum samples, those that were in the environment with light only on the food source travelled the most towards the glucose, 6.66 mm +/- 1.69, followed closely by the Physarum in complete darkness, 6.33 mm +/- 6.018, and then the Physarum in complete light, 1 mm +/- 0.816. Taking into account the statistical test results, there was a statistical difference between Control Dark-Control Light, p-value = 0.0141, as expected, as well as between Control Light-Test, p-value = 0.0065. The latter is important in that it demonstrates that Physarum polycephalum exhibit a preference towards chemotaxis, even when there is light on the food source, as there was in the Test samples. The final statistical test is also important between Control Dark-Test, which showed an insignificant result, p-value = 0.471. This means that there was no statistical difference between the amount of distance travelled by the Physarum in complete darkness and when there was light on the food source. Further supporting our argument that Physarum prefer a food source over light exposure to an extent. A previous study also supported our results, published in Ecology, demonstrated that food quality and the risk of light exposure affect patch-choice decisions in the slime molds [Latty: 2010]. While our results supported our hypothesis, there was a large standard deviation in the Control Dark results. This can be attributed to a multitude of factors, but there was a systemic problem in the Physarum samples, where normal growth was shut down. A possible reason for this behavior would be that when food is unavailable or humidity drops, the plasmodium hardens to form a suspended stage called a sclerotium, a hibernation state. Thus, movement towards food source would be halted or somehow affected, because of a block in the signal transduction pathways for chemotaxis. There are multiple pathways that control our behavior, each using different receptors and secondary messengers, and a small change in the amount of one molecule affects our thoughts and behavior, by influencing enzymatic and other cellular activities directly, or they can bind to calcium-binding proteins, to modulate protein kinase within the cell [Hasstert: 1982]. A previous study also  varied the level of ultraviolet radiation on the Physarum polycephalum at different times in the mitotic cycle, halting replication in some cases [Vimala: 1968]. A future study could take this into account and look at how varying levels of light affect Physarum polycephalum’s preference towards food and nutrients and its tolerance levels towards light.
