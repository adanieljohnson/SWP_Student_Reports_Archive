Title: The Effects of Light and Dark on The Root:Shoot Ratio of Buckwheat

Abstract:
Being able to understand what conditions can maximize the productivity of any given plant is important not only for commercial use, but also for having a greater understanding of a plant’s interaction with its environment. The plant buckwheat, Fagopyrum Esculentum, was grown in two different settings, on in the light and one in dark, in order to determine how it affected the plant’s growth. More specifically, the root:shoot ratio which can show how the roots of a plant grow in comparison to the stem. When analyzing the data collected from the buckwheat plants in both settings, it was shown that the two factors of light and dark did not have a significent impact on how large or small the root:shoot ratio was. This goes to show that the root:shoot ratio cannot be altered by the amount of light the plant is exposed to and therefore is better determined by the type of soil the plant is in and how much nutrients it receives from this soil.

Introduction:
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum Esculentum), is a fairly common plant [4] that is used widely as a cover crop for large fields. It is a plant that does well in low-fertility soils as well as acidic soils [5]. The efficiency of a plant like this can be analyzed through something known as a root:shoot ratio. The purpose of measuring this ratio between the root and shoot is to show how well a plant can grow in a given environment, and it can also show what kind of environment the plant is growing in. It has been observed that plants whose soil may contain less nutrients will have longer root systems in order to seek out more sources of sustenance, while more tropical plants may not need roots to reach to the depths of the other plants.  The two factors of light and dark were chosen due to their simplicity, but also to see if this ratio is really affected by the presence of a light source, or whether it is completely due to environmental factors like the nutrients in the soil. To be more specific, it is already known that the root:shoot ratio is determined by the amount of nutrients that are in the soil [3], but this experiment looks to figure out whether there are more factors that must be accounted for in the determination of the root:shoot ratio. Light and dark were not chosen just because they are easy to controll, but also because there are factors in the environment that can limit these two things naturally, so it would be useful to see these types of effects. All of this coming together, I hypothesize that when there is less light present in the growth process that the plant will not be able to grow very long roots and in turn decreasing the root:shoot ratio. 

Materials and Method:
We began the lab by filling eight separate plastic pots with vermiculite, and labeling each pot with a light or dark label, more specifically four light and four dark. Next these pots were placed into a larger tray where each was pre-watered and sprayed with miracle grow before any seeds were planted. Once this was completed we took around fifteen seeds for each one of the eight pots and planted them into each. The high amount of seeds for each pot was necessary to assure that there would be enough test samples to use once the growing was completed. These eight pots were then placed into the greenhouse, four in light and four under a black curtain to act as constant darkness. For two weeks the plants were watched and watered every day as they grew. Once the growing was done, the plants were taken into the lab room and harvested, three plants from each pot were used to measure the weight of the root and shoot as well as the length of the root and shoot. Each of the two factors data was compiled and analyzed with the average root:shoot ratio.

Results:
The buckwheat seeds that were grown in both factors experienced substantial growth, both presenting some different physical factors like color and number of leaves. The root:shoot ratio of the light plants in terms of weight was averaged to be 0.1 with a standard deviation of 0.03, while the root:shoot ratio of the dark plants inn terms of weight had an average of 0.175 with a standard deviation of 0.021. When it came to the root:shoot ratio according to the length of the roots and shoots, the light plant averaged 0.871 with a standard deviation of 0.213 and the dark plants had an average ratio of 0.682 with standard deviation 0.0962. To better analyze the data, a two-tailed two-sample t_test was used to determine the significance of the numbers and ratios that were found. The average root:shoot ratio according to the weight was shown to be not statistically significent when the dark plants were compared to the light plants (T stat = 2.684, d.f. = 18, p =.065). When comparing the root:shoot ratio as determined by the average length in the light or dark plants, this comparison between the two was also proven to be not statistically significent (T stat = 1.735, d.f. = 18, p = .0998). Root:shoot ratios determined from the averages of both weight and length in the light and dark samples may be better represented as a bar graph in order to provide visualization of the differences that are shown in the data. 

Discussion:
The original hypothesis that the plants grown in the dark would grow smaller roots than normal, and therefore lead to a smaller root:shoot ratio was not supported by the experiment. All in all, the difference in the average weights and lengths of both the light and dark plants was not very large (P=.065/.0998). This shows that the two factors that were chosen, light and dark, did not actually have much of an effect on the growth of the plant. I had originally believed that the plants grown in the light would be able to grow larger and have longer roots due to the fact that more photosynthesis would be able to occur in a maximal amount of light that was provided by the greenhouse [1]. This also leads me to believe that the only real factors that go into determining the root:shoot ratio and/or the length of the roots in a plant is based solely upon the amount of nutrients within the soil [2]. There was a possibility of error, as there is in any experiment, and more specifically in the days that the plants were watered. There was a hurricane the first weekend the plants were to be watered and due to this they were not watered for two days, but seeing as the plants still had significent growth at the end of the two week period I can determine that this error did not effect the experiment much as a whole. Another smaller error that could have been made was due to human error in the possibility of the measurements taken for each plant could have been off by very small factors, and because of these small factors I do not feel that this had a large impact on the results. Being able to understand the root:shoot data of such a common plant that is frequently used in agriculture can have many positive impacts, especially since buckwheat can grow in less than exceptional environments. Such a knowledge can help those that use the plant be more efficient in its planting and by using the root:shoot ratio can see that the plant does not necessarily need to be in the most fertilized environment in order to thrive.
