Title: The effects of acid rain on the Root:Shoot ratio of the Fagopyrum esculentum plant

Abstract:
This study looks at how the Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plant adjust to abiotic factors of the environment through resource allocation. Abiotic factors are stimuli that come from non-living aspects of the environment. A great example of an abiotic factor is rainfall. To successfully complete our experiment it was necessary for us to have many replicas of the buckwheat plant. This is only because the size of the plant was so tiny that we needed a lot of specimens to be able to clearly see differences in data. In the growing process we utilized two groups of plants. One group was grown with acid rain water, the other was grown with regular water. After a week we took the plants out of the pots and processed them for data. Our data comes through the form of root: shoot ratios for height and weight. Our hypothesis was that plants watered with acid rain would have larger root to shoot ratios. This is because we thought the plants would allocate more resources to their roots to become better at finding nutrients in the soil . Our results tells us that we have no significent difference between our data sets. 


Introduction:
In any enviroment a combination of biotic and abiotic factors interact with each organism. Plants and animals interact on a day to day basis so they learn to adapt to one another. Abiotic factors are stimuli that come from non-living aspects of the environment. This is like wind, rain, or pollution. This study looks at how plants adjust to abiotic factors of the environment. In resource allocation the plant is seeking to optimize the way it responds to environmental cues and to integrate these with the genetically determined elements of development in order to maximize its reproductive potential and ensure the production and survival of the next generation [Bennet: 2012]. Acid rain is an abiotic factor caused by pollution on the earth. Rain is a much needed resource of plants, so what affect does unsually acidic rain have? A study was preformed that simulated acid rain (SAR) at early plant growth on some morphochemical characters of two varieties of Mash (Vigna mungo L.).  The data revealed that low pH aﬀected more severely at all parameters including number of leaves, shoot: root ratio, water contents of shoot and Potassium ion concentration. Whereas for a few parameters like plant height and number of branches the simulated acid rain proved a bit better for plant growth, the root length was increased in case of SAR [Imran:2014]. We will be studying the resource allocation of the Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plant under the influence of acid rain. We hypothesized that acid rain would trigger a greater root:shoot ratio in the buckwheat plant. This is because resource allocation would cause the plant to focus more on the roots due to a lack of nutrients. This lack of nutrients would be caused by the unusually acidic rainfall. 


Materials and Method:
We made 8 pots that contained seeds of the buckwheat plant. With four of the pots we watered the plants using regular water. With the remaining four we used acid rain. The plants were placed in a green house and for every day of that week we watered each respective pot with 25Ml of its designated treatment. To start the data collection of the study we first harvested 10 different Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plants from each group. In all 20 different plants were utilized. The next step was to take the mass of the whole plant. From here we used siccors to detach the stem of the plant from the root. We made sure to cut at the same spot on every plant. This spot was at the first color change on the stem. Next we cut the point of the stem where all the leaves came together. We weighed and measured each processed section of the plant. We recorded all the values found in this section of the study.  In processing our results we utilized a 2-tailed statistical T-test.This type of test utilizes P and T values for understanding the significance of the data. The cut off for significent data is P.05.


Results:
The Data depicted in figures 1&2 show the root to shoot ratios of height and weight for each testing sample. Plants watered with regular water had an average size of 0.9513g +/- 0.5410 sd. The plants watered with acid rain were slightly less massive with an average of 0.7339g +/- 0.4295 sd. The average height of plants watered with acid rain was 1.0892mm +/- .4010 sd. While plants that were watered with regular water grew to an average height of 1.0193 +/- 0.3285 sd. Our statistical test show (t_stat=0.982, d.f.=19, P=0.338) for weight. For the height of our plants the statistical test show (t_stat= 0.440, d.f.=19, P=0.665). 


Discussion:
Exposure of plants to different environmental treatments (altered CO2, temperature, and soil pH) resulted in altered growth rates [Yung Ok Kim:2008]In this study we looked into the concepts of plant allocation. To do this we utilized the buckwheat plant and placed it under controllled environmental stress. This stress was brought on by the use of acid rain water. Acid rain pollution has become a new environmental problem, seriously affecting plant survival [Zhang:2018]. Plants gain water and other resources by way of the root. Since acid rain lowers the acidity and nutrients in the soil we hypothesized that the plants would allocate more resources to its roots. This response would help it to take in more nutrients while in a less nutrient rich area. Our data showed that when looking at root to shoot ratio for weight, plants that were given regular water were on average bigger than those given acid rain. This could be due to the lack of nutrients in the acidic water. In looking at the root to shoot ratio in terms of the height, the acid rain caused better growth. Both sets of data showed high standard deviations meaning they were widely spread from the mean. In looking at our p_values, .338 for weight and .665 for height, we find that this data holds little significance. Our results tell us that both sets of data are not significently different from the other, there is no change. From this we can not reject or support our hypothesis.
