Title: ACHe Effects in Frog Leg Muscle Relaxation

Abstract:
The aspect of neuromuscular controll that we wanted to test was the receptiveness of the Gastrocnemius muscles of the frog legs to an injection of Tubocurarine (an ACh Antagonist). We predicted that if Tubocurarine was injected directly into the Gastrocnemius, then the relaxation phase will be longer as shown in the experimental myograms. The frog legs were prepared and were treated with the same pulse voltage for the same amount of repetitions before injecting the legs with Tubocurarine. The trials where the leg muscles did not have Tubocurarnie injected in them had shorter relaxation periods compared to when the Tubocurarine was injected into the leg muscles and the voltage was applied. The paired t_test, containing our means from each of our leg trials (without Tubocurarine injection and with Tubocurarine injection for each of the three legs, supported our hypothesis by having a significent t-value, displaying the fact that the trials containing the Tubocurarine injection had longer relaxation periods. 


Introduction:
Like hormones, nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. The neuromuscular system is different in that it can respond within milliseconds rather than responding in seconds to days like hormone-based systems do. Skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousands of myofibers, which are cylindrical, fused aggregates of cells. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, which have cell bodies located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal [Johnson: 2016]. Ach binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium ion (Na+) channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release of Ca2+ activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten. Myograms are used to monitor and record the macroscopic movements in a muscular nerve. A myogram is when a force transducer is attached to a muscle and it records the amount of force generated over a given time. There are three phases to a myogram, Latent (very short time lapse between the time of stimulation and the time of contraction), contraction (muscle shortening due to chemical changes within muscle fibers) and relaxation (post concentration where muscle returns to its former relaxed state). There are also changes in muscle contractions depending on how it is stimulated. Summation is when force generated by multiple motor units is added together to produce muscle tension. There are two types of summation: spatial (increasing the number of axons that are carrying action potentials which increases the number of active motor units) and temporal summation (axons of a given number of motor units are stimulated repeatedly. Eventually, temporal summation of twitches will cause a motor unit or muscle to generate the maximum force possible, tetanus, which will eventually cause fatigue in the active muscle due to the running of the ATP. In this experiment, we will use frog legs to model the movement and behavior of muscle. My hypothesis for the frog legs is if AChE antagonist Tubocurarine (which binds in the same place as AChE but does not have the function of AChE and is an ACh antagonist) [Katz: 1967] is injected directly into the frog leg muscle Gastrocnemius, then the relaxation phase will be longer [Jaiswal: 1991], as shown and calculated from the experimental myograms.


Materials and Method:
We selected three frog legs of similar size and prepared them by removing the skin and preparing the Gastrocnemius muscle for testing, including properly attaching the leg to the dissecting pan and the force transducer. We attached the first leg to the force transducer and applied one one  volt pulse of force at an amplitude of one three times with enough time in between for the myogram to record the recovery of the muscle in response to the pulse. We then calculated the relaxation phase from the graphing software and recorded that data. We then injected the leg with 0.1 Ml of Tubocurarine and repeated the data collection process for the first frog leg. We then repeated the controll and experimental processes with the second and third frog legs and made sure to carefully clean our experimental pan between trials to make sure our legs did not get contaminated. We then ran a paired t_test (alpha=0.05) to analyze the difference in mean values between the controll trials and the experimental trials.


Results:
The duration of the relaxation periods from when our frog legs were injected with Tubocurarine was consistently longer compared to our controll trials when we did not inject the frog legs with anything. Our results from our paired t_test were (t-value: 10.25, d.f.=2, P(paired)= 0.009384).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported by our experiment because all of our experimental trials where the frog legs were treated with Tubocurarine had a longer relaxation phase compared to the trials where the legs were not treated with Tubocurarine. The Tubocurarine is an Ach antagonist, which allowed for a longer reaction period since the Tubocurarine was binding to Ach, which prevented ACh from binding to its receptors. The Na+ channels that generate action potential in the muscle fiber [Johnson: 2016] were not opened which prevented the action potential from spreading throughout the fiber and prevented the release of Ca2+ from being released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which prevented the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber to be as activated since Ca2+ was not released from internal sites.
