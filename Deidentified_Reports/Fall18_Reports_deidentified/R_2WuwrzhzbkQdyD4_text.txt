Title: The effect of sex on the reaction time of Betta splendens when presented with food

Abstract:
Intraspecific aggression is when animals of the same species show aggression towards each other. Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens) is a fish that shows a good demonstration of this behavior and has been domesticated due to its unique aggressive behavior and beautiful colors. Male Betta splendens are especially eye-catching as they must engage in agonistic behaviors to protect their nests and assert dominance against other males. In this lab, we observe pairs of fish of the same sex with and without the presence of food in order to see if the addition of a valuable resource would affect the behavior of the fish. The hypothesis of this experiment is that male Betta splendens will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendens. Our data showed a significant difference (P=0.000017) in the time it took for the fish to notice each other. This significance suggests that male Betta splendens will display aggressive behaviors towards the other fish present when introduced to valuable resources, suggesting that there is a dominance hierarchy. Further studies could look into the behavior of a fish when there are other fish present along with food as it may affect the agonistic displays.

Introduction:
Intraspecific aggression is when animals of the same species show aggression towards each other. For some animals, this happens because they need to gain access to resources like food and shelter. There are obviously costs to this behavior too, including the death of the organism when aggressive behaviors occur. An organism with a great demonstration of this adaptation is the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendens), which is a fish native to Southeast Asia. The unique aggressive behavior and beautiful colors of these fish have made it a common domesticated aquarium fish. [Braddock: 1955] In the domesticated fish market, the most extravagant looking fish of this species are the males. This is because the males spend a large amount of energy on the process of reproduction than female Betta splendens. [Justus: 2018] Male Betta splendens have been known to defend their territories against other males as well as court females using agonistic behaviors which are motions that are related to fighting or aggression. [Barrows: 2000] In this lab, we will be observing pairs of fish of the same sex with and without the presence of food in order to see if the addition of a valuable resource (food) would affect the behavior of the fish. This treatment may change the behaviors displayed as female Betta splendens may be more interested in survival than with becoming the dominant fish as they do not need to compete for access to male fish. Therefore, with the knowledge that male Betta splendens tend to be more aggressive than females, the hypothesis of this experiment is that male Betta splendens will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendens.

Materials and Methods:
Male-male fish interaction without food was conducted for 5 minutes. The time it took for fish to notice each other was measured using a stopwatch. Fish were then given at least 5 minutes of rest. The process was repeated on female-female fish pairings without food. Then, the observations were repeated on male-male and female-female pairings with the presence of food. An ANOVA test was conducted to calculate the p-value and determine whether or not there was a significant difference between the time it took for fish to notice each other between the conditions. Tukey-Kramer test was done to confirm where the differences occurred between groups.

Results:
The mean time it took for the male fish to notice each other was 49.67 ± 9.29 seconds for the ‘no food’ condition and 15.00 ± 5.00 seconds for the ‘with food’ condition. The mean time it took for the female fish to notice each other was 216 ± 34.51 seconds for the ‘no food’ condition and 61 ± 25.16 seconds for the ‘with food’ condition (Figure 1). An ANOVA test was used and it indicates that there is a significant difference (P=0.000017) in the time it took for the fish to notice each other. The Tukey-Kramer test also shows that there is a significant difference between some groups. It indicates that the males and females behave differently, that female behavior is different when there is a presence of food, and that male behavior is not different with the presence of food.

Discussion:
With reference to the ANOVA test, the p-value generated is significant according to the alpha of 0.05. The results support the hypothesis that male Betta splendens will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendens. It can be concluded that male Betta splendens will display aggressive behaviors towards the other fish present when presented with valuable resources like food. As mentioned before, there are many costs and benefits to this behavior and the fact that the fish allocated energy into displaying these potentially fatal behaviors to get food shows that its benefits overcame its costs. From the results, we are able to say that food is an important resource for both sexes and that the fish are willing to display aggressive behaviors to wane away its competitor. Past studies have indicated that fish of both sex form intraspecific dominance hierarchies in the presence of a community [Goldstein: 1975] Reinforced with the fact that male Betta splendens are the ones that have to protect the nests and territories, it makes sense that they are less distracted by the food than females as it is key to their survival that they are aggressive. [Todd: 2008] Further studies could possibly look into the behavior of a fish when there are other fish present along with food. The addition of other fish could be interesting since it may affect the agonistic displays, in relation to how dominant it is in its community.
