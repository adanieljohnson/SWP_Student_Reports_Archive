Title: The effect of lanthanum chloride on twitch threshold in Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle

Abstract:
Muscle contraction and stimulation is an important topic in biology. It is important to understand the how calcium and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine are responsible for causing actin and myosin filaments to interact, causing muscle contraction. In this experiment, lanthanum chloride was used to test the effects of a calcium channel blocker on twitch threshold in Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. It was hypothesized that the lanthanum chloride would cause the twitch threshold to increase because this calcium channel blocker would inhibit contraction, therefore the muscle would need to be stimulated with more force to produce contraction. The data proved to be insignificant because the p value of 0.7623 was greater than the alpha value of 0.05. This means that the difference between the control twitch threshold and the experimental twitch threshold after addition of calcium channel blockers for each frog leg was due to chance. This shows that lanthanum chloride is not a universal calcium channel blocker.

Introduction:
In the neuromuscular system, nerves and muscles allow organisms to respond to the environmental stimuli within milliseconds. Motor neurons stimulate muscle contraction using action potentials. When an action potential reaches the neuromuscular junction, uptake of calcium into the presynaptic cell causes ACh to diffuse into the synapse to the postsynaptic cell of the muscle fiber. This opens sodium channels of the post synaptic cell. This depolarization causes other action potentials which stimulate the release of calcium. The calcium causes interactions between the actin and myosin filaments, ultimately resulting in contraction of the muscle. When calcium is taken back up into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the muscle can relax. In this experiment, a myogram is used to record the amount of force the muscle generates during contraction. The twitch of a muscle is the one contraction that results, where a threshold stimulus is the smallest stimulus the muscle needs to contract. In this experiment, the gastrocnemius muscle from the leg of a Rana pipiens is used to determine the twitch threshold. Lanthanum chloride is used to block calcium channels in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens. In a study on calcium and contraction in an esophagus muscle of a cat it was found that in the presence of lanthanum, the calcium blocker, the esophageal contraction was completely gone [Biancani: 1987]. This is important because it shows that calcium inhibitors reduce contraction. It is hypothesized that if the calcium channel is blocked using lanthanum chloride, the twitch threshold will increase because the muscle will have to use a lot more force to stimulate the same contraction, since calcium is what stimulates muscle contraction and actin myosin interactions.

Materials and Methods:
Three Rana pipiens legs were selected. The gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve were isolated from the leg to demonstrate basic properties of neuromuscular control, including contraction. Once the leg was set up with the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve isolated, the muscle was applied directly with stimulation. Stimulation was started with 0.1 volts and was increased by 0.1 volts until a contraction was observed. At this point the resulting voltage was found, and the minimum voltage with an observed twitch was the twitch threshold for the control. Then the same leg was injected with 0.2 mL of calcium channel blocker, lanthanum chloride. The leg sat for 8 minutes, then was stimulated again starting at 0.1 volts, increasing by 0.1 volts until a contraction was observed. This was the twitch threshold for the experimental group. This entire experiment was repeated on three different Rana pipeins legs, first finding the control twitch threshold, then finding the experimental twitch threshold. A paired t test was used to determine differences in the control and experimental twitch threshold.


Results:
When observing the first frog leg, the control had a higher twitch voltage than when the calcium was injected. For the second and third frog leg, once the leg was injected with calcium channel blocker, the twitch threshold voltage was larger. The third frog leg, for the experimental part produced a large contraction. When compared to the alpha value of 0.05, the p value of 0.7623 shows that the results were insignificant and the difference between the control and experimental twitch threshold voltages for the frog legs was due to chance. For frog leg 1 the control twitch threshold was 0.45 V, compared to the experimental twitch threshold with calcium channel blocker of 0.22V (Fig 1).  The difference between these twitch thresholds was -0.23V. For frog leg 2 the control twitch threshold was 0.10 V, compared to the experimental twitch threshold with calcium channel blocker of 0.40V (Fig 1).  The difference between these twitch thresholds was 0.30V. For frog leg 3 the control twitch threshold was 0.30 V, compared to the experimental twitch threshold with calcium channel blocker of 0.39V (Fig 1).  The difference between these twitch thresholds was 0.09V. A paired t test was used to analyze the results. The p value was 0.7623, with degrees of freedom = 2, and the t statistic = 0.3461.


Discussion:
The hypothesis that calcium channel blocker leads to increased twitch threshold is not supported. Since the p value of 0.7623 is larger than the alpha value of 0.05, the results are insignificant, and the difference between the twitch threshold voltages is due to chance. This demonstrated that calcium channel blocker does not increase the twitch threshold. While calcium channel blocker should increase the twitch threshold because calcium blocker should stop interactions between actin and myosin, this was not always the case. For the second and third frog leg, the calcium channel blocker worked as hypothesized. The twitch threshold after the calcium channel blocker was added was larger than the twitch threshold of the control, because the muscle had to use a lot more force to contract. However, in frog leg 1, the calcium channel blocker did not work as hypothesized. The control twitch threshold was larger than the twitch threshold after the addition of the calcium channel blocker. There are many reasons for this observation. If anything changes regarding the tension and position for the set up for the frog leg stimulation, this will greatly affect the resulting voltage for a stimulus voltage. One of these errors could have a caused the control twitch threshold to be larger for the first frog leg. Furthermore, other experiments have yielded similar results to ours. In another experiment using lanthanides on cation channels, it was found that lanthanides were unable to block the channel, and they increased the twitch amplitude [Mezochow: 2010]. This study concluded that lanthanides are not universal cation channel blockers, and calcium pathways may be different in plants and invertebrate animals [Mezochow: 2010]. An understanding of how calcium channel blockers work on animals is important for comprehending the pathways for cation channels in the neuromuscular junctions, and provides information on how contraction works at the cellular level.

Difference in twitch threshold voltages varied depending on frog leg (p value = 0.7623, degrees of freedom = 2, t statistic = 0.3461). For frog leg 1, calcium channel blocker decreased twitch threshold voltage, with the difference being -0.23V.
