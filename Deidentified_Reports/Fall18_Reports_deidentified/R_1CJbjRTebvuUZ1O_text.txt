Title: The effect of Light Color on the energy allocation of Buckwheat plants

Abstract:
Using Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants, we investigated the use of red light on energy allocation. Many plants are often grown under different colors of light, and noticing this pattern we asked: how will light color affect the root:shoot ratios of the plants? We hypothesized that the buckwheat grown under red light would in comparison to the control group allocate more resources to its roots and capturing energy than investing in growth of it’s shoot. After growing the plants for 2 weeks under different light conditions, there proved to be no difference in the ratio of resources allocated to each portion of the plant by the different groups, hoever there was a seemingly significant difference in overall size, with the control group plants being much larger. This result was probably skewed by the red light group’s plastic filter trapping in heat and moisture, possibly smothering the plant in excess heat and water, preventing growth. Thus further experiments are likely required to ensure the accuracy of this experiment’s results.

Introduction:
	Plants, like any organism, have limited resources available to them. How plants “spend” their resources depends on many environmental factors [Lab Manual : 2018]. Different colors of light are known to affect plant growth, with red typically being the most effective at spurring growth within filtered light colors and green the least effective, although this varies between plant species [McCoshum : 2011]. This difference between light colors is due to the different wavelengths of light that make up the different colors affects the production of different chemicals within the plant, in turn affecting the plant’s overall growth and structure [McCoshum : 2011]. Knowing that changing light color will affect how well plants are able to grow and produce certain resources, how will changing light color affect a plant’s resource allocation? To calculate this, we will analyze the ratio between resources allocated to the roots and resources allocated to shoots of Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants. A higher root-shoot ratio will typically that the plant needed to invest more in gathering energy while a lower root-shoot ratio typically means that the plant was easily nourished and could afford to allocate more towards it’s growth [Lab Manual : 2018]. In this experiment, we will test the effects of receiving solely red light on the root:shoot ratios of buckwheat plants. Our hypothesis is that plants grown under red light will have higher root-shoot ratios than the plants grown under normal light (control group).
HA: Root-Shoot ratios will increase under red light



Materials and Methods:
Materials used in this lab included:
¥	Four thin, square, plastic potting containers
¥	Two larger, thicker plastic containers
¥	About 100 buckwheat seeds
¥	Potting soil
¥	Miracle grow liquid fertilizer mix
¥	Tap water
¥	Translucent red plastic 
Fill the four plastic pots with potting soil, then put approximately 25 seeds in each pot, planting them just beneath the soil and spaced out within the pot. After placing the seed, add 200mL of miracle grow to each pot, then about 500 ml of water to each pot. Place the pots in containers, then place those in a greenhouse with one container holding two pots under normal sunlight and one container holding two pots under sunlight filtered through the red plastic. Leave the plants in the greenhouse for the next two weeks, giving them the same amount of water each day. In our experiment, the amount of water varied each day due to an inability to access the greenhouse during hurricane Florence. After two weeks, the plants were carefully removed from the pots using plenty of water and were washed, and from each pot 6 plants were selected at random (making 12 plants for each light color). The root lengths were measured from the tip of the root to the root-shoot junction, and the shoot lengths were measured from the root-shoot junction to the point where the leaves branch from the stem. The plants were then cut at the root-shoot junction and the leaf-stem junction and weighed the roots and the shoot of each plant. 


Results:
The mean root-shoot ratios for weight and length of the red-light group were not significantly different from the ratios of the normal-light control group.
Weight: T-Stat = 0.714, df = 22, p = 0.0483
Length: T-Stat = 0.0467, df = 22, p = 0.963
It is worth noting that even though the ratios were similar, the mean values for the root and shoot length and weight of red light plants was much smaller than that of the normal light plants.


Discussion:
The data did not support our hypothesis as the root-shoot ratios were fairly similar and weren’t close to having a statistically significant difference between the two. Even though the root-shoot ratios were roughly the same, the mean of the weights and lengths had a noticeable difference. The red-light plants were on average much smaller than the control group plants, but they managed to hold the same root-shoot ratio as the control group plants. This means that the red-light plants were probably receiving enough nutrients and required sunlight, but likely had their growth stunted by a confounding factor. In the case of our study, the lurking variable that stunted the red-light plant’s growth was the plastic cover, it seemed to trap heat and moisture in, possible suffocating the plants with the excess heat and water in the soil. In future experiments the red plastic should be kept well above the plants and the control should have a layer of clear plastic above it as well to avoid this problem. With the results we have however, we can infer that buckwheat plant’s resource allocation is unaffected by red-light. It may also be helpful to test many other colors as well to see if they have an effect on buckwheat’s resource allocation.
