Title: The effect of 2% of sevin of frog leg contractions

Abstract:
Rana Pipiens frogs predominantly rely on the contraction of their gastrocnemius muscle for movement. When there is a change in the calcium level or an action potential does not occur, the gastrocnemius muscle does not contract in the amount required for the intended movement. In this lab, 2% of Sevin was injected into the gastrocnemius of the frog leg. It was hypothesized that the addition of 2% of Sevin in the gastrocnemius would cause an increase in the twitch frequency and would ultimately lead to tetany at a lower amplitude. However, data did not show a significant difference between the control and experimental frog legs. The experimental frog legs failed to reach tetany at a lower amplitude than the control frog legs. The hypothesis was not supported by the results of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Muscles contract when neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, are released into the neurotransmitter junction and bind to the postsynaptic muscle fiber. An action potential is created by the binding, causing the action potential to spread through the muscle. Then the muscle myosin binds to actin which leads to the actual contraction of the muscle. Calcium also influences the contractions of the muscle. When calcium is released into the cytoplasm, it binds with troponin, allowing the myosin binding site to be exposed and ultimately allows the myosin to bind with the actin [Endo:1968]. Calcium is then taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing relaxation of the muscle [Endo:1968]. In the lab, the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve of a frog under the injection of 2% of Sevin was examined. 2% of Sevin is a chemical insecticide naphthyl methylcarbamate. It is typically used to kill pests due to its powerful effect on their nervous systems and causing their death. Based off previously conducted experiments, it is believed that 2% of Sevin interferes with the venous fluid which helps conduct action potentials created by the stimulation of the motor fibers involuntary muscles [Dale:1936]. The biological question investigated was whether 2% of Sevin would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower stimulus amplitude. To answer this question, the effects of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude was investigated. It is hypothesized that when 2% of Sevin solution is injected into frog legs, the muscle will twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower amplitude.

Materials and Methods:
To begin three frog legs were selected and placed them on three separate pans. The frog legs were set on the pan. The skin was peeled off the frog legs. A scissor was used to separate the gastrocnemius muscle from the bone, breaking the connective tissue, finally, the connective tissue was cut towards the end of the muscle. Then the sciatic nerve was separated. Pins were used to holding the leg in place. A 30 cm piece of string was used and tied around the tip of the muscle when tying the muscle, the string was looped so it could be suspended from the arm of the force transducer. The electrode was placed securely with forceps and placed with the sciatic nerve over it. The electrode allowed the nerve to be stimulated and record the distance in peaks from the myograph. Once the frog leg was prepared the other end of the electrode was plugged into the computer.  The control part of the experiment was done first, the muscle was stimulated by action potentials, that come from the nerve. The computer generates a stimulation of different frequencies (2,4,5,10,15,20, and 25 Hz). For each stimulation, the pulse was set to 0, the pulse amplitude remained at 1.0 A, and the width at 5 ms. Press record on the computer and record observations. Record the distance between the peaks of the twitches until the frog leg reaches tetany. Then the muscle was injected in random spots with 2% of seven, using a syringe and repeat the procedures above. Then the same process was repeated for the two other legs. Finally, a paired T-test was done to the averages of both experimental and control data. 

Results:
The experiment did not show a significant difference in between the control and experimental group. Based on the raw data there is a slight difference between the control frog leg and the experimental frog legs reaching tetany.  Two out of three frog legs never reached full tetany. When analyzed by frequencies, both the control and experimental groups from 2-10 Hz varied very little. However, in the higher frequencies like stated previously the experimental legs did not always reach full tetany, as seen in figure 1. The test used to analyze the data was a paired T-test, to see if the average distance between twitches in ms with a 0.1 mL of 2% of seven would significantly affect the experimental group vs. the control group. The findings showed that there was no significant difference (t-stat=0.995, df=6, P=0.357512).



Discussion:
The purpose of this experiment was to test whether adding 0.1 mL of 2% of seven would affect the amount of Hz it would take for a frog leg to reach tetany. It was hypothesized that when 2% of seven was injected into the muscle, it would twitch more frequently, and reach tetany at a lower stimulus. Base on this the alternate hypothesis must be rejected. The results proved that the frequencies were not statistically different. Therefore, the conclusion is that 2% of sevin does not affect the time it takes to reach tetany. In actuality, some of the results showed that the legs did not reach tetany at 25 Hz, which is the typical frequency. However, error in the experiment must be taken into consideration. The same frog leg was used for control and experimental, meaning the leg could have been tired. Although our hypothesis was rejected, it was thought to be true because, 2% of sevin was theoretically supposed to keep the calcium gated channels open longer. This would allow the muscle to contract more frequently. If this experiment were to be preformed again,  a new chemical that affects the calcium gated channel should be tested (Dale, 354)
