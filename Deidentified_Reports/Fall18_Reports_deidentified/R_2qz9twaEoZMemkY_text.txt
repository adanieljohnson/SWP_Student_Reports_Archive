Title: Growth and development of Manduca sexcta exposed to ecdysterone blocker azadiractin 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a common agricultural pest in the Tobacco industry. In order to determine examine ways to control this pest species the impact of the Ecdysterone blocker Azadiractin was studied. Ecdysterone is an insect hormone which regulates the timing of molts. By altering Ecdysterone it is possible that the molting of Manduca sexta might altered of blocked. In this study half of the caterpillars where given food with a small amount of Azadiractin and the other half served as a control. The development of the caterpillars was observed through changes in weight. Through observation and analysis, it was determined that Azadiractin has some impact on the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, but that due to other factors examined in the article by Ridderford. 20E blockers are not and ideal way to control the pest population. Other means of pest control will be necessary in light of the Manduca sexta population.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta or Tobacco Hornworm is an agricultural pest. In its juvenile state, it destroys tobacco crops which are its primary source of food. The process of metamorphosis transforms Manduca sexta caterpillars from their juvenile state as larva to their mature, adult form. Over the course of its growth and development, the Manduca sexta experiences a series of molts called instars followed by pupation. This process of is controlled by Insect Growth Hormones (IGHs), specifically Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterones (20E). While JH determines the type of molt and maintains the juvenile state of the caterpillar, 20E is responsible for the timing of molting and pupation. In addition, both hormones are present in adults and perform other complex functions. Because of their impact on tobacco crops the use of IGHs is being explored as a method of pest control. In the article by [Riddiford: 2003], 20E and JH are discussed in reference to molting. Here JH is discussed as a preventative for both molting and pupation within the Manduca sexta. It is our hypothesis that giving Manduca sexta caterpillars the 20E blocker Azadiractin will impact their development into adults and decrease their weight during the fifth instar.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars at their fifth instar where split into two groups. Each caterpillar was isolated in a container and given 10g of food. The control group received food with 6 drops of deionized water while the experimental group received food with 6 drops of Azadiractin. All caterpillars were kept in and incubator to stimulate growth. Each day for fourteen days, beginning on the second day, the caterpillars where weighed (g). Food was replenished as necessary adding the appropriate amount of water or hormone for each subsequent refeeding. When the time allotted for the experiment ended, the data was analyzed using a two tailed T-test. 

Results:
Experimentation showed that the 20E blocker impacts the development of Manduca sexta in their larval state. When compared to the control group, the experimental group was smaller in weight with an average weight of 3.095g in comparison to the control group which had an average weight of 5.298g. This can be seen in figure 1. The two groups had a standard deviation of 2.06g. In addition to the change in weight, the experimental group consumed less food and took a slightly longer amount of time to pupate. Their pupation occurred a day to two days later than the control group and their pupated size was considerably smaller. These outcomes indicate an impact of Azadiractin on Manduca sexta development. 

Discussion:
In examining the data, it is apparent that the caterpillars’ exposure to the 20E blocker, Azadiractin, did have a significant impact on the growth and development of the caterpillars which can be seen in the p-value 0.0375. The caterpillars exposed to the Azadiractin did not gain weight at the rate of the control group and took longer to pupate. Because of this the null hypothesis can be rejected.
These results are somewhat reflected in the paper by [Riddiford: 2003]. The paper is more centered on the idea that diminishing JH levels are responsible for pupation and that JH is responsible for the creation of other transcription factors which influence commitment, pupation, and maturation of the Manduca sexta [Riddiford: 2003]. They write that it is absence of Juvenile Hormone during the fifth instar which allows Manduca sexta to begin pupation, but our experiment did not block JH. Our experiment blocked 20E which is responsible for the timing of molting and pupation, and yet we still had most of our caterpillars pupate within the two-week experimental period. One explanation for this can be seen in the article when they infer that extremely small amounts of 20E can, in the absence of high levels of JH lead to a commitment pulse [Riddiford: 2003]. It is possible, even with the Azadiractin, extremely small levels of 20E in the right circumstances could lead to pupation. 
In regard to the significant weight difference, 20E is responsible for “orchestrating” molting [Riddiford: 2003]. It drives the caterpillar to consume more food in preparation to molt or pupate where JH actually controls the molting and pupation. The diminished weight of the caterpillars in the experimental group when compared with the control group could likely stem from a decrease in appetite. 20E affects growth and development in several ways, notably it stimulates the appetite of the caterpillars causing them to gain weight leading to further progression of developmental stages. When blocked, 20E cannot stimulate eating and without weight gain the caterpillars will slow in their development. 
There is the potential that the caterpillars behaved the way that they did because of the change to their food. The experimental group ate less of the food which likely contributed to a lower weight overall. Furthermore, it is possible that the stress from not eating slowed their pupation into adults. One explanation for this is that they did not like the food with the Azadiractin in it.
The use of Azadiractin, while it does affect growth and development of the Manduca sexta, is not particularly effective in the control of pests. Azadiractin should not be used to control Manduca sexta populations in an agricultural setting. Though they ate less food in their larval state, the experimental group remained in the larval stage for a longer period of time than the control group. In addition, the caterpillars survived to pupation and likely would have become reproductively mature adults. Given this experiment, other means of controlling the Manduca sexta population will likely need to be used.
