Title: Effects of Precor on Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20E) are two important hormones that can regulate an insect’s development. They work together to controll growth rate, metamorphosis, and molting of insects. The purpose of our experiment is to test the effects of Precor, an insect growth regulator that mimicking natural JH, on growth rate and pupation of Manduca sexta caterpillars. Eight 4th to 5th instar Manduca sexta larvae were divided into a controll group and an experimental group. We collected weight, length, and growth rate of each caterpillar and recorded observation for two weeks. Two sample t_test is used to analyze data and the results lead to a conclusion that the reintroducing of Precor can inhibit Manduca sexta caterpillars progressing onto the pupal stage, but there is no significent relationship between increasing growth rate and the adding of Precor.

Introduction:
Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) are the two main hormones in insects. Ecdysterone is a naturally occurring ecdysteroid hormone that can regulate the timing of molting in insect growth and can affect other functions in insects’ adulthoods. Juvenile Hormones are long-chain organic molecules secreted by Corpus Allata. JH controlls the type of molt during insect’s developments and also regulate several functions in adult insects. 
Methoprene (Precor) is a juvenile hormone (JH) analog which acts as a growth regulator when used as an insecticide. It is an amber-colored liquid and human beings can use them to controll mosquitoes which spread dengue fever. Instead of killing insects, Methoprene acts as an insect growth regulator, mimicking natural JH. Juvenile hormone must be absent for a pupa to molt into an adult. So, when larvae are treated with Methoprene, they will be unable to successfully turn into adults from pupae. The insect’s life cycle will break in this way. Methoprene is considered a biological pesticide, but it still has varied effects on different insect species and life stages [Wijayaratne:2018]
In this experiment, our group focus on Methoprene (Precor), which mimics JH. Our hypothesis is that: if an analogue of JH (Precor) is reintroduced in the larval stage of the Manduca sexta, growth rate (weight difference) of the larva will increase without progression onto the pupal stage.


Materials and Method:
We selected eight 11-12 days old, 4th to 5th instar Manduca sexta larvae and divided them into two groups. Their weights and lengths were measured. We then placed each caterpillar in its own separate jars and fed each of them one of the two diets: the first four caterpillars in the controll group received 10g Manduca sexta diet with 5 drops of water; the remaining four caterpillars in the experimental group received 10g Manduca sexta diet with 5 drops of 1: 1000 Precor. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 25 Celsius degrees, 12-hour dark cycle and we record the weights and lengths every day for each caterpillar for three weeks. The caterpillars in the controll group kept being dark green in the first 11 days and kept growing longer and heavier; they formed cocoons and turned brown from the 12 days on. The caterpillars in the treatment group turned light green after they were fed by diet with Precor, and they kept growing longer and heavier. A two-sample t_test is used to compare the difference between the growth rate of the caterpillars and our alpha value is 0.05. 

Results:
For the growth rate, according to Figure 1, in the controll group, all caterpillars kept growing heavier in the first few days. They formed cocoons at day 12 and their weight kept constant around day 11 to day 14. In the experimental group with 1: 1000 Precor, all caterpillars kept growing for the two-week periods (except the outlier day 8,14) and failed to pupate. We use a two-sample t_test in the experiment. The results have values d.f.=26, t-value=0.874, and one-tailed p_value=0.195 (p&gt;0.05). We failed to reject the null and there should be no relationship between the adding of Precor and the increase of growth rate. 
For length in Figure 2, caterpillars in the controll group have an average length of 6.08 cm, which is a little bit longer than those in the treatment group with an average length of 5.81 cm. For weight in Figure 3, caterpillars in the controll group have an average of 3.97 g, which is lighter than those in the treatment group with an average length of 4.86 cm. 


Discussion:
The analysis of data does not support that the growth rate will increase due to the adding of Precor. However, the data did support that the caterpillars in the controll group would pupate, but the treatment group would not. The treatment of Methoprene (Precor) inhibited wasp emergence in a dose-dependent manner in insects, which causes delay or inhibition of turning into adults of insects [Beckage: 1981]. 
With statistics analysis, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and there is no significent difference between the controll and experimental group in the growth rate. Our measurements also show that the average length of caterpillars in the experimental group is a little bit longer, but the weight of them are lighter compared to those in the controll group. So, it is hard to tell whether Precor has a positive effect on growth. According to Nijhout et al (2006), the body size of insects is determined by 3 parameters: the growth rate, the critical weight, and the interval between the critical weight and the secretion of ecdysone. There is no single locus of controll of the size of body, because the body size depends on interaction between determinants of the three parameters. However, here in our experiment, we use weight difference to act as growth rate, which is not precise enough as Nijhout suggested: weight difference and growth rate are two different definitions. Also, the length and weight should combine together to interpret the growth rate. For future experiments, we should define growth rate in a more precise way. Finally, a conclusion is drawn from our results that the reintroducing of Precor can inhibit Manduca sexta caterpillars progressing onto the pupal stage, but there is no significent relationship between increasing growth rate and the adding of Precor.
