Title: High Increase in Ecdysone levels in Manduca sexta yield lower growth rates and premature molting

Abstract:
Hormones in an organism’s body work together and serve many important functions. When these hormone concentrations are varied, they produce different effects in the organism, activating or inhibiting natural sequences and reactions. This can be studied in the Manduca sexta, a caterpillar that has a well-illustrated molting process, by varying its hormones. It’s changes between larvae phases are called instars, each characterized by a molt. The timing of this molt is controlled primarily by two hormones, ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone. While the effects of these hormones are known, the question arises, “what if the hormone levels changed significantly?’’ Would molting occur? If molting didn’t occur would uncontrolled growth occur? This is important because it brings up the further question of, by controlling the growth and development of these caterpillars into moths, could hormones be administered as natural pesticides, controlling the transition of the pest caterpillars into moths? This idea is cited to a scientific article that studied the effects of Manduca sexta when administered a molting hormone. The results concluded that individuals were unable to develop any further, even after forming a complete molt (Leonard CL. 1985.). Therefore, it is hypothesized that a group of cate

Introduction:
Hormones in an organism’s body work together and serve many important functions. When these hormone concentrations are varied, they produce different effects in the organism, activating or inhibiting natural sequences and reactions. This can be studied in the Manduca sexta, a caterpillar that has a well-illustrated molting process, by varying its hormones. It’s changes between larvae phases are called instars, each characterized by a molt. The timing of this molt is controlled primarily by two hormones, ecdysone and Juvenile Hormone. While the effects of these hormones are known, the question arises, “what if the hormone levels changed significantly?’’ Would molting occur? If molting didn’t occur would uncontrolled growth occur? This is important because it brings up the further question of, by controlling the growth and development of these caterpillars into moths, could hormones be administered as natural pesticides, controlling the transition of the pest caterpillars into moths? This idea is cited to a scientific article that studied the effects of Manduca sexta when administered a molting hormone. The results concluded that individuals were unable to develop any further, even after forming a complete molt (Leonard CL. 1985.). Therefore, it is hypothesized that a group of caterpillars given an ecdysone-infused diet will possess incorrect hormones levels, leading to an inability to pupate and uncontrolled growth.

Materials and Methods:
In this lab, environments were set up for the caterpillars with control or treatment diets provided. The caterpillar’s growth was observed daily, as well as its weight recorded daily. The materials needed for the lab included eight healthy Manduca sexta caterpillars of the same age, isolated environments for the eight caterpillars, 10g of caterpillar diet per caterpillar, ecdysone hormone or hormone mimic, a weight scale, an incubator, a “hole” tool, sharpie, transfer pipet, scooping utensil, and a data log book. First the environments for the caterpillars were made. Two four-celled plastic containers, with a lid, were used. Respiration was possible inside the environments by using the “hole” tool to create three holes near the top of each cell. The sharpie was used to label the control and treatment environment and then label the individual caterpillar cells. Next, the diet was prepared. 10g of food was measured out for each caterpillar, rolled into a ball, and placed into the cell. If the food was too dry to form a ball, a few drops of water were used to moisten it. Using the transfer pipet, 4 drops of ecdysone hormone were then added to the balls of food of the treatment group, remixed and replaced into the cell. Next, each caterpillar was weighed, recorded and placed into its appropriate cell to begin eating and developing. The environments were placed into an incubator and only removed during further daily observations and measurements. Every 24 hours the caterpillars were weighed and observed, and data was recorded. When food levels were low, an additional 10g of food was provided. The extra food did not include ecdysone hormones for the control or the treatment group. The data was recorded daily in a chart depicting the weight of each caterpillar. This data was then used to calculate the maximum weights of both the control and treatment group and depicted into a bar graph including error bars. Also, the data was statically analyzed in a Sample t Test.

Results:
In the experiment, the treatment group did produce a different growth pattern than that of the control group. The control group followed natural growth patterns while the treatment group, in comparison, showed slower growth rates. Also, the treatment group reached a lower maximum average weight compared to the average maximum weight of the control group being. Another important observation is the length of time it took for each group to begin pupation. The treatment group began pupating days before the control group did. One other important observation is the observation of color and movement. The treatment group lost its teal color and transitioned into a brown color and had very little movement before the pupation began.In this chart, the maximum weights of both the control group and treatment groups are illustrated. The control group reached a higher mass with a small margin in the error bars. The treatment group grew to a lower maximum average weight with a slightly larger margin in the error bars. After statistically analyzing the data it yielded a t-value of 6.852393, 6 degrees of freedom, and a p-value of .000238. 

Discussion:
These results did not support the hypothesis. The higher levels of ecdysone administered to the caterpillars did change the hormones balances but resulted in different effects than hypothesized. Instead, the treated caterpillars had a reduced growth rate and entered pupation earlier. From this, it can be inferred that the increase levels of ecdysone triggered the commitment phase, a naturally occurring increase of ecdysone levels that signals the beginning of molting between instars, early. Growth rates slowed to begin preparing for pupation and molting began days earlier than the control group. The control group continued to grow normally during the instar and prepare for pupation at a natural time. Also, the observation of discoloration and lethargic movement in the treatment group can show the lethal effects the hormones can have on the organisms in unbalanced quantities. These lethal effects can be related back to the scientific journal where an injection of hormones into the worm can be used as a natural insecticide, inhibiting proper development and inducing lethal effects (Leonard CL. 1985.). Although our data is quite significant as seen in the p-value of .000238, some difficulties occurred throughout the experiment that could have manipulated results. These include inclement weather where worms could not be weighed and observed daily. This also led to some caterpillars with a lack of food for an extended amount of time. Some further experiments that would reinforce this data is experimenting with differing amounts of ecdysone administered to the treatment groups. The 4 drops of ecdysone could have caused extremely high concentrations and caused lethal results in the treatment group. However, using this knowledge, it is now evident that it is highly plausible to manipulate levels of hormones in organisms to act as natural pesticides.
