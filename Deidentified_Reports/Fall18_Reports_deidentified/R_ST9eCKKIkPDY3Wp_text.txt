Title: The Influence Of Calcium On Muscular Contractions

Abstract:
All species, whether vertebrate or invertebrate, experience muscle contractions due to processes involving myofibers and the opening of specific channels. We hypothesized that the activation of calcium channels would results in greater contractions. To test this theory, we performed contractions on two frog legs. Each leg would experience trials before activation of the channels, and after activation of the channels. Upon conducting the experiment, contractions following the activations were shown to have over double the intensity of the contractions pre-activation. This safely proved that the activation of calcium channels results in contractions at greater intensity. 

Introduction:
   Invertebrates and vertebrates both have skeletal muscles that contain myofibers. These myofibers group together, becoming supplied with nerves through motor neurons. Originating from the spinal cord, motor neurons facilitate muscle contractions (1).  Motor neurons then extend at points called neuromuscular junctions to supply specific myofibers. From here, impulses cause acetylcholine (Ach) to be released, which in turn opens sodium channels. Generated action potentials stimulate calcium, resulting in the activation of a contractile mechanism, which then causes contraction. We speculate that the activation of calcium channels will result in contractions with higher intensity. 

Materials and Methods:
A tray holding a detached frog leg was placed on the table. The leg was skinned to the muscles. Then, the Achilles tendon was clipped with scissors. Following this, the gastrocnemius muscle was tied with a string and suspended in the air. The remainder of the leg was secured down with pins, and the software was connected. Once the software was enabled, various frequencies were stimulated for five seconds each. The effects of the stimulations on the muscle were observed and recorded. 

Results:
Trials were conducted on two frog legs. Regular contractions served as the control date, while contractions following the activation of the calcium channels served as the treatment data. Five trials were conducted prior to activation and after activation on each leg. Throughout the conducted trials on the first leg, the control data commenced at an intensity around .1, before experiencing a gradual increase. However, the treatment trials commenced at a contraction around .28, before experiencing a decline (Figure 1). On the second leg, the control data once more commenced at .1, before experiencing a gradual decline, while the treatment date commenced around .25, before experiencing a sharper decline (Figure 2). 

Discussion:
As demonstrated through the trials, the activation of calcium channels resulted in contractions at greater intensity. The normal contractions never commenced at more than .1 intensity, in contrast to both post-activation contractions commencing at above .25 intensity. This proved our hypothesis, which asserted that the activation of calcium channels would result in contractions at higher intensity. This also translated to muscle fatigue, as the treatment trials experienced a steeper decline. Overall, the experiment reaffirmed past findings of calcium having a significant, if perhaps the primary role in muscle contractions.
