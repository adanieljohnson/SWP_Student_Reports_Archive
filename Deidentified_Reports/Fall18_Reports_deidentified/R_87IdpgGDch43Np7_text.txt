Title:  The effects of temperature on the photosynthetic activity of Elodea Canadensis 

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if water temperature influenced photosynthesis in
Elodea Canadensis. Prior research has shown that temperature changes can influence the light-
independent reactions and light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. This occurs through a
disruption of the electron transport chain and through a decrease in the functioning of enzymes. It
was hypothesized that changes in water temperature would influence the rate of photosynthesis
in the waterweed. For this experiment, chloroplasts from the Elodea were enriched, separated
into different test tubes and mixed into a solution containing DCIP. After absorbance was
measured, the samples were put either into a room temperature, hot, or cold condition and kept
there for ten minutes. This procedure was repeated after twenty and thirty minutes. Percent
change and statistical significance were calculated. It was found that there was no significant
difference between the mean percent changes after thirty minutes and hence it was concluded
that temperature did not influence photosynthesis in these chloroplasts. While this could be a
result of an experimental design error it is also possible that the waterweed is simply extremely
adaptable which would explain its success as an invasive species.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is vital for the survival of plants given that it allows light energy to be converted into chemical energy through a series of complex reactions. Photosynthesis occurs within the chloroplasts in plants which absorb solar radiation and ultimately produce ATP.  The production of ATP involves multiple oxidation-reduction reactions where electrons are transported via carriers through an electron transport chain located in the thylakoid member of the chloroplast. The movement of electrons allows for the creation of a proton gradient across the inner membrane [Johnson: 2016]. The movement of protons through the membrane protein ATP synthase changes binding affinity and allows ADP and Pi to combine to become ATP [Berg: 2002]. These reactions are known as light-dependent reactions as they require light energy to run. Following this process, light-independent reactions take place in which energy from ATP drives a chemical pathway which uses carbon to build glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). This three-carbon sugar is used by cells to build a multitude of different sugars such as glucose. Furthermore, additional ADP and NADP+ is produced by the Calvin cycle which are both reused in the light-dependent reactions outlined above. One can measure photosynthetic activity by measuring electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts. This occurs through the use of alternative electron acceptors such as 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol or DCIP. DCIP when reduced experiences a color change and hence can easily be measured using absorbance  [Johnson: 2016].
For this experiment, the waterweed Elodea Canadensis will be used to determine if water temperature influences the rate of photosynthesis. Elodea is a freshwater plant that grows in waterways in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is currently considered a noxious weed in Europe as it invasive and has a negative impact on the functioning of aquatic ecosystems [Nichols: 1996]. The water weed’s optimal temperature is between 10 ℃ and 25 ℃ [Carey: 2016]. It is important to note that temperature is one of several factors which influence photosynthetic rates as plants generally have an optimal temperature range in which photosynthesis occurs most efficiently. This is because the enzymes controlling the light independent reactions are temperature sensitive where they could become denatured if it is too hot [Berry: 1980]. In addition, if the temperature is too cold enzyme substrate activity decreases [Allen: 2001]. Research has also demonstrated that cold conditions reduce the rate of reactions and disrupt the electron transport chain by slowing the diffusion of protons [Laisk: 2005][Laisk: 1994]. Based on this, it can be predicted that a change in temperature may disrupt both light independent and light dependent reactions which are vital for photosynthesis. Because of this, this experiment will measure the rate of photosynthesis after thirty minutes by looking at the rate of electron transfer using DCIP in Elodea in three different temperature conditions. It is hypothesized that the rate of photosynthetic activity will be highest in the condition at 22 ℃, followed by the cold condition in 10 ℃, and be lowest in the hot condition at 34 ℃. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to study the effect of water temperature on photosynthesis, the Elodea plant was acquired and the leaves were crushed using a mortar and pestle. Once the leaves were ground into a thick paste, 10 mL of the cold grinding buffer, 400 mM sucrose in tricine buffer at a pH of 8, was added to the mixture. After some more grinding, another 10 mL of the grinding buffer was added. Once the Elodea leaves were completely crushed the mixture was strained through three layers of cheesecloth and into a cold beaker. The solution was then transferred from the beaker into a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube. After adding a balancing tube, the solution was spun at 200 x G at 4℃ for three minutes. The mixture was then transferred into another beaker taking care not to transfer the debris at the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The Elodea solution from the beaker was then placed into another centrifuge tube and spun again at 1,000 x G for ten minutes at the same temperature as before. Once this was completed the supernatant was pour out into a beaker but the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was not disturbed. An addition 20 mL of the cold grinding buffer was added to the pellet and it was suspended by being stirred gently. This solution contained the enriched chloroplasts that would be used for the remainder of the experiment. Following this, three water baths were set up at the temperatures of  22 ℃, 10 ℃, and 34 ℃. In addition, a spectrophotometer was turned on and set to 600 nm.
Ten test tubes were then gathered and labeled as blank, room temperature, cold, or hot. Only one of the tubes was labeled blanked and then each of the other conditions had three replicate test tubes used. Once all labeling was complete 8 mL of water was added to the blank along with 2 mL of a buffer solution containing 100 mM of phosphate at a pH of 6.5. For the remaining nine tubes, 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the buffer solution were added. To begin the assay, 100 μl of the enriched chloroplast solution was added to each test tube and then stirred. These mixtures had their absorbances immediately measured using the spectrophotometer. The blank was used first to blank the spectrophotometer. After recording the data, the three tubes labeled room temperature were placed in a water bath at 22 ℃, the three tubes labeled hot were placed in the 34 ℃ bath, and the three tubes labeled cold were put in the 10 ℃ bath. After allowing the mixtures to sit for ten minutes absorbances were remeasured and then the mixtures were replaced into their appropriate baths. This process was repeated after twenty minutes and then again after thirty minutes. Using the data collected, the percent change in absorbance was calculated. The data from the readings at 30 minutes was then used for a one way ANOVA statistical test to determine if the data was significant [Johnson:2018]. 


Results:
The results of the experiment showed that the average percent change in absorbance after thirty minutes in the room temperature condition was 2.11 ∓ 4.95 (table 1). In addition, the average percent change after 30 minutes in the hot condition was 3.20 ∓ 9.23 and the average percent change after 30 minutes in the cold condition was 4.62 ∓ 3.17 (table 1). The one way ANOVA determined that there was no significant difference between these mean values (fs=0.118, df=8, p=0.89). This can further be seen in figure 1 which shows the overlap between the standard deviation error bars. Figure 2 shows the general trends of percent change across time but once again these trends are not significant. 


Discussion:
The results of the experiment did not support what was hypothesized in that there was no significant difference between percent change in absorbance when comparing the three different temperature conditions. This means that temperature did not significantly influence the photosynthetic activity of the Elodea waterweed after thirty minutes. While it was predicted that the water weeds chloroplasts would have its electron transport chain disrupted in extreme conditions this did not seem to be the case and the general trends as can be seen in figure 2 actually depict that the efficiency of photosynthesis remained highest after 30 minutes in the cold condition. Despite these trends not being significant, it is important to note that with extended time more significant trends could be extracted from this experiment. However, this study does support the premise that the rate of photosynthesis in Elodea is not affected by temperature. Research has shown that the waterweed has more recently become established in the Arctic systems where it is an invasive species and is beginning to outcompete other aquatic vegetation. From this, it can be seen than Elodea can not only survive in frigid conditions but also prosper in high latitude ecosystems [Carey: 2016]. A study on three different invasive aquatic plant species including Elodea also concluded that this plant was the most competitive out of the three species in both high and low temperatures hinting to the premise that the waterweed can withstand hot conditions as well as cold ones [Riis: 2012]. Using these studies it can be concluded that Elodea can adapt to all sorts of temperature conditions and withstand photosynthetic disruptions where other plants cannot. This premise can help explain why the Elodea chloroplasts in this experiment successfully carried out photosynthesis in all three conditions despite prior research concluding that temperature changes in other plants disrupts the reactions necessary to do so. 
Due to the unique nature of the Elodea waterweed, it can be said that the outcome of this study may not be generalizable to other plants which normally would be influenced by changes in temperature. In addition, the standard deviation in this experiment was relatively high for all three conditions which demonstrates that the data was widely spread around the mean and hence likely not reliable. In order to increase reliability, a larger sample size should be acquired and each sample should be exposed to the temperature conditions for longer than 30 minutes. This could increase the significance of the results and therefore be used to make better and more accurate conclusions about the data. 
Understanding the conditions which Elodea can best undergo photosynthesis is vital due to the fact that it may offer hints on how to eradicate the plant from the ecosystems in which it is causing a negative effect on the overall integrity of ecosystem processes and food web structures. It is important to note that photosynthesis in this aquatic plant can lead to fluctuations of oxygen concentration and research has shown that there may be up to a 75% reduction in dissolved oxygen concentration in the water after the introduction of the waterweed. The reduction in oxygen can be detrimental to aquatic organisms including fish [Ondok: 1984]. Because of this, finding factors which disrupt photosynthesis can help reduce this effect and regenerate ecosystem function. While temperature, as seen in this experiment, does not seem to be a detriment to the photosynthetic activity of Elodea, other factors which could potentially disrupt the electron transport chain or the enzymes in the light-independent reactions should be furthered explored in order to produce better plans on how to manage the invasive species.
