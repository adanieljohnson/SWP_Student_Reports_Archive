Title: Growth inhibition effect of Ecdysterone blocker on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Hormones are important regulators in either plants or animals. With change in the level of different hormones, organisms regulate themselves accordingly. There is a hormone called Ecdysterone(20E) that regulates timing of molting during insect development [Johnson: 2018]. Here we look at the effect of Aza, a type 20E blocker, on Manduca sexta. We added 8 drops of liquid Aza solution to the food for the experimental group and added only 8 drops of water to the food of the control group. The expectation is that adding 20E blocker will cause the caterpillars to lose weight and die and that there will be significant difference in the average weight of the control and the experimental group. Our data shows a significant difference in the weight. Also, we found that the whole experimental group were dead before the final day of the experiment, which is exactly what we expected. All the data supports our hypothesis, which means that disturbing hormone supply in Manduca sexta will have negative effects on their development.

Introduction:
It is important to understand the function(s) of each hormone in organisms. Here we look at the effect of 20E blocker on Manduca sexta, a moth belonging to Sphingidae, that is still in the larva stage. In its life cycle, JH and 20E work corporately to help complete molting, a process during which a larva becomes a pupa and further developing into an adult. The caterpillar requires 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) orchestrating the molting process and JH determining the nature of the molt [Riddiford: 2003]. Lacking either of 20E or JH can be fatal to the caterpillar since the developmental stages will be heavily disturbed. Manduca sexta has a developing cycle of 39 to 48 days at 26 degree Celsius. Our study is between the 3rd or 4th larva stage and the pupa stage. It takes 15 to 18 days for a 1st instar larva to become a pupa. In theory, with a 20E blocker, the larva will not receive signals telling it to molt, and without the control of timing, the caterpillars will be stuck at larva stage. So, our hypothesis is that the caterpillars in the experimental group will lose weight and die.

Materials and Methods:
8 healthy Manduca sexta were divided into two groups. One is control and the other is experimental group. They were placed in two containers and each has four cells of equal space. Every cell was punched two holes to allow air circulation. Caterpillars were weighted and number coded before being put into the cells, e.g. control#1. The control group was treated food provided by the lab with 8 drops of water per 10 grams of food. The experimental group was treated with 8 drops of Aza solution per 10 grams of food. The caterpillars were then being put into the incubator. Their status including weight, color and condition were tracked and recorded on a daily basis. T test was adopted and an analysis on the trend of the weight collected from the two groups and conditions such as appearances of the caterpillars was used.

Results:
On the final day of experiment, in the control group, three Manduca sexta entered pupa stage and one died during the process of pupating, and in the experimental group, all Manduca sexta died before. The lowest average weight of control group is 5.6725g and the weight, recorded at the same time, of the experimental group is 3.7g(Fig.1). The one-tailed p-value is 0.000177. The lowest average of the control group is significantly different from the lowest average weight of the experimental group. The weight trend of the experimental group showed that all caterpillars in that group continuously lost weight till the end. Data of the control group shows that the caterpillars first gained and then lost weight. 

Discussion:
The two groups developed differently. Our hypothesis, that when adding 20E blocker in the food of the caterpillars, they will have decreases in weight and eventually die, is supported. In fact, the result is the same with our hypothesis. The data does show a continuous decrease in the average weight of caterpillars in the experimental group, and on the last day of the experiment, all those caterpillars were found dead. Also, the significant difference in the weight between control and experimental group demonstrates that Aza has impacts on the development of caterpillars. Other experiments have been done regarding the positive effect of 20E on molting. Use of a Gal4, a positive regulator of gene transcription, line driving the UAS-BR-Z3 isoform, specifying in cuticle formation, in the putative PTTH cells had no effect on larval molting, but driving it in the prothoracic glands prevented molting of about 53% of the first instar larvae and only 3% pupariated (N=60). Feeding 20E to these first instar larvae rescued the lethality, and with subsequent pulses of 20E in their diet, they pupariated and formed pupae (N=45) [Riddiford: 2003]. Our experiment proves that 20E is indispensable for specific insect development and blocking 20E is deadly to caterpillars. So this could be used as a way to control the number of insect that requires 20E during development.
