Title: The Impact of Different Herbicides on Inhibition of Photosynthesis in Chloroplast Samples of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
  Photosynthesis is a principle process for plants to self sustain and grow. However, we wanted to know how this process can be manipulated and what are the effects on photosynthesis. In this experiment we tested the effects of acid rain, homemade, and synthetic herbicides on photosynthesis in chloroplasts in Spinacia oleracea leaves. We used the Hill Reaction and a color changing electron acceptor DCIP to determine absorbances and percent change in absorbance, which represent reduction and photosynthesis. We tested these samples in blue light to promote photosynthetic activity and measured absorbance at increments of 10 minutes of exposure up to 30 minutes. We hypothesized that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis with lower percent changes at 30 minutes compared to the percent change of a sample with solely chloroplasts and no herbicide. We also hypothesized that acid rain will show the least percent change at 30 minutes inhibiting the photosynthesis the most. Our results concluded that the synthetic herbicide showed the least percent change at -19.22+/-3.39%, making it the strongest herbicide and inhibitor. Using an ANOVA test, the p-value for our data was 0.295 showing our results were not statistically significant possibly due to experimental errors. 

Introduction:
    Plants, certain bacterias and some protists capture, synthesize and store energy through a process known as photosynthesis. For specifically plants, this process occurs in chloroplasts. Solar radiation from sunlight is absorbed in chlorophyll, the molecules within chloroplasts, excite electrons in carrier molecules within the plant and cause them to leave. This electron deficiency then promotes the cleavage of water molecules in order to restore the electrons, forming a proton gradient that drives the formation of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, which is the energy currency of the cells [Hohmann-Marriott:2011]. Nearly all or all of this synthesized ATP goes towards synthesizing glucose. Enzyme complexes, with ATP and carbon dioxide from the air, create 6-carbon glucose molecules that are used and stored throughout the plant as energy. More specifically in the chloroplast, the electrons travel through a electron transport chain before being synthesized into ATP. The water molecules are cleaved into 4H+ and 2O2 where electrons are released [Hohmann-Marriott:2011]. This electron transfer can be visualized and measured by the Hill Reaction.

                  2H2O + 2A → 2AH2 + O2

In the Hill Reaction above, 2A is an electron acceptor and 2AH2 is the reduced form after the water is cleaved [Shevela:2011]. This leads to the question what applications does the Hill Reaction have when it comes to measuring electron transfer and rate of photosynthesis? 
	In this experiment, we will use the Hill Reaction to test, measure and determine the effects of different herbicides on the rate of photosynthesis of plants in their chloroplasts. We will specifically use Spinacia oleracea, an edible plant in the Amaranthaceae family. Spinach is ideal for its readily usage of photosynthesis and accessibility [Roberts:2016]. To test this, we will modify the Hill Reaction. We will use 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, or DCIP, as the replaced electron acceptor. That is because when DCIP, which is originally blue, is reduced and gains electrons it becomes DCIPH2 which is colorless [Shevela:2018]. This color change is an immediate indicator that photosynthesis is occurring through the synthesis of ATP in the electron transport chain as water being cleaved and electrons gained turns the DCIP from blue to clear depending on the intensity of the activity. 

				2H2O + 2DCIP → 2DCIPH2 + O2 

Because of the color change, or the dependent variable, we can measure absorbances using a spectrophotometer to accurately get a measurement on the rate of photosynthesis happening. By looking at the percent change of a samples at 0 minutes vs over increments of time, we can determine measurement. A lower percent change in comparison means less reduction has occurred as the absorbances have not changed much and the solution became less clear. 
	The herbicides we decided to test in this experiment are store bought, synthetic herbicides, a homemade herbicide, and acid rain. Herbicides specifically disrupt the development and photosynthesis of a plant to keep them from growing. We specifically chose these three to see their impacts on photosynthesis in the spinach leaves. Acid rain is a natural phenomenon that deteriorates and harms plants due to its namesake acidic nature. We chose this based off a study by Zhang that shows that acid rain inhibited the rice plants ATPase activity in the chloroplast, serving as a natural herbicide stunting photosynthesis [Zhang:2018]. We chose a homemade herbicide made of vinegar and clove oil. This was decided based off a study that used this formula to test its effects as an herbicide on crops such as onions, corn, and potatoes. The study found stunded growth as chloroplasts were inhibited in these plants [Evans:2008]. Thirdly, we will use Round-Up, a store bought herbicide containing glyphosate, which causes oxidative stress and from hydrogen peroxide buildup to inhibit photosynthesis, respiration and damage plant pigments according to another study [Gnomes:2016]. 
	For this experiment, we will use enriched chloroplasts from the spinach leaves, the herbicides, and DCIP to monitor absorbances and reduction to determine the best inhibitor of photosynthesis between a natural, synthetic, and homemade herbicide. We will place our samples under blue light. This is based off a study that found blue light, when compared to red, promoted chloroplast development in plants grown under the respective light, meaning an increase in photosynthetic activity [Poudel:2008]. This is necessary because to obtain the best results, we want to maximize photosynthesis to answer the question which herbicide, more specifically at which of their differing pH’s, will stunt the process most effectively? We hypothesize that when compared to a standard enriched chloroplast solution, the three herbicides will decrease photosynthetic activity after 30 minutes of total exposure to blue light. Also, we hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes, meaning the greatest inhibition of photosynthesis based off Zhang’s study. In Zhang’s study, we see acidic rain is at a very low pH of 4, which not only inhibits the chloroplasts but can deteriorate them through the cell wall [Zhang:2018]. 


Materials and Methods:
            Five medium-sized spinach leaves were used in this experiment.  Each leaf had the large central veins removed, then the leaves were rinsed and put into a mortar and pestle with 10mL of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  These leaves were then grinded to a thick paste, and then an additional 10mL of cold grinding buffer was added and then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker.  This remaining green liquid was then put into a 50mL tube and centrifuged for 13 minutes.
        	Before adding the spinach paste, reaction mixtures were prepared to go into 16 large test tubes.  Test tube 1 was the blank containing 8mL of water, 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts.  The no chloroplasts test tubes were tubes 2-4 and these were prepared with 6mL of water, 2mL of DCIP (130mM), and 2mL of reaction buffer.  The chloroplasts with no herbicide were test tubes 5-7, and these tubes were prepared with 6mL of water, 2mL of DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts.  Then the chloroplasts with acid rain (tubes 8-10) were prepared with 1mL of 25% nitric acid, 5mL of water, 2mL of DCIP, 2mL of reaction buffer, and 100mL of the enriched chloroplasts.  The chloroplasts with homemade herbicide (tubes 11-13) had the same mixture as the acid rain but were mixed with 1mL of the home-made solution (4mL white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2mL of clove oil) instead of the nitric acid..  The chloroplasts with synthetic herbicide (tubes 14-16) were mixed the same way as well but were mixed with 1mL of RoundUp instead of nitric acid or the home-made solution.  Each tube was mixed after adding the chloroplasts and was transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes.
        	After the spectrophotometer was blanked, the absorbance for all of the samples at 600 nm was recorded as the time zero data.  All of the samples were placed in a rack under a blue light, and the same absorbance measuring process was repeated at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for all samples.  After getting the data and calculating the percent changes after each absorbance, an ANOVA test will be used to test our data for significance. 


Results:
      For each different sample, our results showed three different readings of absorbances that were averaged. With these average absorbances, as seen in Table 1, we calculated percent change at 10, 20, and 30 minutes of blue light exposure with respect to the sample at 0 minutes. The percent changes for each sample were also graphed. Trends seen in data are mainly the increasing negative percent change as the time of exposure increased. The table shows the specific data and standard deviations while the graph visually shows the change and difference in percent change between the samples. Based off Figure 1, the solely chloroplast solution was the greatest in percent change, followed by homemade, acid rain, synthetic and no chloroplasts at 30 min. Our data had a p-value for the percent changes of 0.295 determined from an ANOVA test. This means our data does not fall within the 95% confidence interval and is not statistically significant. 
	After analyzing our data, our first claim that the three herbicides would inhibit photosynthesis when compared to a sample of enriched chloroplasts without herbicide was supported. The percent change for all three solutions with herbicides after 30 minutes were lower than the -44.46+/-15% change in absorbance of the chloroplast sample. However, also based off our data, our hypothesis of acid rain being the most potent inhibitor was not supported. The data showed after 30 minutes the percent change in absorbance of the acid rain was -29.63+/-4.05%. After 30 min the synthetic, or Round-Up, sample had a percent change of -19.22+/-3.39%. Because the net percent change was lower for the Round-Up sample, that means less reduction occurred along the transport chain meaning overall less photosynthetic activity. Acid rain did come next, followed by the weakest herbicide based off our data which was the homemade sample at -29.77+/-7%. Though, the homemade sample was very close to the percent change of acid rain, so similar inhibition of photosynthesis between the two did occur. In comparison the chloroplast sample, Round-Up had a difference of roughly 25%, while acid rain and homemade were about 14%. This allowed us to draw the conclusion, based off the properties of DCIP and the Hill Reaction previously discussed, that Round-Up had to most inhibition at it had the biggest difference from the change in absorbance to the no herbicide chloroplast solution. 
	There are multiple explanations for why our hypothesis on acid rain was not true. When the acid rain was added to the DCIP sample, there was an immediate change into a clearer solution rather than blue for the others. This technically means reduction was occurring immediately and that any small changes at different times would result in greater percent changes as the starting point was also in reduction. Specifically, the decrease at 30 minutes was around .005 in absorbance, though the percent change was large at 29.63+/-4.05% compared to that of time zero. Other errors could have been in how the assay was run. There is potential for errors in our solution mixtures as our none chloroplast sample shown in Table 1 produced a percent change of -1.07+/-2.13%. Though this is low, this means reduction did occur in a system where the percent should have been zero as there were no chloroplasts to carry out the electron transport chain and photosynthesis. Finally, errors in using the spectrophotometer or reading the absorbances could have also skewed our results thus cause our hypothesis to be wrong. Our p-value for our data was 0.295, which was found using an ANOVA test since we had more than three groups become statistically evaluated. This p-value is not in the 95% confidence interval, which could also be a product of experimental errors such as absorbance readings and assay conduction.  


Discussion:
     According to our results, store bought synthetic herbicide was the best inhibitor of the three. Our first hypothesis that all samples would see inhibition based off our results was true, however, we predicted the wrong herbicide to be most effective as acid rain was not the most effective. Our sample of 1:4 nitric acid for the acid rain could have immediately broken down the system and chloroplasts releasing excess electrons making the DCIP appear to have undergone more reduction, or more photosynthesis. Or, also, the acid rain might not have been strong enough to produce the inhibition we were expecting.An explanation for this comes from Zhang’s study where it was observed that the acid rain can destroy the system and cause a rapid release of electrons and reduction. However, on the contrary in the study some samples of acid rain did not produce many effects of inhibition [Zhang:2018]. Based off the results above, the data does lean toward store bought herbicide as the most effective. So, this study demonstrates the most effective herbicide when looking to stunt plant growth.
    To further our experiment, we could test different store bought herbicides to determine which brand is the optimal brand to purchase. We would also look towards manipulating the effects of different lights for sample exposure. We used blue based off a study we found, but it would be beneficial to test the samples under white and little to no light and see if there are any definitive trends or consistent results to be compared. If the light experiment were to be conducted, we would assume that, based off how blue light promoting photosynthesis according to the Poudel study, that when under light better data and higher electron transfer would occur. Also, another way to further this study specifically based off our results is to analyze it on a molecular level. As our data shows, there is inhibition happening found through the Hill Reaction. However, an important aspect of that could be to find what specifically is happening within the system to cause inhibition as it is generally broad to just say reduction is stunted, thus photosynthesis was being stunted. For the sake of our experiment however, reduction and DCIP were adequate as we were testing for trends and visual observations, or color change, and not attempting to interpret on a molecular level. 
	When considering the real world applications of this experiment, acid rain is an important factor as well as herbicides themselves. Acid rain is a natural phenomenon, so conducting experiments like this provide further insight on its effects on the environment and plant life. Herbicides such as the homemade and synthetic are also important as they are commonly used products for home, lawn, and agricultural care. Understanding their specific effects on photosynthesis in plants and plant growth itself provides a further understanding of the processes going when using a common product. Also, experiments such as this demonstrate effectiveness of different solutions allowing to understand the potency of certain solutions or chemicals in stunting plant growth, paving the way for many future experiments to test and new possible solution combinations to make the optimal herbicide. As connected to overall science, studying photosynthesis is important as it is the driving mechanism for plant life to grow and thrive. Understanding this process is important, but also manipulating it and finding our the effects outside sources have on the process can help make breakthroughs in both promoting plant growth, and in this case, stunting plant growth.
