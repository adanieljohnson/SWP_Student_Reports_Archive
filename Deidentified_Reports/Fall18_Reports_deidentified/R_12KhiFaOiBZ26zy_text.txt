Title: The Comparison of Brassica oleracea’s Ability to Transfer Electrons to Spinacia oleracea’s Ability to Transfer Electrons

Abstract:
Plants obtain energy through photosynthesis and the transfer of electrons that is stimulated by this light reaction. Different types of plants go through different rates of electron movement based on the context of their leaves or prevalence of chloroplasts within their cells. This experiment tested the ability for kale and spinach leaves to transfer electrons during light and dark reactions. It was hypothesized that kale leaves would have a faster rate of electron transfer because of the dense amount of chloroplasts. Additionally, it was hypothesized that the light exposed chloroplasts would exhibit faster rates of electron transfer. Kale and spinach leaves were crushed and liquified into samples with concentrated chloroplast levels. These samples were then checked for absorbance levels and compared over 10 minute intervals for a total of 30 minutes. Both experimental groups underwent t-tests. Average absorbance levels for spinach decreased gradually after each interval while the kale had no trends over the 30 minute interval. Results were not statistically significant. The experimental hypothesis was rejected because there was not a faster rate of electron transfer within the kale leaves. The spinach light dependent reaction supported the hypothesis, without statistical signifi

Introduction:
All organisms obtain and use their energy in a variety of ways. Using photosynthesis, plants capture and store their energy from the sun. This stored energy goes directly into the mitochondria and is also released into the cytoplasm of the cell using glycolysis. All of this stored energy in the mitochondria will go through respiration. Photosynthesis and respiration are similar because both involve multiple redox reactions. The energy that is being used by both continues to generate a proton gradient that will then be used to synthesize ATP. During the entire process of photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation through their chlorophylls. Additionally, chloroplasts will pass electrons through different electron acceptors to yield the production of oxygen. This entire reaction is known as the Hill reaction. Chloroplasts are incredibly essential for plants during the process of photosynthesis because of their ability to generate ATP and electron movement throughout the cell. Even though chloroplasts and this mode of energy processing is used in all plants, different plants have other factors that may either increase or decrease their electron movement within the cell. Additionally, there are multiple environmental factors that effect a plant’s ability to undergo photosynthesis, such as increased light. In kale plants, increased rates of photosynthesis were correlated with increased light, following a regular biological circadian rhythm during the day (Edwards et al., 2011). We hypothesize that kale will have a higher rate of electron movement compared to spinach because kale has a thicker leaf because kale leaves has more intracellular space and more mesophyll cells that contain chloroplasts. The greater the number of chloroplasts, in the mesophyll cells, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. The higher rate of electron movement should indicate an increase in the rate of reduction of DCIP, meaning that the rate of photosynthesis should be higher in the kale and spinach within the light conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
Pack 2 mortar & pestles,  2 medium-sized beakers, and 6 50 ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle are cooling, remove the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and 4 medium-sized kale leaves. Rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. Then blot off any excess moisture from the leaves. When the mortar and pestle are cold, wipe them dry, then add the spinach leaves. Add the kale leaves to a separate mortar and pestle. Then add 10 ml of cold grinding buffer o the spinach and 10 mL of grinding buffer to the kale. Grind the spinach and kale until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left.
Add an additional 10 ml of grinding buffer to the spinach, mix with the spinach slurry, and strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Add an additional 10 mL of grinding buffer to the kale and strain the entire volume through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a separate chilled beaker. Transfer the remaining green liquid from “Sample of A Spinach” to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A - Spinach”, and spin it at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. Transfer the remaining green liquid from “Sample of A Kale” to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A - Kale”, and spin it at 200 x for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. Pour the liquid out of the tube marked “A - Spinach” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Spinach”. Do not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A - Spinach”. Pour the liquid out of the tube marked “A - Kale” into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Kale”. Do not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A - Kale”. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B - Spinach”) at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. Centrifuge the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B - Kale”) at 1,000 x for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. After, pour the supernatant, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C - Spinach”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet. Place tube “B - Spinach” on ice. Pour the liquid, into a clean 50 ml tube marked “C - Kale”. Be careful not to disturb the pellet. Place tube “B - Kale” on ice. Then add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Add 20 ml of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspend it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Label 13 large test tubes and place them in a tube rack. Turn on the spectrophotometer and set it to 600 nm. Then prepare 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes; there is only one blank needed. When you are ready to begin the assay, add 100 uL of spinach chloroplasts to blank 1 and tubes #6-11. And add 100 uL of kale chloroplasts to blank 1 and tubes #12-17. Mix each tube immediately after adding the chloroplasts. Transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Immediately blank the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 1. Place tubes #1 and #3-8 and #12-14 in lamp light. Place tubes #9-11 and #15-17 in darkness. After 10 minutes, blank the spectrophotometer with spinach blank (tube #1) and record absorbance for spinach samples - tubes #6-11. Then blank the spectrophotometer with kale blank (#2) and record absorbances for kale samples -tubes #12-17. After 10 more minutes (20 min total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer again with each sample and record absorbances a second time. After 10 more minutes (30 min total) in light or dark, blank the spectrophotometer again with each sample and record absorbances a third time. A two-tailed t-test was used to employed to compare the absorbance rates of kale and spinach. 


Results:
Average light absorption levels for spinach leaves gradually decreased over the 30 minute interval (Table 1). Kale leaves increased from initial absorbance level to the 10 minute absorbance level, decreased to the 20 minute absorbance level, and then increased again to the 30 minute absorbance level (Table 1). The results from this experiment were not statistically significant (t-value=1.49, P=0.1855). 

Discussion:
The results from this experiment do not fully support the hypothesis made earlier and the null hypothesis was not rejected. The spinach trends from this experiment followed expectations because higher electron movement should, theoretically, occur when the leaves enter light. As light enters into a plant’s chloroplasts, there are light driven reactions in photosystem 1 and photosystem 2. When these light driven reactions, there is a driven reaction of protons that are pumped into the thylakoid lumen, which is then used to generate ATP within the cell. The dependency of light on photosystems 1 and 2 indicate that the plants would end up transferring more electrons into their systems in the presence of light (Rochaix, 2010). The spinach leaves supported this portion of the hypothesis because there were lower absorbances overall in light conditions compared to dark conditions (Figure 3). 
On the other hand, the kale leaves did not follow expected trends due to the unaccounted for negative initial absorbance (Figure 3). Hypothetically, the kale leaves should have had lower absorbance levels as time went on. 
	Moreover, potential errors include the spectrophotomer used when obtaining absorbance values. The spectrophotomer in this experiment continued to move between positive and negative values after a certain point of data collection. At this point in the experiment, the same spectrophotometer was used in order to keep uniformity, but it seemed that the machine was malfunctioning. Additionally, another potential error could have occurred when grinding the kale leaves. The kale leaves were incredibly thick and large. Thus, the leaves took a lot more time to grind. When straining the leaves, it appeared that the leaves were not siphoning through the cheesecloth at the same level that the spinach leaves were. There may not have been enough kale that was actually strained, which may have accounted for the unaccounted for results for the kale leaves. Further studies can examine both of these leaves with a much larger sample size. With a lot of the data obtained from this experiment, specifically in the kale leaves, there was one outlier that skewed the average data and significantly affected the percent changes.
