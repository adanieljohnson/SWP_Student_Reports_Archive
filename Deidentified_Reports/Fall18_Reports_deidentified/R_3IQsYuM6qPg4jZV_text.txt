Title: The Effects of Sunlight Variation on Root to Shoot Ratios in Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to determine the effect on the growth of field peas (Pisum sativum) amount of sunlight has. Sunlight is very important in the growth of plants because it is what allows photosynthesis to occur and that is how plants acquire energy. The field peas (Pisum sativum) were grown in an area of natural sunlight or increased shade, and it was hypothesized that those in more sunlight would have increased growth. The results did support the hypothesis because there was a significantly higher root to shoot values (growth) in the not shaded versus shaded plants. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, we are studying field peas (Pisum sativum) and the effect that varying amounts of sunlight has on the growth of the plant. Field peas are a small annual legume that is rather common. Sunlight is known to have an important role in the role of photosynthesis in plants. Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves and stems of plants, also known as the shoots, and is important for the acquisition of energy that is required for processes within the plant [Johnson: 2018]. Each plant has a delicate balance between amount of leaves and amount of stem. Plants use the energy gathered through photosynthesis for many things including growth [Johnson: 2018]. Growth will be determined by measuring the root to shoot ratio. The root to shoot ratio will be determined for both length and weight. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio will be higher if the field peas are planted in an area of more sunlight as opposed to more shade. 


Materials and Methods:
First, we located field pea seeds and then planted 16 seeds in a pot, watered them 100mL, and fertilized them. Step one was repeated five more times in order to have a total of 6 pots, three of which were control and three of which were treatment, which were labeled accordingly. The three control plants were placed in normal sunlight in the greenhouse. The three treatment plants were placed in the greenhouse, but under a black mesh covering to limit the light. For two weeks, the plants were watered 100mL per pot. After that time 12 plants were selected from each group, making sure to take four from each pot, which were then picked and separated from the soil using water, while making sure to keep the plants separated into their respective groups. All the plants were then cut to separate the root and the shoot. The root and shoot weight and heights were then measured in grams and centimeter, and then recorded in a table in excel. The average root to shoot ratios were determined and a two-sample t-test was used to determine the significance of the results and result with a p-value of 0.5 or less were considered significant. 

Results:
The root to shoot ratio for weight was significantly different in those plants in an area that was shaded (t-stat: 2.75, df=22, p=0.012). The root to shoot ratio for length was significantly different in those plants in an area that was shaded (t-stat: 3.83, df=22, p=0.00092). The figures both showed a tendency that the root to shoot ratios were higher in the not-shaded plants than the shaded plants. 


Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the hypothesis of a different root to shoot ratio of plants in an area of more sunlight, was supported. This most likely occurred because the lower the root to shoot ratio the more shoot per root, which is expected because sunlight has direct effects on the growth of plants because of the energy plants gain from the sun. The statistical results for weight and length were both significant. An area of possible error in the experiment could have been the fact that during the first week the plants were not watered for three days because of the hurricane. 
A previous study about the effect of light on wild rice growth showed that there was an increase in biomass with an increase in sunlight, specifically the previous study showed an increase by 34% [Sims et al: 2012]. Those findings support the findings of this study that there is a relationship between sunlight and growth [Sims et al: 2012]. Further research could be conducted on the same topic, but with varying species and amount of sunlight to improve the conclusions drawn from this study about growth.
