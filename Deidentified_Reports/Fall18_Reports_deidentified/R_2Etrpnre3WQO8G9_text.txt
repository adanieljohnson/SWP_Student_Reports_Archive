Title: The decrease in agnostic intraspecific behaviors amongst male Betta splendins in the presence and absence of food 

Abstract:
Agonistic intraspecific behaviors, aggressive behaviors within one’s own species, are often used by aquatic populations to secure survival and reproductive success. This experiment used Betta splendins to observe aggressive behaviors because they mimic wild populations while on time constraints. The hypothesis of the experiment was that male Betta splendins will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food. This experiment paired six Betta splendins to form three groups. Each group was observed in an environment with no food (the controll), a small amount of food and a large amount of food. Each trial lasted for five minutes, followed by a ten-minute break. Linear regression was used to analyze the data. The results of the experiment were statistically insignificent and did not support the hypothesis (r2=0.333, n=9, d.f.=7, p_value=0.104). However, it was observed that the fish acted more aggressively with no food than with a high amount of food. Animal aggression can be studied to understand the negative implications of pollution on waterways and the rate of survival of marine life in those environments.

Introduction:
Agonistic intraspecific behaviors are displays or acts of aggression towards animals of the same species and are an essential component of population regulation amongst wild animal populations [Johnson: 2018]. In other words, the frequency of aggressive intraspecific behaviors is dependent on the population density of the species. For instance, when environmental resources are abundant, including space, food and reproduction capabilities, animals may allocate energy towards interspecific threats to survival [Robb: 1998]. However, constricted environmental resources may provoke an animal to display aggressive intraspecific behaviors to secure an area for reproduction and nutrition [Polis: 1981]. Despite acts of aggressive intraspecific behaviors being somewhat concerning for species with low population densities because they must compete for resources amongst outside populations and themselves, these behaviors can be beneficial to the overall survival of the species. When an animal is killed or removed from the group due to an intraspecific agnostic encounter, the fitness of the remaining population increases [Polis: 1981]. Therefore, increasing the population's rate of survival for future generations. These acts of aggression, however, can be mediated by characteristics, like sex, age, and size, of the animal's opponent [Polis: 1981].       


Frequently, wild fish populations use these agnostic behaviors as a mechanism of survival and reproductive success. Betta splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, are useful in observational laboratory studies because they mimic the behaviors of wild populations and can display agnostic behaviors within time constraints. When stimulated by a shift in the environment, Siamese fighting fish display a variety of aggressive behaviors. Understanding the aggressive behavioral patterns of Betta splendins can be useful in predicting the way that marine life must adapt to changing environments due to human exploitation. When pollutants enter waterways, the uncontaminated spatial environmental for that species becomes condensed. Thus, only leaving a restricted area for food. When the resources of a species become limited, intraspecific aggressive behaviors may increase. In turn, leaving only the fittest of the population survive. It is important to recognize this behavior to discover ways to prevent species from contributing to their own extinction through intraspecific aggressive behaviors in addition to population depletion from pollution. We hypothesize that male Betta splendins will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food.

Materials and Method:
The experiment quantified the level of aggression of male Betta splendins by counting the number of times they display a red mane in the presence or absence of food. For example, if a male Siamese fighting fish encounters another male, he may choose to display broadside movements, such as pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, or tail flashing to warn off the opponent from the claimed territory [Simpson: 1968]. In the instance that the opponent challenges these behaviors, the male Siamese fighting fish may choose to protrude its branchiostegal membranes in a phenomenon known as the red “mane” [Simpson: 1968]. The red mane is known to be the highest level of aggression amongst Betta splendins before physical contact is made [Simpson: 1968]. 
The experiment used six Betta splendins; pairing them with one another to form three groups. Each group participated in three trials. The first trial was the controll of the experiment by which the fish were given no food. The second trial utilized the experimental condition of a small amount of food by which the fish were given about 10 flakes to share between them. In the third trial, each group was given a large amount of food of about 20 flakes to share between each other. Each trial period was five minutes long with a ten-minute break provided after each trial. The researches were prepared to separate the paring from one another during the trial if they made physical contact. The data from this experiment was analyzed through linear regression with a one-tailed p_value.

Results:
The data collected from the experiment showed that the average number of red manes displayed during the controll trail of no food was 8.00, while the average number of red manes displayed during both experimental conditions of a small amount of food and a large amount of food was 2.67. The results of this experiment were not statistically significent (r2=0.333, n=9, d.f.=7, p_value=0.104) (Fig. 1).

Discussion:
The hypothesis of this experiment suggested that male Betta splendins will act more aggressively in environments with smaller amounts of food compared to those with larger amounts of food. The results of this experiment, however, did not support the hypothesis. The data had a very low correlation coefficient that did not significently support the negative slope of the data.

Although the data did not support the hypothesis of the experiment, it does offer interesting insight into animal behavior and the means of survival. Previously, it was thought that the presence of a small amount of food would elicit instinctive aggressive behaviors within the Siamese fighting fish because the resource is scarce and would trigger the need for the fish to claim the territory. However, amongst all three pairings of fish, the controll variable of no food had the highest display of aggression, averaging 8.00 red manes per encounter versus 2.67 red manes displayed in the two experimental conditions. Though being careful to not claim causation, the absence of food within the tank may have contributed to hyper-aggression behaviors of the pairing to have claim of the territory in the event that a resource, food or a female Siamese fighting fish, was added to the environment [Simpson: 1968]. A similar experiment was conducted in 1998 and predicted that an increase in structural complexity of a habitat will decrease the animal’s aggression. The researchers used groups of Danio rerio, commonly known as zebra fish, and placed them in an environment with or without vegetation [Basquill: 1998]. It is important to note that all fish were given food, despite its environmental condition. The variable of observation was the aggression displayed by the male fish within each environment. The results did support the hypothesis, the levels of aggression of the fish were lower in the habitat with vegetation than without [Basquill: 1998]. Therefore, indicating that the energy needed to put forth intraspecific agnostic behaviors is conserved in an environment that appears to have a plethora of resources. 

One limitation to the study was the feeding order of the fish. The experimental trials were not randomized, and a fish was observed feeding on one flake of food in two trials out of the nine in the experiment. For this reason, the fish may have gotten full from eating before the last experimental trial. In turn, possibly contributing to the lack of red manes displayed in the second and third trials. However, the aggressive behaviors did not appear to increase in the presence of more food. Another limitation to the experiment may have been habituation, despite 10-minute breaks given to each fish between the trial periods. As seen in many cases, once the fish is exposed to another for an extended period, it may never return to the same level of aggression it had towards it initially [Clayton: 1967]. All fish in this experiment decreased the number of red manes displayed from the controll of no food to the experimental condition of a lot of food. Replicates of this study may use the experimental condition of a lot of food as the controll for the experiment to better observe the agnostic behavior of the Betta splendins when the resource is gradually restricted.

In summation, it is important to understand the agnostic behaviors of aquatic animals to better predict their chances of survival in the presence of pollution. Though efforts are being put forth to regulate environmental damage caused by large industries, it is very difficult to regulate decisions of environmental consciousness of individuals. Many do not participate in recycling efforts or clean energy alternatives because of the cost, the inaccessibility or the inconvenience. Nonetheless, waste continues to pollute waterways across the globe. As this pollution continues, the areas by which aquatic life can successfully reside decreases. In turn, increasing displays of intraspecific agnostic behaviors amongst animals. It is important for researchers to understand the effects of intraspecific agnostic behaviors on the population density in relation to the need for individual survival. In the short term, the species may grow to contain only the fittest of the population. However, if the offspring of those in the population cannot survive in the polluted conditions, the animals may have contributed to their own extinction.
