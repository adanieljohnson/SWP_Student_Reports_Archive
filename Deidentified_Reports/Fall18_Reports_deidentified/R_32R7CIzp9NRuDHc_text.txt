Title: The Negative Effects of the Hormone Blocker Azaguard on the Regular Life Cycle of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta is a type of caterpillar that produces two main hormones responsible for its molting period: juvenile hormones and ecdysone hormones.  The azadirachtin, Azaguard, is a hormone blocker that blocks the natural production of ecdysone.  We have used Azaguard to test the effect of this particular hormone blocker on the regular life cycle of the Manduca sexta.  We used 10 drops of Azaguard in the caterpillars 10 grams of food for each day.  The caterpillars were studied for two weeks and observed almost daily.  We concluded that Azaguard increases the appetite of the caterpillar for a few days.  Eventually, the caterpillars affected by Azaguard will stop eating.  Then, they will die likely due to the lack of the production of ecdysone and therefore a lack of a commitment pulse.  The caterpillars affected by 10 drops of Azaguard will die as juveniles.  However, there is not enough evidence to prove that Azaguard affects the weight and length of Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
There are many hormones present in various types of creatures.  In the Manduca sexta, one such hormone is the ecdysone hormone.  This hormone is important to the molting of the insect.  It can affect the insect in the respect of the timing of the molt, in the amount of ecdysone present, and in which stage the amount of ecdysone is present [Walter E. Bollenbacher, Stan L. Smith, Walter Goodman, and Lawrence I. Gilbert, 1981].  Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are mechanisms that affect the normal growth of insects. When exposed, development in the normal life cycle of insects can be affected and it is possible for metamorphosis to not occur. Azaguard is a chemical that inhibits the natural production of the ecdysone hormone.  We will be testing this hormone blocker on the Manduca sexta insect.  When Manduca sexta is exposed to Azaguard, it is possible for the life cycle to be altered.  We hypothesize that Azaguard will affect the natural life process of the Manduca sexta.

Materials and Method:
We began the experiment by gathering 2 identical containers that has 4 compartments each.  We labeled the container as either controll or experimental group and labeled each compartment 1, 2, 3, and 4.  We then punctured two holes in each compartment. We then prepared food for the caterpillars. For the controll group, we measured 10g of food to place in each compartment.  Once measured, we put 10 drops of water into the food and mixed to together. We then placed the food and water mixture into compartment 1, 2, 3, and 4. For the experimental group, we measured 10g of food and place 10 drops of Azaguard into the food. We mixed the food up again and placed each 10g into the compartments. Next, we obtained 8 randoMly selected caterpillars.  We weighed, in grams, and measured, in cm, the starting units of the caterpillars.  These measurements were noted, and the caterpillars were placed in their respective containers (Control 1, Control 2, Experimental 1, Experimental 2, etc.).  The lids were closed, and they were placed in an incubator. Daily, we would come and remeasure and reweigh the caterpillars and also change their food if either if was low or dry.  These processes of coming in daily was repeated for two weeks.  Once all the data was collected, we completed a two paired t_test.

Results:
We collected data for approximately two weeks for this experiment.  We calculated the average weight for the controll group to be 5.67575 g and the experimental group to be 5.93475 g.  We also calculated the average length of the controll group to be 5.79625 cm and the experimental group to be 6.0725 cm.  Generally, the experimental group was larger than the controll group.  Additionally, the experimental group began eating more food than the controll but quit eating after about day 4 or 5.  After about a week, the controll group began metamorphosing, while the experimental did not.  Around day 10, sometime during weather complications, all of our experimental group caterpillars died.  We then completed two two-paired t_tests, one for weight and one for length. We found the two tailed p_value for weight to be 0.640782 and the p_value for length to be 0.456403.  Below is a graph documenting the days and the weight of the different specimens. We were not able to observe the specimens on days 8, 9, and 10 due to weather complications.  

Discussion:
Based on that data collected, our group concluded that the experimental group grew significently larger than the controll group.  However, it may be possible that the growth is caused by chance.  There is a 0.64 and 0.456 chance that the caterpillar’s weight and length occurred by chance, respectively.  It may be possible for the hormone blocker Azaguard to affect the appetites of the caterpillars.  Therefore, they may likely eat more food, at least for the first few days.  After day 6, the controll group was, on average, heavier than the experimental group.  This is also likely due to an effect that the hormone blocker had on the caterpillar.  The hormone blocker group, azadirachtin, has an effect on the eating patterns of insects, similarly to another experiment [K.P. Siber, and H. Rembold, 1983].  The hormone blocker, Azaguard, is a type of azadirachtin.  However, it is possible that the lack of eating is not responsible for the experimental caterpillars’ deaths.  It is possible that their deaths is caused by the elimination of the ecdysone hormone.  Siber, et al. had a similar experiment and found that blockage of this hormone can result in death [Siber, et al.].  Without the ecdysone hormone, because the natural production was blocked by Azaguard, the caterpillar cannot confirm the commitment pulse and will not transform into an adult.  The creature will then die a juvenile.  Even though the specimen may have a bigger size due to the impact of Azaguard, the creature still died and never molted. Therefore, our hypothesis is correct.  Azaguard may not have affected the weight and length of the specimens, but it did alter their life cycle.  The caterpillars died juveniles and did not even show signs of pupating.  Our initial hypothesis, therefore, is valid.
This information is relevant because it can be used by the agricultural business.  Manduca sexta insects can consume a variety of plants, including tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants.  If there is a way to hinder their consumption of widely used plants, then agrarians will use that method.  The use of Azaguard may cause the consumption of the Manduca sexta to increase for a few days, but they will eventually stop eating and die before they become adults.  This means they cannot reproduce and there will likely be less caterpillars present during the next season.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Legend: Above is a graph documenting the days and the weight of the different specimens. We were not able to observe the specimens on days 8, 9, and 10 due to weather complications.  There is a trend of experimental specimens being heaver up until day 5.  At day 6, the experimental caterpillars are observed to no longer be eating.  Therefore, the controll group passes the experimental group in weight.
