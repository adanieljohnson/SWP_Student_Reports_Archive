Title: Aggressive Behavior of Betta splenden in Response to Change in Environmental Conditions

Abstract:
Environmental conditions have an influence on the behavior of many species. Ecologists study how the environment affects behavioral patterns in fish to understand evolutionary adaptations that increase fitness. This experiment focused on aggressive behavior of male Betta splenden, a species known for its dramatic displays of aggression in both interspecific and intraspecific interaction. The experiment tested how the color of the water in the environment of B. splenden influences aggression during intraspecific male-on-male interaction. Behavioral displays of four B. splenden in natural, red, and blue water were observed and recorded using a point system. It was hypothesized that B. splenden would exhibit more aggressive behavior in red water and less aggressive behavior in blue water. The results were analyzed using an ANOVA statistical test. 

Introduction:
Ethologists work to understand behavior from physiological, genetic, and evolutionary standpoints through detailed patient observation of species and individuals. By studying behavioral patterns, ethologists can begin to understand how adaptations for both intraspecific and interspecific behaviors evolved in species. Aggression is a behavior commonly studied by scientists because an organismâ€™s response to the presence of individuals within and outside of their own species plays a significent role in reproductive success and survival [Johnson : 2018]. Betta splenden are often used as subjects of ethological research because they exhibit very specific and easily observable agnostic behaviors in response to interspecific interaction. These behaviors are classified into broadside and facing displays, and range in aggression based on perceived severity of the threat [Johnson : 2018]. Studies have been conducted to understand how environmental conditions such as water color and influence behavior in fish. One study found that tank color had an effect on stress levels, feeding rates, and growth of various species of fish [McLean et al : 2008]. This experiment tested the effect of water color on aggressive behavior in male B. splenden. It was hypothesized that changing the water color of the environment of two red B. splendins to red would increase aggressive behavior during male on male intraspecific interaction, and that changing the water color to blue would decrease aggressive behavior.

Materials and Method:
In order to quantify aggressive behavior in the B. splenden, a ranking/point system was devised based on relative aggressiveness of specific behaviors and the duration of the behavioral display. The three broadside and three facing displays were each ranked on a scale of 1-3, 1 being the least aggressive and 3 being the most aggressive. The point value for that behavior was multiplied by 1.1 if the duration of the displays exceeded one minute, 1.2 if it exceeded 2 minutes, and so on. The sum of the point values for each individual was used to quantify aggression in each environment. The controll trial was conducted by placing two male B. splenden in a tank separated by a transparent barrier and recording displays of aggressive behavior of each fish for 5 minutes. The two fish were then given a resting period of 3 minutes separated by a solid barrier. To conduct the first controll trial, 7 drops of red food coloring were placed in each fish tank chamber. The solid barrier was removed and aggressive behavior of the fish separated by the transparent barrier was recorded for 5 minutes. The fish rested for another 3 minutes. The fish were then placed in another tank where 4 drops of blue food coloring was put in each chamber. The solid barrier was removed and aggressive behavior was recorded for another 5 minutes. All three trials were repeated for another pair of B. splenden. The values for aggressiveness were calculated for each fish numbered 1-4 in each environment, and an ANOVA statistical analysis test was used to analyze the data.


Results:
Data from this experiment displayed in Figure 1 shows that B. splenden in red and blue water exhibited less aggressive behavior than in natural colored water. The values for average aggression factor for fish in red and blue water were similar, around 2.5, and the average value for the controll group was 3.575. Results of ANOVA statistical analysis show that there was no statistical difference among any of the three trials (f(11)=0.158, p=0.856). Error bars in Figure 1 show there was significent standard deviation in the results for each trial.


Discussion:
The results of this experiment refute the hypothesis that aggressive behavior of B. splenden would increase if placed in an environment of red water, and decrease in an environment of blue water. Though the data shows a lower aggression factor in blue water than in the controll environment, there is not a significent difference between the values, thus the hypothesis must be rejected. It can be concluded that the color of the water in the environment does not have a significent effect on aggressive behavior in B. splenden. It was observed that fish #2 exhibited generally more aggressive behavior than the other fish in all three environments. Fish #1, #3, and #4 all exhibited variation in aggressive behavior, leading to inconclusive results. These observations lead to the possible conclusion that the innate aggressive tendencies of B. splenden has a greater effect on aggressive behavior in intraspecific interaction than the physical characteristics of the environment. A possible confounding variable in the experiment is that the addition of food coloring made the water darker and inhibited the ability of the fish to identify the presence of another male, lowering the potential for aggressive behavior. Though the results of this experiment were inconclusive, another study found that Oreochromis niloticus, or Nile tilapia, living in a blue tinted environment has significently higher reproductive rates than those living in a white tinted environment [Volpato: 2004]. These results show that environmental conditions may have an impact on long term behavior patterns in fish. Similar experiments may be used by ethologists to come to conclusions on the effects of environmental factors on fish behavior. These findings can be applied to further understand the impact of human interruption to species of marine environments.
