Title: Effect of Sunlight Allocation on Plant Growth in (Pisum sativun)

Abstract:
The effect of sunlight allocation on (Pisum sativun), or field peas, was tested in order to see if the presence of sunlight will affect growth and development. To measure growth and development of the field peas, the length and weight of the shoots and roots of the plants were measured. If the field peas grow in shaded sunlight, then the field peas’ root to shoot ratio will be lower than the root to shoot ratio for plants grown in sunlight. The independent variable is the varying amount of sunlight: not shaded is the controll and shaded is the treatment. The dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio in the field peas. In order to verify the hypothesis, an experiment using twenty-four plant, twelve under a shaded treatment and the other twelve under a no shade controll. The results showed that controll group had higher root to shoot ratios for both length and weight in comparison to the root to shoot ratios for the treatment group. In conjunction the two-sample t_test for length had a p_value of 0.012 and for weight has a p_value of 0.00092, showing that the results are statistically significent. Thus, the experiment illustrates that field peas in shaded environments do have lower root to shoot ratios in comparison to field peas in full sunlight.

Introduction:
(Pisum sativun), or more commonly known as field peas, are the main focus of this experiment. Field peas are cheap, grow quickly, and have a short reproductive life span. Field peas are also annuals so they can grow throughout the year making them a good plant for study. The plants are used to determine the effect of sunlight allocation on root to shoot ratios on length and weight. Roots are the part of the plant that absorb nutrients and water and anchor the plant into the ground [Johnson: 2018]. Shoots, on the other hand, include the stems and the leaves of the plant, and aid in light capture and competition through lifting the plant up [Johnson: 2018]. Photosynthetic reactions take place in the chloroplasts of the leaves and provide the necessary energy and sugar necessary for growth and development to occur. If solar energy allocation is compromised, then the field peas will show the lack of sunlight phenotypically through shorter sizes and lighter masses. This process of changing the allocation of resources based on environmental conditions is known as phenotypic plasticity [Johnson:2018]. Another study conducted found that plants changed their phenotypic plasticity in the presence of increased light by either increasing or decreasing their root to shoot ratios [Sims, et al: 2012]. The purpose of this experiment is to see how field peas change their phenotypic plasticity when the allocation of sunlight changes. More specifically, how does varying amounts of sunlight, shaded versus not shaded, affect the root to shoot ratio in field peas? The independent variable is varying amount of sunlight, not shaded versus shaded. The dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio for the lengths and weights of the shoots and roots. With less exposure to sunlight, it is expected that (Pisum sativun) will have lower root to shoot ratios due to less growth because of less photosynthetic activity.

Materials and Method:
	First, obtain twenty-four (Pisum sativun) seeds, twelve pods to grow the plants in, vermiculite, and Miracle Grow. Two groups are planted. In the first group, six pods are used to plant twelve seeds. The seeds are planted in the pods in vermiculite and Miracle Grow. This first group is the controll group and is placed in full sunlight in the greenhouse. In the second group, six pods are used to plant twelve seeds, as well. The seeds are also planted in vermiculite and Miracle Grow. The second group, however, is placed in a shaded location in the greenhouse and is the treatment group. The second group is shaded using a black transparent cover. Before the plants were placed in their respective conditions, they were watered with 100 Ml of water. The plants were then watered with 100 Ml of water in each pod everyday for two weeks. Data was then collected. First, the plants were removed from the vermiculite by placing them in a tub of water and then separating the vermiculite from the roots. Then, twelve plants from each group were cut to separate the root and shoot. Each plant was cut at the same place, right above the seed. Each root and shoot was measured for length and weight in each group. The hypothesis is tested by seeing if the ratios of the roots and shoots of the lengths and weights collected is lower in the shaded group. After the experiment was completed, a statistical analysis using a two sample t_test for length and weight was conducted. The first two sample t_test is conducted using the root to shoot ratios for weight in the controll and treatment groups (t_stat= 2.75, d.f.=22, P=0.012). The second two sample t_test is conducted using the root to shoot ratios for length in the controll and treatment groups (t_stat= 3.83, d.f.=22. P=0.00092). 


Results:
In the data, it can be seen that the treatment group had significently lower root to shoot ratios than the controll group. The results from Figure 1 show that the root to shoot ratio for weight in field peas is affected by the decrease in sunlight exposure. The results from Figure 2 show that the root to shoot ratio for length in field peas is affected by the decrease in sunlight exposure. For weight, the controll group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.96 ± 0.12 and the treatment group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.84 ± 0.09. For length, the controll group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.61 ± 0.11 and the treatment group had an average root to shoot ratio of 0.45 ± 0.10. General trends in the data showed that the controll group had higher root to shoot ratios for both length and weight. 

Discussion:
The results support the hypothesis because the removal of sunlight in (Pisum sativun) led to a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length. The reason for this occurring biologically is that the removal of sunlight caused for there to be less photosynthesis occurring since the amount of light capture in the shoots decreased. Therefore, the plants in the treatment group would allocate less of their resources to growing their shoots and roots leading to a lower root to shoot ratio in weight and length. The controll group had full sunlight and was able to carry out normal light capture resulting in its higher root to shoot ratios. In conjunction with the experimental results, the statistical results support the conclusion that sunlight allocation does affect the root to shoot ratios in field peas. The root to shoot ratio for weight was significently lower in field pea plants that were in an area that was shaded (t_stat= 2.75, d.f.=22, P=0.012). The root to shoot ratio for length was significently lower in field pea plants that were in an area that was shaded (t_stat= 3.83, d.f.=22. P=0.00092). Thus, there is a significent difference between the controll group being not shaded and the treatment group being shaded. In this experiment, however, there is one error in the method where the plants were not watered for a few days due to a hurricane. Access to the building was denied during this time so the plants were not watered and this may have resulted in less growth in both plants; therefore, resulting in slightly skewed data. Despite the error, the results in the experiment and the statistical results confirm that the hypothesis is supported. Other published studies used field peas in order to determine how nutrient deficiencies affected root to shoot ratios. For example, one such study found that lowering the amount of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus resulted in lower root to shoot ratios due to effects on protein synthesis and growth [Andrews, et al.: 1999]. The experiment conducted using sunlight allocation is important because it can help farmers develop effective cropping and planting method in order to ensure that plants that require plenty sunlight acquire that amount of sunlight. Thus, farmers can harvest crops that grow more. In future experiments, the method need to be altered in order to account for the error in watering. Future replications need to ensure that the plants are watered every day of the experiment. (Pisum sativun) root to shoot ratios for length and weight is affected by the allocation of sunlight as less sunlight results in fewer photosynthetic reactions leading to less growth and development.
