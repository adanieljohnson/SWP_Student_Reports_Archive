Title: The Effects of Glucose and Sucrose on the Chemotaxis of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
	Physarum polycephalum, or more commonly known as slime mold, is an organism that goes through several forms of taxis, including phototaxis and chemotaxis. The organisms used actin microfilaments to “reach out” and engulf a food source that is near them. The organism continually moves around looking for food sources. Glucose and sucrose are both carbohydrates that can be considered food sources for the Physarum polycephalum, however the organism may display a desire for one over the other. Physarum polycephalum exhibit positive chemotaxis toward glucose and negative chemotaxis away from sucrose in every case, including experiments previously done. 


Introduction:
	Slime mode, or Physarum polycephalum, are a single plasma membrane organism that have multiple nuclei. The Physarum move as a mass with the use of actin filaments to aid in the movement. Physarum are extremely intelligent and have been looked at to be potentially used in supercomputers and other biological innovations due to their reactions and behaviors. They exhibit behaviors such as cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis and chemotaxis. Cytoplasmic streaming is the act of the cytoplasm inside of the thin strands that “reach out” having the ability to flow bidirectionally. The slime will “reach out” for food, or other molecules that it senses are near. The phototaxis and chemotaxis are when the masses either move toward or away from light and chemicals, respectively. For phototaxis and chemotaxis, there are two different types, the first being positive, meaning that the organism moves toward it and the latter being away from it. There are a variety of chemicals that the slime has positive or negative chemotaxis to. The slime is known to like oats and other carbohydrates, however, there have been studies that have shown that they may not necessarily like the disaccharides that are in the carbs alone. In various previous experiments, it has been proven that the slime is attracted to the glucose, galactose, and other sugars, but are repelled by sucrose. In a 1978 study, it was shown that the slime experienced exponential growth when glucose was an option, but did not grow at all when sucrose was an option [Knowles and Carlile: 1978]. Other studies such as one done in 1970, found that sucrose was actually a repellant for the Physarum and that if given the choice, it will go as far away from the sucrose as possible [Carlile: 1970]. This is odd because the slime in known to grow on dead plants, and said dead plant matter contains sucrose. It is expected that the slime mold with have positive chemotaxis with the glucose and negative chemotaxis with the sucrose, or will not move at all; and in a competitive situation, will select glucose over sucrose. It is also expected that there will be larger net distance travelled in competitive plates than the non-competitive plates. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted by creating 12 total plates; 9 experimental, 2 stock (glucose and sucrose) and 1 blank control plate. Melt 2% water agar in the microwave. Mix 20ml of agar with 1 ml of 20X glucose or grams of sugar (for the final mixture of 25 mM in 20 mL solution, mix: 0.17115 g sucrose, 0.09008 g glucose, let cool to 50 ). Pour the mix in a 100 mm petri plate to cool and harden. Cut slabs and place them on plates the same way as it was done in the chemotaxis assays, or use the chemical plate as needed. Label 1 Control plate, 3 glucose plates, 3 sucrose plates, and 3 glucose/sucrose plates. Tape lid of each plate, wrap all plates completely in foil, and place into dark bag in a dark drawer. Check and record at 48 hours. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance of the experiment.


Results:
The results yielded both expected and unexpected results. It was expected that the Physarum polycephalum would move toward the glucose and away from the sucrose, however, the distances that they moved were significantly less than expected and not all of the samples experienced chemotaxis. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported by the experiment, in that, the Physarum polycephalum experienced more positive chemotaxis with glucose and more negative chemotaxis with sucrose. The average distance traveled that the plates with glucose alone experienced was 3.67 mm toward the glucose, while the average distance traveled for the plates with the sucrose were 3.67 away from sucrose. The Physarum polycephalum would rather be equally away from the sucrose as towards the glucose. In the competitive plates, the Physarum polycephalum moved toward the glucose, away from the sucrose, in almost all of the plates. The one-way ANOVA did however determine that the results were not statistically significant because there was not a large enough effect to conclude that the differences were due to the experiment and not random chance. One major unexpected result was that there was no growth, whatsoever, on the control plates. This could be due to the Physarum being in its reproductive cycle. When stresses such as light, heat, and a lack of food are added to the conditions of the Physarum, they begin their reproductive cycle. During this time, they cannot “reach out” for food and is not able to respond to the external stimuli. The control also lacked a food source so, which most likely sent the Physarum into its reproductive phase, thus no growth. 
The results from the 24 hour results were not used in the calculations because there was little to no chemotaxis displayed in the plates. The extra 24 hours allowed for the Physarum polycephalum to experience chemotaxis and yielded results that were more likely. A 1975 experiment proved that glucose acted as an attractant, while sucrose acted as an extreme repellent [Ueda: 1975]. Another previous experiment stated that Physarum polycephalum would almost immediately move toward glucose, to the point that the majority of the Physarum polycephalum would invade the area occupied by glucose [Costello: 2014]. This did not occur in the plates and therefore the results were not as expected. The positive chemotaxis towards glucose is due to glucose being a monosaccharide and easier to break down for nutrients, however, in many experiments, it was determined that the Physarum was attracted to maltose and other complex sugars [Knowles and Carlile: 1978].
The somewhat unexpected results could be due to the plates used. The sucrose and glucose plates were handmade, and there for could introduce human error. Also, the glucose and sucrose used in the experiment were 25 mM of each, while previous experiments had used between 30 mM and 75 mM of each [[Knowles: 1978]. The decrease in the molar of the treatments could have decrease the chemotaxis that was displayed. Further experiments could be conducted using various molarities of glucose and sucrose to determine if the molarity of the solution will increase or decrease the chemotaxis displayed in the plates. Also, the time frame for the chemotaxis to be measured could be extended.
