Title: Behavioral Aggression Displayed by Betta splendins in Differing Tank Sizes

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to determine if tank size affects aggressive behaviors in Betta splendins (betta fish). An aggressive index was calculated based off observations from two pairs of males being put together in a small and large tank. The aggressive index was specifically calculated for each male by multiplying the level of aggression of a trait by the times that trait was displayed. It was hypothesized that betta fish would display more aggressive behaviors in terms of number and intensity in the small tank than the large tank. It was concluded that betta fish on average displayed more aggressiveness in the small tank than the large tank. This is due to the fact that these organisms are very territorial. Therefore giving them more room to roam around and establish separate territories, means they will interact with one another less.

Introduction:
This laboratory utilizes Betta splendins (Siamese fighting fish). These fish display intraspecific and interspecific agnostic behaviors when interacting with one another. The two main types of these intraspecific behaviors are broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements in increasing level of aggressiveness include: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing [Halperin 1997]. Facing movements in increasing levels of aggressiveness include: erect pectoral fins, spreading gill covers (opercula) and red “mane” display [Halperin: 1997]. It has been previously shown that aggression and welfare in common aquarium fish are impacted largely by tank size, in that the larger aquarium the less aggressive fish are [Old.f.ield: 2011]. This experiment looked to observe these aggressive behaviors (independent variable) dependent on space given to roam (dependent variable) in Betta splendins specifically without any habitat details or spectator fish. It was hypothesized that fish will display more aggressive behaviors in terms of number of times and level of aggressiveness in a smaller tank than in a larger tank.

Materials and Method:
Four male betta fish (Betta splendins) were obtained and separated from each other. Two tanks of different sizes were obtained, tank 1: 20cm x 16.5 cm x 15 cm (4950 cm3) and tank 2: 51 cm x 31 cm x 25.75 cm (40710 cm3). They were filled with tap water (tank 1 level:8.5cm, tank 2 water level: 15.5cm) and buffer (amount designated on bottle). The first set of two fish were put into tank 1 for 5 min. All behaviors of aggression were recorded. Then they were left to rest for 5 min. Next, they were put into tank 2 for 5 min and all aggressive behaviors were recorded. The same process was done for the second set of males. The levels of aggression (ranked 1 to 3) were then multiplied by the number of times a fish displayed that behavior. Averages for each tank were calculated and a paired two-sample t_test was used to determine significance between tanks.

Results:
Overall, the physical observations of betta fish interactions that were recorded matched the average aggression indexes calculated. Figure 1 illustrates that the average aggression index for the two sets of fish in the small tank was 42.75+/-23.315, while the average aggression index for the same fish in the large tank was 22+/-11.52. The data collected of level of aggressiveness between the two tanks was statistically significent (t stat = 2.8776, d.f. = 3, P= 0.032). 

Discussion:
The results of this lab support the hypothesis. The summarized data in Figure 1. Shows that the aggression index (total # of behaviors displayed per rank) was greater for the sets in the small tank (42.75+/-23.315) compared to the large tank (22+/-11.52). This means that betta fish are shown to exhibit more total behaviors and more aggressive behaviors on average when confined to smaller spaces, meaning that spatial allocation is a stimulus in betta behavior. In the small tank, the two males began interacting aggressively right away, while in the large tank it took, on average, two minutes before they began to interact. One reason for this could be because the fish did not see each other. Another reason behind this could be because the more dominant fish was more satisfied with larger territory. It has previously been shown that betta fish fight because they are incredibly territorially and based off their wild habitats extending far beyond the volume of any fish tank, they resort to violence against one another when paired in a tank setting [Old.f.ield: 2011]. There was one fish that acted as an outlier by being far less aggressive in both tanks, contributing to the large standard deviation. A possible explanation for this is the fact that this fish was a different color from the other males used which may also be a dependent variable in aggression index [Clotfelter 2007]. Overall the results of this experiment are statistically significent and show that space given directly effects levels of aggressiveness and tendency to be aggressive in betta fish.
