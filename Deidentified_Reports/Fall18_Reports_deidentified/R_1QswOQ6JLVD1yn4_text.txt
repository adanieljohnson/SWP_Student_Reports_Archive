Title: Impacts of Azaguard on Manduca Sexta Caterpillar During Life Cycle

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of blocking the hormone Ecdysterone (20e) on the Manduca sexta caterpillars, or tobacco hornworms, over two weeks with the chemical Azaguard. The hormone 20e heavily influences the development of the hornworm into its adult stages of life. By testing this experiment, the outcome could potentially give insight into developing more efficient pesticides and reveal more information about the importance of hormones. Our group hypothesized that giving Azaguard to the hornworms would make the caterpillars weigh less, and also prevent them from entering the pupation stage of their life. This was accomplished by separating the controll group and experimental group into two separate trays, and feeding them the same food, except with the experimental having 5 drops of Azaguard added. The two groups were monitored for two weeks and fed when necessary. The results shown that the experimental group weighed less than the controll, but one of the caterpillars entered pupation, making our hypothesis partially supported. The importance behind these results are that larger dosages of Azaguard could cause better pesticides being made against the hornworm, along with showing that 20e plays a large role in the development of the species.

Introduction:
Hormones in both plants and animals play crucial roles in development along with regulating physiological processes. Hormones also influence the lives on insects and other common animals. The Manduca sexta, more commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, is a caterpillar that has contributed heavily to scientific research, as it has largely been the ideal insect for studying endocrinology and physiology [Nijhout: 2006]. However, the caterpillars are also widely known as pests in the agricultural industry, especially for tobacco farmers [Jouanin: 1998]. The caterpillar’s life is largely separated into multiple distinct stages, with the final result of turning into an adult moth. These stages include five larval instars, transitioning into a pupa, and the adult moth as the last stage. During its life, the hornworm’s pattern of molting into multiple stages is heavily influenced by the hormones Ecdysterone (20e) and Juvenile Hormone during its developmental stages. In particular, the steroid 20e influences adult transitions and stages in the caterpillar’s life [Keshan: 2006].  The purpose of this experiment is to determine how large a role the hormone 20e plays in the life cycle of the Manduca sexta. In theory, if given the chemical Azaguard, which has been shown to inhibit 20e, the adult stages of the tobacco hornworm would be greatly affected. It could potentially stunt growth, cause harmful side effects, or other negative outcomes. If given Azaguard as part of their diet, we hypothesize that the Manduca sexta caterpillar will weigh less and not reach the pupae or other adult stages of life.

Materials and Method:
To conduct the experiment, the first step was to prepare two plastic trays (each with four compartments) for eight different tobacco hornworms. The plastic trays had to be correctly labeled with experimental and controll titles, along with numbering each chamber for one caterpillar and making holes for proper ventilation. Following this, we selected eight different caterpillars and weighed them in grams, and placed them into either our controll or experimental group, each having four caterpillars to study. Next, we weighed out 40 grams of caterpillar food for the controll group, and split it into 10 gram portions, and put 5 drops of water from a pipette as well into each section of the tray. For the experimental group, we also weighed out 40 grams of food and divided it evenly, but instead of giving the caterpillars water, they were administered 5 drops of Azaguard with the utilization of a pipette. We organized the trays so that the caterpillar would still have room for movement after the food and liquid was placed into each individual section. After the initial weighing and feeding, the caterpillars were placed into an incubator, being checked daily from approximately 5:00 to 6:00 PM. If certain trays needed food due to old food drying out or being consumed, it was provided with the same provisions and proportions. The caterpillars were monitored for a total of two weeks. After monitoring the caterpillars, data was collected and organized into proper graphs and figures. A two-tailed t_test was also completed to determine if the data was statistically significent. 

Results:
The results of the experiment are outlined in the figures and photos placed in the report. Throughout the experiment we observed the physical changes of the caterpillars along with collecting physical data. Observations included that the controll group transitioned in the expected way, with each reaching pupation. For the experimental group, we observed that the caterpillars did not gain as much weight as the controll group, and most never reached pupation. Some of the experimental caterpillars were also discolored compared to the controll group. From the data collected, the following results were formed.  The controll group had an average weight of 5.229 grams, and the experimental group had an average weight of 3.983 grams (Figure 3). These results were demonstrated as significent by our t_test of the average weights over the two weeks. The p_value of 1.71% is considered significent (Figure 3). The two photos, Figures 4 and 5, featured show the physical differences between the caterpillars on the first and last days of the experiment. 

Discussion:
After collecting data and observing the caterpillars, we concluded that our hypothesis was partially supported. Our data supported the fact that adding Azaguard to the experimental group’s food would cause them to weigh less, as it repressed 20e during the experimental group’s life cycle (Figure 1).  The results show that the controll group overall reached much higher peaks of weight development as compared to the experimental group, Figure 3). However, during the experiment, one of the experimental caterpillars also began to molt into a pupae, which we predicted would not happen during the lab (Figure 2). The Azaguard should have largely prohibited this from occurring, but one was still able to begin the process. While it was only one caterpillar, it still goes against our idea that Azaguard should have still prevented pupation. Along with this, during the two weeks one of the experimental caterpillars died halfway through the lab. This was most likely caused by consuming Azaguard and not being able to properly develop through the adult stages, but there is not a definite cause. If the caterpillar would have stayed alive, it could have further contributed to our data about the potential pupation of the experimental group. The controll group behaved as expected, reaching pupation with no major problems or setbacks. It showed the major difference between giving the tobacco hornworm Azaguard, compared to a normal diet. The results of this experiment are statistically significent, with the p_value being 0.017113. (Figure 3). These results are seen in similar studies as well. A study conducted using a similar chemical to Azaguard on other animals also found that experimenting with hormones caused bad results, with an experimental group of Locusta migratoria being negatively affected, with some of the locusts dying [Siber: 1983]. Along with this, the results can be beneficial in a larger picture. The agricultural industry has had multiple problems with the Manduca sexta, as they can cause entire crop fields to be destroyed by their eating habits, especially for tobacco farmers [Jouanin: 1998]. The data shown in this experiment shows harmful side effects of giving Azaguard to the Manduca sexta, which could be used in developing pesticides against the caterpillar. However, it would be more efficient to most likely use a higher dosage of the chemical, as our use of 5 drops per caterpillar did not kill the hornworm (except for 1), but instead slowed down their growth. With the knowledge of the effects of Azaguard, developing more efficient pesticides against the tobacco hornworm is a likely possibility. In conclusion, giving the Manduca sexta Azaguard as part of their diet can lead to a better understanding of the importance of hormones in their life cycle, as well as providing important statistics to develop more efficient pesticides and other products.
