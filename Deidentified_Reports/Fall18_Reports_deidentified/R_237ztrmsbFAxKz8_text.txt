Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Neuromuscular Responses

Abstract:
Tetany is induced in muscles when muscles become fatigued, most often by excessive stimulation, causing the muscle to contract for extended periods of time. Caffeine is thought to induce tetany via increasing the presence of calcium in motor neurons, allowing for the constant activation of the contractile mechanism. In testing the effect of caffeine on the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens, we hypothesized that the addition of 0.1Ml of caffeine to the muscle during stimulation would result in an increased millivolt output of the muscle and its eventual tetany. All legs produced significent results, supporting our hypothesis (Leg one: p_value=1.5 x 10-11; d.f.=4; t-value=795.5. Leg two: p_value=1.74 x 10-9; d.f.=4; t-value=203.77. Leg three: p_value=8.68 x 10-9; d.f.=4; t-value=288.31). Similar studies testing the effects of caffeine on muscle function reaffirmed our results. The caffeine inhibits the reuptake of Ca2+ ions by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby increasing the presence of said ions allowing the muscle to remain contracted, as opposed to relaxing.


Introduction:
Neuromuscular controll is exercised by motor neurons within the body. These motor neurons experience a stimulus, which in turn produces an action potential. As this action potential signal travels down the axon of a neuron, acetylcholine is released, stimulating the eventual release of calcium ion (Ca2+) which causes the muscle to contract. The subsequent reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum results in the relaxation of the muscle. Caffeine, a commonly used stimulant, acts on the sarcoplasmic reticulum in lowering the ability of the reticulum to reuptake Ca2+. The resulting higher concentrations of Ca2+ affect the contractile mechanism while the stalled reuptake or calcium does not allow for the relaxation mechanism [Jones: 1982]. Tetany—muscle fatigue—occurs when muscles are over stimulated and involuntarily contract rendering the muscle “ineffective.” Previous experiments have shown that muscle fatigue is in fact reached in humans when affected with caffeine [Lopes: 1983]. If 0.1 Ml of caffeine is administered to the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens (Northern Tree frogs), then the muscle will initially experience a stronger response, ultimately resulting in tetany.


Materials and Method:
Three Rania pipien legs were skinned and cut so as to reveal the sciatic nerve. The gastrocnemus muscle was snipped and tied at the Achilles tendon and the leg was suspended from this muscle’s tie at a 90 angle. The stimulus probe was connected to the sciatic nerve and a stimulus of 1.0mV was administered and repeated ten times, recording voltage responses in the iWorx computer program. After the fifth stimuli, 0.1Ml of caffeine was administered directly into the gastrocnemus muscle and the remaining five stimuli were recorded. This procedure was repeated for the remaining two legs. The data was then gathered for each leg, three measurements pre-injection and three measurements post-injection. A two-sample p-test was run for each leg’s results to determine whether or not the results were significent. The average amplitudes and standard deviations of pre-injection and post-injection responses were calculated and graphed for each leg. 


Results:
Each leg, following the administration of ten stimuli and caffeine, experienced tetany. The gastrocnemus muscle was contracted and firm to the touch. Each leg saw a significent spike in the mV muscle response to the stimuli after caffeine was added. The average muscle response of leg one was 1.285 +/- 0.001 pre-injection and 1.815 +/- 0.0006 post-injection. The average muscle response of leg two was 0.524 +/- 0.001 pre-injection and 1.217 +/- 0.0006 post-injection. The average muscle response of leg three was 0.348 +/- 0.001 pre-injection and 1.315 +/- 0.0006 post-injection. These results are highlighted in Figure 1. Each leg provided significent results when calculated in a two-sample p-test. Leg one resulted in a p_value of 1.5 x 10-11 (d.f.=4; t-value=795.5), leg two resulted in a p_value of 1.74 x 10-9 (d.f.=4; t-value=203.77), and leg three resulted in a p_value of 8.68 x 10-9 (d.f.=4; t-value=288.31).


Discussion:
The results of each leg proved significent, allowing us to reject our null hypothesis in support of our hypothesis. After caffeine was added to each leg, the mV response increased and tetany was induced. A sharp incline in the amplitude graph exhibits this trend in each leg. We know tetany was induced having felt the gastrocnemus muscle post injection/stimulation; the solid nature of the muscle illustrates a semi-permanent contraction—otherwise known as tetany. In a study conducted by Jones, Howell, Roussos, and Edwards, human muscles treated with caffeine concluded the same results—induced tetany [Jones: 1982]. This is to be expected as caffeine inhibits the reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing the contractile mechanism’s activity therefore over-stimulating and fatiguing the muscle. The effects of caffeine were observed immediately after injection. These findings, paired with Jones’ results, lead to further questions regarding the effects of caffeine on the human body. This leads to a new research question: what quantity of caffeine may be ingested by humans before a decline in muscle performance is experienced? These results may prove helpful in analyzing athlete performance and in creating performance geared supplements.
