Title: Effect of Temperature on Photosynthesis Activity of Spinacia Oleracea Chlotoplasts

Abstract:
In this experiment, the goal was to explore the relationship between photosynthesis of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Savoy) chloroplasts and the temperature. The participants used the Hill reaction as the indicator to monitor the photosynthetic activities. It was hypothesized that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts would increase. The enriched spinach chloroplasts were kept at different temperatures, and photosynthesis rate would be recorded every 10 minutes by measuring the absorbance. However, the participants were unable to find statistically significent differences between sample groups. The null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Further testing is needed to produce a definitive conclusion. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a crucial biological pathway that allows plants to harvest light energy to fix carbon and produce sugar, which releases O2 as a waste product. Nearly all living organisms on the earth depend on this biological process [Lambers, 2008]. During the photosynthesis, the CO2 molecules in the atmosphere enter the plants’ leaves through the pores called stomata. The chloroplasts which are in a tight array could capture the solar radiation, which excites electrons. These excited electrons are then used to create a proton gradient and produce ATP molecules. The ATP molecules combined with high energy electrons are then used to synthesize glucose molecules from CO2 molecules in the atmosphere which enter the plants’ leaves through the pores called stomata [Lambers, 2008]. Hill reaction, which is the process of transferring electrons, can be used as a tool to measure photosynthetic activity [Arnon et al., 1956]. DCIP, a blue substance, could be used as an alternative electron acceptor in the Hill reaction. When DCIP is reduced, it becomes colorless. By measuring the absorbance of the reaction solutions, the photosynthetic activities could be monitored. Plants have different optimal temperatures which would allow them to grow better. A study has shown that spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. cv Savoy) grows at 5 °C would show signs of increased dry mass, thicker leaves, and larger leaf areas [Boese & Hunter, 1990]. The experiment participants want to further explore the relationship between the photosynthesis and temperature. It is hypothesized that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts will increase. The independent variable is the temperature, and the dependent variable is the absorbance at 600nm, which is an indicator of the photosynthetic activity.



Materials and Method:
The dried spinach leaves, whose veins were previously removed, were grinded in 10 Ml of cold 400 mM pH 8.0 grinding buffer using a set of cooled mortar and pestle. Another 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the ground spinach leaves. Then the spinach slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The filtered liquid was then centrifuged at 200G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and then centrifuged again at 1000G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was removed. Then the pellets were resuspended with 20 Ml grinding buffer. 13 test tubes were prepared. 6 Ml of water, 2Ml 100 mM pH 6.5 phosphate reaction buffer, and 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP was added to test tubes 1-12. The test tubes 1-3 was kept at 0°C ice-water mixture, test tubes 4-6 at 25°C (room temperature), test tubes 7-9 at 35°C water bath, and test tubes 10-12 at 45°C water bath. Then 2 Ml of enriched chloroplast was added to test tubes 1-12 and mixed immediately. A blank was made by mixing 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. The spectrophotometer was blanked, then the absorbances of the solutions in test tubes 1-12 were measured at 600 nm at time 0. The spectrophotometer was re-blanked, and the absorbances of the solutions in test tubes 1-12 were measured at 600 nm after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The absorbances at 10, 20, and 30 minutes were then compared with the time 0 absorbance by calculating percent change using the formula [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at the time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. The data was then analyzed using a one-way a-nova test to compare the differences in photosynthesis activity of the chloroplast in different temperatures.

Results:
The data displayed in Figure 1 does show that the chloroplasts kept in 0-3˚C tend to have higher percent change than samples kept in higher temperature. The statistical test shown in Table 1 and Table 2indicates that there was no statistically significent difference among percent change among sample kept in different temperature at 10 minutes and 30 minutes mark. At the 20 minutes, there is a statistically significent difference in percent change between the 0-3˚C and 25˚C as indicated by Table 1 and Table 2. Note: Test tube number 10 (45˚C) shows the usual discoloration after 10 minutes, it was dark green instead of blue.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis that if the temperature is decreased, the rate of photosynthesis of the spinach chloroplasts will not change cannot be rejected. The goal of the experiment is exploring whether photosynthesis would be affected by environmental temperature. At 10 minutes and 30 minutes, there was no statistically significent variation in absorbance among samples at the different temperature. However, at 20 minutes, the data suggests that there is a statistically significent difference in absorbance between the chloroplasts and the 0-3˚C and 25˚C. But this statistically significent difference alone cannot definitively suggest the effect of temperature on the photosynthesis activity of spinach chloroplasts. However, despite the lack of statistical significance, the data does show that the chloroplasts kept in 0-3˚C tend to have higher percent change than samples kept in higher temperature, which indicates 0-3˚C have more active photosynthetic activity. This corresponds to the findings of other studies done in the past. It is evident that the spinach chloroplasts, when kept in low temperature, do have the higher rate of photosynthesis in short period; but in the longer period, the coldness would inhibit the photosynthesis [Somersalo & Krause, 1989]. One potential error contributes to this result could be the lack of controll over how much light was facilitated to the chloroplasts during the experiment. Samples at 35˚C and 45˚C were kept in two different water bath. Both of the water bath machines have tinted lids, which were kept closed during the experiment. However, the samples kept in 0-3˚C and 25˚C were left in the open without obstruction from the light source. The previous study has suggested that the quality and quantity of the light have a strong correlation with the photosynthesis rate [Platt & Jassby, 1989]. In the future experiment, the experiment participants could try to conduct this experiment with a more careful controll of the lighting of the samples. One possible way of achieving this might be open the lids of the water bath machines while the incubating the samples in them.
