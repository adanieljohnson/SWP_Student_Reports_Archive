Title: Effects of acidic, neutral, and alkaline pH levels on the reduction reaction in photosystem II of spinach leaves

Abstract:
This study tests the effects of various pH levels on the reduction reaction that occurs at photosystem II during photosynthesis in spinach leaves. The effect of a pH level of 4, 6.5, and 10 were used in order to determine the optimal pH for the photosynthesis process. This was measured through comparing the absorbance data at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer and the electron acceptor DCIP. The DCIP electron acceptor was used as an indication of the rate of photosynthesis occurring in the spinach leaves and could be used to determine the effects of pH on the reduction reaction through comparing changes in absorbency. The hypothesis was that the 6.5 pH environment would be the most optimal for the reduction reaction and was determined through a lower absorbance rate relative to the other samples. The results favored the hypothesis, which showed the 6.5 pH samples to have a lower average absorbance than the other samples; however, the data was statistically insignificant and can neither support or reject the hypothesis.

Introduction:
Cellular processes in biological systems require added energy to live, which comes through harvesting energy from external sources [Johnson-2016]. Plants can use photosynthesis in order to capture energy and store from the sun [Johnson-2016]. Throughout this process, electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain that assists in energy capturing [Johnson-2016]. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb energy from the sun [Johnson-2016]. Electrons are excited and trigger a chemical reaction that cleaves water in order to release electrons to replace and to generate a proton gradient [Johnson-2016]. The high energy electrons store on NADPH and the H+ gradient powers ATP synthesis [Johnson-2016]. In the light dependent reaction section that occurs in the thylakoid membrane of a chloroplast, photosystem II absorbs energy form the light, which causes electrons to leave chlorophyll [Johnson-2016]. The cleavage of water is indirectly stimulated and creates O2 and electrons [Johnson-2016]. Electrons will eventually be accepted by NADP+ to make NADPH [Johnson-2016]. The reduction of NADP+ can be used to show the activity of photosynthesis, but can also be viewed using alternative electron acceptors, such as a dark blue compound called DCIP to show electron transfer activity [Johnson-2016]. This will show ATP production. During photosynthesis, DCIP is reduced to DCIPH2, going from a dark blue compound that absorbs light maximally at 600 nm, to a colorless substance due to the conjugated new double C bond [Johnson-2018]. Because of this, as the absorbance goes down, it can be inferred that the reduction reaction occurring at photosystem II is increasing. Through adding DCIP to a photosynthesis reaction, it can be determined how environmental conditions, such as pH, affect the reduction reaction required for photosynthesis. It has been indicated that pH can be used as a factor that effects redox reactions due to the change in concentration of hydrogen protons [Walter-2006]. Spinach leaves have been found to have a high rate for the reduction reaction at a pH of 6.5 [Okasaki-2009]. The reduction reaction in the redox reaction will be tested in a higher (pH 10) and lower pH(pH 4) level in order to determine the effects of a more acidic and more alkaline environment on photosystem II, which has been seen to be highly sensitive to small changes in pH [Mathur-2011]. The rate of the reduction reaction occurring at photosystem II during photosynthesis in spinach leaves will be the greatest at a pH 6.5, and will show the greatest decrease in absorbance. This will be indicated using the absorbance data of spinach leaves at a wavelength of 600 nm. This is a significant question because it can reveal how the pH of soil may effect plant growth, as that soil alkalization has recently become a major environmental problem in agriculture [Zhang-2016].

Materials and Methods:
Additional materials to typical lab equipment needed were a mortar and pestle, 4 spinach leaves, grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), cheesecloth, a centrifuge, a spectrophotometer, reaction buffer(100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), reaction buffer acidic(100 mM phosphate, 4), and reaction buffer alkaline (100 mM phosphate, pH 10).
Part 1
A mortar and pestle, medium-sized beaker(150-250 ml size) and (7?) 50 ml centrifuge tubes were placed into crushed ice to cool. The large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves were removed and thrown away. The remaining leaf pieces were rinsed with water and then blotted off in order to remove moisture. The spinach leaves were then added to the mortar and pestle after wiping the mortar and pestle dry. 10 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added, and then the spinach was grinded into a think paste. After the spinach had a consistency without large chunks of leaves, an additional 10 ml of grinding buffer was added and mixed into the spinach. The spinach was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the medium-sized beaker. The contents of the beaker were then poured into a 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. A balance tube filled with water was used to balance the centrifuge. The supernatant was poured from tube “A” into a second 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B”, leaving the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Tube B, containing the chloroplast suspension, was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then poured out of tube “B”, leaving the pellet of B in tube “B”, which was then placed on ice. 15 ml of grinding buffer was added to tube “B” and suspended by stirring it gently with a transfer pipet. Three centrifuge tubes labeled pH 4, pH 6.5, and pH 10 each had 5 ml of the suspended B pellet poured into them. 5 mL of the corresponding pH buffers (pH 4 buffer in pH 4 tube, pH 6.5  buffer in pH 6.5 tube, pH 10 buffer in pH 10 tube were added into each designated centrifuge tube at the same time, and 10 minutes passed in order to allow the solution to react. The three centrifuge tubes were then centrifuged at 1000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatants of the three tubes were poured out, and 5 ml of grinder buffer were added to each test tube labeled pH 4, pH 6.5, and pH 10. 
Part Two
13 large test tubes were labeled with numbers 0-12, indicating that the 0 test tube would be the blank. The spectrophotometer was turned on and set to read at 600 nm.  Tube 0 had 8 ml of distilled water and 2 ml of reaction buffer pH 6.5 added to it. Tubes 1-12 had 6 ml of distilled water, 2 ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 ml of reaction buffer pH 6.5 to it. 100 microliters of pH 6.5 chloroplast mixture was added to Tubes 1-3. 100 microliters of pH 4 chloroplast mixture was added to tubes 4-6. 100 microliters of pH 10 chloroplast mixture was added to Tubes 7-9. Each tube was mixed immediately after the chloroplasts were added. The small part of each test tube was then each transfer to spectrophotometer cuvette. The spectrophotometer was blanked using the blank solution at 600 nm. The absorbances of all the samples were recorded as Time Zero data points, measuring absorbances. All test tubes were then placed in direct sunlight for 10 minutes, and then the absorbances for each test tube was recorded again. The results were recorded in a table. Standard error and a two-tailed T test will be used to determine statistical significance.


Results:
In order to determine the most effective pH for the process of photosynthesis we determined the average absorbances at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. We found that there was a larger decrease in absorbance for the 6.5 pH sample which means that the chloroplasts at a pH of 6.5 had the highest rate of reduction in the photosynthesis process. The absorbance for sample at pH 4 and pH 10 had higher absorbance levels than the 6.5 sample. 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment were in favor of our hypothesis, which stated that the reduction reaction of spinach will have the highest rate at a pH of 6.5. However, the data was not all statistically significant, so it cannot adequately support the hypothesis. The trends revealed in the graph indicate that the pH levels of 4 and 10 drastically decreased the rate of the reduction reaction occurring in photosynthesis, due to the smaller decreases in the absorbance rate. Because less electrons were being transferred, the electron acceptor DCIP was not creating as many new carbon double bonds, which causes the decrease in the blue color that indicated changes in absorbency [Johnson-2016]. This may be because the hydrogen concentration at a pH of 6.5 is ideal for the hydrogen concentration gradient that is used in order to generate ATP. It has been shown that it is energy exhaustive for plants to maintain a cytosolic pH under acidic conditions because they must overcome an increased proton concentration gradient, which may lead to a decrease in photosynthesis rates [Gerloff‐Elias-2005]. This may also occur because many enzymes are dependent on a certain pH and no longer can function well at acidic pHs [Gerloff‐Elias-2005]. High alkaline pH levels have been shown to destroy photosystem II in other plant species [Moustakas-1998].
