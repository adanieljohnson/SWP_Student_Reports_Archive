Title: Root to Shoot Ratio Comparison of P. Sativum Arvense Grown in Sunlight and Darkness

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation in plants as a result of changes to the environment is a very important aspect of evolutionary biology. Learning how and why this variation occurs may lead to a better understanding of the environment in which we live and how these changes may benefit the ecosystem in the future. Here we look at the phenotypic variation of field pea plants (P. Sativum Arvense) grown in full sunlight and complete darkness by measuring and comparing their average root to shoot (R:S) ratios. It was anticipated that the R:S ratio for both the weights and lengths of plants grown in sunlight would be smaller than the ratio for those grown in darkness in response to the search for lacking light. Our data displayed that there was a significant difference in the lengths of those grown in each condition, yet one large root skewed the data for the R:S weight differences between the conditions and showed no significant difference between the two. This significant difference in the R:S ratios for length suggests that, when deprived of light, plants tend to allocate their resources to seeking out the sunlight they need for photosynthesis. This adaptation shows that the P. Sativum Arvense plant is willing to change its appearance in order to survive in different environments.

Introduction:
This experiment researches and analyzes the effect of sunlight on the Root to Shoot ratio of field peas (P. Sativum Arvense). Photosynthesis is an organism’s (primarily plant’s) ability to convert available sunlight into food for its growth and development. This process can be found in the leaves of the plant as this is the area that captures solar energy when sunlight is present. However, studies have shown that, after cutting the root from the shoot of P. Sativum Arvense plants and attempting to re-grow roots on their severed ends, a lack of sunlight and therefore photosynthesis resulted in the inability of a shoot to grow new roots [Eliasson: 1978]. Furthermore, when sunlight is available, plants have a higher growth rate due to this increase in resource allocation [AD Johnson: 2018]. This plays a vital factor in the sustainability of an organism’s life and we wanted to see the outcomes of depriving a plant of sunlight as compared to those provided full sunlight during development. For this experiment, I hypothesize that the average root to shoot ratio will increase for field pea plants grown in darkness in an attempt to seek out the lacking sunlight. In addition, the root to shoot ratio for field pea plants grown in the sunlight-available greenhouse will be smaller because they have no need to seek out the readily-present sunlight.

Materials and Methods:
To conduct this experiment, the field pea seeds were first soaked in water for at least 30 minutes and planted in 4 different pots of vermiculite. Then the soil was dampened with 100 mL of water and 50 mL of Miracle Grow and the seeds were covered with a thin layer of vermiculite. Next, two pots were placed in the well-lit greenhouse and the other two pots in an area with no sunlight- a cabinet in the laboratory. All four pots were watered with 100 mL of water daily for two weeks. After this period of time, the developed field pea plants were carefully separated from the vermiculite, dried off, and cut at the base of the seed to separate the roots from the shoots. These roots and shoots were separated by their condition of growth, either sunlight or darkness and their weights (grams) and lengths (cm) recorded. Each root and shoot was weighed in a standard lab balance by the same team member and the lengths factored from the end of the cut side to the tip of the shoot stem. A one-tailed, two sample t-test was used to determine if there was any variation in the R:S ratios, the lengths, and the weights of the field pea plants grown in the greenhouse (sunlight) and in the cabinet (darkness). 

Results:
After conducting a two-sample T-test for the root to shoot ratios of the weight and length of plants grown in both conditions, we discovered a statistically significant difference for the R:S length ratio of each condition (T-value=6.9; df=18; P-value=0.00). However, the mean R:S ratio for weight proved not to contain a statistically significant difference between those grown in sunlight and those grown darkness (T-value=1.9; df=18; P-value=0.07).


Discussion:
The hypothesis for this experiment is accepted in regards to the prediction that the root to shoot ratio of the plants’ lengths would increase for the plants grown in darkness. This can be shown by the p-value of 0.00 for the length of plants grown in both conditions because a p-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant to this experiment. On the other hand, our hypothesis is rejected for the R:S ratios for the weights of plants grown in both conditions because there was no statistical significance to the p-value (0.07) for this data set. This can be contributed to an outlier in our sample of the field pea plants grown in sunlit conditions where two seeds fused into one and weighed nearly twice the amount of its shoot. This shifted the overall mean R:S ratio for this sample group and thus may have impacted the statistics yielded from the research. More research on this experiment must be conducted in order to eliminate certain confounding variables that presented a challenge in this initial study. One confounding variable was the presence of Hurricane Florence during the first three days of the plant growth. This hurricane prevented our group from watering the pots daily as we instead had to give each plant 300mL of water on the first day to compensate for the 2 following days without access to the building which sheltered out plants. However, if done properly, this experiment could yield findings which prove relevant to the topic of how phenotypic variation in the presence of adverse conditions can be beneficial to a species’ survival.
