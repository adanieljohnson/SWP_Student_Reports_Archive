Title: The impact of water color on the aggression levels of male Betta splendins and their interactions

Abstract:
The bright displays of aggression performed by male betta fish provide a great opportunity to study the intraspecific competition of males in a population. Learning about what affects and alters this type of competition is important to the study of sexual selection and breeding patterns within a species. Here we look at how changes to the color of water in which they reside alters the displayed levels of aggression between two sets of B. splenden males. It was hypothesized that the alterations made to the water color of the aquariums would have a significent impact on the agnostic behaviors of the fish. The data we gathered refuted that water color is not statistically significent and has no impact on the betta’s behaviors. These results suggest that these intraspecific actions are genetically based and are not influenced by the environment. 


Introduction:
This experiment looks at how differences in water color may or may not affect the agnostic behaviors, or levels of aggression, of male betta fish (B. splendins). Generally, male betta fish are extremely aggressive in the presence of other males of their kind as displayed by many flamboyant movements of their fins and bodies [Clayton & Hinde: 1967]. Male betta fish in the wild are typically dull in color and only display their bright red and blue “fighting colors” when faced with another male opponent. However, through domestication, their baseline appearance is now that of their previous “fighting” appearance [Johnson: 2018]. Changing the water color to the “fighting” colors commonly found in bettas may impact whether the fish interpret the water color as a display of aggression in their opponent. As such, we hypothesize that, through conducting this experiment, there will be a significent change in the displayed aggressive behaviors of these fish based on the color of water that they are in. We anticipate an impact on aggression because the male bettas are highly reactive to the bright red and blue colors that are displayed as a warning by other males, so manipulating the water color to mimic this effect may instigate a larger reaction than if the water were clear. 

Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis, two separate, clean aquariums were divided into 2 individual “tanks” with glass dividers and opaque coverings. One aquarium was filled with clear, treated water and the other was dyed red using 4 drops of organic food coloring. Once the tests were completed for both sets of bettas in one condition, they were switched and tested in the other tank’s condition. These two sets of B. splenden males were allowed to see each other through the glass barrier for 5 minutes and their levels of aggression, 1-5, were recorded. They then got a 5 minute period of rest before they were placed in one large section of the respective tank and their unimpeded interactions were recorded using the same scale. After both conditions were tested for each group, the clear tank was dyed green using 4 drops of organic food coloring and the same process was repeated. The levels of aggression were as follows: (1) No aggression (2) Broadside movement of tail flickering and/or facing movement of erect pectoral fins (3) Broadside movement of tail beating and/or facing movement of spreading gill covers (4) Broadside movement of tail flashing and/or facing movement of displaying red mane (5) Physical fight (including biting, darting, and attacking). An ANOVA test was constructed to analyze the results of the study for each individual fish in all three conditions. 


Results:
During the study, it was noted that there was one dominant and one submissive betta in each pairing. This prevented any physical attacks from occurring- darting, biting, etc- because there was not a mirrored display of aggression from the submissive betta. However, all four bettas displayed common signs of aggression at some point during the tests, these included erect pectoral fins, exposed red manes, and tail beating. The mean levels of aggression for all four B. splendins with glass dividers in every water condition was not statistically significent (F(11)=0.8412, p=0.462). This continued in the results of the bettas in all conditions without a glass divider (F(11)=0.206, p=0.818), which also shows no statistical correlation to their displayed levels of aggression. The large standard deviations of both glass and no glass divider agnostic levels in each water condition shows about an even rank for every interaction between the pairs of bettas, which furthers the lack of statistical significance of the data yielded in the ANOVA test.  


Discussion:
The hypothesis presented for this experiment was rejected by the data gathered in the research. The data shows no statistically significent difference in the levels of aggression in the bettas based on the color of their tank water. In addition, the presence of a glass divider also yielded no statistically significent data. The trend present in Figure 1 displays that there is no major variation in betta fish reactions in any condition. One factor that may have influenced the outcome of the study is the habituation of the two males in their environments. In their research article on the habituation of displays of aggression in B. splendins, Clayton and Hinde found that from after the first few minutes to around the 24-hour mark of interaction between two male bettas, their aggressive displays rapidly decreased until nearly gone [Clayton & Hinde: 1967]. As stated in this research article, the four bettas present in our study may have gotten familiar with each other or learned when the glass barrier was present and when they could attack their pair without impediment. This was particularly evident during the last condition in which the two pairs were tested as they had gone through four other interactions with their partner- glass and no glass for two tank colors. By the last condition, the fish showed markedly less aggression than in their initial encounters with each other.
