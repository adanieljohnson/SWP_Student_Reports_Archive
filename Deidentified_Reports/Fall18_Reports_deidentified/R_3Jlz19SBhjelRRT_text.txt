Title: Testing the Effects of Lidocaine On Physarum Polycephalum

Abstract:
In this experiment the effects of lidocaine on the growth signaling pathway of Physarum polycephalum, a common slime mold. It was hypothesized that the addition of lidocaine to the Physarum sample would completely inhibit the growth of the mold; because it is an inhibitor of sodium ion channels that are involved in the sodium channel signaling pathway of Physarum. After preparing the test and control groups, the Physarum was monitored over a 48 hour long time period. Both the control and test groups showed no growth at all. The results section of this report will aim to portray the data that was expected to be generated by this experiment. The discussion section will aim to explain or determine probable causes for the lack of growth. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold that spends most of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage [Bozzone: 1998]. The Physarum mold is an ideal organism to study for signaling because it is easy to monitor, grows at a rapid pace, and is known to utilize numerous signaling pathways. Physarum mold is able to move through the extension of actin filaments. Physarum moves in order to search for food. If food is unavailable, the mold will enter a suspended stage [Bozzone: 1998]. To find food, the Physarum uses numerous signaling pathways in order to move towards a food source, or to provide a directionality to its movement. One pathway in particular involves the use of sodium ion channels [Guttes, et al: 1961]. These signaling pathways can be altered to change the directionality of the Physarum’s growth or stop growth completely. Testing signaling pathways is important because nearly all organisms use signaling in order to carry out a multitude of different activities. In this experiment, we will aim to alter the movement of Physarum using the substance lidocaine. Lidocaine will affect the sodium channel signaling pathway of Physarum in order to inhibit growth. Lidocaine is a sodium channel blocker, so it will block the sodium ion channels that are used during an action potential [Calahan, Almers: 1979]. These action potentials are necessary for the Physarum to move. It is hypothesized that if lidocaine is presented to the Physarum mold in a food rich environment, it will not grow because lidocaine will block the sodium channels that are used to signal for movement. 

Materials and Methods:
​Six agar containing Petri​ dishes were obtained from the lab. A petri dish containing the Physarum sample was also provided. Three 2% water agar plates were labeled control one through three. Three 2% water agar plates were labeled test one through three. One milliliter of lidocaine was added into a test tube containing 19 milliliters of distilled water. Into each of the three control group plates, two one centimeter holes were cut out. Five milliliters of lidocaine solution was put into the test plates. After waiting for the lidocaine to dry, two one centimeter squares were cut into each of the three test plates. The plate containing the Physarum sample was divided entirely into one-centimeter squares. A one centimeter square of Physarum sample was implanted into each opening previously prepared. Oatmeal was placed into each of the six plates. The plates were then covered entirely with tin foil and placed in an incubator. The plates were left in the incubator and left for 48 hours. Growth was determined after 48 hours by measuring in millimeters the distance of migration from the Physarum’s start point. A two-tailed t-test was used in order to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in the amount of growth between the control and test cultures. 

Results:
This section is a representation of the results we would have expected to see after completing this experiment. The data that was actually obtained showed no growth in the control or test groups.
 All three of the lidocaine containing cultures showed an average of 1.33 millimeters. The test groups showed an average of 25 millimeters of growth. The t-test showed statistical significance between the two groups (p-value: 0.000139, t stat: 26.835, df: 2). The direction of growth in the control group was in the direction of the food. 


Discussion:
In the introduction, it was explained that Physarum polycephalum uses signaling pathways in order to determine the directionality of its movement. One of these signaling pathways involves sodium ion channels that are used during action potentials. These action potentials are responsible for the movement of Physarum. Lidocaine is a sodium ion channel inhibitor [Guttes, et al: 1961]. In the case of this experiment, it is likely that the lidocaine successfully inhibited the action of sodium ion channels, causing the Physarum’s growth to be inhibited immensely. The t-test showed that the two groups were significantly different (p-value: 0.000139, t stat: 26.835, df: 2). By referencing the figure, it is clear that the growth of the control was noticeably higher than the growth of the test group. The lidocaine’s action blocked the signaling pathway by which Physarum was able to move. This evidence supports the hypothesis previously proposed at the beginning of the experiment. This hypothesis can also be explained by the fact that lidocaine blocked the sodium channels in the respective signaling pathway utilized by the Physarum [Calahan, Almers: 1979]. This information is important biologically because it not only tests how signaling pathways can affect activities of organisms​ but also how those signaling pathways can be altered or inhibited. 
	In reality, the experiment yielded no data. While the lack of growth in the test group supported the hypothesis stated in the discussion, the lack of growth in the control group was an unexpected anomaly. The Physarum cultures seemingly just shut down and failed to grow. Considering the numerous signaling pathways utilized by Physarum, there are a number of factors that could have come in to play. For example, a 1975 study showed that the chemotaxis can be altered based on the lack of pure cultures and soluble media for Physarum mold to grow on [Carlile: 1970]. Essentially, the study determined that a pure glucose source was required to have a high yield of growth, and the less pure the carbohydrate solution, the lower the yield. This means that our cultures could have been contaminated or impure. This would cause the Physarum samples to behave irregularly and possibly not grow at all. Physarum mold also could have shut down due to a number of different reasons, such as the opening and closing of the incubator causing sporadic temperature and light changes, however, due to the nature of this lab, it is very difficult for variables like that to be controlled. 
	Conclusively, the lidocaine test groups lack of growth was predicted by the hypothesis; and while the control group’s lack of growth was unexpected, it can be explained biologically in a number of ways.
