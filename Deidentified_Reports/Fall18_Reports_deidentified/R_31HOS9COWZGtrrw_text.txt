Title: Testing the Effects of NaCl on Spinacia oleracea Electron Transport in Light Dependent Photosynthetic Reactions

Abstract:
A prominent environmental stressor today is salinity in agricultural soils that reduce the productivity of crops.  High soil salinity in food insecure regions can cause dangerously low food yields that exacerbate food shortages. This experiment aims to generate information on how salinity can affect plants through the testing of different concentrations of NaCl on Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts and determining how this NaCl affects Electron Transport. Based on previous information, salt concentration should decrease electron transport, resulting in the assay samples remaining a bluer color with high absorbance values when compared to the controll samples. Thus, demonstrating that electron transport is being inhibited. To test this hypothesis, an assay was performed that used saturated enriched spinach chloroplasts in the different NaCl solution concentrations 10%, 25%, and 50%. A spectrophotometer recorded the absorbances of these solutions, the Hill Reaction Equation calculated percent change of absorbance, and finally, an ANOVA statistical test analyzed the data. When examining the data, the chloroplasts exposed to NaCl solutions seemed to have a lower rate of change when compared to the controll, the ANOVA statistical test determined these differences were not significent.

Introduction:
Biological processes require supplemental energy from various sources in order to operate accurately and efficiently. In plants and animals, this energy is generated from three major sources, chemical energy in covalent bonds, energy stored as an oxidation-reduction potential, and energy from an electrical or chemical gradient across a bilayer. Plants, some protists, and certain bacteria utilize photosynthesis as a way to seize all three functional energy forms from the sun. This stored energy is released through glycolysis via the cytoplasm and through respiration that occurs in the mitochondria. (1)
	Photosynthesis is a three-step process, in which the first two steps are light dependent reactions that involve and the use of absorbed photons to generate electron carriers in the form known as NADPH. Electrons carried by NADPH can be transferred to multiple different electron carriers. The measurement of the transportation of electrons can be used to determine ATP production during photosynthesis by utilizing the Hill Reaction Equation. The understanding of this process helped drive the experiment of what affects may be seen when determining how different NaCl solutions may affect electron transport in spinach. 
One of the most prominent environmental stressors today is the salinity affecting agricultural soils. (2) Salt affects the agricultural production of crops. Since food scarcity is widespread across the globe, determining if salt affects agricultural production could be extremely beneficial in preventing low crop yields. 
	In the previous experiment conducted by (3) Kalaji, H. M. et al. in 2011, the NaCl salt treatment significently decreased the rates of photosynthesis in photosystem II in barley based on chlorophyll florescence data, that showed that the light section of the chloryphyll were significently altered after the application of salt. Another source, the P. Mehta et al. article written in 2009, also displayed that salt may have had a significent effect on photosynthetic activity because of harsh effects on Photosystem II in wheat leaves. 
Based on the results of both these articles an experiment was formulated in order to test how different concentrations of NaCl could affect enriched spinach chloroplasts over the course of 30 minutes. Spinacia oleracea was specifically used as our model organism because the plant is easily accessible and simple to measure. Based on this information, NaCl should inhibit electron transport, resulting in the assay samples remaining a bluer color along with absorbance values being higher when compared to the controll samples. This would demonstrate that electron transport is being inhibited by NaCl. Also, the higher amount of NaCl used would increase the inhibition of the electron transport. 


Materials and Method:
To begin, a cooled mortar and pestle were utilized to grind the de-veined spinach leaves into a thick paste. After that, 10Ml of grinding buffer solution (400mM sucrose intracrine buffer, pH 8.0) were added to the paste. When finished the slurry solution was drained using a cheese cloth into a 150Ml beaker. When this was finished the liquid was transferred into a centrifuge tube marked tube A and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4˚C. After the supernatant was done spinning, the contents were taken out of tube A and moved into tube B. The material was then spun a second time at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4˚C. The new supernatant was then poured into tube C and tube B was placed on ice. An additional 20Ml more of buffer solution was added to tube C stirring gently. This pellet sample contained enriched chloroplasts and was used to perform the assay. Next the concentrations of the NaCl solutions (10%,25%, and 50%) were prepared for the assay. To make the 10%NaCl solution 200µl of NaCl and 1800µl of water were mixed. For the 25% NaCl solution 500µl of NaCl and 1500µl of water were mixed. Lastly for the 50%NaCl solution 1000µl of NaCl and 1000µl of water were mixed. After these concentrations were made, the test tubes for the assay were made. There were 3 tubes for each concentration in the assay, one tube for the controll, and one tube for the blank used to balance the spectrophotometer. Each tube, excluding the blank, had 2Ml of 130mM of DCIP, 2Ml of an NaCl Concentration solution (10%,25%, and 50%), 2 Ml of Reaction Buffer 100mM phosphate pH 6.5, 100µl of enriched chloroplasts from Tube C (enriched B pellet) and 6Ml of water. The blank had only the 2Ml of Reaction Buffer 100mM phosphate pH 6.5 and 10 Ml of water. These test tubes were then transferred to cuvettes. The spectrophotometer set to read at 600nm was then blanked and the absorbance was measured for all samples before being placed under the UV lamp. After the absorbances were measured and recorded every ten minutes for 30 minutes. After measuring the percent change of electron transport using the Hill Reaction Equation a one-way ANOVA statistical test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
The statistical test used to analyze the results was a one-tailed ANOVA to compare the means of the experimental and controll groups to one another. The results are displayed in figure 1, where the percentage rate of change for the four experimental groups were averaged for each NaCl concentration and a controll group. Based on the one-way ANOVA statistical test, the difference between the means of the different groups is was not significent because the p_value obtained from the statistical test was greater than 0.05 the alpha value for this experiment. (f-stat= 3.509, degrees of freedom=11, p_value=0.069.)

Discussion:
	As stated previously, biological processes require supplemental energy that can be generated from the transfer of electrons. Plants use this energy generated form this electron transport in order to grow and prosper. This experiment aimed to test if different concentrations of NaCl could decrease or inhibit electron transport in spinach leaves. Based on the data from figure 1, a slight difference can be seen when the absorbances of the NaCl groups and controll group (controll=43.4, NaCl 10%=28, NaCl 25%=24.2 and NaCl 50%=26.4), as the controll group has a higher percent rate of change. However, after performing the ANOVA statistical test, this difference was determined not to be statistically significent. Thus, supporting the null hypothesis.
This data is contrary to the other studies researched, as both the Kalaji, H. M. et al. and P. Mehta et al. article displayed that NaCl caused inhibition during photosystem II. saw significent changes in electron transport after exposure to salts. The data from this experiment may have differed from previous studies because the plants in previous studies were affected for long periods of time while in this experiment the chloroplasts were only exposed for 30 minutes.  Meaning that the 30 minutes the enriched chloroplasts were exposed to NaCl solutions may not have much effect on the transfer of electrons. However, if tested for a higher period of time such as an hour, the may have been a more significent difference in the average percent rate of change between the controll and treatment groups.
	While this experiment did not bring any significent results, the effect of salinity on agricultural plants is an important topic as the world continues to face more problems concerning pollution and food scarcity.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 Displays the average rate of change for each NaCl treatment group and the controll after 30 minutes under the UV lamp. The rate of change for each of the treatments was determined by the Hill’s reduction equation. Then, the average was obtained for each of the treatment groups by averaging each of the 3 trials for each concentration dilutions. The data averaged for the controll groups was 51.3, 36.3, and 42.6. The data averaged for the 10% NaCl group was 23.6842105, 32.8813559, and 27.5. The data averaged for the NaCl 25% group was 13.9784946, 31.2056738, and 27.4247492. The data averaged for the 50% NaCl group was 35.2727273, 15.4676259, and 28.4132841. The data bars represent the average percent rate of change for each treatment group and the error bars represent the standard deviations of all the treatment groups, controll=43.4 with a standard deviation of 7.531932023, NaCl 10%=28.0 with a standard deviation of 4.62072729, NaCl 25%=24.2 with a standard deviation of 9.05421501, NaCl 50%=26.4 with a standard deviation of 10.0572036. The average percentage change values have been rounded to be more easily read on graph. The results from the one-tailed ANOVA statistical test were (f-stat= 3.509, degrees of freedom=11, p_value=0.069.*************************************************************************
