Title: Varying water temperatures indicate no clear effect upon elodea photosynthetic rate

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the mechanism by which plants produce their own energy in the form of glucose. While studying photosynthesis with regard to plant cell biology, the effect of varying water temperatures was examined as applied to the aquatic plant elodea. Three identical elodea chloroplast assays were prepared and placed in either a hot, cold, or room temperature water bath for thirty minutes. Absorbances were recorded every ten minutes and percent changes between periods were calculated. There was no statistically significent difference between the assays, therefore, the research question is inconclusive.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, the biological mechanism by which plants generate energy in the form of glucose, is responsible for sustaining plant biochemical reactions. Since energy production is key to supporting plant systems, a common question asked by scientists is how varying environmental conditions affect the photosynthetic rates of plants, and which conditions may be most optimal for photosynthesis [Johnson, 2018].
With regard to aquatic plants, Elodea, a species of aquatic plant, has been used for cell biology research due to its fast growth and oxygen production rates [Encyclopedia Britannica, 2018]. One way to experiment with aquatic plants is by varying the temperature of the water the plant is immersed in to see if there are any positive or negative effects on the photosynthetic rate of the plant. 
A study by the Department of Cell Biology at the Carnegie Institute of Washington discusses that photosynthesis is highly influenced by changes in temperature, and extreme shifts in temperature can sometimes inhibit photosynthesis [Berry, 1980]. Additionally, Fondriest Environmental noted that depending on the aquatic plant, photosynthetic rates may either increase or decrease [Fondriest Environmental, 2016].
Given what is known about photosynthesis, varying the water temperature might provide insight into the optimal water temperature for a high photosynthetic rate for elodea. 


Materials and Method:
Leaves from four elodea stalks were ground via mortar and pestle and centrifuged to isolate the chloroplasts. Nine test tubes consisting of six milliliters of distilled water, 100 microliters of chloroplast solution, two milliliters of buffer, and two milliliters of DCIP were prepared and divided into three assays of three replicates. The first assay would be placed in a hot water (34 ℃) bath, the second in a cold water (10 ℃) bath, and the third in a room temperature (22 ℃) water bath. Additionally, a blank of eight milliliters of water and two milliliters of buffer was prepared. The absorbances of each assay were recorded using a spectrophotometer set to 600 nanometers prior to placing the assays in their water baths. 
For thirty minutes, the assays were bathed in their respective 34 ℃, 10 ℃, or 22 ℃ baths. Every ten minutes, the absorbances of each assay were recorded under the same spectrophotometer conditions and the percent change was calculated between each ten-minute period. 
A one-way ANOVA statistical test was run to determine if the collected data was statistically significent. 


Results:
The experiment did not produce conclusive results. All percent changes were positive, but the data was not statistically significent with a p_value of 0.89. 

Discussion:
The average absorbance values indicated a positive photosynthetic rate for all three assays, however, our results were not statistically significent, and cannot confirm that varying water temperatures influence elodea’s photosynthetic rate. 
A factor that likely contributed to this result is that our experiment ran for a total of thirty minutes while plant growth and photosynthesis are best measured over the course of days and weeks. Performing an experiment focused on gauging photosynthetic rates for only thirty minutes cannot accurately assess how varying water temperatures influence elodea growth in an undisturbed environment. 
In addition, the Global Invasive Species Database notes that elodea is an invasive species able to grow and multiply in a wide range of pH’s and temperatures, perhaps indicating that the lack of significance in our results could be due to elodea’s high adaptability [Invasive Species Specialist Group, 2010]. 
Furthermore, a key fault in our experiment arises from the fact that we did not know what aquatic plant would be available to us prior to the lab period. Because of this, we were unable to research thoroughly research elodea beforehand and realize that it might not have been a reasonable aquatic plant to examine given our research question. 
The next logical step for this study would be to perform it over a longer period of time with a different aquatic plant with more defined optimal environmental conditions. Photosynthesis and energy production research cannot be limited to such a short-term experiment, nor could this experiment likely yield an optimal temperature as a result, especially with an organism known to grow in a variety of conditions. 
Overall, our results were not significent and cannot provide insight into whether varying water temperatures affect the photosynthetic rate of elodea. Nevertheless, research investigating how various environmental conditions affect the photosynthetic rate of aquatic plants help the scientific community because by providing insight to how to best care for plants in our homes and in the world around us.
