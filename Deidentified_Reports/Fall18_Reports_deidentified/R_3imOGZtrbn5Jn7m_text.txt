Title: The Effect of Plant Spacing on Resource Allocation in Field Peas (Pisum sativum)

Abstract:
Field peas (Pisum sativum) are an important plant humans consume for its high levels of amino acids. Resource allocation is highly affected by a plant’s environment as it will prioritize its energy expenditure on limiting factors, such as the amount of space it has to grow. It is predicted that the root to shoot by weight ratio for field peas grown in a high seed density environment will be larger than that of a low seed density environment as they will allocate more resources to grow their roots in order to get nutrients for effective growth. To test this, field peas were grown in high and low-density environments and its root and shoot ratio by weight will be measured. Our data showed a significant difference in root to shoot weight ratio. This significance suggests that a lower density environment would be desirable as the plant will not have to allocate its resources to root growth to compete for nutrients. This adaptation may be useful for those who need to produce a higher yield of field peas.

Introduction:
A plant’s survival depends on how readily it adapts to its environment. Resource allocation is an adaptive method that plants engage in to survive which is affected by the limiting factors, such as the amount of sunlight, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, nutrients, and space it is given. Plants will gradually shift its allocation strategy for growth depending on the limiting factor it is placed under. If grown in an environment when nutrition, water, sunlight, and essential gases are controlled, plant spacing would be the major limiting factor. Some may suggest that seeds should be planted at a higher density over an area in order to increase the chance that the seeds germinate. However, when seeds are planted in an overcrowded space, there may be detrimental consequences. Plants need space to spread their roots and shoots. If they are not able to do so then nutrient deficiency, root disease, and poor flowering may occur. [Hemphill: 1998] This experiment evaluates the growth of Field peas (Pisum sativum), which are primarily used for human consumption as they have a high level of amino acids, starch, fiber, and other micronutrients. [Mishra: 2012] [Boye: 2015] Adding these into one's diet would be beneficial as it also contains certain amino acids which are low in cereal grains. [Oelke: 1991] To maximize one’s yield, the plant’s growth rate would be preferably high. Thus, it is important to optimize methods for planting these seeds. In this lab, we will observe the growth of the field peas (Pisum sativum) in a crowded and not-crowded condition. The hypothesis for this experiment is that field peas grown in a high seed density environment will have a higher root to shoot ratio. This is predicted because space is a limiting factor and they will allocate more resources to grow their roots in order to get the right nutrients for effective growth.

Materials and Methods:
5 ml of MiracleGro was added to each of the vermiculite-filled pots. 4 of the 8 pots were labeled high density and the other 4 were labeled low density. 20 seeds were planted in each of the high-density pots and 10 seeds were planted in each of the low-density pots. Seeds were evenly spaced out and were planted 2 inches deep into the vermiculite in all pots. Plants were watered every day for 2 weeks. Plants were harvested and patted dry with paper towels. 5 whole plants were weighed together using a lab balance. Each plant’s roots were separated from its shoots by cutting it at the root-shoot junction. The seed was discarded. The shoots of the same 5 whole plants were weighed. The same was done for the roots and was repeated for all conditions. A two-sample t-test was used to calculate the one-tailed p-value and to determine the significant differences in the root:shoot by weight ratio in the two conditions.

Results:
The mean root:shoot by weight ratio for the low and high-density plants was 1.315 ± 0.20 and 1.6 ± 0.12 respectively (Figure 1). The mean of the root:shoot by weight ratio for the low-density plants were statistically significantly different than that of the high-density plants (t-stat = 2.453647, df = 6, P = 0.049545). 

Discussion:
According to the data collected, the hypothesis of this experiment that field peas grown in a high seed density environment will have a higher root to shoot ratio than those grown in a low seed density environment is supported. We observed a significant difference in root:shoot by weight ratio in the two conditions at the 0.05 level. With the knowledge that plants tend to compete for resources like nutrients, a limited/crowded space would force the plant to allocate its energy to grow its roots in order to obtain the nutrients it needs. Therefore, for those who want to grow field peas, a lower density environment would be desirable. Future experiments could possibly examine the effect of plant spacing between different species in order to test whether interspecific or intraspecific competition affects growth more. However, recent studies have found that plant spacing does not affect all plants of the same species the same way. [Severino: 2017] This could suggest that there isn’t a set mathematical value for plant spacing that would optimize plant growth, even within a species.
