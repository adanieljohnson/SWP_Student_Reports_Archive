Title: Difference In Absorbance Rates In Collards And Spinach As It Relates To Shade Of Green

Abstract:
Phenotypes of plants can have an important direct impact on a plant's rate of photosynthesis and can also be important predictors of how quickly they might do so. In this experiment our lab studied both spinach and collards. We hypothesized that because the collard’s leaves are much darker than the spinach leaves, they will have more chloroplasts, and therefore a greater reduction of DCIP (a higher rate of absorbance). This experiment tested the two groups enriched chloroplasts at room-level lighting and direct lighting at 10, 20, and 30 minutes Our results indicated only one statistically significent value which was our comparison of absorbance between collards and spinach under lamp light (p_value: 0.0166, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 3.97). All comparisons were found to be statistically insignificent. Our hypothesis that collards would have a higher rate of absorbance than spinach was proven to be largely incorrect. Basic principles of photosynthesis would lead us to believe that if our plants had a more stark contrast in color the experiment could have produced statistically significent results.

Introduction:
Plant species all have their own set of distinctive characteristics that drastically vary from plant to plant. Some may have thorns and thick membranes while others possess short hairs or large leaves. Of this wide number of traits that plants contain, there are many related to the energy harvesting system developed by plants: photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use light to synthesize foods from the surrounding carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in these plants often involves a pigment known as chlorophyll which is the green part of the plant. This process also generates oxygen as a byproduct (Johnson: 2016). Color or shade of green is a very visible trait among most plants and it is reasonable to assume that the shade of green might correlate to the amount of chloroplasts and therefore the level of light absorbance in any given plant (Kume: 2017). Spinach and collards are two plants with leaves that have varying shades of green. To conduct this experiment we measured absorbance values to determine and quantify the rate of electron transport in our two samples (spinach and collards). To do so we created pastes of chloroplasts using a mortar and pestle, centrifuged to obtain a chloroplast rich group, and then placed these samples under two distinct light conditions (room lighting and direct lighting). We used DCIP in a spectrophotometer as a measure for our plant’s different absorbance. DCIP was used because it changes color from dark blue to more faded in our samples as more and more electrons were absorbed from the chloroplast samples. We compared both spinach and collards at room-level lighting and direct lighting and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes and we recorded each group’s absorbances. We hypothesized that because the collard’s leaves are much darker than the spinach leaves, they will have more chloroplasts, and therefore a greater or quicker reduction of DCIP (a higher rate of absorbance).

Materials and Method:
First the group created two pastes for both species of plants so that we could then perform centrifugation to enrich chloroplasts of both plants. We did this by grinding up approximately four leaves from both spinach and collards (removing any major veins) in a mortar and pestle mixed with 10Ml of chilled grinding buffer. The lab group added 10Ml at the beginning of crushing and 10Ml during the last phase of crushing then we transfered our paste into a 50Ml centrifugation tube. The first centrifugation was spun at 200 x G for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. The second centrifugation was at 1000 x G for ten minutes at four degrees Celsius, and this is what produced our enriched chloroplast sample which was the pellet formed at the bottom of the 50Ml tube. Using these enriched chloroplast samples for both species, we set up an assay of reactions to test their absorbance levels. We set up twelve tubes, and each tube contained part of our chloroplast sample (100Ul), DCIP, water, and a reaction buffer. We tested the two groups at room-level lighting and direct lighting at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Absorbance levels were measured using a spectrophotometer set at 600nm and each of the four groups contained 3 replicates. A two-tailed t_test was used on our 30-minute data (data at the conclusion of the experiment) to statistically analyze our data.

Results:
Our results indicated only one statistically significent value which was our comparison of absorbance between collards and spinach under lamp light (p_value: 0.0166, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 3.97). All comparisons were found to be statistically insignificent. Spinach and collards at room level lighting had too high of a p_value (p_value: 0.390, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 0.962). Spinach under room and lamp lighting was found less insignificent, but still with too high of a p_value (p_value: 0.0572, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 2.65). Finally, collards under room and lamp lighting was found statistically insignificent (p_value: 0.209, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 1.50). Figure 1 shows the absorbance as measured using DCIP over time at increments of 10 minutes. Spinach under room-level lighting had an average absorbance value of 0.380 while the spinach under direct lighting had an average absorbance value of 0.3275. Collards also had similar absorbance values with the collard sample under room-level lighting having an absorbance value of 0.390 and the collard sample under direct lighting having an average absorbance value of 0.373. The greatest deficit between any of these four absorbance values is 0.0625 between directly lit spinach and room-level collards. Figure 1 also shows how rapidly the spinach under direct lighting dropped in its absorbance rate compared to the other three groups.

Discussion:
Photosynthesis is a powerful tool for plants to use and many physical aspects about a particular plant can have a strong impact on its rate of photosynthesis. The background information looked at in this experiment suggested specifically that plants of a darker green would have a more prevalent rate of photosynthesis. The hypothesis  established in this experiment that collards would have a higher rate of absorbance than spinach because of this color difference was proven to be largely incorrect. The trends of our data show that only one group visually sticks out when compared to the others which is spinach under direct lamp lighting, but when we look at the overall trends from the other three groups we see less variation because they all have a very similar pattern of decreasing roughly 0.3 absorbance for each 10 minute interval. Figure 2 is a photo of the pastes created for this experiment and it is more clear that they were actually not too different in their shade of green. We found there was a significent difference between the rates of absorbance of spinach and collards under direct lamp light (p_value: 0.0166, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 3.97), but all other categories showed no significance. One possible source of error is when the lab group conducted research before the experiment, we examined online photos of collards and spinach to compare the colors of their leaves. In these photos the color difference appeared to be much starker than when we obtained these plants on lab day. The actual difference in color was miniscule when we finally saw our plants with our own eyes. It is possible that if sample plants had been hand selected based on how they appeared outside of a digital setting, then the experiment might have produced more statistically significent results. Plant phenotypes can and do have a major impact on how they obtain light energy through photosynthesis (Sarlikioti: 2011). Our expectation is still that plant color can be a major predictor on how quickly light is absorbed in the chloroplasts of leaves.

Figure 2: A photo of our pastes that exemplifies the less-than-stark color contrast between the two greens. It is likely because these two did not differ much in color that our experiment showed few statistically significent results.*************************************************************************
