Title: The Characterization of Root : Shoot Ratio of Vigna radiata in Differing Light Conditions

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to compare root to shoot ratios in shady conditions versus full sunlight conditions of Vigna radiata. It is hypothesized that plants in direct sunlight will have a larger root : shoot (R:S) ratio than the plants in the shady condition. R:S is a useful number in determining energy allocation within plants. The more energy allocated to a specific part of a plant, the larger it will be. After watering Vigna radiata for two weeks, the root : shoot ratios were determined for both height and weight of root/shoots. The average R:S of sunlight and shade were compared. It is concluded that the R:S ratios of Vigna radiata in direct sunlight are larger than R:S ratios in shade. This is due to the fact that change in lighting conditions affects photosynthesis which plays a large role in energy allocation within a plant.

Introduction:
Plants adapt according to biotic and abiotic factors. Adaptation occurs due to resource limitations acting as a directionally selective force. Plant leaves and stems (shoots) are the location that source carbon compounds derived from photosynthesis while the roots, below ground, take up water and other essential nutrients including Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Calcium, among others. The biochemical systems responsible for root : shoot ratio are photosynthetic and nitrogen rates within the plant [Agren: 1987]. In this experiment, mung beans (Vigna radiata) are used. The independent variables are the amount of water and soil conditions, while the dependent variable is the amount of sunlight the plant receives based off of its location: shady or sunny. It is expected that the plants in the sun will have a larger root : shoot ratio, than the plants in the shade. That is to say, the plants in the sun will have larger roots and smaller shoots. This is due to the fact that more sunlight will mean less need for large leaves above ground for photosynthesis since they will not need as large of a surface area due to the direct, high, intensity of sunlight. In turn, more resources for these plants will be allocated to the roots, as soil will dry faster, creating larger roots to dig deeper for the water and soil nutrients.

Materials and Method:
A large amount of mung bean (Vigna radiata) were soaked in water for twenty-four hours. Four pots about 6”x6” were obtained. The pots were filled to the top with vermiculite. They were pre-watered, and six holes were poked into the soil of each pot. Two mung bean seeds were put into each hole. Next, 50 Ml of miracle grow was poured into each pot. The pots were labeled with (Team name, TA name and Lab Section). The pots were taken to the greenhouse and two plants labeled “sun” were put in a direct sunlight location, while the two plants labeled “shady” were put in a shaded webbed cage. For the next two weeks, each pot was watered with 100Ml of water daily. After the two weeks were over, the plants were brought back into the laboratory, rinsed off from soil and six plants from each pot were taken out. They were cut at the point where the stem went from red to green and the weight and length of each segment was measured and recorded. The R:S values were calculated, and a two-step t-value test was used to determine p_values. Overall, the R:S average values of weight and length in the shady setting were compared to the R:S average values of weight and length in the sunny setting.

Results:
Overall, the plants in the sunny conditions appeared to have smaller leaf/stem structures and larger root structure than the plants in the shady conditions. There was no alteration in color between the two groupings. The R:S ratios matched this observation. As seen in Graph 1. The average R:S ratio of weight for plants in the sun was 0.931+/-0.162, while the average R:S ratio of weight for plants in the shade was 0.744+/-0.141. The average R:S ratio of height for plants in the sun was 1.33+/-0.386 while the average R:S ratio of height for plants in the shade was 0.856+/-0.232. The mean R:S ratio of weight is slightly less statistically significent (t stat = 3.028, d.f. = 22, P = 0.006174) than the mean R:S ratio of height (t stat = 3.61, d.f. = 22, P = 0.00156).

Discussion:
The results of this lab support the hypothesis. The summarized data in Graph 1. shows that the R : S ratio is larger in sunny conditions in terms of both height and weight. This means that roots are larger, and shoots are smaller on average in sunny conditions than in shady conditions. More energy is allocated to root production in sunlight because it is easier to get sunlight for photosynthesis in direct sunlight. Since it is easier to get sunlight due to the higher intensity, less surface area of leaves and stems are necessary creating smaller shoots. Meanwhile, it is harder to get water from the soil in sunlight as it dries quickly, meaning roots must extend deeper into the soil. This is further supported by previous studies of R:S ratio. The R:S ratio has been found to be a linear regression depending on nitrogen concentration which is dependent on photosynthetic rates [Agren: 1987]. Additionally, the p_values for both weight and length are acceptably, under 0.05 meaning that it can be said with confidence that these R:S ratios are significent and are clearly due to the factors of sunlight or lack thereof. Overall, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternate hypothesis is supported.
