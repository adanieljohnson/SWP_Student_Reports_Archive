Title: Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition on Life Cycle of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to determine the effect of 20E inhibition in Manduca sexta, the tobacco hornworm.  The tobacco hornworm is considered the “white rat” of insect studies, and therefore extensive research has been done on it and its hormone cycle.  Within the hormone cycle, there there exists a hormone called Ecdysterone (20E) that controlls the timing of molting during development. The expected outcomes from this experiment are that 20E inhibition in Manduca sexta will prevent pupation into an adult, and that the average change in larvae weight of the 20E inhibited caterpillars would be smaller than that of the untreated caterpillars.  Our results showed that 20E inhibition did prevent pupation and significently decreased the average change in larvae weight over 15 days.  These results supported our hypothesis.  From this experiment we concluded that 20E inhibition prevents pupation and decreases the average change in weight of developing larvae, and it accomplishes this by interrupting the ratio of 20E and JH, which affects development of Manduca sexta, and inhibiting the commitment pulse, which prevents pupation.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a common pest of tobacco plants, tomato plants, pepper plants, eggplants, and various other weeds, hence their common name the “tobacco hornworm.”  The life cycle of a tobacco hornworm consists of eight different developmental stages starting at the egg and ending at the adult moth.  The tobacco hornworm, after it develops from an egg, progresses through five instar larvae stages.  At the 5th instar larvae stage, it then undergoes the process of pupation for around 19-23 days.  The resulting organism is an adult Manduca sexta.  In its entirety, the process under normal conditions of 26 °C takes between 39 and 48 days [Johnson: 2018].
One essential part of the development of Manduca sexta is the cycle of hormones that occurs during different parts of development.  Two essential hormones in the development of Manduca sexta are Juvenile Hormone (JH), which regulates, among other adult factors, the type of molt during development, and Ecdysterone (20E), which, among other adult factors, regulates the timing of molting during development [Johnson: 2018].  Manduca sexta is also known as the “‘white rat’ of insect endocrinology,” so much is known about its hormone cycle [Weeks: 2003].
It is known that the ratio of these two hormones affects development in Manduca sexta.  During its regular life cycle as a larva, JH remains relatively high, what follows is a small drop in JH and a temporary rise in 20E around the 4th instar larvae stage.  This is then followed by a significent drop in JH during the 5th instar larvae stage, and then a second, smaller rise in 20E in the absence of JH called the commitment pulse, which triggers pupation.  This commitment pulse is significent because it is the first instance in the life cycle of Manduca sexta that the concentration of JH is low while the concentration of 20E is higher [Johnson: 2018]. Because is is the ratio of these hormones that controlls development, it is often questioned how changes in this ratio also affect the development of Manduca sexta.  For example, it has been found that when JH levels are raised during development, growth of larvae is promoted, resulting in larger larvae, however, these larvae do not undergo pupation. [Riddiford: 2003].  This response is based on the changing ratio of hormone levels in Manduca sexta. When looking directly at the effect of levels of 20E in Manduca sexta during development and pupation, it has been found that infusion of β-20E in the presence of JH into Manduca sexta during the 5th instar larvae inhibits pupation [Nijhout: 1976].  Armed with the knowledge of the behavior of JH and 20E at different levels and how they affect the development of Manduca sexta, we sought out to fill in one missing piece and discover the effects that the absence of 20E would have on development and pupation of Manduca sexta.  The purpose of this experiment is to see the effects that 20E inhibition produce on a developing and pupating Manduca sexta.  To do this we used the 20E inhibitor Azaguard, which mimics the loss of 20E in Manduca sexta.  Our hypothesis for this experiment is that inhibiting 20E in Manduca sexta will prevent caterpillars from undergoing pupation, and that the average change in larvae weight of the 20E inhibited caterpillars would be smaller than that of the untreated caterpillars.

Materials and Method:
First, we gathered two plastic boxes, each with 4 segments.  We then poked two holes in each segment.  Next, we weighed out 80g of food and divided it into eight, 10g sections which we then placed in each of the eight plastic segments of the boxes.  Next, we administered 10 drops from a handheld plastic squeeze pipette of either deionized water or a 1: 1250 diluted Azaguard solution to the food and massaged the food until the liquid was completely dispersed throughout.  We then compacted the food into a corner of the plastic segment to minimize moisture loss and to leave room for the caterpillar to grow.  Next, we placed 4 Manduca sexta larvae in the box treated with 1: 1250 Azaguard, with each larva going in its own segment of the 4-segment plastic box and labeling each segment 1-4.  We did this again with the controll group receiving water, labeling each segment 5-8, resulting in a total of 8 Manduca sexta larvae participating in the experiment.  We replaced the food regularly when it had dried out using the same process as described above.  Below is a summary of the two groups: 
We then placed both groups in an incubator, and recorded daily their length and mass.
	After 14 days of data collection, we then decided to statically compare the masses of the caterpillars, rather than their lengths, because the masses were more accurate due to the fact that the larvae would not always remain still for length measurement, which created extra error in our data collection.  After data collection, we then determined the maximum change in weight that each of the eight larvae experienced.  If the final weight of the larvae was the highest value, and the initial weight was the lowest value, we subtracted the initial weight from final weight to determine the change in weight.  However, if the final weight was not the highest value, we chose the highest value to serve as the maximum weight in the calculations.  Additionally, if the weight did not change, we stated the change in weight as zero.  We then ran a one-tailed, 2-sample t_test on the change in weight for the treatment group and the controll group to determine if the difference between the groups was significent.  Lastly, we also calculated the standard deviation of each data set in the t_test to determine the range of error in both the treatment and controll groups.

Results:
For the first three days of the experiment, the treatment and controll groups remained on relatively the same trend (Fig. 1).  However, beginning on day 4, the controll group began increasing at a rapid rate, reaching a maximum on day 8, while the treatment group maintained a relatively constant weight for the entire experiment (Fig. 1). However, in the controll group, one of the four caterpillars died during the experiment, and its weight generally followed the treatment group trend until its death on day 7 (Fig. 1).
The mean change in weight for the controll group was 6.2875g, and for the treatment group was .565g (Table 3).  The standard deviation for the data in the controll group is 4.265g, and in the treatment group is 0.377g (Fig. 2).  Our t_test determined that the difference between the mean change in weight between the controll and treatment group was significent with a p_value of .0184 (Fig. 2).

Discussion:
Overall, our results that we collected did in fact support our original hypothesis.  Determined by our collected data, the average change in weight of the caterpillars in the treatment group was significently smaller than in the controll group (Table 3).  This supports our hypothesis which stated that by inhibiting 20E, we will decrease the average change in larvae weight during development.  Additionally, none of the surviving caterpillars in the treatment group underwent pupation, however, all of the surviving caterpillars in the controll group underwent pupation by the 15-day mark (Table 2).  This supports the second part of our hypothesis, which states that inhibiting 20E will prevent pupation in Manduca sexta. 
Inhibiting 20E decreased larvae size because it disrupted the ratio of JH and 20E, affecting the development of Manduca sexta through its five instar larvae stages.  Because of this disruption, the Manduca sexta was not able to develop properly, and therefore was smaller than its controll counterpart.  The absence of 20E also prohibited pupation because in the absence of 20E, there was no commitment pulse, and therefore no trigger to begin preparing for pupation.  This result and the support of our hypothesis that it gives us ties into the knowledge of the greater hormone cycle of the Manduca sexta.  Along with the research of Nijhout and others, we now know that when there is an increase or decrease of 20E to above or below the standard value, pupation of Manduca sexta is inhibited [Nijhout: 1976].  Both of these outcomes are most likely due to the fact that the level of 20E during the commitment pulse is very sensitive and specific.  When the level of 20E is not balanced during the commitment pulse, pupation does not occur.  Our conclusion is also supported by the study performed in 1981 by Walter E. Bollenbacher.  This study, which looked at the amount of ecdysteroid present in the entire life cycle of Manduca sexta, concludes that there are acute rises and falls in ecdysteroid concentration that regulate various developmental processes.  Additionally, the changes in the amount of ecdysteroid must be precise in order for the Manduca sexta to develop properly [Bollenbacher: 1981].  These findings support our conclusion that it is the sensitive nature of Manduca sexta development to the concentration of certain hormones that cause development to be affected when given a 20E inhibitor, therefore upsetting the careful balance needed for development.  
Additionally, there is some possible error involved, which can be seen in Figure 1, where the weight of the caterpillars in the controll group after day 8 largely decreased and then plateaued until day 15.  This is most likely due to one of two factors.  The first factor is that the caterpillars around this time underwent pupation, so the weight could have plateaued due to that factor.  However, this doesn't explain the drop in weight.  The other factor was the arrival of Hurricane Florence.  Because the hurricane prevented our group from coming into lab to feed the caterpillars, we gave them a double dose of food and left them for three days.  When we returned, quite a lot of food was missing, therefore, the drop in weight could have been caused by the lack of food during days 9-12.  This explanation also seems more accurate because the drop in weight was first recorded on the day we arrived after the hurricane.
The next step for this experiment would most logically be to repeat it using the same method, however, this time adding more technical replicates.  One suggestion could be using 7 or 10 larvae per group.  The reason for this is to create a larger sample size in case caterpillars die.  Because two of our four caterpillars in our controll group died, the values and statistics are not as accurate because we do not have all of the true data that we would have had if all four had lived until the end of the experiment.  If we increase the sample size, the more data points would make the results stronger even if caterpillars die during the second experiment.
Overall, this experiment and its results contribute to a larger understanding of the hormone cycle of Manduca sexta.  Although there have been countless studies done on Manduca sexta, there is always more to discover, and therefore more experiments to run.  From this experiment involving 20E inhibition, one could derive countless others to help broaden the overall picture of the Manduca hormone cycle.
