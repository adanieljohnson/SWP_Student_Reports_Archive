Title: Aggression in Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. In this lab, the aggressiveness of Betta splendens in response to a stimuli was observed. It was hypothesized that one color fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in response to a stimuli than the other. Six Betta splendens were procured, three red ones and three blue ones. A tank filled with water was separated into three sections: on one side there was a red betta, in the middle was a red and blue plastic betta to serve as a stimuli, and on the third section there was a blue betta. Each broadside and facing movement was assigned a score from 1-3 based on level of aggression, pelvic fin flicking and erect pectoral fins were = 1, tail beating and spreading of opercula were = 2, and tail thrashing and display of branchiostegal membrane were = 3. It was found that the p-values between the two groups was not significant (t-stat = 0.983, df = 24, p-value = 0.168), therefore our hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection [Johnson: 2018]. Behaviors are discerned by the organism’s genetics, physiological, and learned actions, and not by human interpretation. Patient observation, coupled with research on the behavior and evolution of the organism in question allows for the collection of data, the recognition of repeated patterns, the development of questions and hypotheses, and ways to test this hypothesis. In this lab, Betta splendens was the organism observed. Bettas express colorful displays in the presence of other members of their species, called intraspecific behaviors, and are separated into two main types of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail thrashing, in level of increasing aggressiveness. Erect pectoral fins, spreading of opercula, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane comprise facing movements, in order of increasing aggressiveness. In response to these movements, observing bettas may ignore them, flee, behave in a way to show submission, or escalate by showing another movement, whereupon the first betta must decide to perform one of the aforementioned behaviors. In this lab, we tested two colors of betta, red and blue, to see if there were a difference in response to a stimulus. I hypothesized that one color fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in response to a stimuli than the other.

Materials and Methods:
Six Betta splendens were procured, three red ones and three blue ones. A tank filled with water was separated into three sections: on one side there was a red betta, in the middle was a red and blue plastic betta to serve as a stimuli, and on the third section there was a blue betta. Each broadside and facing movement was assigned a score from 1-3 based on level of aggression, pelvic fin flicking and erect pectoral fins were = 1, tail beating and spreading of opercula were = 2, and tail thrashing and display of branchiostegal membrane were = 3. Each individual fish was tested during a 5 minute period for displays of aggression two times, with 5 minutes of rest in between each trial. A total of 12 trials were run, two for each fish. During the resting period for one color fish, the test was run for the different color fish on the opposite side of the tank. During each test, the level of aggression and the number of times this behavior was displayed was recorded. After all tests were run, the trial for each fish that evoked the highest level of aggressiveness was counted, leaving 6 trials to be analyzed using Microsoft excel. Data was analyzed using an unpaired, two-sample t-test.


Results:
After we performed the unpaired, two-sample t-test, it was found that the value was found to be not significant (t-stat = 0.983, df = 24, p-value = 0.168).


Discussion:
From Figure 1 it can be seen that the red betta group had a wider range of aggression values than the blue betta. This suggests that the red betta fish is more aggressive than the blue betta. We observed that our fishes, both red and blue, spent more time swimming around the tank with no aggressive behavior shown. This is similar to a study that found that bettas, regardless of color, showed no "qualitative differences" in aggressive reaction to stimuli [Amiri: 2012]. However, because the value of the t-test was not statistically significant, it is not possible to say that our statistical hypothesis was supported. Therefore, our biological hypothesis was likely not supported.
