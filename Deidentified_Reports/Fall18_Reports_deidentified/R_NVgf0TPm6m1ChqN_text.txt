Title: Use of Tubocurarine as an inhibitor for Acetocholine binding in the post synaptic cleft to limit muscle twitch response in frog legs

Abstract:
The objective of this research was to determine what the result of inserting tubocurarine into a frog leg would be, in terms of muscular response. Tubocurarine has been previously shown to act as an inhibitor on acetocholine ligand gated channels. In order to test this, we obtained three different frogs, recorded the effect of applying an electrical stimulus to the frog leg. We then injected the leg with Tubocurarine and repeated the stimulus and recorded the responses and differences before and after. We determined that the tubocurarine had a significant effect on the response observed, in the frog leg, from the stimulus that we applied. We were able to conclude that tubocurarine had a significant effect on the frog leg’s reaction to a stimulus, as it acted in blocking the acetocholine ligand gated channels, resulting in a limited reaction in the frog leg after the applied stimulus. 

Introduction:
Many organisms contain motor neurons. Motor neurons are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord [Johnson: 2016]. Axons from the motor neurons reach into the muscles to points called neuromuscular junctions [Sadava: 2016]. At these regions the message to stimulate the contraction of a muscle is passed through action potentials. When the action potential reaches a synapse the potential triggers the release of sodium ions which depolarizes the pre-synaptic membrane [ Sadava: 2016]. This depolarization triggers the release of calcium ions into the pre-synaptic terminal. The calcium ions cause the vesicles containing the neurotransmitters, in this case acetocholine, to bind to the presynaptic membrane. This binding releases the acetocholine across the synaptic cleft. At this point the acetocholine binds to the receptors on the post synaptic membrane. This binding of the ligand gated channels causes them to open, allowing sodium ions to depolarize the membrane and the action potential carries out through the rest of the neuron. Acetocholinesterase then breaks the acetocholine off of the receptors and the acetocholine is then returned to the presynaptic terminal where ecdysone regenerates the vesicles which take up the recycled acetocholine [Johnson: 2014]. Tubocurarine acts as an inhibitor to acetocholine by blocking the binding site for acetocholine and its ligand gated receptor [Starke: 1989]. By introducing tubocurarine into the synaptic cleft it is possible to limit the amount of muscular response because the acetocholine, which is needed to trigger the action potential that leads to the muscular response, cannot activate the necessary channels. We elected to observe frog legs in this experiment because frog legs have, proportionally, a very large gastrocnemius. By preforming different experiments on the frog’s gastrocnemius, we can record data very well and very easily. Taking into consideration the likely effects of the Tubocurarine and what it has been shown to do, we hypothesize that if we inject Tubocurarine into the muscle of a frog leg, that we will see a decrease in muscular contraction seen in a decrease in amplitude of the voltage generated by the response.

Materials and Methods:
We obtained three frog legs. We then took the skin off of the legs, separated the gastrocnemius from the bone of the frog and separated the sciatic nerve from the muscle surrounding it. We then took our first frog and tied the gastrocnemius with string and raised the gastrocnemius so that it was perpendicular to the table and thus the rest of the frog leg. We the injected the electrodes used to apply the stimulus directly into the muscle. We then applied four different stimuli of .75 volts and recorded the amplitudes. We then injected the frog’s muscle with tubocurarine using a syringe. At this point it was essential to move the two other frog legs away from the leg being tested to ensure that no tubocurarine contaminated the control readings. We then applied the tubocurarine injected, frog leg with .75 volts and again recorded the amplitude. We repeated these steps for the subsequent two frog legs. At this point we took the average of our four tests for each leg, control and experimental, and applied a paired one tail t-test analysis on the data. 

Results:
Our results show that there is a decrease in the recorded amplitude between the control and experimental procedures. There is an oddity in the third and final frog leg, where we see an already lowered starting amplitude and then an even lower experimental amplitude. In looking at the data and figure one, the control frogs all output a higher amplitude than the experimental, however the amount that the control and experimental differ by changes each trial. The average the average of the group after the injection of Tubocurarine was significantly smaller than its mean before the injection (t-stat = 4.53, df = 2, P = 0.0456). 

Discussion:
Our lab was statistically conclusive enough to determine that we supported our hypothesis, adding the tubocurarine to the frog leg decreases the muscular response we observed. I am confident that we had a source of error in the third frog leg and that that error came from the fact that we did not properly apply frog ringer to the leg while it sat, waiting to be tested. This undoubtedly messed up our data and if we were to perform this test again, we would be sure to apply frog ringer consistently to the leg to be sure that there was still ATP in the leg to be used for the muscular twitch response. We see that the injection of tubocurarine leads to a decrease in muscular response. The reason that we observe this phenomenon is that tubocurarine acts as an acetocholine ligand gated channel inhibitor [Starke: 1989]. Because the tubocurarine comes into the post synaptic cleft and binds to the ligand gated channel where acetocholine would normally bind there is a decrease in the observed response seen in the muscle contrition because the proper amount of acetocholine cannot bind to the ligand gated channel responsible for opening the channels to allow ions to flow through to allow the action potential to enter into the T-tubule, resulting in the proper amount of muscular contraction [Sadava: 2016].  We have shown that injecting tubocurarine into the frog leg causes a decrease in muscular response. Our results support the previously conclusion that tubocurarine acting as an inhibitor binding on the ligand gated ion channel that acetocholine is meant to bind to hinders the ability for the synapse to trigger the action potential to flow throughout the neuron leaving the post synaptic terminal. This is important data because understanding how this process is restricted can help us to understand health issues like snake bites, where the snake venom acts in the same way that tubocurarine does and causes muscles to lock up and sends the victim into paralysis. [St. Pierre: 2007]. In order to generate further conclusions on how the neuromuscular synapses, we need to perform more experiments and gain a greater understanding of how the synapses function in order to come to conclusions about the effects and results of medical and health issues, as well as general bodily functions, that are affected by the neuromuscular synapses and action potentials flowing through them.
