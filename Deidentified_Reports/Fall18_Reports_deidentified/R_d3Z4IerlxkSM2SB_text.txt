Title: Effect of calcium antagonist lanthanum chloride on the growth of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold, can identify molecules in its surrounding environment and as a result, either move away or towards the source. To sense environmental cues, Physarum uses intracellular signal transduction pathways. The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effect of blocking calcium from entering Ca²⁺ channels in the IP3-mediated pathway on Physarum’s chemotactic movement, particularly the motility of the cytoplasm. Lanthanum chloride was used as the calcium antagonist. It was hypothesized that blocking calcium from entering the cytoplasm via the Ca²⁺ channels in the IP3-mediated pathway would inhibit the growth of Physarum toward the oatmeal food source. However, after measuring the distance moved after a 24-hour time period, no accurate conclusions could be drawn regarding the effect of lanthanum chloride on the behavior of Physarum. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime mold usually found in a multicellular plasmodial stage as a yellow mass up to 30 cm in diameter, as long as its environment reflects dark and damp conditions. However, if food becomes unavailable or the humidity decreases, the plasmodium hardens and develops into a resting stage known as sclerotium until food becomes available again. As a whole, Physarum can recognize molecules, such as food sources, in its surrounding environment and subsequently move either away or towards the sources. Instead of using hormones or nerves to sense environmental cues, Physarum uses intracellular signal transduction pathways, including G-protein coupled receptors, such as the IP3-mediated pathway in which the effector enzyme phospholipase C cleaves a membrane phospholipid to generate the second messengers, IP3 and diacylglycerol. IP3 then binds to receptors on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, a calcium reservoir, which in turn releases Ca²⁺ to bind to proteins that can activate or prevent activity [Johnson: 2018]. After sensing environmental cues, Physarum subsequently moves via cytoplasmic streaming, a process in which the endoplasm moves back and forth due to actin and myosin interactions in the plasmodial tubes [Terry: 2009]. Specifically, this experiment aims to evaluate whether lanthanum chloride, a chemical that blocks calcium in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum from binding to calcium regulated proteins via the IP3-mediated pathway, affects an organism’s chemotactic motive forces. Physarum will be used to test the effect of blocking calcium on an organism’s chemotactic motive forces. Lanthanum chloride has been shown in several studies to be a calcium channel antagonist by preventing calcium influx into various cells. For example, one study determined that lanthanum chloride can prevent calcium from entering parathyroid cells [Lopez: 2010]. The goal of this experiment is to measure and analyze the chemotaxis behavior of the plasmodial stage of Physarum in the presence and absence of the lanthanum chloride, which will be accomplished by measuring the distance Physarum travels in a 24-hour time period using a ruler. We predict that blocking calcium from entering the cytoplasm via the Ca²⁺ channels in the IP3-mediated pathway will inhibit the growth of Physarum toward the oatmeal food source, a positive stimulus. Thus, there would be a significant difference in the distances traveled by Physarum in the presence versus the absence of lanthanum chloride. 

Materials and Methods:
Six, 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water were obtained. Three plates were labeled as the control group. The other three plates were labeled as the experimental group and covered with a diluted solution of lanthanum chloride. The 20X stock solution of lanthanum chloride was diluted to 1X by adding 1 mL of lanthanum chloride to 19 mL of water. Flat-tipped forceps and a metal spatula were placed in beaker of 95% ethanol for sterilization. A 1 cm x 1 cm square was removed from the center of each plate in the control and experimental group using the spatula and forceps, which were sterilized in between each square removal. Then, six 1 cm x 1 cm squares were removed from the Physarum stock plate and placed into the holes in the control and experimental plates. Five oatmeal flakes were tapped onto the surface of each plate. Next, the lids of the plates were taped down with two pieces of clear tape. The plates were subsequently wrapped in aluminum foil, placed in a black bag, and stored in an incubator set at 25 degrees Celsius. After 24 hours, the distance Physarum traveled for all six plates was recorded using a millimeter ruler. For statistical analysis, a two-sample t-test was employed to compare the control group, Physarum without lanthanum chloride, to the experimental group, Physarum with lanthanum chloride, analyzing whether the introduction of a calcium antagonist had an effect on the behavior of the organism. 

Results:
While movement of Physarum towards or away from the food source was anticipated, it was not subsequently observed, as our results were inconclusive. If the experiment had gone as planned, for the control group we expected to see clear movement towards the oatmeal food source after a 24-hour period. For the experimental group, we expected to see little movement towards the food source after a 24-hour period.  

Discussion:
IP3-mediated pathways are intracellular signal transduction pathways that play an instrumental role in Physarum’s behavior. Our prediction was that blocking calcium from entering the cytoplasm via the Ca2+ channels in the IP3-mediated pathway would affect cytoplasmic movement and thus inhibit the growth of Physarum toward the oatmeal, a positive stimulus. We hypothesized that lanthanum chloride would inhibit the growth of Physarum toward the oatmeal food source. However, our results were inconclusive due primarily to a lack of Physarum growth. 

In reflecting on this experiment, there is room for improvement. An alternative biological explanation is that environmental factors, such as light, temperature, and humidity, played a role in the growth of Physarum. The change in light source and temperature as the plates were moved in and out of the incubator most likely caused Physarum to begin sporulation as a part of its reproductive cycle. While Physarum is usually found in dark and damp environmental conditions as a multicellular plasmodial stage, Physarum undergoes differentiation, also known as sporulation, in response to the introduction of stressors, such as light. In this process, Physarum, in its usual multicellular plasmodium state, breaks apart into smaller pieces known as sporangia that then produce spore capsules. Within these spore capsules, cells go through meiosis, a form of cell division, to create spores, which are haploid gametes [Johnson: 2018]. One study examined the photoreceptor pigment that induces differentiation in Physarum and concluded that light activation is indeed needed to induce sporulation [Wormington and Weaver: 1976]. Therefore, upon exposure to light during the conduction of the experiment in the lab as well as in the illuminated incubator, Physarum could have entered the process of sporulation, an irreversible process in which it essentially fragments and forms resting spores, or dormant forms; hence, Physarum’s chemotactic motive functions would have been compromised [Johnson: 2018]. Furthermore, another study determined that heating, even for only ten minutes, lowers the rate of cytoplasmic streaming and leaks cytoplasmic pigments; therefore, the exposure of Physarum to a warmer environment in the lab room versus the cold atmosphere of the incubator could have resulted in the decrease of cytoplasmic movement [Arndt and Bernstam: 1973]. Another alternative explanation is that there could have been a decrease in humidity as the plates were transferred in and out of the incubator, causing Physarum in its plasmodium state to harden and form sclerotium, entering its resting or hibernation phase, in which its chemotactic motive functions would have also been compromised [Johnson: 2018]. 

In reviewing the hypothesis and results of this experiment, a stronger prediction would have included the specificity of the environmental conditions in which the plates were left to incubate versus those in which the experiment was conducted. Looking towards the future, the next logical steps for this study would be to modify the procedure and repeat the experiment. Specifically, a modified procedure would use stock plates with extensive Physarum growth to ensure there is enough of the organism to begin with. Overall, no accurate conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of lanthanum chloride on Physarum’s behavior. However, the conclusions drawn generate questions regarding the effect of other environmental factors on Physarum growth, including availability of food sources, that could be tested in future studies.
