Title: The Introduction of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Antagonist Causes a Decrease in Strength of Direct Responses in Frog Legs

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to introduce a nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist to a frog leg and record how it affects its direct response when stimulated. The contraction process begins when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, releasing acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh ultimately leads to the release of Ca2+, activating the muscle fiber and causing a contraction. My group hypothesizes that if nicotinic ACh antagonist is introduced to a frog leg, then there will be a decrease in the strength of direct responses. We recorded the direct response of frog legs with and without the nicotinic ACh antagonist and compared the results. The difference between the unaltered frog leg and the frog leg introduced to the nicotinic ACh antagonist was significantly positive in all three frog legs (paired t-test: 6.911945, p-value: 3.985E-8). The average difference of the direct responses between the control and the experimental in the first frog leg was 0.186, the second leg had an average difference of 0.175, and the third leg had an average difference of 0.149. Given the results, our hypothesis was supported and one can infer that the introduction of a nicotinic ACh antagonist to a frog leg causes a decrease in the strength of direct responses.

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons. Axons (where impulses are conducted) of motor neurons extend into a muscle then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers (single muscle cells), at points called neuromuscular junctions. The neuromuscular junction amplifies the currents from an action potential to trigger an action potential in a large muscle fiber and produce a direct response [Engel: 1994]. It all begins when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, causing the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber to open sodium channels. The opening of these channels generates an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential in the muscle spreads throughout the length of the fiber and stimulates the release of Ca2+. The Ca2+ activates the muscle fiber and causes it to constrict by shortening the muscle fiber. The purpose of this lab is to isolate the gastrocnemius muscle from a frog leg to observe some basic properties of neuromuscular control. How would a nicotinic ACh antagonist, or inhibitor, affect the muscle contraction observed in a frog’s leg? My group hypothesizes that if nicotinic ACh antagonist is introduced to a frog leg, then there will be a decrease in the strength of direct responses when stimulated.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were observed. We began by skinning the frog leg and isolating the gastrocnemius muscle from each frog leg by using a probe to gently separate the muscle from the leg. The muscle was attached to a stand to observe any visible muscle contractions. Without altering the muscle, a force transducer was attached and it conducted stimulus of different amounts of voltages on the frog leg. The direct responses, in volts, were recorded. The nicotinic ACh antagonist was then injected into the gastrocnemius muscle and sat for five minutes to be absorbed. The force transducer was attached once more and the same stimuli was applied to the frog leg. After recording the direct responses, the entire process is repeated with the remaining frog legs. The frog legs were kept moist throughout the experiment with Ringer’s solution. The differences between the direct responses were found and graphed for each frog leg to analyze and compare the results. Paired t-test and one-tailed p value are calculated.

Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable pattern seen between the differences of all three frog legs. The difference between the unaltered frog leg, that served as a part of the control group, and the frog leg introduced to the ACh antagonist, part of the experimental group, was significantly positive in all three frog legs (paired t-test: 6.911945, p-value: 3.985E-8). This means that for the most part, the control group displayed a stronger direct response than the experimental group. The average difference of the direct responses between the control and the experimental in the first frog leg was 0.186, the second leg had an average difference of 0.175, and the third leg had an average difference of 0.149.

Discussion:
On average, the experimental legs displayed a lower strength of the direct response in comparison to the control legs. Given the results, our hypothesis was supported by the data collected and one can infer that the introduction of a nicotinic ACh antagonist to a frog leg causes a decrease in the strength of direct responses. In another study conducted, it was suggested that if any ACh antagonist was present, reducing the amount of binding sites for ACh, the rate of synaptic decay would increase [Lipscombe: 1998]. This data further supports our findings on the decreased strength of direct responses. Despite most of our data supporting our hypothesis, there was some data that was not supportive of our hypothesis. This negative difference could have been due to the nicotinic ACh not being fully absorbed. As time passed and later stimuli were conducted, the data for that leg continued to support our hypothesis. For future experiments, one could test how the amount (concentration) of nicotinic ACh inhibitor has different effects on the strength of the direct response in a frog leg when stimulated.
