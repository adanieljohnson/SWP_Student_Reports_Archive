Title: Influence of Calcium Ions on Frog Leg's Muscle Contraction

Abstract:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. With the changing stimulus, it is important to understand how certain ions affect the ability of the muscle. In this experiment, we study the stimulus-response, particularly muscle contraction of frog leg, and demonstrating basic properties of the neuromuscular control. The hypothesis was that if we inject a frog leg with calcium, then the force of muscle contraction will increase. This hypothesis is not supported by our data although the test results showed a significant difference in the force generated before and after injecting the calcium. The test reveals the opposite results of the hypothesis, the force generated after injecting calcium is less than before. This adaptation benefits the frog by conserving ATP, the energy source required for movements.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of Calcium on muscle contraction of frog legs. The stimulus of Calcium from the environment would cause the response in muscle fiber. Frog legs are used in this experiment because it can be easily obtained and the nerve and the muscle in the frog leg can be separated easily. [Johnson: 2018] The release of Calcium activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber. [Johnson: 2018] Calcium is ions that bind to troponin and cause the tropomyosin to shift the face of the actin filament to which myosin heads can ​grab the actin to cause muscle contraction. [Squire: 2010] This experiment treats frog legs with an increased amount of Calcium and record the muscle contraction force. With the additional Calcium ions, we expect the muscle contraction happens with more force. The hypothesis is that if we inject a frog leg with calcium, then the force of muscle contraction will increase. The dependent variable is the force generated by the frog leg, and the independent variable is whether or not calcium is injected into the muscle.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs are obtained and each is its own control and experimental group. A constant 10 Hz electricity is applied to the frog nerve and the force of muscle contraction is recorded in voltage. A myogram is used to graph the force generated from the frog leg muscle in volts. The amplitude is firstly increased by 0.1 amp and after 0.5 amp, increased by 1 amp. 5 mL 50mM Calcium is injected into the frog leg after 10 trials finished. We waited for 1 minute for the Calcium to work and the 10 trials repeated again. During the process, the frog legs are rinsed in the solution to keep as much ATP as possible. The difference of the force between the force generated before and after adding the calcium is recorded. A one-tailed paired t-test is used to determine the differences in force difference of the frog leg muscle. 

Results:
The largest force generated by the muscle of each leg before and after injection is used. According to figure 1, the force difference of the trials before injecting the 5mL 50mM Ca and after the injection for frog A is -0.093 volts, for frog B is -0.099 volts, for frog C is -0.105 volts. The p-value of the one-tailed paired t-test is 0.001222. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if we inject a frog leg with Calcium, then the force of muscle contraction will increase, is not supported by the test result although we observed a significant difference between the force generated before and after the injection of Calcium. The result means the alternative hypothesis is supported, that the force would decrease after injecting Calcium. The calcium ions bind to troponin and cause the tropomyosin to shift from the face of the actin filament to which myosin heads need to bind to produce contraction. The increased Calcium level caused the muscle to contract more frequently and for a longer time since it would normally stop without the added Calcium. [Szent-Györgyi: 1975] However, there was limited ATP in the dead frog's leg muscle; and with the limiting ATP, the muscle can only contract with a smaller force. That is the reason why the force actually decreased. Such a realization would lead to the future study of adding Calcium when there is plenty of ATP present in the muscle. If our conclusions are supported, with enough ATP present, the force would not decrease. However, the force would not increase either since the Calcium just activates the change in position of the tropomyosin without change anything to the force the muscle generates.
