Title: Calcium Injection in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rania pipiens Causes Chemically-Induced Tetany

Abstract:
The gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens displays the functions of the neuromuscular junction in a complex organism. When caffeine is present in this system, it triggers calcium potentiation. It was hypothesized that injection of 0.1 Ml caffeine into the muscle would cause chemically-induced tetany upon stimulation, until fatigue. In order to test this hypothesis, three frog legs were observed upon stimulation before and after injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle. The frog legs thus served as their own controll groups, as well as the experimental groups. The average of the voltage recorded for the three legs, in the stimulation trial prior to caffeine injection, was 0.718±0.5239. The average of the voltage in the stimulation trial following the caffeine injection was 1.459±0.3151. The paired T-test used for each frog leg resulted in values of (trial 1) p_value = 1.5 x 10-11, (trial 2) p_value = 1.74 x 10-9, (trial 3) p_value = 8.68 x 10-10. Thus, the results of the experiment supported the hypothesis and were found to be of significance. 

Introduction:
The nervous system is a physiological system found in complex organisms, that operates by electrochemical functions. It is a communication system that allows an organism to sense, perceive, and respond to its internal and external environments [Wake Forest Biology Department: 2018]. It is important that we develop an understanding of the nervous system and its functions, because of its vitality in an organism’s survival. Movement of complex organisms is controllled through stimulation of the skeletal muscle by the nervous system, via motor neurons. The synapse formed between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell is known as the neuromuscular junction. The Rania pipiens is a species of frog that is used in research to understand the functions of the neuromuscular junction. This neuromuscular unit operates on chemical signaling, where one cell transfers its action potential to the postsynaptic cell through the use of neurotransmitters. An unbalance of these neurotransmitters can inhibit a nerve cell from contracting. Caffeine is a calcium potentiator. Thus, when caffeine is present in the neuromuscular junction, it causes an increase in the release of calcium, which triggers the continuous release of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Caffeine also inhibited the rate of Ca uptake, which may in part account for the prolongation of the active state caused by caffeine [Weber: 1968]. The postsynaptic muscle cell therefore remains depolarized and continues to contract in a state of tetany until it fatigues. The injection of 0.1 Ml of caffeine into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens will cause the muscle to experience tetany upon stimulation until it fatigues. 
 


Materials and Method:
The model organism in this experiment was the Rania pipiens. Three separate legs taken from this organism were used to model the functions of the neuromuscular units in the gastrocnemus muscle. The skin was removed from all three legs, and the thigh tissue was pulled away until the sciatic nerve was made accessible. The end of the gastrocnemus muscle distal to the knee joint was then separated with the tendon still attached. A piece of string was attached to the separated end of the tendon and muscle and used to suspend the gastrocnemus muscle at a 90-degree angle from the rest of the leg. The leg of the frog was then secured with pins, while attempting to refrain from puncturing the muscle tissue. Electrodes will be used to apply direct stimulation through the sciatic nerve during observation. Throughout the experiment, the subject frog leg was kept moist with frog Ringer’s solution. Each leg served as its own controll during observation, prior to caffeine injection. The LabScribe iWorx data anaylsis software was used in order to apply stimulation and to record the stimulation effects. For each frog leg, the Amplitude was set to 1, the W(ms) to 5, the F(Hz) to 1, and the HP to 0. The gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated once via the sciatic nerve, and the effects were observed and recorded. The gastrocnemus muscle was then injected with 0.1 Ml of caffeine, and stimulated again immediately following injection. The effects of this were observed and recorded. The same process of preparation, stimulation, and observation was repeated on each of the three frog legs. 
The values for the voltages that were recorded during each stimulation of the muscle were used for data comparison. This information was submitted in a paired T-test format, in order to obtain a T-stat and P-value, determining the significance of the results. A paired T-test was used to compare this data, because there were multiple data recordings taken from the same test subject in each trial. 


Results:
The three subject frog legs experienced normal action potential sequences in their controll trials, but upon caffeine injection the stimulation caused an observed state of chemically-induced tetany to occur in the gastrocnemus muscle, as shown in Figure 1. The average of the voltage recorded for the three legs, in the stimulation trial prior to caffeine injection, was 0.718±0.5239 (controll) as shown in Figure 2. The average of the voltage in the stimulation trial following the caffeine injection was 1.459±0.3151 (experimental), also shown in Figure 2. The data for the individual frog legs is listed in Table 1, below. The data recorded for each frog leg was compared using a paired T-test. For the first frog leg, this resulted in a p_value = 1.5 x 10-11, T-stat = 795.5, and a Df = 4. The data for the second frog leg resulted in a p_value = 1.74 x 10-9, T-stat = 203.77, and Df = 4. The data for the third frog leg resulted in a p_value = 8.68 x 10-10, T-stat = 288.31, and Df = 4. An increase in the voltage was recorded in each frog leg after the injection of caffeine. A state of chemically-induced tetany was observed in each frog leg, yielding results that were supportive of the hypothesis and determined to be significent. 


Discussion:
The comparison of data between the controll and experimental trials of the three subject frog legs in a paired T-test resulted in p_values that indicated that the results were significent. This was expected, because caffeine has shown its effect on the potentiation of calcium in various research settings. Caffeine at up to moderate concentrations causes a substantial increase in the maximal Ca2+ release obtained following large depolarizations. The voltage dependence of the Ca2+ release is characterized by a caffeine concentration‐dependent shift towards more negative membrane potentials [Delay: 1986]. Caffeine also inhibited the rate of Ca uptake, which may in part account for the prolongation of the active state caused by caffeine [Weber: 1968]. Calcium triggers the release of acetylcholine, which makes it a vital part of the function of depolarizing the post synaptic cell. This explains the effects observed on the subject frog legs. The presence of caffeine in the experimental phase led to the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell, causing unceasing contractions until fatigue of the cell occurred. This research is vital, as it provides information about the variable effects that different chemicals can have on the neuromuscular junction in complex organisms. The neuromuscular junction is a unit that is needed for the movement and adaptation of complex organisms to their environments. In order to further test and confirm the effects that caffeine causes upon the functions of the neuromuscular junction, a larger experiment should be conducted using variable amounts of caffeine. In our research, we used a single standard amount of caffeine for injection. There could be variable effects when increasing or decreasing the amount of caffeine present in the neuromuscular junction, thus research on variable amounts would be necessary.
