Title: The Negative Impact Martin’s IGR has on the Development of the Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars depend on three critical hormones, one of which is the Juvenile Hormone. When levels of the Juvenile Hormone fail to drop during the commitment pulse, the Manduca sexta becomes incapable of pupating. In this experiment, it was hypothesized that the addition of an insect growth regulator to the Manduca sexta diet would prevent the species from developmentally maturing because of the IGR’s ability to mimic the juvenile hormone. To conduct the experiment, Martin’s IGR was added to the food source of four experimental Manduca sextas and water was added to the food source of four control Manduca sextas. Experimental observations showed that caterpillars failed to mature past the fifth instar larval stage. While visual observations from this two week study likely supported the hypothesis, statistical data showed that there was no significant difference between the weights and lengths of the control Manduca sexta and the experimental Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
Like most insects, the development of the Manduca sexta moth occurs over the course of 39 to 48 days. During the course of this life cycle, several hormones play important roles in controlling the biochemical and physical changes in the species. Three hormones that contribute to the insect's ability to molt, or secrete a new outer layer of skin, are the prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E), and the Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH and 20E are found to work together to control the growth, molting, and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta. In normal caterpillars, JH is typically found in high concentrations prior to the fourth instar larval stage. After this point, it drops and ecdysterone levels rise during the commitment pulse. 
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are known to negatively impact the development of the insects and in some cases can cause abnormalities to the normal growth, molting, and metamorphosis processes. Some negative impacts include inhibiting insects from molting by modeling the juvenile hormone released during the fourth instar larval stages. In a previously conducted study, Staal set out to predict the effects of insect growth regulators on pests. The group hypothesized that the species would continue to grow, but instead of molting, would become excessively large and/or produce extra larval, nymphal, or pupal forms [Staal: 1975].  Their results demonstrated that the Manduca sexta with IGR in their body system caused them to consume abnormally large amounts of food and to grow to abnormally large sizes [Staal: 1975]. Although these Manduca sexta developed much more rapidly, they failed to molt when the control Manduca sexta did. 
Given the results collected and analyzed from this previous experiment, the Manduca sexta in this experiment could be reasonably anticipated to be incapable of molting after adopting a steady diet with Martin’s IGR. The purpose of the experiment will be to determine the effect Martin’s IGR will have on the biochemical functions of the Manduca sexta and to observe how these changes will affect the Manduca sexta physically. If Martin’s IGR is consumed daily by the Manduca sexta, it is hypothesized that there will be a significant negative effect on the maturing rate of Manduca sexta in that the caterpillar will fail to pupate. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight, 11- 12 day old Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and divided into two groups: control and experimental. The caterpillars were placed into two, four-celled containers with each having its own individual cell. Breathing holes were made for the caterpillars and each cell was labeled in order to track each caterpillar’s growth. Every Manduca sexta caterpillar was fed 10g of Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet. However, each caterpillar in the control group had 10 drops of water put into their food before it was rolled into a ball and placed into the cell. In the experimental group, the remaining four Manduca Sexta caterpillars were fed 10 g of GLM diet with 10 drops of Martin’s IGR. The caterpillars and their homes were placed in the same incubators were which was set at 28°C , in a 12 hours of dark, 12 hours of light cycle. Once per day for two weeks the M. Sexta caterpillars were measured by weight (g), length (cm), and observations were recorded. Whenever food was noticed to had been fully consumed, the procedure for making the food was repeated for the control and experimental groups respectively. Additionally, feces were removed when there was a buildup. The statistical test that was used for this data was the two sample t test because it most accurately tests that the mean values of the measurement variable are the same in two groups. The independent variable will be the diet given to the caterpillar and the dependent variable will be the development of the caterpillar measured by its weight and length as well as through direct observations.


Results:
There are some general trends to take note of from the raw data. As seen by Figure 1, the caterpillars in the control group were found to have lost weight and the caterpillars in the experimental group were found to have gained weight by the end of the two weeks. As seen by Figure 2, the caterpillars in the control group were found to have lost length and the caterpillars in the experimental group were found to have gained length by the end of the two weeks. Table 1 tracks each individual caterpillar’s growth in both weight and length from Day 0 to Day 14. The initial and final weight and length values for the Manduca sexta were collected and their differences were calculated. The total growth value is a report of their change (final-initial) in weight and length from the beginning to end of the experiment. Despite the varying average weights and lengths shown in the figures, Table 1 again shows that each experimental caterpillar experienced overall weight and length gain and each control caterpillar overall experienced weight and length loss.
The control group’s appearance differed greatly from that of the experimental group by the end of the two weeks. The control caterpillars had formed orange-brown shells or cocoons wrapped around their bodies, and they appeared to no longer be consuming food. Food more often had to be replaced and feces removed from the experimental group. These caterpillars were a bright green throughout the duration of the experiment, but became larger as well as more swollen by the conclusion of the two weeks. A two sample t test was performed on this data. The average weight of the control group was found to not be statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=1.76, df=22, P=0.09). The average length of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group (t-stat=1.96, df=22, P=0.0623).


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that Martin’s IGR will prevent the caterpillars from maturing. Direct observations likely supported the hypothesis since the addition of Martin’s IGR to the caterpillars’ diets prevented the experimental group from pupating and the addition of only water did not prevent the control group from pupating. Despite the experimental Manduca sexta’s failure to mature past the fifth instar larval stage from visual observations, based on the results of the two sample t test, it could not be concluded that there was a statistical difference between the weight and length in the control group versus the experimental. That being said, the weights and lengths of the caterpillars are not necessarily indicators of pupation. 
The difference in appearance noticed between the control group and the experimental group could be explained by a number of factors. As predicted in the hypothesis, the insect growth regulator provided to the experimental group could be responsible for preventing the caterpillars from molting and pupating like the control group did. It mimicked the juvenile hormone typically released during the larval stages. However, the continuous release prevented the caterpillars from ever pupating because the levels did not decrease like they did in the control group. As soon as the control group started to pupate, they seemed to stop consuming food. This explains the decrease in weight and length that occurred around Days 7 and 8 (Reference Figures 1 and 2). 
Overall, the results in this experiment were found to be quite similar to those of Staal’s study. The caterpillars were found to have increased body weight when exposed to Martin’s IGR, but would not molt [Staal:1975]. If this experiment were to be repeated again, it would be interesting to see how the Manduca sexta are affected by the presence of IGR in their diet for a longer period of time. Will this diet lead to a more timely death than a normal diet? Another study could be conducted and a new hypothesis could be made centered around testing these related biological questions.
