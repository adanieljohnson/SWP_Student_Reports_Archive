Title: The Effects of Vibration on Agonistic Behavior in Betta splendens

Abstract:
One of main objectives of ethology is to examine behavioral processes such as aggression in animals. Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, are known to be aggressive in nature and therefore are an ideal test species for showing how intraspecific aggression functions within their species. This study uses ethological techniques to quantify the levels of agonistic behavior displayed by four male B. splendens before and after they have been stimulated by vibration. The specific technique used was measuring the amount of times a specific behavior was displayed and quantifying it by arbitrary intensity based on known behaviors. The study examines the relationship between vibration and the Betta fish hypothesizing that if the Betta fish are stimulated by vibration then they will exhibit higher levels of agonistic displays. This hypothesis was tested with four male Betta fish over two sets of trials within the same tank. The hypothesis is not supported, but the stimulus still had an effect on the subjects. When stimulated by vibration before an encounter with another male Betta fish, the levels of agonistic behavior shown significantly decreased upon the encounter. 

Introduction:
Male Betta splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, display aggressive, also known as agonistic behavior, when placed in contact with other male Betta fish. This agonistic behavior is a way for the fish to assert dominance within an environment and therefore ensure their sexual reproduction and their own longevity. There are detailed descriptions of how agonistic behavior is shown in B. splendens available and published by animal ethologists such as Harman V. S. Peeke [Peeke:1970]. These descriptions show that male Betta fish present their aggression in six recognized physical displays with two main forms: broadside display and facing display. These contain three increasingly aggressive levels of behavior: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, and erecting pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, presenting a red “mane” by enlarging their branchiostegal membrane. These displays have evolved as a result of intraspecific competition for mates, competition within the species. It is important to study these behaviors because ethologists are able to use this data to predict agonistic behavior for B. splendens populations as a whole as well as for species with similar aggressive tendencies. Testing the ways that outside stimuli affect agonistic behavior in Bettas allows insight into the ways that a changing environment may affect intraspecific interactions overall. This changing environment as effected by vibration is similar to the effects that sea travel may have. This could include anything from submarines in the deep ocean to pleasure crafts such as jet skis. This testing also allows a glimpse into how different species may interact in an interspecific environment within the ocean under these effects. They can be mapped onto other vertebrate animal interactions because of similar relationships with aggressive displays and chemical receptors [Clotfelter:2007]. To agitate a Betta fish environment, a stimulus must be added into the environment. In a previous study it was found that vibration was an effective stimulant for eliciting aggressive behavior, when used for short periods of time, in another aquatic species, Nereis pelagica [Peeke:1970]. In our experiment we will be testing the effects of vibration as a stimulant for the agonistic behavior in the male Bettas. If the environment of a male Betta is agitated by vibration, then they will display higher levels of agonistic behaviors. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, we placed two male Betta fish on each side of an opaque divider and allowed them to rest without any outside stimuli for five minutes. After this time had passed, we removed the divider so that only a clear divider separated the fish and recorded the types of behaviors displayed for another five minutes. We quantified the behaviors by assigning numeric values to the three levels of aggressive display for broadside and facing displays. The assignments were as follows for broadside display: pelvic fin flickering = 1, tail beating = 2, tail flashing = 3. For facing display, the assignments were: erecting pectoral fins = 1, spreading the opercula = 2, presenting a red “mane” by enlarging their branchiostegal membrane = 3.  We then replaced the opaque divider and rested the fish for 2.5 minutes then placed an electric toothbrush in each of the tanks for the remaining 2.5 minutes before again removing the opaque divider and recording any behavioral displays. We repeated the above process a second time per fish pair. Upon completion of the second trial we removed the original male Bettas from the tank and replaced them with two new specimens. We repeated our process with this pair in the same manner as the first. To ensure data for later computations we selected and used data from the trial with the higher aggressive level for posterior analysis.  We then selected the largest average agonistic displays by summing the data for the broadside and facing displays of each fish. We tested for significance using a paired t-test.

Results:
The results show a significant decrease in the level of agonistic behaviors displayed after male Betta fish were treated with vibration (Fig. 1, t-stat = 5.5, df = 3, P = 0.01). The average level of agonistic behavior before and after vibration were 4.45 ± 0.25 and 2.35 ± 0.66 respectively. This data shows that there was a mean difference between these agonistic levels of -2.10 ± 0.76. 

Discussion:
The results from the experiment rejected our hypothesis. The significance of our experiment rather supports a new hypothesis that if the male Bettas are agitated by vibration, then they will display lower levels of agonistic behavior (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained in a previous study in which male B. splendens were exposed to the neurotransmitter serotonin [Clotfelter:2007]. In opposition to our experiment the stimulant used in Clotfelter’s experiment was an internal rather than external stimulation [Clotfelter:2007]. One possible explanation for this decrease of aggression observed in our experiment could be that the Betta fish had become habituated to their environment during their first encounter and had not had sufficient time to rest between the trials. If this habituation occurred to their environment, then the decreased aggression could be a result of this rather than the vibration. In a prior study habituation has been shown to decrease aggression and inhibit the complete recovery of B. splendens from habituation to a stimulus or environment [Peeke:1970]. In our experiment the only variable that we manipulated was the presence of the vibration within the environment. This change was intended to agitate the Betta fish and elicit an increased agonistic behavior. In our study this did not occur potentially because of habituation to the vibration or to the environment of the experiment. Subsequent experiments would benefit from having multiple trials in which the environment was changed after each trial was completed so that habituation to the environment, in this case the glass tank, could be decreased or eliminated completely. It could also be altered so that the frequency of the vibration could be manipulated over multiple trials to gain a larger data set. To avoid a lack of conclusive data we completed trials with two pairs of male Bettas. Each of our trials showed consistent data that a decrease in agonistic behavior occurred. This may have also been due to habituation to the fish on the other side of the divider during the multiple trials rather than a reaction to the vibrations of the water.
