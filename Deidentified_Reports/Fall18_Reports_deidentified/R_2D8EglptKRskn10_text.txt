Title: The Effects of Atrazine on Spinach Chloroplasts at Different Light Intensities

Abstract:
Most living cells require energy to function. Energy is often derived from three main sources such as the chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stores as an oxidation-reduction potential, or through electrical or chemical gradients across a lipid bilayer. . From the trends observed our hypothesis was rejected due to absorbances of lower light intensity being higher than the ones in at a higher light intensity.

Introduction:
Most living cells require energy to function. Energy is often derived from three main sources such as the chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stores as an oxidation-reduction potential, or through electrical or chemical gradients across a lipid bilayer. [Johnson:2018]  Organisms such as plants, some protist, and bacteria absorb solar energy and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. The energy that absorbed by chloroplasts, which are only present in plants and are responsible for the processes of capturing sunlight and energy production. The photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts in three various steps. The first two-stages are called the light-dependent reaction, they absorb to photons of two different wavelengths to produces NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). From this process a proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis. This experiment will focus on the light-dependent reaction and more specifically look at the function photosystem II. Photosystem II, energy from the absorbed photons of light causes electrons to leave the chlorophyll and move to the plastiquinone. The oxidized chlorophyll indirectly stimulates hydrolysis of water to produce molecular oxygen, the excess of electrons then restores the ones lost from the chlorophyll. Due to water being broken down, H+ protons are then pumped across the thylakoid membrane. The reduction plastiquinone transfers its cytochrome b6f, which then transfers electrons to plastocyanin. Simultaneously, the cytochrome b6f complex pumps protons across thylakoid membrane, adding to the proton gradient that allows for the electron transport chain to function.[Johnson:2018]. In this experiment, we will be observing the effect of Atrazine, a known photosystem II inhibitor, has on Hill reaction, which is the process of electron transfer in chloroplast, on spinach leaves.  According to research done by Dan Hess, herbicide types such as triazines (e.g., atrazine) and phenylureas (e.g., diuron) have their site of action in photosystemII (PS II) in the photosynthesis light reaction. Symptoms from herbicides that interfere with PS II slowly evolve over several days. [Hess:2000].  Due to NADP+ being difficult to measure, we used DCPIP( 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol ) as an alternative electron acceptor to measure the reduction of NADP+. From this we hypothesized that with the addition of the herbicide Atrazine, absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis will be lower at a higher light intensity (100%) than at lower light intensity (50%) or in dark.

Materials and Method:
The main stem of 4 spinach leaves were removed. The rest of the leaf were placed into a mortar, with We labelled 19 large test tubes. Test tube #1 was our blank, only 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5) . Test tubes #2-#4, contained 8Ml of water, no DCPIP, 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 1 microliter chloroplast, and were to be placed in the dark. Test tube #5-#8 contained 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), no atrazine, and placed under a lamp with 50% of the bulb covered. In Test tubes #9-#12, 5 Ml of water, 3 Ml of reaction of buffer, 1 Ml of Atrazine is added, 1 microliter of chloroplast, and is placed in dark. In test tubes #13-#15, chloroplast, 1 Ml of atrazine, 5Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 1 Ml of Atrazine, and tubes to placed in 50% of light as the one before without the atrazine. Tubes #16-#18, had 5 Ml of water, 2Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 1Ml of Atrazine, and placed in 100% of light. We mixed the chloroplast thoroughly immediately after putting it into the test tube. We then transferred a sample . We then prepared the spectrophotometer and placed the blank inside it. We put the absorbance of the spectrophotometer at 600 nm. We recorded the absorbances  after 10, 20 , and 30 minutes. We performed 3 t_tests.

Results:
I couldn't figure out how to do the 3 t_tests. I just observed the trends from the data collected. From what I could see I did see that the absorbances of the 50% light intensities were higher than the ones at 100% light intensities.

Discussion:
Herbicide types such as triazines (e.g., atrazine) and phenylureas (e.g., diuron) have their site of action in photosystemII (PS II) in the photosynthesis light reaction. Symptoms from herbicides that interfere with PS II slowly evolve over several days. [Hess:2000] ALthough our experiment did not take a few days we can observe that atrazine did inhibit the functioning of photosystem II. But according to trends observed this could have been due to Atrazine no longer being an effective inhibitor as described in research done by Friesen and Powles that concluded that atrazine did not inhibit photosystem II in wild radishes.[Powles:2007]
