Title: Simulated herbivory affects resource allocation and root-to-shoot ratio in Raphanus raphanistrum

Abstract:
The effect of herbivory on resource allocation in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum), manifested in the root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) of length and weight, was studied in this experiment.  It was predicted that herbivory would lead to a higher R:S for both length and weight.  Two groups of radish plants, each consisting of four pots with seeds planted in vermiculite, were grown in a greenhouse under similar conditions, with one group receiving simulated herbivory.  Herbivory was simulated by using a Phillips head screwdriver to perforate the leaves.  The R:S was calculated separately for the weights and lengths of the roots and shoots.  It was observed that the average R:S length was higher in controlls than in the group experiencing herbivory, while the average R:S weight was higher in the test group than in the controll.  However, the data for weight were not statistically significent.  Our hypothesis was neither sufficiently confirmed nor denied, but our observation that R:S for length was higher in controlls suggests that further research should be conducted on the effects of herbivory on length.


Introduction:
Herbivory is one of the biggest threats to crop production.  Each year, billions of dollars are lost due to herbivorous pests, such as deer, rabbits, and various insects.  Our plant, the radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), is an important food crop.  Radishes were also chosen because of the ease of growing them in the laboratory and because of their relatively large leaves.  The purpose of our experiment was to determine whether herbivory affects resource allocation, here measured as root-to-shoot ratio (R:S), and phenotypic plasticity.  Root-to-shoot ratio is usually defined as the ratio of the weight of the roots to the weight of the shoots (Harris 1992), but here we also took into consideration the R:S for length as well.  R:S can be used as a metric for resource allocation, as it shows to what degree the plant allocates its resources to the roots and shoots respectively.  A higher R:S is usually considered not ideal, and is associated with decreased health, although most trees have a high R:S (Harris 1992), and do not appear to suffer from that.  Simulated herbivory has been shown to have deleterious effects on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L. nevadensis), leading to an increased R:S (Hódar, et al. 2008).  
We studied the effect of herbivory on resource allocation by simulating herbivory on radish plants.  It is important to study herbivory in crop plants, including radishes, because of the economic implications of crop loss.   We predicted that simulated herbivory to the leaves would lead to a higher R:S, as plants would need to compensate for the loss of function in leaves.


Materials and Method:
Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) seeds were soaked in water for 30 minutes.  While seeds were soaking, eight pots of vermiculite were prepared, four labeled “herbivory” and four labeled “controll.”  After 30 minutes of soaking the seeds, each pot was planted with 10 seeds to ensure that each pot would contain a few plants.  All pots were then watered thoroughly.  Plants were then grown in a greenhouse for two weeks, during which time they were watered regularly.  A Phillips head screwdriver was used to create holes in the leaves, in order to simulate herbivory.
	After growing for two weeks, 3 plants from each pot were taken.  Roots were measured from root-shoot junction to the tips; this was recorded, along with the length from root-shoot junction.  Root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) was calculated for length using these data.  Following this, the plants were separated at the root-shoot junction; the shoots of all three were weighed together and recorded, as were the roots, and R:S calculated.  This was repeated four times for the controll group, and four times for the test group experiencing herbivory.  The data were analyzed using a two-sample t_test to determine whether they were significent.


Results:
The average R:S weight for controlls was 2.16; for test 2.75.  Average R:S length was 2.66 for controlls and 3.39 for test.  This indicates that R:S weight was observed to increase with simulated herbivory and that R:S length was observed to decrease.  The p_value for R:S length was 0.01, which indicates that the data are statistically significent.  For R:S weight, the p_value was 0.05, which indicates that the data were not statistically significent.


Discussion:
As expected, the average R:S weight for controlls was higher than that of the test group.  This is consistent with prior research on herbivory and resource allocation in Scots pine (Hódar, et al. 2008).  However, the data were found to be not statistically significent, so it cannot be confirmed that simulated herbivory indeed does result in an increased R:S weight, rather than the results being due to chance.  As such, further research may elect to increase the sample size or increase the amount of time the plants are allowed to grow (and thus the time the test group is subjected to herbivory).  Plants growing in an atmosphere with higher CO2 levels have been found to have a higher R:S (Rogers, et al. 1996); we did not take into consideration the level of CO2 in the greenhouse, which may have had an effect on the R:S of the plants.
	An interesting finding was that the R:S length for controlls was higher than that of test subjects.  This indicates that the roots of the controlls were of a higher weight than those of the test group.  This may indicate a need on the part of the plants experiencing herbivory to compensate for leaf tissue; however, it has been found that plants’ ability to compensate for herbage loss from herbivory is more determined by abiotic factors such as availability of sunlight and water than it is by herbivory itself (Hódar, et al. 2008).  It is important to note that R:S is typically defined as the ratio of the weight of the roots to that of the shoots, not the ratio of the length (Harris 1992).
	The negative effects of herbivory are not limited to stunted growth.  Radishes that have experienced herbivory have been shown to become less attractive to pollinators (Lehtilä and Strauss, 1997). Further research may be done to determine whether this is related to a need to compensate for herbivory.  It is known that wild radishes experiencing herbivory are less reproductively successful.  However, herbivory has been found to be potentially important in the maintenance of a flower color polymorphism in wild radishes (Raphanus sativus), by countering selection by pollinators of yellow and white flowers at the expense of pink and white flowers (Irwin, et al. 2003).  Herbivory may have an important part in preserving genetic diversity in some cases.
	Overall, the findings of this experiment neither confirm nor contradict prior research; while the results tended to support our hypothesis that R:S for weight would be higher in plants experiencing herbivory than in controlls, the results were found to be statistically not significent, and therefore not useful to support or reject the hypothesis.  The finding that R:S length was higher in controlls than in the test group contradicted our hypothesis, but it is entirely possible that herbivory may lead to stunted growth of roots in comparison to shoots, which may result in a higher R:S weight.
