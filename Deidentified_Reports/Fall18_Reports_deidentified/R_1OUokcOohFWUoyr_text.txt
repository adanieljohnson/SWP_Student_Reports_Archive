Title: The Effect of Precor on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, known as the Tobacco Hornworm, is recognized as a pest among tobacco and vegetable such as tomatoes. Despite their harmful effects on these crops, once the insect matures to adulthood, it feeds instead on nectar. The effects of pests on crops worldwide has influenced scientists to explore the effects of hormone-based pesticides, some of which include methoprene, a known juvenile hormone mimicker, and is known by the brand name Precor. To understand the effect of Precor on the growth and development of Manduca sexta larva, several caterpillars were exposed to small doses of Precor in order to demonstrate its effect on the average weight change. It was hypothesized that if Manduca sexta were exposed to Precor in late larval stages, then they would experience a greater average weight change than unexposed caterpillars. Due to extraneous factors, our results come out to be slightly skewed, with a p value above 0.05, making our results insignificent. 

Introduction:
Manduca sexta are a species of insects that are well known to be a pest among crops in the United States. During their larval stages, Manduca sexta, known commonly as the Tobacco Hornworm, feed upon tobacco and other crops, such as tomatoes. Once matured to adulthood, however, the Manduca sexta no longer feed on crops; they become harMless and feed on plant nectar. Manduca sexta undergo metamorphosis in order to pupate and molt into their adult form. This process involves the hormones juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). JH, produced by the insect’s corpus allata, are present through all instars of the larval Manduca sexta, whereas 20E is produced by the prothoracic glands [1]. Between the fourth and fifth instar of its larval stages, the level of JH in the insect drops off substantially, and 20E experiences a slight increase [1]. This event, known as the commitment pulse, indicates that the insect has enough resources to undergo metamorphosis [1]. Without this momentous change in the insect’s hormone levels, the insect will not pupate and mature to adulthood [1]. Precor, a known JH mimicker, is commonly used as a pesticide especially for flea controll [2] Precor is also known for its pesticidal effects on Collembola [3]. Juvenoids [2] such as Precor work as by altering the endocrine function of pest populations and suppress the proliferation and reproduction of pests in adulthood [3]. It was hypothesized that if Manduca sexta are exposed in late larval stages to Precor, then they will express a greater average change in weight than unexposed Manduca sexta. 

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, eight late-larval Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and their initial weights were taken. They were separated into two groups, a controll and a Precor treatment group, each containing four caterpillars. Two plastic containers, one labeled “controll” and the other labeled “treatment,” were each divided into four subdivisions in which the caterpillars were placed individually. Each caterpillar was fed one of two diets. Those in the controll group were fed the traditional Great Lakes Manduca (GLM) diet (10g) with 3 drops of water, whereas those in the treatment group were fed the GLM diet (10g) with 3 drops of Precor. The controll and treatment groups, in their respective containers, were kept in an incubator kept at constant temperature. Caterpillar weights were measured and recorded 5 times over the course of 14 days. As caterpillars ate their food, it was replaced accordingly, feeding the controll group 10 grams of the GLM diet with 3 drops of water, and the treatment group 10 grams of the GLM diet with 3 drops of Precor. To test the result of the experiment, a two-tailed T-test was conducted to determine whether the results were significent. 

Results:
To measure the effects of Precor on the average weight change of Manduca sexta caterpillars, The initial weight was subtracted from the final weight of each individual caterpillar to find the individual weight differences, from which the controll group values were averaged and the treatment group values were averaged, yielding an average weight change in the controll group, and an average weight change in the treatment group. To determine the significance of the results, a two-tailed T-test was performed, and the two-tailed P-value was determined to be p=0.114821. Figure 1 displays the average weight changes among the controll and treatment groups, and the standard deviations within each. 

Discussion:
The data shows an increased average weight difference among the treatment group, however the two-tailed p_value of 0.114821 represents a nonsignificent result due to its high likelihood of our results being due to chance. The hypothesis predicted a difference in average weight changes among the two groups, however due to the p_value, the data is inconclusive. It is important to note that the data from the experiment was likely impacted by the death of one of our treatment group individuals. This left 3 treatment caterpillars, as opposed to the four controll caterpillars. Observations of the individual caterpillar also noted that there was one treatment caterpillar that appeared to be substantially smaller than the other two. This likely led to the extreme standard deviation in the treatment group, and skewed the average weight change as well. Based on our knowledge of JH, Precor, and the hormone composition of Manduca sexta, we can infer that exposure of larval Manduca sexta caterpillars will ultimately impact the growth and development of the organisms by maintaining high levels of JH thus forcing the exposed caterpillar to skip the commitment pulse. Based on the extensive use of Precor as a pesticide and preventing the development of insects that are pests in adulthood [2], we inferred that Precor would maintain larval Manduca sexta, which would ultimately keep them in their “pest” stage. The effects of JH and JH mimickers are well studied and known to largely impact matured adult insects and their ability to reproduce [3], so the effect of Precor on pre-mature Manduca sexta was important in understanding the role of JH in insect development.

Figure 1. Effect of Precor on average weight change (in grams) of Manduca sexta. Average weight change among the treatment group individuals was greater than average weight change among the controll group individuals. Standard deviation was greater among the treatment group with a value of 2.7972665, whereas the controll group had a standard deviation of 0.9306046. *************************************************************************
