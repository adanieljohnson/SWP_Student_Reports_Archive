Title: Effects on Mass of Manduca sexta That Ingested the Hormone Precor

Abstract:
The study’s main objective was to discover if there was a relation between an elevated amount of juvenile hormone and growth by mass in the Manduca sexta species. The hormone precor was used to simulate juvenile hormone. The controll group of the species was given ten grams of food with ten drops of water. The experimental group was give ten grams of food with ten drops of precor. Both groups had similar habitats. The results found that the controll and experimental group weighed an average of 7.0165g and 5.06745g, respectively. A two sample t test found that there was a statistical difference in the controll and test group. In conclusion, the hormone precor decreased growth rate in the Manduca sexta species.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta species is a major pest on many farms and gardens in its larval stages. The species mainly destroys tobacco, tomato, and potato crops. While Manduca sexta destroy crops in their larval stages, adult Manduca sexta cause no issues. On the contrary, adult Manduca sexta are beneficial because they are good pollinators. Larger farms use pesticides to deter or kill Manduca sexta. The smaller Manduca sexta are when they consumes the pesticide the less they needs to consume for the pesticide to work properly [Byron: 2017]. Juvenile hormone controlls growth in Manduca sexta, as well as other biological processes [Noriega: 2014]. The hormone precor acts like juvenile hormone which is naturally occuring in Manduca

sexta. If Manduca sexta have a diet that consists of precor they will grow at a slower rate. If this is true then pesticides can be mixed with precor, so the pesticides can be more efficient.

Materials and Method:
This hypothesis was tested with a controll group of four Manduca sexta and an experimental group of four Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta used in each group were all chosen for similar size. Two containers with four separate compartments were used as the Manduca sexta’s habitat. One container was solely for the controll group, while the other container was for the experimental group. Three holes were poked in each compartment so the Manduca sexta could breath. The species was kept inside of an incubator. The controll group was fed every other day with ten grams of GLM mixed with ten drops of water. The test group was fed every other day with ten grams of GLM mixed with ten drops of precor. All Manduca sexta were weighed every day.


Results:
A two sample t test yielded a p­value of 1.4 x 10­5. Since this p­value is less than 0.05 the null hypothesis is rejected. This means there is significent difference between the controll and experimental group. The controll group had a mean mass of 7.0165g and the experimental group had a mean mass of 5.06475g. The experimental group grew at a slower rate by mass.


Discussion:
From the results in this experiment, precor slows growth by mass of the Manduca sexta species. Precor mimics the natural hormone juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone regulates growth speed in the Manduca sexta species. Once the Manduca sexta experimental group consumed the precor, their growth slowed down because the effects of juvenile hormone were
intensified. Other researchers found that a change in juvenile hormone had no effect on weight for locusts [Beenakkers: 1974]. This difference in results was most likely caused by the use of two different species. The results of this experiment show that when Manduca sexta consume precor their growth is slowed. This is very beneficial for agricultural pesticides. If precor is mixed with the pesticides used to exterminate Manduca sexta, the pesticides would be more successful. The smaller the Manduca sexta the less pesticide it has to ingest to be exterminated. If the pesticides are mixed with precor then the Manduca sexta will be smaller, therefore they will have to ingest a smaller amount of pesticide to be exterminated.
