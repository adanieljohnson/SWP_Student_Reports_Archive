Title: 20E Blockers Cause a Decrease in Weight When Added to a Manduca Sexta Caterpillar’s Diet

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to introduce Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) to the diet of Manduca Sexta caterpillars and record how it comes into play with other hormones to affect their weight. One of the caterpillar’s main hormones is Ecdysterone (20E). It is part of the family of steroid hormones which is in charge of regulating the timing of molting during insect development. We hypothesize that if a 20E blocker is introduced to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet, then the Manduca will spend a longer time in it’s caterpillar stage and increase in weight. Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were chosen and divided into two groups of four each. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets. The caterpillars were monitored every other day for two weeks in order to record the weight (in grams) of each caterpillar and to replenish their food as needed. The group of caterpillars that had a control diet without the 20E blocked displayed a significant increase in weight while the treatment group of caterpillars who had the 20E blocker added to their diet showed a decrease in weight. Given the results, supported by our p-value of 0.00.1364, our hypothesis was not supported and we cannot infer that the 20E blocker causes an increase in weight by extending the Manduca Sexta’s caterpillar phase.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect that has a holometabolous life cycle. This means that the insect experiences an eeg/embryo stage, a larvae stage, a pupa stage, and an adult stage. Manduca Sexta’s experience 5 instar larval stages before pupating and becoming an adult moth. The purpose of this experiment is to introduce Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) to the diet of Manduca Sexta caterpillars and record how it comes into play with other hormones to affect their weight. The caterpillar’s growth is controlled by two main hormones: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). The JH regulate the type of molting during development while the 20E is part of the family of steroid hormones which is in charge of regulating the timing of molting during insect development. Insects need JH and 20E in order to live. The amounts of each hormone present and the insect’s developmental stage determine what the effects of the two hormones will be. The JH and 20E work together to control growth and molting of the Manduca Sexta. Before the commitment pulse, which indicates that the caterpillar is large enough to pupate and form a normal sized moth, there is a drop in JH along with a small rise in the 20E level. What would happen to the caterpillar’s weight if we could delay their commitment pulse? Since 20E initiates the moulting process, we will introduce an IGR that acts as a 20E blocker to the diet of these caterpillars [Jenkin&Hinton: 1996][Wigglesworth: 1973]. We hypothesize that if a 20E blocker is introduced to a Manduca caterpillar’s diet, then the Manduca will spend a longer time in it’s caterpillar stage and increase in weight. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were chosen and divided into two groups of four each. Each caterpillar was then placed into its own separate container. We fed each caterpillar one of two diets. Diet 1 was composed of 10 grams each of unaltered Manduca diet with five drops of water. Diet 2 was composed of 10 grams each of Manduca diet with five drops of the 20E blocker. The caterpillars in the control group and the caterpillars in the treatment group were all labeled. Four of the caterpillars were part of the control group which were fed ‘Diet 1’ while caterpillars 4 of the caterpillars were part of the experimental group and were fed ‘Diet 2’. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator in a 12 light:12 dark cycle. The caterpillars were monitored every other day for two weeks in order to record the weight (in grams) of each caterpillar and to replenish their food as needed. We computed the average initial and final weights for the caterpillars as well as standard deviation, mean change in weight and completed the one-tailed T test.


Results:
Shown by Figure 1, there is an observable pattern seen within both groups of Manduca Sexta caterpillars. The group of caterpillars that had a control diet without the 20E blocker displayed an increase in weight as they displayed overwhelmingly positive percent changes in weight, with an average increase of 289.74%. The group of caterpillars that were in the treatment group with the 20E blocker displayed a decrease in weight as they displayed negative percent changes in weight with an average decrease of -13.97%. The standard deviation for the control group was 123.41 while the standard deviation for the treatment group was 13.30. A one-tailed two sample t-test was utilized to analyze the results of our 20E blocker experiment. The four Manduca Caterpillars in the control group were significantly different than the four Manduca caterpillars in the treatment group according to our p-value which was 0.001364. 

Discussion:
Given the results, our hypothesis has not been supported by the data and we cannot infer that the 20E blocker causes an increase in weight by extending the Manduca Sexta’s caterpillar phase. We did observe within the other groups that whenever the caterpillar got closer to the commitment pulse, their weight tended to decrease. We believed our results may have been skewed because in the beginning of our experiment, our caterpillars in the treatment group were noticeably larger than the caterpillars in the control group. Previous experiments have shown that once a Manduca caterpillar weighs up to 5g, then it begins to decide when to pupate [Nijhout: 1974]. Multiple caterpillars in our treatment group had a starting weight higher than 5g, which could have affected our results because they could have already been undergoing the pupation process before being introduced to the 20E blocker. Additionally, the treatment group caterpillars were of a dull earthy color (brown and green) while the control group caterpillars were of a bright green color. This leads us to believe that the treatment group caterpillars were in a more advanced larva stage than the caterpillars in the control group. With further testing of Manduca Setxa Caterpillars being introduced to the 20E blocker during different larval stages and weights, our results could potentially demonstrate that the 20E blocker led to a prolonged caterpillar phase after a decrease in weight.
