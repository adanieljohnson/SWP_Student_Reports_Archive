Title: The Effect of Different Light Colors on Physarrum Phototaxis

Abstract:
The purpose of this lab was to evaluate how light irradiation of difference colors effected phototaxis by Physarum polycephalum. This experiment used red, green, white and no light as experimental treatments. White light was our positive controll, we know that there should be a negative phototaxis response. White light should elicit a negative phototaxis on our organism because Physarum’s optimal environment is darkness. Physarum reacts to blue light and white light the same with a decrease in reaction to the light source but then induces a prolongation of oscillations to distance itself from the irradiated light area and seek out darkness. With this in mind we decided to use green light and red light, because it’s on the other side of the color spectrum. It was predicted that green light will lead to no significent difference when comparing white light and green light and red light will lead a significent difference in results relative to white light, having the opposite effect as blue light. The results showed that there was no significent difference between white light and green light migration but no significent difference when comparing white light and red light. 

Introduction:
The purpose of this lab is to evaluate how light stimulus of different colors effects the distance migrated by Physarum polycephalum. We exposed P. polycephalum to red, green, white and no light. White light was our positive controll and no light was our negative controll. Physarum is a multinucleate syncytium which means it has one single plasma membrane but is comprised of multiple nuclei [Johnson; 2018]. The nuclei undergo mitosis at the same time. Physarum remains a multicellular plasmodium as long as it remains in darkness with high humidity. When light is around, plasmodium might migrate away from light which is a negative phototaxis or towards light which means positive phototaxis. Typically, the plasmodium moves away from light if it can but if it can’t it will change to another life stage or can undergo fragmentation [Adamatzky; 2013]. We can conclude with this that the optimal environment for P. polucephalum is darkness. P.polycephalum mediates light sensing through phytochromes, which is a photoreceptor that’s location is unknown but everywhere [Adamatzky; 2013]. It also has at least three blue and UV light phytochromes that produce signal transductions which controll cellular function that is necessary for life [Marwan; 2001]. One of the signal transductions targets the cytoskeleton that results in changes in cell shape and direction of cell migrating during photo movement.
Within past experiments it has been found that P. polycephalum reacts to blue-light with many cell responses such as changes in motility in the intracellular rearrangement of “chloroplast and other organelles in morphogenesis and differentiation” [Korohada, et al.;1983]. Furthermore, blue light elicits a signal transduction pathway from the illuminated area to the non-illuminated regions causing endoplasmic shuttle streaming [Korohada, et al,1983]. Shuttle streaming is how P. polycephalum communicates with the rest of its organism to induce oscillations and contracts to produce movement. Within this same experiment, it’s been found that blue light induced a prolongation of oscillation periods that was traced back to an increase in the contraction phase [Korohada, et al; 1983]. Since we know that the organism reacts to blue light we then want to start thinking in what way will blue light react in terms of away from the light source or towards. An experiment by Block and Wohlfarth-Bottermann, it was deduced that blue light induces a negative phototaxis, because it reacts the same way as if white light was irradiated. Blue light produced a change in its oscillatory contraction frequency which leads to a decrease in reaction in the Physarum and increased the distance that the Physarum migrated away from the light source, blue and white in this experiment. [Block and Wohlfarth-Bottermann, 1981]. Therefore, the Physarum deduced that blue light was not an optimal environment, reason for the change in oscillatory contraction frequency, for its organism and decided to move away from it. The decrease in reaction would be from the Physarum communicating with its whole organism to figure out what it should do. Ultimately deducing that the blue light was harmful. Another experiment tested how the plasmodium would react to a far-red light (720nm), red-light region (650nm) and blue light(490). It concluded that the red-light region (650nm) induced a negative phototaxis and the red light region (650nm) led to a positive phototaxis” and the blue light region (490nm) led to a negative phototaxis [Hato, et al; 1976]. The far-red light region at 720nm is on the other side of the spectrum as opposed to blue light making it understandable as to why the Physarum would act in that way if it deduced light within wavelengths. This experiment also leads us to understand that there should be a negative phototaxis response to blue light because of the association with white light as a non-optimal environment for the slime mold. 
We decided to use red light and green light as our experimental lights because red light is in the opposite side of the spectrum of blue light and we know what kind of effect blue light has on our model organism. We also believed that green light would inhibit a similar response to blue light because of their closeness in frequency. If Physarum responds to white light and blue light, which exhibits a wavelength of 490 nm, it should respond similarly to green light at a wavelength of 550nm, similarly deducing that it is not an optimal environment. Therefore, I hypothesize that the green light will lead to a negative phototaxis or no significent difference when comparing white light and green light results because green lights wavelength is closest to blue light (490nm) and Physarum recognizes blue and white light as a harmful environment. I hypothesize that the red light will lead to a positive phototaxis, or a significent difference in results relative to white light, having the opposite effect as blue light. 


Materials and Method:
We took 12 100mm petri plates containing 2% PDA-agar medium sized and then labeled the plate on the backside with our names and the date. On the back we also drew two boxes in the middle of the plate, labeling one box controll (left box) and another start point (right box). The boxes were about 1 cm by 1 cm. We then turned the plate over with the cover facing up. We then sterilized our spatula with ethanol and cut out the center squares only from the plate. We did this to 12 plates, dividing them into 3 groups and placing our color names (red, green, white, no light) on the back top of the plates. We then sterilized the spatula and opened our Physarum stock plate and used the spatula to cut out a line through the middle of the plate. We cut half of the plate of agar into 1-cm blocks. When we finished slicing up half of the stock plate we removed any excess on our spatula and then reserialized it. Then we opened the stock culture plate and removed one 1 cm X 1 cm square of the Physarum culture, that had pieces of oatmeal on them with the bright yellow plasmodium. We then opened our PDA-agar plate and slid the pieces of agar and oatmeal from our stock culture to the wells that we cut out in the PDA-agar plate. After we did that to all 12 plates we wrapped the plates that were labeled no color (controll) completely in foil and placed them with the lids facing up in the drawer at our bench. Then we wrapped the red and green in foil and made sure to label the foil. Then we cut a small square (1c, by 1cm) at the top of the plates to expose the samples to their respective colors (only on the ones labeled, white light, green light and red light). We did this by exposing them to colored light bulbs (red and green). The positive controll, white light, was left with just a square in the foil and left exposed to a regular light bulb. We then waited 18 hours to score our plates. When we scored the results, we made distance away from light source a negative value and distances towards the light source positive. We used a 1 tailed t_test to compare white light values and green light values and then separately compared white light values and red light values. The alpha that deduced significance was 0.05. 

Results:
The red light averaged 0.1cm towards the light source and white light resulted with an average of 0.96cm away from the source of light in figure 1.  The 1 tailed t_test comparing white light and the red light had a p_value of 0.062 with degrees of freedom being 2 and a t-value of 1.94. Green light averaged 1.0cm away from the light source (figure 1). No light had no specific direction but averaged a migration distance of 0.87cm. The statistical test comparing no light with green light resulted with d.f.=2, t-value=0.04 and p_value=0.48. The standard deviation of our positive controll was plus 0.35 cm and minus 0.35cm. Green’s standard deviation was plus and minus 1.38 cm and red was plus and minus 0.88. And no light was plus 0.55 and minus 0.35cm.

Discussion:
It was predicted that green light will lead to a negative phototaxis or no significent difference because green lights (550nm) wavelength is closest to blue light (490nm) and Physarum recognizes blue and white light as a harmful environment therefore P. polycephalum will also deduce green light as harmful. Based on the results found with the 1-tailed t_test, do in fact support my hypothesis for green light. It was also hypothesized that red light will lead to a positive phototaxis, or a significent difference in results relative to white light, having the opposite effect as blue has. Based on the results found, the p_value was not significent enough to support our hypothesis deducing that red light relative to white light had no significent difference. We can infer that green light has a more significent effect on P. polycephalum than red light. 
The p_value of 0.48 in regard to green light compared to white light was greater than 0.05 alpha, meaning that there was no significent difference, supporting the hypothesis. Our standard deviation for the green light was plus or minus 1.38 cm meaning that our data was very variable and potentially not as reliable which could have affected our results. For white light our standard deviation was plus or minutes 0.39 cm, which had less variation than green light did. Based on our averages, green averaged 1cm away from the light source. Whereas white light averaged a distance of 0.97cm away from the light source. White light and green light had a negative phototaxis reaction, but the results were not significent enough which is what was wanted. 
The p_value comparing white light with red light was 0.062 which does not support our hypothesis because the p_value is larger than alpha, 0.05. In figure 1, we can see that red light had a positive value meaning that the P. polycephalum went towards the red light and the white light treatment went away from the source of light but these results were not significent enough to conclude significance. 
In many experiments that tested how P.polycephalum would react to red light there was a main focus on how the mechanism worked but I over looked the potential effect of the method in which the experiments were conducted. One experiment had starved their Physarum for 12 hours before illuminating their sample with light. When Physarum is starved or if the humidity decreases the plasmodium begins to harden and then into a suspended stage called a sclerotium, a term for gradual desiccation [Johnson, 2018] This is also a hibernation state that the Physarum lives in. This could have been a rational explanation for why our Physarum acted in a way that was not significent enough as predicted because the Physarum had plenty of nutrients. Our P. polycephalum was not starved and we used PDA-agar. This could have led to why we were not able to get significent results for the red light treatment. Physarum is also found to be mostly sedentary when it is in a well-nourished environment and a starved Physarum will tend to migrate rapidly over surfaces which can be why we only viewed an average of 0.1 cm of distance traveled towards the red light as opposed to a greater value.  Another difference from our method and most experiments was the condition of our room in which the P. polycephalum was in. The room temperature was below normal room temperature and that is not the optimal temperature the Physarum likes to be in. When Physarum is in cold temperatures there is a disruption of the microfilament structure that’s necessary to keep the maintenance of the cell shape, this is because cold temperature induced a intracellular Ca2+ release within Physarum. [Uyeda, T. Q., & Furuya, M.;1986]. This at the end disrupts the shuttle streaming that Physarum use to move around. 
Overall the physarrum samples were faulty and didn’t achieve the results that was expected of them. Also, our Physarum stock dish wasn’t heavily grown so we had to get another stock Physarum in order to get a well grown product. We also observed heavy sporulation and not a direct pattern of migrating direction. Other students in our lab found non-significent results and non-growing Physarum which could support the idea that the Physarum was in its late stage of plasmodia and in a vegetative state. At this stage of life, Physarum will transfer its energy to reproduction and not looking for a food source. In an experiment by Bialczyk, it was found that young plasmodia might migrate towards dark places and mature, fully developed plasmodia that are in a vegetative growth, have been shows to go towards lighted areas [Bialczyk; 1979]. This could potentially offer another rational as to why our Physarum didn’t experience a stronger migration towards the red light. As said earlier, our Physarum was not fully grown so we had to take some of the not fully grown Physarum and the other stock dishes that were fully grown. This could have given us mixed migration and insignificent results because the old Physarum did go towards the red light and some of the young Physarum went towards the darker areas.  
For future experiments we could test how starvation and non-starvation affect the migration of Physarum since it was deduced that the variable could have an effect on the Physarum sample that we used. Instead of using PDA-agar plates we could use water-agar plates and compared it to the PDA-agar plates to see how much an effect to migration it would result in. We could also test other colors on the spectrum and see if Physarum would react similarly to that of green and white color, perhaps using violet could result in the same results because of its proximity to blue light. Through research, it was found that blue light could be coupled with respiration within Physarum. This could be interesting to experiment with, we could variable the amount of oxygen Physarum is exposed to see the changes in motility when exposed to white light.
Something that we could have changed in our method was the amount of samples we used in each treatment. A larger sample size could have given us the significent result for red light treatment that we expected. Also keeping our Physarum stock culture to one could have also maybe given us more consistent results and limited the amount of variables we had.
