Title: The Altered Sciatic Nerve Response to Electrical Stimuli in Frog Legs Resulting from Calcium Inhibition

Abstract:
Understanding excitation-contraction coupling is crucial to examining the phenomenon of muscle contraction. The transmission of an action potential from a nerve to a muscle fiber causes contraction of a muscle, and the release of calcium in the muscle fiber is an important component to this contractile action. In this experiment, the effects of a calcium inhibitor upon strength of the sciatic nerve response of a frog leg will be measured. It was hypothesized that if a calcium inhibitor was injected into the frog leg, then the sciatic nerve response would change. While the differences in neural response between the control and experimental groups supported the hypothesis, the inconsistencies in trend of the various responses of the two groups in relation to each other caused the results to not be significant. The average sciatic response of the control frog legs was 0.628 V, and the average sciatic response of the experimental frog legs was 0.401 V. This indicates that the experiment needs to be conducted again to observe and analyze the diminishing effect of calcium inhibition upon sciatic nerve response.

Introduction:
The facilitation of nerve impulses is crucial for a muscle response. When the muscle fibers receive a nerve impulse, they release calcium from their sarcoplasmic reticulum to initiate contraction [Johnson: 2018]. However, the muscle will only respond if its threshold has been met by the nerve impulse it received; further, a nerve will only respond to an action potential and release a nerve impulse if its threshold has also been met [Raymond: 1979]. Because the amount of calcium available to the nerve and ATP in the organism determines the strength of the nerve’s response, this experiment examines the effect of calcium inhibition on the response of the sciatic nerve to an electrical stimulus. The leg of a frog, specifically the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle, was the medium upon which this experiment was conducted. The accessibility and ability to control the neural response made the frog legs the clear choice for this experiment. Treating the frog legs with a calcium inhibitor, the neural response of the control and experimental group was measured. The hypothesis states that if calcium is inhibited, then the sciatic nerve response will change. 

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were used in this experiment, and they served as both their own experimental and control group. Each leg was dissected by pulling down the skin and exposing the leg muscles. The nerve was pulled away from the surrounding upper-thigh muscle, and it was crucial to not touch metal to the nerve. After the leg was dissected, the frog Ringer’s solution was used to keep the tissue from drying out. A leg was then tested as the control group by administering various volts of an electrical stimulus- 0.5 V, 0.75 V, and 1.00 V- from a force transducer in the iWork electrophysiological recorder to display an electromyogram of the sciatic nerve response. The same leg was then tested as the experimental group after injecting 0.2 mL of calcium inhibitor by repeating the same steps as were used to test the control group. This entire process was then repeated with the two remaining frog legs. Changes among the sciatic nerve response to different voltages in the control and experimental group were observed. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine the difference in the average sciatic response of the frog legs that weren’t injected with calcium inhibitor in comparison to the legs that were given a calcium inhibitor. 



Results:
The average sciatic response of the control frog legs was 0.628 V, with the responses ranging from 0.778 V to 0.496 V (Figure 1). The average sciatic response of the experimental frog legs was 0.401 V, with the responses ranging from 0.884 V to 0.051 V (Figure 1). A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the results of our calcium inhibitor experiment. The average difference of the neural responses between the control and experimental group was sizeable but not significant at -0.2273 V (t-value= 1.1824, degrees of freedom= 2, p-value= 0.3586). The two groups had divergent intensities in voltage from the beginning of the experiment with evident inconsistencies in the neural responses; the response of the group with the calcium inhibitor was sometimes larger than the control response and vice versa, and there was also a large range of recorded sciatic responses within each group.

Discussion:
The hypothesis, that the sciatic nerve response would change if calcium was inhibited, was not accepted. The general trend of the data appeared as if it could support the hypothesis, but the statistical test indicated that the results were not significant. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the results were not due to chance. Even though the results were not significant, there was still a noticeable change in the responses between the control and experimental group. However, it was unclear of what trend the experimental and control groups were following in relation to one another.  Inhibiting calcium in the nerve decreases the strength of neural response and neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction- this causes a weakening of the muscle contraction [Wright: 1996]. The inconsistent decrease in sciatic nerve response of the experimental group caused various degrees of intensity of gastrocnemius contraction; the neural response must decrease for neural response to decrease. Since calcium concentration dictates the strength of the neural response and subsequent muscle contraction, the calcium-inhibited frog legs should have shown a constant decrease in volts of sciatic response. However, since the experimental response values were so sporadic in comparison to the control values, it makes sense that the results were not significant; this could be attributed to the various amounts of ATP in each frog leg, because this would affect the amount of energy available to each nerve to conduct an impulse. A possible source of error might be that some of the calcium inhibitor might have leaked out of the frog leg at the time of injection. Other studies have shown that the blocking of calcium has prevented calcium dependent functions, such as nerve impulses from taking place [Wright: 1996]. Future studies should focus on the addition of supplemental calcium to observe if additional calcium strengthens the neural response and lack of calcium truly has adverse effects on the strength of the response. Applying the results of this calcium inhibition experiment in frog legs to the human neuromuscular system, these conclusions could lead to various techniques to improve and examine neuromuscular disorders, such as ALS or multiple sclerosis.
