Title: The effect of injecting the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens with tetraammonium chloride on the threshold for muscle contraction

Abstract:
Muscle contraction is an important feature of body movement that allows organisms to respond through the tensing of the muscle fibers known as a twitch. This experiment observes the effects of injecting tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania pipiens on the threshold for muscle contraction. It was hypothesized that the threshold would increase following the injection of the TEA into the gastrocnemus muscle due to the blockage of potassium. Through establishing a positive concentration within the cell it would require a higher amount of sodium for depolarization in order to conduct additional action potentials. Through stimulating the sciatic nerve of three Northern Leopard frog legs the threshold before and after the injections of .1 Ml TEA were determined using a force transducer and electrode. This resulted in an average decrease in the threshold following the TEA injection as opposed to the expected increase, with a p_value greater than 0.05. Through observing the abnormal and inconsistent behavior of the legs following the injection the results were deemed insignificent and no further conclusions on the effects of TEA on muscle contraction could be made through this data.

Introduction:
Movement involves a system of motoneurons and muscle fibers that work together in order to produce muscle contractions in the form of a twitch. Motor neurons that stem from the spinal cord communicate with the muscle fibers through neural impulses called action potentials in response to a stimulus in the environment, or whenever movement is required [Sadava:2017]. In order for a neuron to produce an action potential it must first depolarize through the influx of sodium and then repolarize by permitting the efflux of potassium from the cell membrane. This process is responsible for bringing the cell back to its resting potential which prepares it for additional stimulation, and in terms of motor units this repolarization phase permits additional movement [Sadava:2017].

This experiment observes the effects of stimulation on the sciatic nerve of the Rania pipiens species before and after the injection of .1 Ml of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) into the gastrocnemus muscle of the leg. This species belongs to the order Anura which includes all frogs and toads, and is commonly known as the Northern Leopard frog [“Rania pipiens”: 2007]. The sciatic nerve of this species runs along the thigh and controlls the gastrocnemus muscle, and when this gastrocnemus muscle is isolated the stimulation of the sciatic nerve can be directly observed through its response. The ability to observe the muscle’s response in addition to the easy accessibility of the sciatic nerve through an incision establishes the Rania pipiens as a model organism for this experiment. By stimulating the sciatic nerve of this species the change in threshold for muscle contraction will be dependent upon the TEA introduced into the gastrocnemus muscle. TEA serves as a “potassium-selective ion channel blocker”, which should call into question how the conduction of the action potential will be affected when potassium ions are blocked from leaving the neuron following the influx of sodium [NIH: 2018]. A previous experiment on the sartorius muscle of the Japanese toad demonstrated that injecting fibers with TEA prolonged the duration of the action potential by slowing the repolarization phase [Hagiwara: 1955]. This supports that if the potassium is blocked from leaving the cell then the cell cannot fully return to its normal resting potential value due to the high concentration of potassium that extends the duration of the repolarization phase. Resultantly the threshold to produce another action potential will become a much larger, positive value due to the higher amount of sodium it would take to reverse the membrane potential again. Additionally as observed in the Japanese toad, after repetitive stimulation the amplitude of the action potential was reduced and eventually the cell became disabled from producing additional action potentials when a high amount of TEA was introduced due to the increased demand to meet the threshold [Hagiwara: 1955].This may pose problems for an organism if they need to react to an environmental stimulus quickly, and could ultimately paralyze the muscle fibers. Furthermore, if potassium is blocked through introducing TEA into the gastrocnemus muscle of the Northern Leopard frog, the threshold of the sciatic nerve will increase. This ultimately would increase the amount of stimulus and time it would take for the muscle fiber to fire an action potential, slowing the rate of muscle contraction. 


Materials and Method:

The leg of the Northern Leopard Frog was placed in a dissecting pan, and forceps were used to pull the skin at the top of the leg down to the food to expose the muscle. The inner thigh muscle was separated to reveal the white sciatic nerve, which was freed from the connective tissue. The upper thigh was then pinned to the pan and a string was tied to the tendon that was connected to the force transducer, which was adjusted to a height that provided slight tension to the string. This setup allows for the gastrocnemus muscle to be observed. The sciatic nerve was then draped on top of the electrode pins laying on the pan and ringers was added to the leg. The Labscribe program was used in order to monitor the muscle contraction. After set up of the stimulator controll panel the pulse amplitude was applied and recorded until the first muscle contraction was presented on the screen while also visibly demonstrated as a small jerk in the gastrocnemus muscle. The smallest voltage that produced a twitch was found and recorded as the threshold for muscle contraction before the TEA was added for the first leg. Next .1 Ml of TEA was injected all throughout the gastrocnemus muscle and the twitch threshold was found through the same process. Next the thresholds for muscle contraction of the remaining two frog legs were determined before and after the injection of the TEA. A one tailed paired t_test was used to compare the controll and experimental threshold values in order to test the effects of TEA on the muscle contraction of the Northern Leopard frog leg.


Results:
Overall each frog leg demonstrated very different responses to the ringer and stimulation from the electrodes. The first frog leg took a substantial amount of time and stimulation before producing a twitch and revealed a minor decrease in threshold stimulated by a slightly smaller stimulus amplitude after the adding TEA. The second and third frog leg behaved very differently compared to the first leg, both remaining in a constant twitching state after adding ringers before the stimulation and continuing after disconnection from the electrode. The second frog leg showed the largest decrease in threshold with a small reduction of stimulus amplitude that it took to generate this force. In contrast the final frog leg revealed a small increase in threshold while maintaining the same amplitude stimulation that produced the thresholds before and after adding TEA. The results of the experiment revealed that the thresholds for the legs prior to TEA averaged at 0.03433± .01963 and the legs following TEA injection averaged at 0.01743± .016086 (Fig. 1). The paired t_test revealed that the threshold averages for the controll and experimental data were not statistically significently different (t_stat=0.896198, d.f.=2, P=.464722).


Discussion:
The results of this study revealed that the controll and experimental data were not statistically significently different. Overall there was a slight decline in the average threshold when given the TEA, however the results were concluded as insignificent due to evidence of error found within this experiment. First the thresholds for each leg before the 0.1 Ml of TEA was added were much lower than normal. Secondly the TEA demonstrated little to no effect on the threshold for the Rania pipiens muscle contraction as the values revealed very little and inconsistent change that either increased or decreased. These results may be explained by the inappropriate behaviors of the legs with the first being overly stagnant and the final two demonstrating excessive twitching. The excessive twitching may be the result of excess ions found within the leg that contribute to a constant abnormal muscle tension which in return affects the muscle response to stimulation by affecting its sensitivity. The limited movement of the first leg may be the result of too few ions present which could also affect the sensitivity to stimulation, therefore the presence or absence of ions may play a role in the results of the data. Due to this abnormal behavior that revealed inconsistent changes to the threshold our hypothesis can neither be confirmed or denied based on this specific data. Ultimately with stimulating the sciatic nerve of the frog leg after injecting .1 Ml of TEA into the gastrocnemus muscle the blocked potassium should have caused an increase in the threshold, as illustrated through the prolongation of the repolarization period after injecting TEA into the Japanese toad’s muscle that made it difficult to return the cell back to its resting potential [Hagiwara: 1955]. Without significent data it cannot be determined whether blocking the potassium from leaving the cell following depolarization truly causes the threshold for muscle contraction to increase, therefore we cannot confidently conclude that TEA would prevent species such as the Rania pipiens from responding appropriately to a stimulus that demands muscle contraction. However the hazardous capabilities of a high concentration of TEA presented by the Japanese toad experiment should still be considered [Hagiwara: 1955]. For example, if humans are not able to conduct action potentials to induce muscle movement after immense exposure to TEA than exposure could inhibit the population in many ways and pose an overall threat to their survival.
