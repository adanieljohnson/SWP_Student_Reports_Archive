Title: Influence of Juvenile Hormone on Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Juvenile Hormone cause important changes in larva insects' development. With changing environment, it is important to understand how insects alter their development in response to hormone level changes. Here we look at the effect of Juvenile Hormone on the development (specifically weight) of a moth, Menduca Sexta. The hypothesis was that the caterpillars would have a much heavier weight if fed with 1% JH in their diet compared with caterpillars fed with 0% JH in their diet in order to better prepare for pupating. This hypothesis is supported by our data since the test result showed significant difference in mean mass difference of the two groups. This difference, along with our observation that caterpillars in 1% JH group have lighter green color; suggests that in response to elevated JH level, caterpillars would gain weight. This adaptation allows Manduca Sexta to be better prepared for pupating. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of Juvenile Hormone on development of moth Manduca Sexta. Manduca Sexta is an inset(pest) in the order Lepidoptera.[Dept. of Biology: 2018] The reason why Manduca Sexta is used in this experiment is that it is large compared to other insects, and Manduca Sexta has a life cycle of around 20 days.[Dept. of Biology: 2018] Also, it can be raised in the laboratory easily since its diet could be an artificial diet and the hormone level can be easily regulated in their diet.[Sanes: 1976] Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone that regulates the type of molting during insect development[Dept. of Biology:2018] With the decreasing of JH, Manduca Sexta enters the pupa stage. [Cymborowsk: 1981] Accordingly, Manduca Sexta would remain in larva stage and continuously gaining weight with the increase in Juvenile Hormone. This experiment treats caterpillars with an increased amount of Juvenile Hormone and record their weight as an indicator of their development. The hypothesis is that if the caterpillars are fed with higher concentration of JH in their diet, they would gain weight. The dependent variable is Manduca Sexta's weight, and the independent variable is the concentration of JH added to caterpillars' diet.

Materials and Methods:
Four Menduca Sexta caterpillars received 10g each of caterpillar diet prepared according to manufacturer's instructions with 5 drops of water added. 
Four Menduca Sexta caterpillars received 10g each of caterpillar diet prepared according to manufacturer's instructions with 5 drops of JH solution. 
Both groups are kept in the same standard condition and food is changed when browned.  Each caterpillar is weighed every day using a standard lab balance and the weight is recorded. The difference between the weight of the caterpillar at the first day and the heaviest weight of the caterpillar is also recorded. The average of the mass difference is recorded in both groups. A one-tailed two sample t-test is used to determine the differences in average weight gain of Manduca Sexta caterpillars having standard diet compared to Manduca Sexta caterpillars having increased JH diet.


Results:
Table 1 includes the mean mass difference of the two groups and the t-test statistics. Table 2 includes the original data recorded. Figure 3 is the graph of weight of the caterpillars vs. the concentration of JH in the diet.  The mean mass difference of the group treated with 0% Juvenile Hormone is 6.3975g and the mean mass difference of the group treated with 1% Juvenile Hormone is 13.7775g (Table 1). The standard deviation for mass difference in the 0% JH group is 4.2663 and the standard deviation for mass difference in 1% JH group is 1.2708 (Table 1). The one-tailed two sample t-test results is that: t-value is 3.3157; p-value is 0.008045 (Table 1). The caterpillars in the 1% JH group have a light green color while the caterpillars in the 0% JH group have a dark green color and two began pupating.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if the caterpillars are fed with higher concentration of JH in their diet, they would gain weight, was supported by the experiment results. We observed significant difference at the 0.05 level, suggesting that there is significant difference between the mass difference of the 0% JH group and the 1% JH group. That means increased JH level in caterpillars' diet would cause their weight to increase. This result combined with the observation that the caterpillars in the 1% JH group have the color of a light green while the 0% JH group caterpillars have dark green and two began pupating shows the caterpillars with excess JH remain in the larva stage. As the Juvenile Hormones level decrease, Manduca Sexta would start molting and pupating and they became lighter. [Kiguchi: 1978] They gain weight because they didn't receive signals of JH decrease and they continued to prepare for pupating. The caterpillars in the 0% JH group follow the normal growth pattern and have received the signal of JH decreasing so they stop gaining weight and start pupating. Understanding the influence of Juvenile Hormone in development of Manduca Sexta would further our understanding of the artificial change of hormones' influence to development of insects.
