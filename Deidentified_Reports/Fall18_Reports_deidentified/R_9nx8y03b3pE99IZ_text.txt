Title: The Varied Effects of Temperature on the Photosynthetic Rate of the Highly-Adaptable Species Elodea 

Abstract:
There are many environmental factors that affect the process of photosynthesis in plants. Some of these factors include light intensity, carbon dioxide, and temperature. In this lab different temperatures are tested with isolated chloroplasts to try to determine the ideal temperature for the photosynthesis of Elodea, a water weed. This was done by first isolating chloroplasts of Elodea by centrifugation then placing three test tubes of chloroplasts in water baths of each of the following conditions: 34 ℃, 22 ℃, or 10 ℃. The assays were initiated by 130 mM DCIP, and the absorbances were taken every ten minutes over a thirty minute period to track change in photosynthetic rate. It was found that there was no clear trend in change in photosynthetic rate in any of the three conditions. This is likely due to the fact that Elodea are very common in many different types of bodies of water. They have a high adaptability and can withstand various temperatures and water conditions. Elodea are even considered an invasive species. Due to these unique characteristics of Elodea, the results of this lab could have many multiple explanations some of which have to do with the denaturation of enzymes due to high temperature, adaptability of plants, and the time constraints of the lab period. 

Introduction:
All living organisms require energy to survive. This energy must be first extracted from external sources and then converted into a usable form. Animals do this through a process called cellular respiration where stored energy from food is released in the cytoplasm through glycolysis, a process that breaks down glucose. Subsequently, ATP is generated in the mitochondria [Brown: 2009]. Plants have a different process that yields basically the same result. Plants use and store energy from the sun in a biological process called photosynthesis [Tanaka: 2009]. Together, cellular respiration and photosynthesis make up two of the most vital processes in life [Brown: 2009].
	Since the subjects of this lab are Elodea (water weeds), energy acquisition through photosynthesis will be the main focus of this report. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts (a plant’s storage molecule) capture light from the sun and absorb this solar energy in the form of electrons. These electrons then leave the chlorophyll, move to the plastiquinone, and oxygen is formed from the cleavage of water. The extra hydrogens from water create a proton gradient. This part of photosynthesis is called Photosystem II. In what is called Photosystem I, NADPH is produced by the electrons from solar energy traveling through NADP+. Together, Photosystems II and I make up the Light Dependent Reactions of Photosynthesis. The Light Dependent Reactions generate the proton gradient that is necessary for the synthesis of ATP [Johnson: 2018]. Once NADPH is produced from this cycle, the enzyme complex RUBISCO uses the combination of ATP, NADPH, carbon dioxide, and ribulose phosphate to produce glucose molecules from which energy can be used [Brown: 2009]. 
	There are many factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis. The conditions for photosynthesis are very important for determining the efficiency of the process in the organism [Smith, 1936]. Some of the main factors that affect photosynthesis include carbon dioxide, light intensity, and like almost every other growth process, temperature [Berry: 1980]. In this lab, the effects of different temperature will be tested on the photosynthesis of Elodea, a water weed. Elodea are a particularly unique species because they are highly adaptable to temperature . This quality has created a problem where Elodea are considered an invasive species in some areas since they can photosynthesize in a wide range of conditions [Carey: 2016]. Temperature affects specifically the light independent reactions of photosynthesis because these reactions are catalyzed by enzymes. Enzymes are very sensitive to temperature. Enzymes have an ideal temperature, and a temperature at which they begin to become altered or denature. As enzymes near their optimum temperature, photosynthetic rate increases [Markings: 2018]. However, according to literature, exposure to extreme temperatures can inhibit photosynthesis and seriously alter its rate [Berry: 1980]. Since the optimum temperature for Elodea is between 10 and 25 ℃ [Carey: 2016], the room temperature and cold conditions will have a higher rate of photosynthesis than the hot condition sample. 
	

Materials and Method:
A bundle of Elodea was gathered and the leaves were stripped and added to a cold mortar and pestle to be ground. 10 Ml cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), was added and the mixture was ground until there were no large chunks left. 10 additional Ml grinding buffer were added to mix, and the slurry was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled, mid-size beaker. 
	The filtered liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube to spin at 200 times the force of gravity (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for three minutes at 4 ℃. The liquid was centrifuged a second time, this time at 1000 times the force of gravity (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4 ℃. The supernatant was poured into another clean 50 Ml tube, and the pellet was then suspended using 20 Ml cold grinding buffer so as to isolate the chloroplasts.
	Once the chloroplasts were isolated, ten test tubes were prepared. The blank contained 8 Ml water with 2 Ml buffer. And nine more tubes were prepared with 6 Ml water, 100 microliters chloroplast solution, 2 Ml 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) each. The chloroplasts and DCIP were added last to start the assay. Three tubes were assigned to each condition, 10 ℃, room temperature (approximately 22 ℃), and 34 ℃ respectively. The tubes were placed in their appropriate water baths and the absorbances of each were taken at times 0 minutes, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. The 10 ℃ ice bath was maintained between 10 and 12 ℃ with the occasional addition of ice. The average absorbances of each time and group were recorded. Percent change in absorbance after each 10 minute increment was calculated to determine changes in rate of photosynthesis using the Hill Reaction equation below. 

% change = [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at time ‘N’)/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100% 

Finally, the results were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA statistical test with an alpha value of 0.05. 


Results:
As can be seen in Figure 1, the chloroplast solution left in 34 ℃ water bath had an average increase in the rate of photosynthesis during the first 20 minutes, but experienced a decrease in photosynthetic rate during the last 10 minutes. The cold condition (~10 ℃) had a slight initial decrease in the rate of photosynthesis in the first 10 minutes, but an increase in photosynthetic rate in the second 10 minutes and leveled off after 30 minutes. The room temperature (~22 ℃) group’s photosynthetic rate dropped initially, but increased after the second and third 10 minute increments; however did not photosynthesize as rapidly as the hot or cold conditions. 
The three conditions tested yielded a p_value of 0.89. There were also 2 degrees of freedom among groups, 6 within groups, and 8 total. 


Discussion:
This lab tested the effects of temperature on the photosynthesis of Elodea (water weeds). This was done using absorbance. A positive percent change in absorbance meant an increase in the rate of photosynthesis while a negative percent change denoted a decrease. 
	It was hypothesized that the cold and room temperature groups would exhibit faster rates of photosynthesis; however, this was not necessarily supported by the results. As can be seen in Figure 1, the group placed in hot conditions started out with a positive spike in the rate of photosynthesis, but after thirty minutes its rate had dipped below the rate of photosynthesis in the cold condition. The room temperature group had the lowest rate of photosynthesis throughout, though the rate slightly increased in the last 20 minutes. 
	There are many possible reasons for this data. One factor to take into account is that this experiment only ran for 30 minutes. 30 minutes is not a long amount of time to test the optimal temperature for photosynthesis in Elodea. If this experiment were to be done again, ideally it would be done over a number of days, or even weeks for the best and most conclusive results. Elodea can be found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving waters. Because of this wide range of possible living environments, Elodea are known to be able to endure many water conditions [Carey: 2016]. This likely means that Elodea, like many other plants, are easily adaptable, and the fluctuations that can be seen in Figure 1 would have likely decreased over longer periods of time due to adaptation. Also, since Elodea can endure a large range of temperatures, the cold and room temperature conditions would have likely evened out and been the same once the plants adapted to the new environment. 
	According to Carey et al., the ideal temperature for the photosynthesis of Elodea lies between 10 and 25 ℃ [Carey: 2016]. This is why it is curious that the hot condition began with a spike in photosynthetic rate. The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are catalyzed by enzymes that can be denatured by too high a temperature (approximately above 25 ℃ in the case of Elodea) [Markings: 2018]. It is possible that during the first 20 minutes of the experiment, the chloroplasts were still adjusting to the new temperature, and the enzymes had not been denatured yet. However, by the third 10 minute increment, the enzymes began to become denatured, which caused the light-independent reactions to not be catalyzed and the rate of photosynthesis to go down suddenly. 
	In conclusion, more time is needed in this experiment to fully determine the ideal temperature for photosynthesis in Elodea. With more time, more conclusive analysis of the results could be realized. However even with more time, the data from this lab could be difficult to understand in part due to the adaptability of Elodea. Their ability to adapt to different temperatures and environments makes them a good invasive species in aquatic ecosystems worldwide [Carey: 2016].
