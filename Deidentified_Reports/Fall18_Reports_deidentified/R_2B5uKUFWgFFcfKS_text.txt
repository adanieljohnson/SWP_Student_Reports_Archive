Title: The Effect of Artificial Herbivory on Radish Resource Allocation

Abstract:
This experiment will analyze how resource allocation will change in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum) when exposed to artificial insect herbivory. Large mammals and insects consume parts of plants through herbivory and the plants naturally react by shifting the location of resources to limit the negative effects of the herbivory. I hypothesized that the plants affected by artificial herbivory will react by decreasing their root to shoot ratios in order to compensate for the loss of plant area by herbivory. To test my claim, radish plants were separated into groups of four where one group acted as a control and the other group had incisions made on the plant leaves relative to the size of caterpillar herbivory. After growing the plants for two weeks, the root to shoot ratio for both length and weight were analyzed for the two groups. My original hypothesis was supported in both categories, but the data were only statistically significant for length but not weight. The results of the experiment and results of contrasting experiments support that he plants possibly allocated more resources to their shoots in response to the artificial herbivory because the necessary amount of photosynthesis reactions were not occurring due to decreased leaf area.

Introduction:
Throughout this experiment I will analyze the effects of artificial herbivory on resource allocation in radishes (Raphanus raphanistrum). Herbivory refers to the eating of plants by other organisms while the plant is still alive, usually by insects and larger herbivores (6). Deer and other herbivorous mammals tend to eat entire leaves when consuming a plant; however, smaller insects tend to dissect only part of the leaf when consuming parts of plants (4). In addition, herbivory on the actual stem of the plants will have more drastic effects on resource allocation than herbivory on the leaves because more vital processes occur in the plant stems (1). For that reason, the artificial herbivory being imposed on the radishes will mimic insect herbivory because the radishes being grown do not have a large amount of leaves. To respond to the challenges of the artificial herbivory, the plants will allocate resources in new ways to compensate for herbivory (7). The plants can shift resources in response to the challenge because they each have a degree of phenotypic plasticity (7). The experiment will attempt to distinguish whether the plant will allocate more resources to the roots or the shoots to compensate for the herbivory. I believe that the plant will allocate more resources to the shoots because the artificial herbivory results in a loss of plant area that needs to be recovered to allow the necessary amounts of photosynthesis reactions to occur. For that reason, I hypothesize that plants affected by herbivory will have decreased root to shoot ratios for both length and weight.

Materials and Methods:
To simulate artificial herbivory on plant resource allocation, radishes were grown in eight sections, four of which were left alone as a control and four of which went through artificial herbivory. Each section had approximately 15 radish seeds in the soil at the beginning of the experiment. To simulate herbivory, one week into the experiment, small parts of every leaf that each plant had were cut out similar to the size a caterpillar would cut out in natural settings. Water, sunlight, and soil conditions were all kept constant for both groups. The procedure lasted two weeks until the plants were removed from their soil, washed the plants of remaining soil, and measured their root to shoot ratio for both mass and length, measured in g and cm respectively. We measured three plants in each of the four sections of both control plants and plants that underwent artificial herbivory, resulting in a total of 24 plants being measured for data. To compare the results of the experiment, two sample, one-tailed t-tests were used to synthesize the difference in plant resource allocation in terms of both weight and length. Both of the t-tests were analyzed with an alpha level of 0.05.

Results:
In general, the plants affected by artificial herbivory displayed a higher amount of resource allocation to shoots and a lower amount of resource allocation to the roots compared to the control plants. The average R:S length ratio for plants under artificial herbivory was 2.66 +/- 0.62 (fig 1.), which happened to be lower than the average R:S length ratio for the control group, 3.39 +/- 0.14 (fig 1.). The plants affected by artificial herbivory displayed a similar trend for R:S weight ratios. The average R:S weight ratio for plants under artificial herbivory is 0.37 +/- 0.06 (fig 2.), which is lower than the average R:S weight for the control, 0.46 +/- 0.12 (fig 2.). For both length and weight, the plants in the control group allocated more resources to the development of roots instead of shoots, which yielded a larger R:S ratio for the control group for both length and weight. For R:S length, the difference in mean ratio between the control group and the test group was statistically significant (t-stat=2.47, df=22, p-value=0.011). However, for R:S weight, the difference in mean ratio between the control group and the test group was not statistically significant (t-stat=1.66, df=6, p-value=0.074). Even though the data was only statistically significant for R:S length, both methods of analysis showed a higher amount of resource allocation to the shoots in result of artificial herbivory. 

Discussion:
The data collected supports my original hypothesis that artificial herbivory results in a lower R:S ratio for both length and weight, although the data was not statistically significant for R:S weight. The plants that underwent artificial herbivory probably allocated more resources to their shoots to compensate for the loss of potential energy from photosynthesis reactions occurring in the leaves (8) However, there are many possible reasons why artificial herbivory resulted in resource allocation to the shoots. For example, A study focusing on plant reaction to herbivory in tropical climates found that plants would increase weight in shoots but concluded that the main purpose was to increase leaf length (5). Although leaf area was not measured in our experiment, results can be expected to be similar as leaf area expanded as a compensatory mechanism. In a contrast study, researchers found that below ground herbivory resulted in a decrease in shoot weight (4). These results suggest that it could be possible that plants naturally allocate to overcompensate for whatever area of the plant was affected first, supporting the conclusion regarding aboveground herbivory. The timing of when the herbivory occurs in the plant’s life also impacts how resource allocation will react in the long run (2). However, plants in early stages of development tend to allocate sugars quickly to their roots as a defense to herbivory in early stages of life which could have possibly skewed our data in favor of an opposite conclusion (3). Therefore, the experiment could be improved if the experiment was extended for another 1-2 weeks. The side-effects of early herbivory would be reduced, and that the data would be statistically significant for R:S weight ratio, fully supporting our initial hypothesis. In addition, the radish plants’ leaves would increase inside and the effects of the herbivory would be more easily displayed.
