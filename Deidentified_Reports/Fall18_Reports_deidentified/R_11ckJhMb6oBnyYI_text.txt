Title: The Effect of a Fake Fish on the Aggressive Behaviors of Betta Splendens 

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to determine the change in level of aggression in a male betta fish (Betta splendens) when exposed to a fake fish versus a real male betta fish. It was hypothesized that there would be a higher level of aggressive behaviors when in the presence of a real male fish than a fake one. Multiple different male betta fish were exposed to a fake fish and a real fish and had their behaviors recorded each time. Then the data was quantified and statistical tests were performed to determine the significance. The results showed that there was an increase in amount of aggressive behaviors towards the real fish, but the results were not statistically significant. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we are studying betta fish (Betta splendens) and their aggressive behavioral reaction to another male betta fish versus a fake one. Betta fish are a very common small fish in Thailand and react to the presence of other males by changing color and flaring their gills [Johnson: 2018]. It is known that betta fish perform aggressive threat displays towards other fish [Meliska: 1976]. For the most part bettas are aggressive to other bettas but in some cases, they have been seen to be aggressive to other species of fish or mirror images of themselves [Johnson: 1973]. Their behavior will be quantitatively determined based on number of times specific behaviors are exhibited. It is hypothesized that the male betta fish will exhibit less aggressive behaviors when in the presence of a fake betta fish as opposed to another male betta fish. 


Materials and Methods:
The procedure was carried out with four different male betta fish. A male fish was placed in one chamber of a fish tank and a fake fish in another chamber so they were separated by a glass barrier and an opaque barrier. The opaque barrier in between was then removed and the fish was observed for five minutes while recording a number based on type of behavior/level of aggression and times exhibited. The scale used was a value of one for pelvic fin flicking and pectoral fins erect, a value of two for tail beating and opercula expansion, and a value of three for tail flashing and red mane. The opaque barrier was then put back and the fish was rested for five minutes. Another male fish was placed in the other chamber of the fish tank. The opaque barrier between the two male fishes was removed, leaving just the glass. Then they were observed for five minutes while recording aggressive behaviors like before. The opaque barrier was then put back and the fish was rested for five minutes. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to compare the level of aggression and determine the statistical significance of the results.


Results:
It was observed that the male betta fish were in most cases more aggressive toward the live fish than the fake one. Therefore, there was a trend in Figure 1 similar that the level of aggression was higher towards a real male fish at 70.00 versus 9.68 to a fake fish. There was not a statistically significant difference between the level of aggression towards a fake fish vs a real fish (t-stat=1.62, df=6, p=0.16). 


Discussion:
Based on the data collected, the hypothesis that the male betta fish would react more aggressively to a real male betta fish as opposed to a fake betta fish was not supported. The data did show a trend like the hypothesis predicted, but it was not significant. This most likely occurred because of the small sample size and the presence of outliers in the study. A previous study done by Janice and Charles Meliska showed lower amounts of aggressive behavior in male betta fish towards a mirror image of another fish compared to a live fish [Meliska: 1976]. Therefore, it is known that there is a less aggressive response to inanimate fishlike objects compared to a real live fish, which supports the trend seen in our experiment. 
Further research could be done to determine if the trend would become statistically significant if more fish were tested because it is reasonable to have some difference based on different fish. Other research could be done with other aggressive fish to see if they generally have the same trend observed with the betta fish.
