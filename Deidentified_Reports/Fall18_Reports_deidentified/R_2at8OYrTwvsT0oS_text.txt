Title: The Mass Gain Effect of Juvenile Hormone Imitator on Manduca sexta larvae

Abstract:
This experiment tested the effect of a Juvenile Hormone imitator on the weight gain of Manduca sexta larvae over a two week period. The group wanted to test if the larva are given extra Precor, a 20E hormone inhibitor, then their weight will be significently higher than those who are untreated due to the fact that JH levels will rise and allow the larva to continue to eat and grow without entering the pupa phase. By dividing the larvae into two groups with four larvae in each, placing them in their own cells, and feeding them a diet containing Precor or placebo, the weights could be monitored every other day and compared at the end. The group that received the Precor in their diet gained, on average, more weight than those who did not receive the hormone in their diet. The larvae went through many changes throughout the two weeks, including a spike in weight about half way through. In the end, the data was not statistically significent enough to support the hypothesis despite there being a visible difference in average weight gained by the larvae during the experiment. Similar experiments had better, more statistically significent results than this experiment and show what would have happened ideally in this experiment if a few errors had not occurred. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta larva goes through 5 instar phases throughout its life cycle before maturing into adulthood via the pupa phase. These instars are controllled by two hormones, Juvenile Hormone (JH) and ecdysone (20E). These hormones have opposite effects and, when at specific ratios, cause the larva to undergo changes that aid in the development process. One specific ratio that triggers the larva to enter the pupa stage and later develop into an adult is called the commitment pulse. At this ratio, the juvenile hormone drops off and ecdysone levels spike. 
When these hormones are altered in the larva, the commitment pulse is modified as well. For example, if a certain amount of 20E inhibitor is administered to a larva during the fifth instar, the JH levels within the larva would rise, causing the larva to grow in size and not enter the pupa stage and develop into an adult in the same time frame as a larva that did not have the inhibitor administered. 
Therefore, when presented with the opportunity to run an experiment where the hormone levels in larva are altered, the group seized this opportunity as a chance to observe the effects of JH on a larva’s weight gain. The hypothesis the group came up with was, “If the larva are given extra Precor, a 20E hormone inhibitor, then their weight will be significently higher than those who are untreated due to the fact that JH levels will rise and allow the larva to continue to eat and grow without entering the pupa phase.”


Materials and Method:
Two clear plastic containers, each containing four separate cells with breathing holes punched in them were gathered and labeled clearly. Each cell was numbered in order to keep track of the larva. Then, we selected eight larva and divided them randoMly into two groups of four. Each larva was weighed and we recorded the weight before placing it in its individual cell. Next, we measured out 10g of food for each larva. We then combined 5 drops of Precor to four measures of food, 5 drops per measure. In the remaining four measures, 5 drops of water were added as a placebo. The food with water or Precor in it was compacted slightly and placed in the cells with the larva. We returned and weighed the larva every other day for two weeks, replacing the food as necessary. 
	When calculating the p value for the results, the two-sample t_test was run.


Results:
The trials yielded results the same as what was expected. As seen in Figure 1, the treatment group had all of the larva’s weight increase and the controll group had some larvae lose weight. The refined data can be seen in Table 1. Here, the weight difference for each larva is recorded along with the mean and standard deviation for each group. The p values are also stated as .1335 and .2671. Within the raw data itself, all the larvae used showed a spike in weight around day 7 of the experiment. Both the treatment and controll groups exhibited this sudden spike before losing weight in the last part of the experiment.  Color changes were also observed in the larvae. In the controll group, the larvae began to turn brown and hard around day 12 whereas some of the treatment group larvae paled in color and became sluggish. 

Discussion:
Throughout the experiment, the group noted changes in the larva as well as their measurements. In the controll group, the larvae actually pupated by the end of the two week period in which they were measured. Furthermore, when comparing the weight difference means between the two groups (Table 1), the treatment group had a higher weight gain difference than the treatment group did, as expected. When examining the p values (Table 1) however, they are quite high which implies statistical insignificance and that the data is not significent to support the hypothesis stated in the introduction. This does not mean that the Precor administered had no effect, it just means that experiment was not entirely successful. In the future, perhaps tests where the amount of Precor varies would have better, more statistically significent results. 
In Figure 1, the weight differences of each larva is illustrated. Here, the weight difference is quite apparent. All of the treatment larvae, represented by the orange bars, have positive growth, and the controll group, represented by the blue bars, have some positive and some negative. As discussed later, this could be due to some errors encountered during the experiment but overall, it shows that the hormone administered to the treatment group not only increased weight gain over the two weeks but it also prevented serious declines in weight as experienced by the controll larvae. 
The results of this experiment could have been skewed for a great number of reasons. The drop in weight noticed could be due to weather complications. In the middle of the experiment a hurricane hit campus and because of this, the larvae went a few days without fresh food. Furthermore, the larvae collected at the very beginning of the experiment were all varied in size. While this was accounted for by taking the differences in mass instead of comparing the end weights overall, the size of the larvae could have also thrown off the results. 
In the study, “Changes in weight of the pharyngeal gland and haemolymph titres of juvenile hormone, protein and vitellogenin in worker honey bees” [Fluri, 1981], the experimenters tested the effect of JH of honey bees instead of Manduca sexta larvae. They administered JH to aging honey bees and studied the effects it had on weight increase in a gland of the bees. This experiment is similar to the one run on the larvae but with different outcomes. Here, the researchers were able to notice a change in weight of the glands measured. As stated in the introduction, JH and 20E must work together to regulate growth and development. Therefore, by administering JH to the bee, the hormone ratios were incorrect and allowed for growth in certain glands that was not observed in controll groups.
