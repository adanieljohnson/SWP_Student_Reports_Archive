Title: Exploration of IP3-mediated pathway: effects of ionophore agonist A23187 and antagonist neomycin on motility of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Unlike multicellular organisms that use hormones or a nervous system to respond to stimuli, Physarum relies on signal transduction pathways for movement. Many of the signaling pathways Physarum uses are also in human cells, including the IP3-mediated pathway. In this experiment, the effects of A23187 and Neomycin on IP3 pathways in Physarum are explored. The process was standardized by placing 6 pieces of oatmeal directly at the bottom of each plate. The comparison between Neomycin and controll yielded statistically significent differences, while the comparison between A23187 and controll did not. In the water-agar plates tested with Neomycin, while the distance Physarum migrated was expected, it experienced negative chemotaxis instead of positive. In the presence A23187, the plates yielded both positive and negative chemotaxis. Finally, the controll plates were all expected for Physarum to exhibit positive chemotaxis but experimentally failed to migrate. The Physarum stock solution already contained a food source, potentially causing a lack of migration toward the food source due to satiety. Altering the controll conditions to prevent satiety in Physarum and controllling the amount of A23187 and Neomycin that is soaked in the water-agar plates may yield significent results.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a yellow slime mold with a multinucleate syncitium, allowing for all its nuclei to be contained in a single plasma membrane.  Each Physarum mass, called a plasmodium, behaves as a single giant cell, and is ideal in exploring signal transduction pathways in response to factors due to its ability to undergo mitosis synchrony [Johnson: 2016].  Physarum shares many of the same signal transduction pathways as human cells do, and are much easier to grow, handle, and observe than human cells are.  

Studies have shown that Physarum is capable of exhibiting intelligent behaviors similar to bees and ants, in which when presented with several food sources simultaneously, it was able to create a distribution network of cellular resources to maximize available nutrients [Nakagaki: 2000].  It was proposed that the Physarum is able to organize signaling pathways based on rules-based logic gates, and can be used in replacement of silicon chips in computers to perform calculations. 

Living in darkness with high humidity, Physarum spend most of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage.  Often living within damp decomposing leaves and group debris, Physarum uses actin microfilaments to crawl and extend itself to engulfs bacteria to then transport hydrolytic enzymes into food vacuoles to digest them.  Small pieces of plasmodium can bud off, forming clones of itself.  If the humidity drops or food is unavailable, the plasmodium undergoes hibernation in which it will harden to become a sclerotium [Johnson: 2016].  

When light or heat are present along with lack of food, Physarum will start its reproductive cycle.  It begins by cells undergoing meiosis to form haploid spores, in which they will germinate to form amoeboid or flagellated swarm cells that have the same mating type.  Two swarm cells with different mating types will fuse to form a zygote diploid cell, and will undergo synchronous rounds of mitosis to form a mature plasmodium [Johnson: 2016].  Unlike multicellular organisms, Physarum does not use hormones or a nervous system to sense and respond to stimuli.  Rather, it relies on intracellular signal transduction pathways to controll and coordinate each response.  The majority of the behavior is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors, specifically the cAMP-mediated and the IP3-mediated pathway. The IP3-mediated pathway is triggered by the binding of a signal to a G-protein coupled receptor, which then stimulates the Phospholipase C (PLC) effector to produce the second messenger IP3.  The binding of IP3 to a receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum causes the release of Ca2+ ions, where it binds to calcium regulated proteins to produce appropriate responses to stimuli.  

The objective of the experiment was to study the effect of agonist A23187 and antagonist Neomycin on the IP3 pathway in Physarum and observe positive chemotaxis to a food source. 
It was observed in spermatozoa that the effect of the ionophore A23187 on motility was dependent on the relative activities and kinetic properties of the competing calcium pumps in the plasma and mitochondrial membranes, but nevertheless the ionophore targeted calcium ion influx or efflux [Babcock: 1976].  This suggested that calcium release was directly related to regulating flagellum movement in sperm cells.  In another study, the preparation of Neomycin via radiolabeled IP3 bound to columns attached to glass beads caused the inhibition of IP3 mediated calcium release from intracellular stores of permeabilized insulinoma and liver cells [Prentki: 1986].  Finally, studies showed that Physarum displayed positive chemotactic effects to solutions of glucose, maltose, mannose, and peptone while yielding no chemotactic effects with sucrose, fructose, or ribose [Carlile: 1970].  Therefore, the use of oatmeal, a glucose product is appropriate for this experiment.  It was hypothesized that if the IP3 pathway was inhibited by Neomycin, then Physarum would exhibit decreased movement towards oatmeal as a result of fewer to no calcium channels being active.  On the other hand, if the IP3 pathway was activated by A23187, then Physarum would grow positively towards the food source due to more open calcium channels.  


Materials and Method:
Nine water-agar plates were used to conduct the experiment.  Three plates represented controlls, three plates were coated with A23187, and three plates were coated with Neomycin.  
In a Both A23187 and Neomycin were diluted from a 20X stock solution by extracting 1Ml of solution with 19Ml of water.  The experimental plates were appropriately coated with 5Ml of the diluted solution and waited 10 minutes for the coating to sink into the water-agar plates.  Then we standardized the process of placing 6 pieces of oatmeal directly at the bottom of each plate.  Finally, a 1cm x 1cm block was extracted from the Physarum stock plate and added to each controll and experimental plate.  

The plates were sealed up using tape, wrapped in aluminum foil, contained in a black bag, and placed in the fridge to allow Physarum enough time to grow overnight.  The distance and direction of the Physarum in regards to the oatmeal was observed and recorded.  A two-sample t_test was used to compare the movement of Physarum between Neomycin and controll conditions, and between A23187 and controll conditions.


Results:
The expectation was that the physarum tested under controll conditions would lead to some positive chemotaxis to the oatmeal pieces (figure 1).  However, the experimental results (figure 2) show that there was no movement, which could have resulted from the preparation of the physarum stock plate.  Because each physarum block contained a piece of oatmeal, the Physarum was already nourished and lacked the need to migrate. 

In the presence of Neomycin, it was expected for the physarum to have little to no movement towards the oatmeal due to less stimulation of the IP3 mediated pathway (figure 1).   While the data collected (figure 2) shows that the comparison between Neomycin and controll yielded statistically significent differences (t_stat = 2.93, Degrees of Freedom = 4, p_value = 0.043), the compound experienced negative chemotaxis towards the oatmeal, which was unexpected. 

In the presence of A23187, it was expected for the physarum to move toward the oatmeal at a greater distance than the physarum tested under no compounds (figure 1).  However, the comparison between A23187 and controll (figure 2) did not yield statistically significent differences (t_stat = 2.18, Degrees of Freedom = 4, p_value = 0.094).  Furthermore, while the mean distance demonstrated such, however, the individual results showed that one of the three trials actually experienced negative chemotaxis.  


Discussion:
Physarum relies on many of the same intracellular signal transduction pathways to controll and coordinate each response as human cells do.  The IP3-mediated pathway studied in this experiment is triggered by the binding of a signal to a G-protein coupled receptor, which then stimulates the PLC effector to produce the second messenger IP3.  The binding of IP3 to a receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum causes the release of Ca2+ ions, where it binds to calcium regulated proteins to produce appropriate responses to stimuli.  The objective of the experiment was to study the effect of agonist A23187 and antagonist Neomycin on the IP3 pathway in Physarum and observe its movement in the presence of a food source.  It was hypothesized that if the IP3 pathway was inhibited by Neomycin, then Physarum would exhibit decreased movement towards food as a result of fewer to no calcium channels being active.  On the other hand, if the IP3 pathway was activated by A23187, then Physarum would grow positively towards the food source due to more open calcium channels.  

The water-agar plates tested with Neomycin and A23187 were both compared to a controll condition by conducting a two-sample t_test.  When comparing Neomycin with the controll, a significent p_value of 0.043 was calculated.  While the magnitude of the distance migrated was expected due to predicting less stimulation of the IP3 pathway, the direction of migration was negative chemotaxis instead of positive.  Hence, the movement away from the food source was not expected for Physarum.  However, a study testing the inhibiting effects of caffeine and quinine on Physarum chemotaxis demonstrated that high levels of the compounds led to a severe reaction that caused migration to switch directions [Boisseau: 2016].  Both the Neomycin and A23187 solution were diluted before adding to the water-agar plates, but excess amounts of solution remained after 10 minutes of soaking and were not poured off.  The excess amount of Neomycin solution on the water-agar plates surrounding Physarum could have led to a migration away from the food source.  In contrast, when comparing A23187 with the controll, an insignificent p_value of 0.094 was calculated.  Nevertheless, two of the three samples testing Physarum placed in water-agar plates soaked with A23187 exhibited migration toward the food source.  However, the other sample showed that Physarum migrated away from the food source to such a large magnitude that it caused a high standard deviation of 16.92 mm, leading to statistically insignificent results.  A similar explanation for the unexpected Physarum migration patterns tested under Neomycin conditions could be postulated for results under A23187 conditions.  

Under the influence of only the food source and no compounds, the Physarum exhibited no movement in the controlls.  In contrast, it was expected for the Physarum to show movement towards the food source, but a decreased amount in comparison to Physarum in A23187 conditions.  Physarum that is already nourished will migrate away from the food source, while Physarum that is not fed will migrate towards the food source [Johnson: 2016].  Since the Physarum was already growing on a culture plate with oatmeal available, it would be expected for it to not migrate toward the food source due to satiety.  In addition, the same study conducted by Boisseau et al. exposed the Physarum to caffeine and quinine on successive days, noticing that the response of Physarum to the compounds decreased [Boisseau: 2016].  It was determined that Physarum was ignoring repetitive stimuli and instead focusing on other stimuli more important for their survival.  It is possible that by providing a food source for the Physarum before introducing it to a new environment with either agonist or antagonist compound soaked in it, the Physarum remained in a habituated state and resulted in lack of migration.

The hypothesis for this experiment could not be supported due to the lack of statistically significent results.  Future consideration of altering the controll conditions to prevent satiety in Physarum and controllling the amount of A23187 and Neomycin that is soaked in the water-agar plates may yield statistically significent results.  In addition to a food source that is known to cause positive chemotaxis, other external stimuli like a light source would be fascinating to conduct on Physarum to observe signal transduction pathways.
