Title: The Effect of Water Temperature on Agonistic Behavior of Siamese Fighting Fish

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment performed was to test the effects of environmental temperature on intraspecific aggressive display of Siamese fighting fish. Agonistic behavior between male betta splendins surmounts to physical interaction. Behavior patterns can be altered when influenced by abiotic factors, including temperature. Changes in temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on behavior due to energy conservation to maintain homeostasis. It was hypothesized that when placed in cold water, the bettas would take a longer amount of time to become aggressive enough to incite a fight. Each pair of male bettas was tested in room temperature and cold water conditions. A paired t_test was performed to determine the statistical significance between aggressive displays in the two temperature conditions. The hypothesis was not supported, and results suggest that temperature does not significently effect agnostic interaction of male Siamese fighting fish. 

Introduction:
Betta Splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish are known for expressing highly aggressive behavior, a type of intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behaviors of bettas are categorized under two behavior patterns, broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are performed when a fish is perpendicular to an opponent and include: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements include spreading of the opercula, or protrusion of the branchostegal membrane [Johnson: 2018]. Male bettas monitor aggressive interactions of opponents and use information on relative fighting ability in subsequent aggressive interactions [Rui: 1998]. Escalation of agnostic behavior in bettas leads to a higher intensity interaction in which the bettas begin to bite or grapple [Simpson: 1968]. Behavior patterns can altered when faced with varying abiotic factors. Abiotic factors can be defined as non-living components of an ecosystem, like sunlight, nutrients, and temperature [Dunson: 1991]. Temperature controlls the rate of fundamental biochemical processes and thus regulates organismal characteristics [O’Conner: 2007]. Ectotherms do not use metabolic heat to maintain homeostasis and instead rely on the environment to controll their temperature. Thus, fish have thermal preferences for optimal function [Dolomatov: 2013]. Temperatures varying from the optimum produce unfavorable conditions. Thus, it was hypothesized that male bettas in colder water would take longer to come into contact via agnostic behavior than when in room temperature water. 

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, six male Betta Splendins were randoMly selected and obtained. Each betta was placed into one of six identical containers separated by opaque dividers and filled with 18 °C water. The six bettas were paired into three groups. Each group was tested in the 18°C water. During each trial, the divider separating the pair was removed. The amount of time between removal of the divider and the touching of the fish was recorded. Once the fish touched, they were separated by the opaque divider and allowed to rest for five minutes. After trials concluded in room temperature conditions, the water in the tanks was cooled to 15°C through the addition of ice cubes. The trials were again performed following the procedure outlined above. A two sample paired t_test was run to test the statistical significance of the interaction of male bettas in two different temperature conditions. 
	 


Results:
Statistically speaking, the paired t_test disproved our hypothesis that the bettas would take longer to react in cold water. The average time before physical interaction for the males while in the room temperature water was found to be 122 +/- 24.759 seconds, while the average time before physical interaction for the males when in cold water was 143 +/-28.024 seconds (Figure 1). Thus, temperature did not have a significent effect on the aggressive behavior exhibited between male bettas (t=1.297, d.f.=2,  p=0.325). 

Discussion:
The results of this study did not support the hypothesis. Cold temperature did not significently alter the agnostic behaviors of male bettas. These results suggest that a three degree Celsius change in water temperature was not significent enough to lower the body temperature of the fish and change their aggressive displays. A similar outcome was also observed in a study performed by Daniel Magoulick and Margaret Wilzbach (2011). Their study examined the differential effect of temperature on aggressive interactions between brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, on the basis that abiotic conditions influence interactions among species. The study showed that the change in temperature did not have a significent effect on the aggressive interactions between brook trout and rainbow trout [Magoulick: 2011]. The study of abiotic factors on the behavior patterns of species is important because the environment is always changing, and it is important to know how changes will impact intraspecific species interactions, interspecific species interactions, and overall ecosystems in the future. Therefore, regardless of outcome, more abiotic factors should be manipulated and the effects of such influences should be studied. 
	Possible error in this experiment could have included not cooling the water enough to bring about substantial environmental change for the bettas. Other influences could have included not long enough rest periods, too long of rest periods, or other outside stimuli.
