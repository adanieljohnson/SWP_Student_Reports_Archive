Title: The Effects of Increased Intramuscular Potassium Concentration on The Contraction Force of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Rania temporaria

Abstract:
During muscle contraction, muscle fibers respond to the release of a neurotransmitter from the presynaptic terminal of a motor neuron to initiate an action potential that moves through the muscle and creates the right conditions for contraction to occur. After contraction, relaxation occurs during muscle repolarization. Multiple ion concentrations are responsible for allowing action potentials/contraction to occur. This study investigated how increased intramuscular potassium concentration impacts the force of muscle contractions in Rania temporaria frog legs. It was hypothesized that an increase in intramuscular potassium ion concentration would cause a change in contraction force. Each of three frog legs acted as its own controll before being injected with potassium-rich solution, and contraction forces were measured under each condition. No distinct trends were seen and the two-tailed, paired t_test proved the results to be statistically insignificent, meaning the null hypothesis that increased intramuscular [K⁺] has no effect on contraction force must be accepted.



Introduction:
This lab explored an aspect of neuromuscular controll using the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania  temporaria (frog) legs and theirs attached sciatic nerves. This muscle and nerve are small and compact yet large enough for one to easily dissect and see visible signs of twitching in. The sciatic nerve is the motor neuron that innervates myofibers of the muscle at various muscle junctions [Johnson: 2018]. In response to acetylcholine release from the presynaptic nerve terminal, an action potential can be produced in the muscle fiber, precipitating Ca²⁺ release and engendering the right conditions for myosin filaments to move along actin filaments (which is seen as muscle contraction) [Johnson: 2018]. Repolarization of the muscle corresponds with muscle relaxation during which no twitching occurs. As with all action potentials, it is the relative ion concentrations of ions like Na⁺ and K⁺ and Cl⁻ that determine depolarization and repolarization. Potassium has the greatest impact on membrane/muscle resting potentials and the outflow of potassium is an essential part of repolarization. Thus, the question arises: If K⁺ ion content inside a muscle is increased, will muscle contraction force change? This investigation is relevant to how consumption of potassium heavy food may affect an active organism’s ability to move and maintain heavy activity. Previous research has shown that increased K⁺ content affects action potential amplitude and propagation related to muscle contraction, but there is conflicting evidence regarding the role of [K⁺] in force development [Sjogaard: 1996]. Also, research has shown that changing external rather than internal [K⁺] causes rapid muscle depolarization [Hodgkin: 1960]. Bearing these effects of potassium content in mind, the alternate hypothesis of this experiment is that if intramuscular potassium concentration is increased, then contraction force will increase. In this experiment, the dependent variable of contraction force in volts is compared.

Materials and Method:
First, the gastrocnemus muscles of all 3 frog legs were exposed before the first was suspended at about 90 degrees and moistened with regular Ringer’s solution on the outside. The red and black probes connected to the iWorks electrophysiological recorder were both inserted into the muscle and the amplitude of the stimulus was set to 0.3V before being administered. The software’s reading of the contraction force was then measured. The amplitude was sequentially raised to 0.4V, 0.5V, 1.0V, and finally 2.0V, with the contraction force recorded at each amplitude.  After these five trials, 0.1Ml of 20mM K⁺ Ringers solution was injected directly into the muscle to begin the experimental trial for leg one. A five minute “wait time” was respected to allow the change in ion concentration to have its maximum effect. The tone of the pull on the string suspending the muscle was increased slightly. Then, the process of measuring contractile force at all five amplitudes was repeated before the leg was disposed of. Then, both leg two and leg three underwent the whole process from suspension to stimulation under both conditions as well. The data was analyzed to find an amplitude that produced mid-range contraction force values and produced a non-zero contraction force for each leg under at least one condition (chosen to be 0.5V for this experiment). A two-tailed paired t_test was then run on the differences between the contraction forces under the experimental verses controll conditions at this amplitude.

Results:
The two-tailed paired t_test gave a p_value of 0.718 which is greater than the alpha value of 0.05, so the data is statistically insignificent. The experimental contractile force were sometimes higher and sometimes lower than for the controll conditions. The magnitude of the differences were quite inconsistent as well, but notably never zero (Figure 1). The mean difference in contraction force between the two groups was about 0.0700V and the spread of the differences is relatively large compared to the mean at 0.290 (Table 1). Qualitatively, all muscle spasms looked similar to the naked eye, though the lack of a twitch could be seen during trials at amplitudes that did not produce any contraction force.

Discussion:
With a high p_value, the results are statistically insignificent, and the hypothesis that increasing [K⁺] directly within the gastrocnemus muscle changes its contraction force must be rejected. The null hypothesis that [K⁺] does not affect the contraction force is supported. In context, the results of this experiment suggest that consumption of lots of potassium through food will not affect muscle contraction force. 
However, it should be noted that there was always a difference of some kind seen in the contraction force under each condition. It is possible that just the injection of fluid into the area around electrical stimulation impacted measurement accuracy, and it is possible that the tone was not adjusted properly to counteract the differences in the weight and swelling of the injected muscle. Taking the probes out while injecting and always injecting in the same place might impact results and could be part of a modified design.  As mentioned earlier, there has been controversy in the scientific community regarding the role of potassium in force production in muscle contractions. Some recent models have concluded that [Ca²⁺] is responsible for force production and fatigue while [K⁺] may be ignored [Sjogaard: 1996]. The results of this experiment support this conclusion, and further research could be done repeating this exact same procedure but altering [Ca²⁺] instead of [K+]. If it is [Ca²⁺] that has the most impact on contraction force, then further study into what most strongly affects release of calcium is valuable, and it seems likely from this experiment that increased [ K⁺] does not cause significently more Ca²⁺ release within the muscle. Injecting potassium into the sciatic nerve and/or stimulating the sciatic nerve directly could also be done to investigate how potassium content affects the impulse originally sent to the muscle and better mimic how the process of contraction is carried out in vivo.
