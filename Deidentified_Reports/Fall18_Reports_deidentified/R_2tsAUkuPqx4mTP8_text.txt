Title: Effects of pH on the Rate of Electron Transfer in Spinach Leaves: Spinacia Oleracea  

Abstract:
Spinacia Oleracea, or spinach, is a type of plant that takes part in photosynthesis through the absorption of light energy and transports electrons in the chloroplast. The rate at which these electrons are transported is vital to the plant and to photosynthesis. It was hypothesized that since acids are electron donors, if the reaction proceeds under acidic conditions, the electron transfer rate will increase in S. Oleracea. We confirmed our hypothesis by testing the effects of basic and acidic conditions in S. Oleracea over a period of three 30 minute trials. Our results show a statistically significent difference in the average rate of electron transfer in both of our test groups. The acidic conditions lead to an increased rate in electron transfer, while the basic conditions lead to a decreased rate of electron transfer. Our findings are environmentally significent in the consideration of pollution of basic nature, and that alkaline environments lead to a slower rate of electron transport which could lead to decreased rates of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
S. Oleracea is a species of plant which carries out photosynthesis through organelles called chloroplasts. Once light has been absorbed by this organelle, electrons are excited and drive further chemical reactions, which can be grouped and labeled as Photosystems I and II (Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual). During photosynthesis, a number of oxidation - reduction reactions are performed which involve the movement of electrons through the utilization of the electron transport chain. These electrons are then used to “pump” protons, creating an electron gradient, which ultimately allows for high energy electrons to be placed onto electron carriers. These high energy electrons are then utilized in a variety of biological functions (Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual).   The purpose of this experiment was to test how acidic and basic conditions affect the photosynthetic rate of electron transfer in spinach leaves, S. Oleracea. S. Oleracea were used in this experiment because they are easily accessible, affordable, and manipulatable due to their relatively large size and abundance. The pH of 6.5 is optimal for this species because S. Oleracea grow and thrive best in slightly acidic soil ranging from pH 6 -7.5 (Masley 2009). DCIP was vital to the reaction because it helps record the transfer rate, as it undergoes a chemical rearrangement that allows for a color change from dark blue to clear in the presence of an excited electron. To consider this change, a spectrophotometer was used to determine the absorbance values of each reaction which was used to calculate our results.  By keeping reaction conditions stable across the course of the study, allowing the reaction to proceed under direct light, and calculating the absorbances taken by the spectrophotometer over three ten minute intervals, the percent change of the rate of electron transfer in S. Oleracea were calculated, and therefore the effects of pH on the rate were determined.  Previous studies have analyzed the effects of acid condition on electron transfer and found that acidic conditions increase the rate of electron transfer (Huber 1980). This experiment was designed to test the effects of a very acidic condition and a very basic condition at pH 3 and 10, respectively, against a neutral condition at pH 6.5 as the controll, to determine which condition would be more favorable for a faster rate of electron transport. Research shows that more acidic conditions increase the rate of transfer (Huber 1980). It was hypothesized that the more acidic conditions would have a higher rate of electron transfer over the basic conditions, as acids have an acidic proton that is easily deprotonated (or donated), it is more likely for acids to lose their electrons versus bases.Based on our prior research, it was predicted that acidic conditions would be more favorable for catalytic reactions such as these. Therefore, if the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions, the rate of transfer of electrons will increase in S. Oleracea.



Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, enriched chloroplasts were made for maximum reaction probability.To do so, the large veins of four commercially purchased spinach leaves were removed and then placed in a mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). The leaves were ground into a paste and then treated with an additional 10 Ml of the grinding buffer. This mixture was then strained through a three layered cheesecloth and the liquid was transferred into a conical centrifuge tube, Labeled “A.” The mixture was spun at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was transferred into centrifuge tube “B” and spun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was poured and the pellet at the bottom of the tube was kept for further preparation.   It was found that acidic pH buffers turn the solution a light pink color, seen in Figure 1, which causes the spectrophotometer to produce incorrect absorption values. Therefore, further spinning and preparation was required. 15 Ml of the reaction (pH 6.5) buffer was added to the pellet created from the second spin and resuspended to mix the solution and free the pellet of its compact form. The mixture was then aliquoted into three, 5 Ml volumes and placed in three small conical centrifuge tubes, where 5 Ml of the reaction buffer was added to each. The three tubes were then respun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4oC. 3 Ml of the grinding buffer was used to resuspend the pellets. These three tubes were used respectively to place 100 uL into each of 10 test tubes.    While the enriched chloroplasts were being spun, 10 large test tubes were labeled 0 (Blank) through 9. Tube 0, also known as the Blank, was prepared with 8 Ml of water, no DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 1-3 were designated for acidic condition testing and were prepared with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 3 buffer. Tubes 4-6 were designated for controll condition testing and were prepared with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 7-9 were designated for basic condition testing and were prepared with 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 10 buffer. 100 uL of the enriched chloroplasts were added to each of the 10 tubes. After the enriched chloroplasts were added, an initial Time 0 absorbance value, using a spectrophotometer set at 600 nm, was taken for each of the 10 tubes that were then placed under direct light for 10 minutes. After the light treatment, absorbance values were recorded and the treatment was repeated twice more. The percent change over time was calculated for each of the three trials.   The statistical tests used to analyze the significance of the results were two, two sample t - tests because the means of the two pH conditions, a basic and acidic condition, were compared to the controll condition which was pH 6.5. The test was completed by documenting the average percent change for each rate of electron transfer reaction. The results were then placed into the template provided by the Biology Core Resource Guide, which yielded our results.


Results:
The mean value for the acidic pH 3 condition’s rate of electron transfer was statistically significently different than that of the controll condition at pH 6.5 (t_stat = 7.4105, d.f. = 4, P = 0.0018). Absorbance value 0.091 that was found in the acidic condition Tube 2 was left out of the calculations, as an outlier. The mean value for the basic pH 10 condition’s rate of electron transfer was also statistically significently different than that of the controll condition at pH 6.5 (t_stat = 15.7654, d.f. = 40, P = 0.0001). On average, the reaction that proceeded under acidic conditions showed a decrease in absorbance values of 0.0055, while the basic conditions showed an increase in absorbance values of 0.025 (Fig. 3). Acidic absorbances decreased, while basic absorbances increased over the 30 minute trial period, the controll group followed the same trend as the acidic conditions as it had a 0.268 decrease in absorbance values (Figure 3). Generally, (Fig. 2), acidic conditions had a higher percent change in the electron transfer rate, -24.209% vs. 6.05%, respectively. 

Discussion:
Spinacia Oleracea, or spinach, is a type of plant that takes part in photosynthesis through the absorption of light energy and transports electrons in the chloroplast. The rate at which these electrons are transported is vital to the plant and to the process of photosynthesis. It was hypothesized that since acids are electron donors, if the reaction proceeds under acidic conditions, the electron transfer rate will increase in S. Oleracea. The two sample t - tests results lead us to accept our hypothesis because our data was statistically significent in showing the difference in means of the two target groups. Therefore, as observed in this experiment, acidic conditions lead to an increased rate of electron transfer in S.Oleracea, as seen by the decrease in absorbance values over the 30 minute time period, versus that of basic conditions, as seen by the increase in absorbance values, which lead to a decreased rate of electron transfer. These results allow the initial hypothesis to be accepted.  Absorbance point 0.091 in Test Tube 2 (acidic condition) was left out of the calculations because it was an obvious outlier. This outlying value was likely due to the fact that the pH buffer was added to the DCIP before the enriched chloroplasts, meaning an undesired reaction between the DCIP and pH buffer may have occurred prior to the desired reaction. In future studies, it is recommended that the buffer be added after the enriched chloroplasts, eliminating the possibility of unforeseen reactions. The absorbance values obtained from basic condition testing can be used to show that alkaline conditions alter the electron transfer rate, causing it to decrease. This decline in the transfer rate is due to an increase in the absorbance values because there is not as significent of a color change over the elapsed 30 minute trials. Basic pH values are not favorable because the electrons cannot be transferred as quickly which is why the color did not change to clear as fast and the absorbances increased over time rather than decreased, which is the desired effect.   The negative percent change of absorbed light in the acidic conditions shows that the rate of electron transfer is going up because as electrons are accepted, the color lightens which lowers the absorbance value because means that electrons are being transported faster. The results of this experiment support the conclusions made in the study entitled Light and Dark rate - determining steps in electron transport reactions in spinach leaves (Satoh et al. 1972), that acidic conditions lead to a higher rate of electron transfer.   These findings, along with the ones of this experiment, are important for consideration of environmental hazards such pollution that creates a highly basic soil condition which would lead to a slower rate of electron transfer in S.Oleracea. This is undesirable because a slower rate of electron transfer means a slower rate of photosynthesis that could possibly lead to the death of the organism if it is not able to capture and produce energy effectively.   The study could be furthered by testing the effects of higher basic conditions and observing the process of photosynthesis between the three experimental groups that were tested in this experiment to further prove the harmful effects of basic conditions on the transfer of electrons in S. Oleracea, and furthermore the photosynthetic effects of the conditions.
