Title: The Effects of White, Blue, Red and Green Light on the Electron Transport Chain found in Spinacia Oracea 

Abstract:
In this study, the effects of white, blue, red and green light were tested on the electron transport chain found in Spinacia Oracea. For photosynthesis to occur, light must be absorbed and excite electrons resulting in oxidation-reduction reactions. Light is absorbed through chlorophyll pigments. It was expected that green light would be reflected while blue and red light would be absorbed with blue light having more success. To test this hypothesis, a DCIP assay was run and data was collected using absorbance values from a spectrophotometer. It was found that white and red light caused the most reduction and that green and blue light cause significent reduction compared to the negative controll but less than red and white light.



Introduction:
Spinach, Spinacia Oracea, is an edible leafy vegetable that is native to central and southwestern Asia, belonging to the family of Amaranthaceae.  Spinacia Oracea is an annual plant that is commonly used and consumed by people due to being rich in vitamins, magnesium, manganese, folate, iron, and dietary fibers [Xu: 2017]. Due to containing chlorophyll pigments, Spinacia Oracea’s leaves are green and can absorb and store energy from sunlight using a process called photosynthesis.

Pigments are molecules that absorb specific wavelengths of light/energy and reflects the rest. The color observed is the light that is reflected, not absorbed. This occurs because electrons in molecules exist at specific energy levels and typically try to stay at the lowest possible energy level. If enough energy comes along to move the electron to the next level, they absorb that energy and can occupy that new higher level. Electrons will eventually lose this energy and return to their low energy state and level. The normal pigments involved in photosynthesis are chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and xanthophylls. Chlorophyll a pigments are the most abundant pigments in plants. They absorb light with the wavelengths of 430nm (blue) and 662nm(red). It reflects green light well thus making plants appear green. Chlorophyll b is a molecule that is similar to chlorophyll a but less abundant. It absorbs light of 453nm and 642 nm maximally; they help increase the range of light a plant can use for energy. Carotenoid pigments absorb light maximally between 460nm (blue) and 550nm (green). They appear red, orange or yellow when observed and protect the plant from free radicals formed from ultraviolet and other sources of radiation. The fourth common class of pigments is xanthophylls. They help oxidize carotenoids and contain oxygen. They appear red and yellow but do not absorb energy as well as carotenoids. [Berg: 2002]

	Photosynthesis can be summarized in the following chemical equation:
 6CO2 + 12H2O ➡C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2.  For this reaction to proceed forward, several cofactors are needed such as light, the green pigment chlorophyll, Mn2+ ions, several electron transport complexes, and a phospholipid bilayer capable of producing an H+ gradient. When chloroplasts absorb sunlight using chlorophyll pigments, electrons are excited forcing the electrons to jump from carrier protein triggering a chemical reaction that cleaves water generating a proton gradient. The high energy electrons are stored in the molecule NADPH. This molecule and the proton gradient allow ATP synthesis to occur. The electrons in both NADPH and ATP are then used in chemical reactions to synthesize glucose (6 carbon) from carbon dioxide (1 carbon) molecules. A closer look at photosynthesis reveal that it is a 3 step process, two of the steps being light dependent and one be light independent. The light-dependent reaction use absorbed photons from two different wavelengths to generate reducing power via NADPH. In addition, they create an H+ gradient which drives ATP synthesis. Light-independent reaction use the enzyme complex RUBISCO.  RUBISCO uses ATP and the reducing power of NADPH to combine carbon dioxide (1 carbon) with ribulose phosphate (5 carbons) to create glucose molecules (6 carbon). [Johnson:2016]

In summary, photosynthesis is an important metabolic process that uses oxidation-reduction potentials found in chemical reactions to drive electrical and chemical gradients to generate glucose which helps generate adenosine triphosphate, ATP, via two other metabolic processes: glycolysis and cellular respiration [Johnson: 2016]. 

To measure ATP production or the reduction of NADP+, an alternative electron acceptor is used. 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) turns dark blue when it is oxidized; in its oxidized form, the aromatic ring structure allows it to absorb light maximally at 600nm  [Hassan R.Y.A: 2011]. When in its reduced state, DCIP has a conjugated C=C bond and is colorless. This is summarized in this summarized in the following chemical equation 2H2O + 2DCIP(blue) ➡ 2DCIPH2 (colorless) +O2. The color change can be detected by measuring the light absorption at 600nm. Using DCIP assay, it can be determined if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis [Johnson:2016]

It is predicted that bluelight will oxidize DICP in spinach the best, then red light and lastly green light thus blue will have lowest absorption value while green has the highest. Green light should have minimal oxidation and be similar to the negative controll because green light is not absorb as well as red and blue lights due to chlorophyll pigments. 


Materials and Method:
Make B Pellet: special equipment: centrifuge tubes and RT-7 centrifuge
Place mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250Ml) and three 50Ml centrifuge tube (Tube “A”, Tube “B” and Tube “C”) in crushed ice. Next, remove the large central veins from four medium-sized spinach leaves. Throw away the veins and rinse off with water and dry the leaf pieces. Next, place and grind leaf pieces into a cold and dry mortar with the pestle and add 10Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in a tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Grind till a uniform thick paste is created that contains no large fragments of leaves. Add an addition 10Ml of grinding buffer and mix with the spinach slurry. Then strain the entire volume of the spinach slurry through a three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer the remaining green liquid to a 50Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spin it at 200 times the force of gravity at 1200 rpm in a RT-7 centrifuge for three minutes at 4 degrees Celcius. Do not forget to include a balance tube when using the centrifuge. Pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B” making sure that the debris at the bottom of tube “A” stays in tube “A”. Next, centrifuge tube “B” containing chloroplast suspension at 1,000 times the force of gravity at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celcius. Pour the supernatant into the 50Ml tube marked “C” while making sure not to disturb the pellet on the bottom. In tube “B”, the tube containing the pellet, add 20 Ml of grinding buffer to the pellet then mix.  Label this solution as “B pellet”. 

Prepare Assay: all chloroplast is from pellet B
We prepared 16 test tubes for an assay. The first tube was tube 0, the blank for the spectrophotometer.  The blank contained 8 Ml of distilled water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). We label and made the next set of test tubes, tubes 1-15.  They contained 6 Ml of distilled water, 2mM of DCIP and 2Ml of reaction buffer.  Tubes 1-6 were treated with white light. Tubes 7-9 was treated with green light. Tubes 10-12 was treated with red light. Tubes 13-15 was treated with blue light.
Light’s effect on electron transport chain: special equipment: a spectrophotometer, color light bulbs
We added and mixed 100 micoL chloroplast to every tube including the blank except for tubes 1-3. We transferred all the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes.  Blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using Tube 0 immediately. Then measured and recorded the absorbance of all samples at 600 nm; these were the zero time data points. Placed tubes 1-3 and tubes 4-6 in white light. Place tubes 7-9 in green light. Place tubes 10-12 in red light. Placed tubes 13-15 in blue light. After 15 minutes, we recorded the new absorbance value of each tube; we did not forget to blank the spectrophotometer and set it at 600nm. Lastly, we recorded and calculated the average percent changes in the absorbances of each set of tubes (1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 12-15). We ran a double-tailed T-test to analyze the data.


Results:
In order to understand how different color light affect Spinacia Oracea’s electron transport chains, white, green, red and blue light were tested. White light with and without chloroplast were the positive and negative controlls.The absorption mean of white light was -80.319土0.424. The absorbance mean of green light was -66.46土8.424. The absorbance mean of red light was  -84.07土5.582. The absorbance mean of blue light was -68.205 土11.664.  It was observed that blue light absorbed similar to green light while, white light absorbed similar to red light in Spinacia Oracea. Compared to green light, red light’s absorption value was 26.5% lower (n=3, p=0.039, double tailed T-test)  and white light’s absorption value was 20.85% lower (n=3, p=0.046, double tailed T-test).  Both white and red light had significently lower absorbance values than green light. All tested lights significently had a lower absorbance value than negative controll. Data for blue light could not be compared to green, red or white light due to its high standard deviation. All statistically analysis done through double tailed T-test.


Discussion:
Despite what was predicted, green light did not minimally reduce DCIP but instead resembled blue light in its absorption. Also, surprisingly, red light had the lowest reabsorption rate thus the most reduced followed by white light and then blue light. These discrepancies can be attributed to tainted conditions and photosynthetic efficiency of pigments. 

In the condition we did the experiment, the test tubes were not in an environment where they were exclusively exposed to one kind of light. The test tubes were primarily expose to the treatment color of light but were also exposed to the white light found throughout the room. White light contains all colors of light thus other colors of light could have contaminated the results. A study published in the journal of Plant and Cell Physiology found that in strong white light, green light can penetrate further into the leaf than red or blue light. This results in green light increasing the rate of photosynthesis more than red and blue light. They found in moderate white light that green light drive photosynthesis less effectively than red light but still greater than blue light despite not being favored pigment wise [Terashima: 2009]. The light contamination found in our lab would be categorized under moderate white light. Just as their results showed, red light was more effective at reducing DCIP. Unlike their results, green light was slightly less effective than blue light but they were very comparable in absorbance.

 A study published in the journal of Biotechnology and Bioengineering looked at the effect of light on the photosynthetic efficiency and biomass composition. They found that biomass productivity and photosynthetic efficiency were comparable between white and red light, while under blue and green, biomass productivity and photosynthetic efficiency decreased significently. Under red light cells become smaller and more mobile resulting in higher efficiency. Chlorophyll content was strongly reduced by red light and did even better with trace amounts of blue light. They were able to suggest that red light was just as efficient as white light [Abiusi: 2013]. Like their study, we found an our chlorophyll strongly reduced by both red and white light. Both our red and white light absorbance value were very similar 80.319土0.424 (white) and -84.07土5.582 (red).  We also found that green and blue light to be less effective but not to the extend they described. Perhaps their organism, Tetraselmis Suecica, biologically works similar to Spinacia Oracea in the way that red light stimulates the cell by shrinking them and making them more mobile thus making them more productive.
