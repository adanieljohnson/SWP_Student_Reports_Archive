Title: Betta splendens Aggression: The Effects of Water Color on Agonistic Behaviors 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to test if water color has an effect on Betta Splendens agonistic behavior. Our hypothesis supported that water color would in fact have an effect of levels of aggression of Betta males. By placing a glass divider between two males and then removing the partition and ranking each male’s behavior in both clear, red, and green water, we determined that our results were not statistically significant and our alternative hypothesis was rejected. If this experiment was produced in the future, it is suggested to leave a longer resting time between betta male interaction as to not tire the fish and to prevent habituation. 


Introduction:
Ethology, the study of animal behavior, combines careful observation and evolutionary biology in order to fully understand physiological purposes for behavior. One type of animal behavior that is measureable is categorized as agonistic or aggressive behavior. In this study, we observed the Betta splendens, or common Betta fish. One characteristic that makes the Betta a particularly great organism for studying aggressiveness is their colorful displays of antagonistic behavior during intraspecific interaction. [Simpson: 1968]. Broadside and facing movements are ways in which B. splendens males display aggression. For example, broadside movements, such as pelvic fin flickering, are characterized when a male turns his side to his opponent. Facing movements or tactics are enacted when the aggressor male beta faces his opponent and flares his pectoral fins. By analyzing broadside and facing movements a larger understanding of social interaction with aggression and species interaction can be understood. This experiment tested the effects of different water color on antagonistic behavior between two Betta males. Our independent variable is the changing water colors, and our dependent variable is the amount of aggressive behavior between the two males. We hypothesize that water color will increase agonistic interactions between betta males.



Materials and Methods:
First, a ranking system was created in order to classify each male’s agonistic behaviors: 1-no aggressive behavior, 2-pelvic fin flickering and the presence of erect pectoral fish, 3- tail beating, and spread gill cover, 4-tail flashing and red mane behaviors, and finally 5- physical contact and attack. Two tanks were taken and divided into three sections. Four random Betta males were then selected, labeled and paired together. The first pair interacted in clear water for 5 min with a glass partition between them and then allowed to rest for another 5 min period. After rest, the glass partition was removed and each male Betta in the pair was given a rank for personal agonistic behavior. Each pair of Betta males was tested in the same way in each color condition- both green and red. Four drops of nontoxic food coloring were used to color both the green and red food coloring. We ran two ANOVA tests to determine if there was a statistically significant difference in aggressive behavior in clear or colored water with the glass partition and without it.


Results:
When comparing the average rankings of agonistic behavior in the presence of a glass partition, our results were not statistically significant (f (11) =0.0842, p=0.462). Similar to that of the glass partition, the trials ran without the glass partition to divide the males proved not statistically significant either (f (11) = 0.206, p= 0.0818). Figure 1 illustrates average level of aggressive behavior exhibited by B. splendens in each water color with and without a glass divider. The most agonistic behavior of all the males was observed in the red water and was ranked at an average of 2.25 +/- 1.26 with the presence of a glass divider. Without the divider, an average of 3.25 +/- 1.71 was given to characterize the sum of male betta interaction in red water. 


Discussion:
Average aggression level with and without a glass divider proved to be not statistically significant in any of the three-color conditions. In this case, our alternative hypothesis was rejected that water color does indeed have an effect on betta male aggression. One major aspect that may have led to the rejection of our hypothesis was the fact that our beta fish may not have had a lot of time to rest in-between the numerous trials conducted. After the first color water swap, the fish appeared to be immobile and less active. While the fish in the initial reactions showed more aggressive behavior, with each interaction following, they had an overall decrease in aggression. Perhaps accustomed to the stress, the bettas began to habituate into their changing environments and were less concerned by perceived threats. This could have greatly decreased their agonistic behavior. In a study based on humans, in the presence of red colored objects such as clothing, males are more predisposed to dominance. They attribute this aggressive behavior for distortions of time and perception [Wiedemann:2015]. Perhaps in our study, this is another plausible reason why the B. slendens showed the most agonistic behavior in the red colored water. In the future, this study can be improved with longer waiting times between trials to ensure the fish do not tire. Also, to decrease potential habituation, the order of treatment presentations could be randomized. This compensates higher aggressive behavior during the first trials, independently of water color. This study could also be used to help understand the ways in which fish would act more aggressive in certain environments, and to produce fish populations with less perceived threats.
