Title: The Effects of Acid Rain on the Root/Shoot Ratio of Field Peas 

Abstract:
Both living and non-living factors influence plant growth. Plants allocate their resources differently between the roots and shoots so that parts that are lacking in a particular resource adapt in order to find that resource. A way to measure resource allocation is by determining the root/shoot ratio of a plant. Typically, the root/shoot ratio is smaller when the plant is larger. We predict that field peas treated with acid rain will have a larger root/shoot ratio than the peas treated with simply tap water. We used a two-sample t_test to measure our results. Our data supported our hypothesis because the plants treated with acid rain had a larger root/shoot ratio in regard to both length and weight. This was because the field peas had to allocate resources to the roots in order to find the nutrients they were being deprived of. 


Introduction:
In ecological communities, plants interact with each other. Biotic (environmental stimuli from living organisms) and abiotic factors (stimuli from non-living sources) contribute to these interactions. These two types of factors affect everything from energy capture and nutrient absorption to reproduction. Plants interactions revolve around obtaining nutrients in order to stay alive. Unfortunately, resources in a given environment are limited and therefore organisms need to allocate their resources. 

Allocation patterns for a species are genetically determined, but due to some environmental changes, plants can respond in appropriate ways in some cases. Individuals modify their allocation patterns in order to best adapt to the abiotic changes the environment presents. This is called allocation plasticity. 

Plants vary in how they allocate their resources between their different parts. Increased allocation to leaves leads to a high growth rate when light is plentiful. Stems are the supporting structure in plants and play a role in light capture. In many plants there is a tradeoff between resource allocation between the stem and leaves. The stem and leaves make up the shoot system and the roots serve as the primary sources of absorption. When resources are allocated to the roots, the roots can grow in order to thrive in a dry environment. In general, when nutrient availability increases, plants allocate less resources to their roots because as nutrient availability increases, much less effort is required to acquire resources [Argen: 2003]. 

Allocation is measured by a plants root/shoot ratio. This is measured by dividing the biomass of the root by that of the shoot. This is an accurate measurement because nutrients from the soil must move from the roots where it is absorbed up to the shoots. In general, the root/shoot ratio decreases with increase in plant size [Monk: 1996]. 

Biotic interactions between plants and microorganisms have the potential to be affected by acidic conditions. [Cheplick: 1993]. Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation that is very acidic and possess elevated levels of hydrogen ions [Lal: 2016]. The low pH of acid rain typically stunts the growth of plants by stimulating abnormalities in the metabolism of plants [Lal: 2016]. Therefore, we hypothesize that the field peas treated with acid rain will have a larger root/shoot ratio than plants treated with tap water. 


Materials and Method:
First, we obtained our field peas that had been soaking for 24 hours in water. Next, we labeled eight pots (four pots for peas treated with acid rain and four pots for peas treated with tap water) and filled them to the top with vermiculite. Then, we pre-watered all eight pots and added 50Ml of mirgrow. To place the field pea seeds in the pots, we put an indentation in the vermiculite and put two seeds into each hole. Each pot had 10 seeds, so this made for a total of 80 planted seeds. Lastly, we covered the seeds with vermiculite and watered four of the pots with tap water and the other four pots with acid raid. We continued to water the plants every day for two weeks. After two weeks, we measured the root/shoot ratio of the pea plants. We measured nine plants treated with acid rain and nine plants treated with tap water. To evaluate our data, we used a one tailed two-sample t_test with the average root/shoot ratio of length and weight. 


Results:
The mean root/shoot ratio of weight of the peas treated with acid rain is statistically significently larger than that of the peas treated with tap water (t_stat = 6.867, d.f. = 34, P = 3.29E-8). In comparison, the mean root/shoot ratio of length of field peas treated with acid rain is also statistically significently larger than that of the peas treated with tap water (t_stat = 8.18, d.f. = 34, P = 7.61E-10). This represents that for both length and weight the root/shoot ratio is larger for plants treated with acid rain than plants treated with tap water. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis for this experiment was supported because the plants treated with tap water had longer shoots and weighed more, and therefore had a smaller root/shoot ratio compared to the field peas treated with acid rain. These results can be attributed to the fact that the plants treated with acid rain had to develop a more intricate root system in order to get the resources and nutrients they need. The plants treated with tap water did not have to allocate resources in order to get nutrients. They were given the water and resources they needed without any perturbing outside forces acting on them, so they grew taller and weighed more. According to a similar study done by Shaukat and Shafiq, at seedling growth level the plants showed the highest seedling growth in controlls (water). The acid rain inhibited both root and shoot length, therefore increasing the root: shoot ratio [Shaukat: 1998]. 

If I were to repeat this study, I would separate the pots. When we watered the plants sometimes the acid rain would leak into the controll group, possibly inhibiting growth. Clearly this was not a major issue, as our results were statistically significent, but maybe the acid raid had a bit of an effect on growth of the field peas. I would also like to study the effect of light on root/shoot ratios. Since the shoots are the light capturing organ of the plant, I would assume that the resources would be allocated to the stem, increasing the growth of the stem and decreasing the size of the roots.
