Title: Variation of root to shoot ratio in field peas exposed to different amounts of sunlight

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a very important concept in the field of evolutionary biology. It is important to understand the way plants adapt to their environment in the absence of either essential biotic or essential abiotic factors. Here we will look at the effects that the amount of sunlight has on P. sativun arvense, commonly known as field peas. In order to test this, there will be two different treatments of field peas. One in a dark setting and one in a light setting. The expectation was that the replicates in the dark setting would have a larger root to shoot ratio because of the way their resource allocation. However the results revealed that the plants in the dark setting had a smaller root to shoot ratio because of this very reason. A statistical analysis of these results showed us that the amount of sunlight had no effect on the root to shoot ratio of weight, however it did on length. This shows that phenotypic plasticity is incredibly important in the development of plants especially as it relates to sunlight. 


Introduction:
In every ecological community, the residing organisms are affected by both biotic and abiotic factors. In this experiment, our model organisms were P. sativun arvense, more commonly known as field peas.  Plants can change how they allocate existing resources according to their environmental circumstances. This is called phenotypic plasticity and applies only to the new growth of plants [Johnson: 2018]. To understand this better, we wanted to test how abiotic factors affects the growth of field peas, specifically the amount of sunlight. We placed the field peas into two different groups: one group had full sunlight and the other had none. By considering these two factors, we will measure the root to shoot ratio of the resulting plants. It is important to recognize that phenotypic plasticity doesnâ€™t just have to be expressed by the genotype of the plant. It can be conveyed at the behavioral, physiological, developmental, or biochemical level of an organism [Pigliucci: 2363]. That is why it is important to test such things as sunlight because it is essential to the growth of all photosynthetic organisms thus making it necessary to study the effects of. In this experiment we will assess the physiological effects that limited access to sunlight has on an organism. We predict that the plants growing in the light setting will have a larger root to shoot ratio than the field peas growing in the lighted environment. 


Materials and Method:
	In this experiment, we will put two groups of field pea seeds that are watered and fertilized in both a dark setting and a light setting. The controlls will be that both groups will be fertilized the same amount at the beginning and watered the same amount daily. However the independent variable will be the amount of sunlight that they receive. For the plants with direct sunlight, they will be placed in a greenhouse whereas the plants with no sunlight will be placed in a cabinet. To measure how sunlight affects these plants, we will be measuring their root to shoot ratios in both weight and length. These measurements will serve as our dependent variable. To analyze this data, we will use a two tailed T test for our statistical analysis. 


Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio of weight are not statistically significent in plants growing in light and dark environments (t stat=1.913, d.f.=18, p= 0.071). The mean root to shoot ratio for length is statistically significent in plants growing in both light and dark environments (t stat=6.988, d.f.=18, p=0.000). 

Discussion:
The results tell us that when measuring weight, the alternate hypothesis was reject and the null hypothesis was accepted because the p_value is greater than 0.05 so it is not statistically significent. In the case of measuring length, the alternate hypothesis was also rejected, but so was the null hypothesis because the p_value was less than 0.05 showing that it was statistically significent. Clearly, the amount of sunlight affects the way plants grow in length but does not affect weight. The root to shoot ratio of the dark setting was smaller than the light environment. This still demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of field peas because of the way the replicates in the dark setting had to allocate their resources differently under an absence of an essential abiotic factor like sunlight. However, it is important to recognize the errors of this experiment. For example, in the light environment for weight there was one value that was extremely different from the rest and could have skewed the results as well as the standard deviation. In order to remedy this, it would be beneficial to add more treatments as to eliminate confounding variables. Because there was a huge difference in phenotype, it is clear that the amount of sunlight greatly impacts the development of field peas.

Figure 1. Effect of varied amounts of sunlight on field peas. 15 field peas were placed in each treatment and 12 were recorded for the dark setting however only 6 were recorded for the light group because only 6 survived in the conditions. Each treatment was exposed for 2 weeks to their respective light or dark setting. Each bar indicates the mean root to shoot ratio for length and weight in the light or dark setting; error bars indicate the standard deviation of each.
