Title: Nicotinic ACh Receptor Antagonist and Its impact on the Amplitude of Muscle Contraction. 

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine the impacts of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist on the amplitude of muscle contractions. Due to the importance of ACh in the depolarization process of muscle cells, we hypothesized that the presence of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist would cause an average decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions. We conducted this experiment by testing 3 frog legs separately, stimulating each with the same voltages ranging from 0.1 V and 5.0 V and comparing the amplitude of muscle response when nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist was absent and present. Our data portrayed a decrease in the average amplitude of muscle contractions when the muscle was exposed to nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. Statistical testing yielded a significant p-value of 7.93E^-8, therefore supporting our hypothesis that the presence of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist would cause an average decrease in the amplitude of muscle contractions. 


Introduction:
All living organisms, including humans, must maintain homeostasis in order to survive. Homeostatic systems within organisms make use of both hormones and nervous systems to maintain a stable internal environment. The neuromuscular system plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis as it can respond to environmental stimuli virtually instantly [Johnson AD: 2018]. Many homeostatic functions are initiated by nerve cells that stimulate muscle contractions. These muscle contractions are the result of action potentials that cause the release of acetylcholine (ACh), which in turn allow calcium and sodium channels to open, eventually causing cells to depolarize. [Johnson AD: 2018]. ACh clearly plays a pertinent role in the contracting of muscle cells, so what would happen if a muscle cell was introduced to a substance that inhibits the release of ACh, such as a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist? According to information published in a recent textbook covering pharmacology, nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist agents are crucial in inducing muscle paralysis, allowing for less dependence on anesthesia in surgeries [Kester M: 2012][Vrana K: 2012]. Considering this information, we hypothesize that if a muscle is generously exposed to a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist, then there will be an average decrease in the amplitude of contractions when the muscle is exposed to an electric stimulus. We hypothesize this because we think that a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist will cause a decrease in the release of ACh, therefore causing a decrease in the amount of calcium and sodium channels that can open. This would cause the cell to stay polarized and contract with less force. Combine this with the findings that nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist agents cause muscle paralysis, and there is clear reason to suspect a decrease in the amplitude of muscle contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
3 frog legs were individually tested using the following methods: 

The frog leg was skinned using forceps, pulling from the top of the leg towards the foot. Over the course of the experiment, the exposed tissues had to stay moist with ringers solution. The frog leg was suspended by string under a device that measures contraction amplitude. Electrodes, which were connected to a force transducer, were punctured directly into the gastrocnemius muscle. The frog leg was given electrical stimuli starting at an amplitude of 0.1 volts (V), increasing in increments of 0.1 V until the stimulus amplitude reached 0.5 V. Then, the stimulus amplitude increased in increments of 1.0 V until the stimulus amplitude reached 5.0 V. From the starting stimulus amplitude of 0.1 V, to each increase in stimulus amplitude, the resulting amplitude of the muscle contraction was recorded. After reaching the 5.0 V stimulus amplitude maximum, the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist. Then, the stimulus amplitude was reset to 0.1 V and the resulting contraction amplitude was recorded as previously conducted. The difference in muscle contraction amplitudes between the absence and presence of nicotinic receptor antagonist was used for hypothesis testing. A one-tailed, paired t-test with a 0.05 significance value was used for statistical testing. 


Results:
In the experiment, all 3 frog legs saw a general increase in the difference in the amplitude of response, before eventually leveling off at a stimulus of 2 V until the end of testing at 5 V (Figure 1). This is seen as both legs 1 and 2 hovered at a difference value of approximately 0.25 V, while leg 3 stayed at a higher difference value of approximately 0.37 V (Figure 1). Leg 3 also showed another unordinary trend in that the difference saw a slight decrease at the 0.4 V stimulus value. Despite these differences, the average difference value for each leg was relatively similar, as they all fell in between difference values of 0.169 V and 0.187 V (Figure 2). Statistical testing concluded that the mean of the experimental group (group exposed to nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist) was significantly less than the control group (group not exposed to nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist), with a p-value of 7.93E^-8. 

Discussion:
Based on the significant difference observed between the control and experimental groups, along with the significant p-value obtained in statistical testing, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported and that the presence of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist in muscle cells causes a decrease in the amplitude of responsive muscle contractions. This was to be expected due to the vital role that ACh plays in the contracting of muscles, as the presence of ACh allows for the opening of sodium and calcium channels which enable cell depolarization [Johnson AD: 2018]. Without ACh, depolarization would never take place and the muscle would have a much harder time contracting. This concept was observed in a study conducted by The University of Tulane, in which a non-depolarizing agent introduced into a muscle. This substance mimicked a nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist, as the agent caused a decrease in ACh levels, thus resulting in a fade of twitch amplitude in the muscle [Clarks C: 2018]. These results are significant because the knowledge of nicotinic ACh receptor antagonist agents could be used in health treatments of many kinds. For example, perhaps these nicotinic antagonist agents could help decrease the amplitude of involuntary muscle contractions in people with Parkinson’s disease. Although nothing can be proven from the results of our experiment, we can conclude that nicotinic ACh receptor antagonists do play a role in the decrease of response amplitude in muscles. Perhaps one day we will see these agents used on a broader scale to improve surgical procedures and offset the effects of degenerative diseases many suffer from today.
