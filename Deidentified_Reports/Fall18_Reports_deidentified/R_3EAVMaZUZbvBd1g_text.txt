Title: Effects of Territory on Aggressive Behavior of the Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendes) 

Abstract:
Competitive behavior is fundamental in the natural world as species are forced to engage in competitive behavior in order to obtain necessities for survival--limited resources. As a result, species often develop evolutionary characteristics and behaviors in order to increase their overall fitness. In this experiment, we study the agonistic behaviors of the Siamese betta fish (Betta splendes) in order to understand how territory (a limited resource) can directly affect the aggressive behavior of the Betta fish. It was hypothesized that the species would exhibit an increase in agonistic behavior after having been placed in a small, 5-gallon fish tank, where territory is severely limited as opposed to a significantly larger, 20-gallon fish tank, where there is a significantly more territory available. In conducting this experiment, four male betta fish (the gender was selected as such because they tend to be territorial) were obtained, where thereafter, they were placed in the large fish tank (control) in pairs of two and the number of aggressive reactions each produced was recorded. Next, they were placed in the smaller tank (in pairs of two) where again the number of reactions were recorded. The total number of reactions of the four fish were averaged in terms of those produced in

Introduction:
Competition is an important topic in behavioral ecology as the behavior serves as a fundamental biotic factor used by species in order to obtain limited resources (food, water, territory). There is a wide spectrum whenever it comes to competition. In order to break-down this range, ecologists categorize competition as either interspecific (between species) and intraspecific (within species) [Dzieweczynski:2016]. Nevertheless, competition is not often a straightforward concept. The reasons for producing aggressive behavior and the way in which varying species produce such behaviors yields an even wider spectrum regarding competitive behavior, which leads to a multitude of methods for studying this biotic factor. In recent studies, researchers have been able to observe aggressive behavior in intraspecific relationships through the use of the Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendes)-- a species commonly known to utilize aggressive behavior in order to convey itself as a competitive species. The species serves as the ideal model for studying aggressive behavior as it is a territorial animal that can display an array of colorful reactions whenever engaged in a competitive situation. As a result of conducting these studies, researchers have found evidence supporting the idea that placing male Siamese fighting fish in close proximity increases aggressive behavior [Dzieweczynski: 2016][Matos:2002][Teresa:2012]. This idea is the focus of study in this experiment where we plan to study the relationship between territory and aggressive behavior within intraspecific relationships. Due to their easily observable reactions, we also plan to use the Siamese fighting fish as a model for this experiment where we will study how placing male Siamese fighting fish in a small tank will affect their behavior. We hypothesize that placing that placing the fish in smaller tanks will increase their aggressive behavior. 

Materials and Methods:
In order to carry out this experiment, we obtained four male Siamese fighting fish and placed two at a time (labeled fish A and B) inside a twenty-gallon fish tank (large) and allowed them to interact with one another for sixty seconds. Within those sixty seconds, the number of aggressive behaviors they exhibited was recorded. Aggressive behaviors counted included any of the six they are commonly known to exhibit— broadside movements (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing) and facing movements (erecting pectorals fins, spreading gill covers, creating a red mane). Next, fish “A” and “B” were placed in a significantly smaller five-gallon fish tank (experimental), where the number of aggressive behaviors they exhibited was counted for another 60 seconds. The same procedure was followed for the other two fish labeled “C” and “D”. After Counting the number of aggressive behaviors for each fish in each tank, the total number of aggressive behaviors exhibited across all fish were averaged together for the large tank (control group) and the small tank (experimental). This was done in order to observe the significant differences in the means of our control and experimental groups with the use of a two-tailed, paired t-test. 

Results:
After conducting the experiment, the experimental group produced a higher mean(6±1.41) than the control (4.75±2.5), which are differences that are not significant (t-stat=1.6, df=3, P=0.19)(figure 1).

Discussion:
Although this data is not statistically significant, it supports our hypothesis as it indicates that placing the siamese fish within a smaller space will increase their aggressive behavior. This point is made clear in figure 1 where the orange bar (representing the number of aggressive reactions produced in the small tank) indicates that across all four fish, there was a small increase in agonistic behaviors once they were moved from the large tank to the small tank. The reason as to why the difference may have been insignificant may have been because the method used for testing for differences in agonistic behaviors is not exactly ideal. As recent studies explain, there are a variety of ways to measure aggressive behaviors within the siamese fighting fish. Being able to identify and quantify all of the individual agonistic behaviors within a short time frame is a difficult task [Peake:2006][Brown:2017]. It is likely that while we were conducting this experiment, we were not able to identify all of the aggressive behaviors produced by the betta fish once they were placed in the smaller tank. Once placed within close proximity, the fish were producing reactions more quickly, making it difficult not to miss some of them. This is especially likely considering the species, produces a number of reactions simutamelsely (i.e. spreading gill covers and creating a red mane). This makes it likely that there were more reactions produced by each betta fish, while in the smaller tank, but they were likely missed. If otherwise recorded, the data would have not only supported our hypothesis but could have also been statistically significant. In terms of future experimentation, applying other methods for quantifying aggressive behavior could aid in increasing the accuracy of measuring this behavior. For example, increasing the amount of time in which the species was observed after having been dropped in the tank from sixty seconds could make it more practical in terms of calculating the ratio difference in aggressive behavior between the small and large tank without having to necessarily count every individual aggressive reaction. Measuring the amount of time that it takes for the fish to produce an initial agonistic reaction after being placed in each tank could be used to quantify these behaviors with the shortest time yielding higher aggression. Also, measuring the amount of time in which the fish interact aggressively before separating could be a method used in terms of determining the betta fish’s aggressive behaviors. Combining these methods together could also produce more accurate results by yielded data regarding agonistic behaviors from varying perspectives; aiding in our understanding of how significant of a factor territory can produce whenever regarding intraspecific relationships among species.
