Title: The negative effect of changing temperatures on agonistic behaviors in Beta splendens 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to determine if a changing environment affected agonistic behaviors in Betta splendens. The effect of changing water temperatures on red mane appearances was tested in this experiment. If a change in environmental conditions affects agonistic behaviors, then bettas in standard condition, like room temperature water, will have more red mane appearances than those adapting to new conditions. Two groups of the same six fish were studied. First, they were placed in room temperature water and red mane appearances were counted for each fish. Then, the same fish, were placed in cold water and red mane appearances were counted. Red appearances were significantly higher for the bettas in room temperature than those in a cold temperature (p=0.023). The bettas in cold water need to allocate more resources to survival and adapting to the new environment, therefore, less agonistic behaviors will be observed. 

Introduction:
Animals respond to certain conditions and stimuli based on evolution’s effects on the way they view the world. In this experiment, the behavior of a male Betta splendens (betta) toward another betta will be observed in a room temperature environment and in a cold-water environment. A change in environmental conditions requires an organism to allocate more resources to adapting to the environment rather than on other aspects of survival, like agonistic behaviors toward competitors. These agonistic behaviors are vital to a betta’s survival and nest protection. In a study on male bettas, it was determined that bettas were most likely to show agonistic behaviors with increasing persistence of the competitor and decreasing distance between nests [Bronstein: 1981]. Without these behaviors, a betta would not be able to defend its territory and reproduce. To determine the level of agonistic behaviors in each environment, red man appearances displayed by the bettas will be counted. A red mane is characterized by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane located underneath the opercula. If a change in environmental conditions affects agonistic behaviors, then bettas in standard condition, like room temperature water, will have more red mane appearances than those adapting to new conditions.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, the behaviors of six different male betas were observed. In room temperature water (11ºC), the behavior of two isolated male bettas was observed for five minutes. Then, the opaque barrier was removed, with the transparent barrier still present, and red mane appearances in each fish were counted for five minutes. The opaque barrier was then replaced, and fish were rested for five minutes. This procedure was then repeated twice more with different bettas so all six fish were viewed once. 
Then, the entire procedure was repeated for cold water (8ºC), with the betas exposed to a different male betta than they were in the room temperature water. Red mane appearances were compared between room temperature and cold water using a two-sample t-test.


Results:
The betta fish in room temperature water has a greater number of red mane appearances (10.33±7.81) than betta fish in cold water (0±0). There was a significant difference between the groups, as seen in Figure 1 (t=3.24, df=5, p=0.023). 

Discussion:
Male bettas in room temperature water displayed agonistic behaviors that were not visible in cold temperature water, therefore, the hypothesis is supported. Bettas are ectotherms, therefore, when placed in a new environment, they must adapt their metabolism in order to survive. The bettas placed in cold water were forced to allocate more resources to survival, rather than to defense and agonistic behaviors. In a study on male bettas, it was determined that in a fight between two, both the winner and the loser almost deplete their amino acids and glycogen for about six hours [Haller: 1990]. This incredible physical toll for a fight could not be possible if the betta was attempting to adapt to a new environment, which would require both amino acids and glycogen.
In the wild, bettas do not experience extreme temperature differences due to their residence in the waters of Thailand. Therefore, the lack of agonistic behaviors in cold temperature could be explained by their lack of evolution in adapting to extreme temperature changes. In a related study, reproductive success was tested in a different tropical ectotherm, Poecilia reticulata (guppies), as a result of increasing temperatures [Breckels: 2013]. It was determined that the guppies in a warmer environment had slower and shorter sperm than bettas in normal water temperatures. This supports our study by suggesting that agonistic behaviors, like reproductive success, suffer when a betta fish is forced to adapt to a different environment. In this experiment, only two temperatures were tested. In order to determine the threshold of cold water that bettas can tolerate before behavior is affected, a range of water temperatures should be chosen for future studies.
