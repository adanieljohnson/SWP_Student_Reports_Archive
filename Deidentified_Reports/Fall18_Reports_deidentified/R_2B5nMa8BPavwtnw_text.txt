Title: The Effect of Lanthanum Trichloride and A23187 on Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The slime mold Physarum polycephalum is known for its various behaviors, such as its ability to grow and reproduce under harsh conditions. One of these behaviors, chemotaxis, can be manipulated through Physarum’s exposure to chemicals. The validity and efficiency of Lanthanum trichloride and A23187 can be tested by comparing the growth of Physarum under these conditions. By measuring the absorbances of three PDA plates for two experimental solutions and one controll, the chemicals’ effect on the growth of Physarum is graphed. The averages of the three plates are recorded and state the consistency of each group. The data reveals the inverse correlation between a A23187 and Lanthanum trichloride. 

Introduction:
Physarum, a genus of mycetozoan slime molds, exhibits various common behaviors as a multicellular plasmodium when exposed to certain conditions. This complex repertoire of behaviors enables Physarum to live and reproduce in environmentally harsh conditions [Takamatsu: 2008]. Among these behaviors, chemotaxis concerns Physarum’s ability to crawl toward or away from molecule sources in the environment [Adamatzky: 2013]. This is important for the slime mold to find food, primarily glucose, by extending its actin microfilaments toward the highest concentration of food molecules, or to flee from poisons, such as phenols. The directionality of the movement is referred to as positive or negative chemotaxis. Various chemicals, acting as inhibitors or activators, effect the growth and directionality of Physarum, and their effects can be compared [Stewart: 2010]. The two chemicals tested were Lanthanum trichloride and A23187. Lanthanum trichloride acts as an inhibitor by blocking the activity of divalent cation channels, mainly calcium channels [Greenberg: 1982]. This is expected to inhibit Physarum through the same biological mechanism. We hypothesize that these chemicals will exhibit inverse effects on Physarum. Lanthanum trichloride will decrease calcium secretion from vesicles, which will sub sequentially decrease phosphorylation and the growth of the slime mold. The addition of A23187 will continuously increase calcium secretion, and thus protein kinase function. This will increase Physarum growth.

Materials and Method:
Three PDA plates are tested in the experimental groups for both Lanthanum trichloride and A23187. A23187 and Lanthanum trichloride are added in 5Ml amounts to three different PDA plates, and the Physarum is later added to the PDA plate in two separate areas of the plate to maximize the data set. Physarum is added through a 100 mm stock plate of the slime mold, and the forceps used to cut and move agar blocks are sterilized each time using an alcohol lamp and ethanol. PDA plates are scored 24 hours later, and growth is measured. Each PDA plate is divided down the midline and two squares are drawn equidistant from each other. These provide a reference for the insertion of Physarum. Once the spatula is sterilized with ethanol, it is placed in a flame of the alcohol lamp. Lanthanum trichloride and A23187 are inserted after the addition of Physarum. Once the procedure is complete, each plate is wrapped in foil, with the plate face up. This allows them to grow without any interference from variable environmental conditions.

Results:
The expected comparison between Lanthanum trichloride and A23187, as seen in figure 1, portrays the inverse effect of the chemicals. The inhibitor decreases calcium secretion from vesicles, which will decrease phosphorylation and the growth of the slime mold. This is represented by the plasmodium’s growth of 1.2 centimeters, which is higher than the controll. The activator exhibits the opposite effect, increasing calcium secretion thus protein kinase function. The actual comparison between Lanthanum trichloride and A23187, when measuring Physarum growth, provides an odd and irrelevant distinction between the effect of both chemical substances. It is evident from figure 1 that the chemicals tested do not correlate with their functions nor our respective hypothesis. These unpredictable values suggest that Physarum’s growth was irrespective of both chemicals’ activation and inhibition. This is highly unlikely, as multiple studies indicate validity regarding the effects of both chemicals. Therefore, the null effect could be the result of various factors.

Discussion:
The chemicals did not display inverse effects on the growth of Physarum; therefore, our hypothesis was rejected. From the results in figure 2, it can be concluded that Physarum grew independently from the chemicals, and the growth itself was minimal. One proposed explanation for the lack of Physarum growth is associated with continued senescence when Physarum is maintained by routine transfer to fresh medium. If routine transfer occurs during the later life of the slime mold, Physarum will exhibit increased senescence as a function of plasmodial age [Lott: 1980]. This implies that the plasmodium given had been routinely transferred to the point of degradation, and this is further exemplified by the possibility of its old age. This routine transfer possibly occurred at the industrial level, and the length of its stay at the laboratory is not known. A second explanation for lack of growth relates to Physarum’s optimal temperature. The slime mold grows at optimal temperatures of 20-25 degrees Celsius [Sussman: 1956]. PDA is kept at cold temperature, resembling a frozen like state when beginning the procedure. When Physarum contacts the PDA plate, its temperature lowers below the optimal range, which prevents Physarum from growing at its optimal potential. If the experiment had worked, these inhibitors and activators could be used for agricultural purposes, such as for the maintenance of crops. However, further research is needed to prove the effectiveness of the chemical substances.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 states the expected averages of three PDA plates tested for each experimental group. The two chemical substances where tested, Lanthanum trichloride and A23187, and they display inverse effects on the growth of Physarum. The baseline controll’s value is between the inhibitor and activator, thereby providing an accurate representation of normal Physarum growth. The P-value for these results, 0.02, indicate statistical significance.

The P-value, 0.04, indicates statistical significance. *************************************************************************
