Title: Manipulating the timing of instar phases and pupation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar using E20 hormone blockers

Abstract:
Hormones regulate growth in many species.  The Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, is one of these species whose growth is regulated by the hormones Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E).  In conjunction, these hormones controll how and when the caterpillars will molt into the next instar, or when they will pupate.  The alternative hypothesis that this experiment was testing was that, when fed 20E blockers, the caterpillars’ ability to molt and grow into the next instar will be delayed, and pupation will be prevented.  This was tested by giving a group of caterpillars 20E hormone blockers in their food and comparing their growth (body mass) and pupation to a controll group that was only given the recommended caterpillar food.  The results were that the treated caterpillars’ growth was stunted and none pupated which was consistent with the alternative.  However, the statistical tests showed that there was not a significent difference in the average mass of the treated group relative to the controll group (P= 0.09).  Therefore, the results yielded from this experiment indicated that the null hypothesis was more accurate.

Introduction:
Hormones are necessary for regulating growth in many species.  In Order Lepidoptera insects, they do this by signaling different phases of development and the onset of metamorphosis.  The Manduca sexta, also known as the tobacco hornworm, is a widely studied model organism that matures in this holometabolous cycle.  Manduca sexta caterpillars go through five instar periods, each of which are separated by a molt.  The caterpillar is then able to reach the final stage before metamorphosis, the pupal phase [Johnson: 2018].  The hormones necessary for regulating this cycle are Juvenile hormone (JH), which determines the type of molt, and Ecdysterone (E20), which signals the timing of the molt [Johnson: 2018]. 

Because Manduca sexta is a model organism, it has been the subject of many studies including an investigation into the effects of Rapamycin in JH deficient caterpillars.  In this study, caterpillars with a mutation in the JH biosynthetic pathway were known to metamorphize into half sized adults because the lack of JH causes E20, which signals pupation to begin, to be secreted early [Hatem et al: 2015].  This confirms that adequate levels of JH are required in order for the Manduca sexta to fully grow before the onset of pupation.  While this highlights the importance of JH, it opens up questions about the necessity of E20.  Therefore, this experiment will be investigating the role of E20 in the growth and pupation of the Manduca sexta by observing the caterpillars’ ability to pupate after being fed E20 blockers.  The hypotheses of this experiment are as follows:

H₀ = The treated caterpillars will grow and pupate at about the same rate as the controll caterpillars
Hₐ = The treated caterpillars will not grow as much as the controll group and will not be able to pupate

Materials and Method:
Eight manduca sexta caterpillars were separated into two groups of four—one being the controll group and the other being the experimental/treated group.  Two containers with four compartments, one compartment for each caterpillar, were prepared with two air holes punched into each compartment.  10 grams of food were measured for each caterpillar and 6 drops of 20E blocker was added to the food of the treated group.  The mass of the caterpillars was measured in grams every day for 13 days and observations were made beginning on day 3 of the experiment.  Food was replenished as needed.  After 13 days, the study was concluded and the caterpillars were euthanized.  The average mass of each caterpillar was calculated.  A two sample T-test was run using these average masses.

Results:
The controll group was observed to be larger and thriving more than the treated group, especially during the beginning days of the experiment.  On Day 6, the caterpillars—both the treated and controll groups—became lethargic and did not eat their food.  There was also liquid beginning to collect in the containers of the controll caterpillars and the food appeared to be more wet than when the experiment was originally set up.  Caterpillar #1 was presumed dead because of lack of response when being handled.  The caterpillars continued to lose weight.  Caterpillar #4 was presumed dead on Day 11 because it appeared to be decomposing.  Only 2 caterpillars (#2 and #3) pupated.

The results of the two sample T-test showed that the average masses of the two groups did not significently vary, for the final calculated P value was 0.09.

Discussion:
While the observations and measurements taken in the lab coincide with the alternative hypothesis, the results of the statistical analysis show that the null hypothesis was more accurate.  Because there was very little significance in the difference of body mass between the controll and treated groups (P= 0.09), it cannot be definitively stated that the addition of E20 blockers had an effect on the growth or pupation of the caterpillars.  Therefore, the null hypothesis that there would not be much difference between the two groups was confirmed by this experiment.  Although these were the yielded results, it is possible that there could have been some errors made which skewed the outcome.  Because only two of the caterpillars from the controll group actually pupated and the other two died, this was not a very accurate sample population size to compare the treated caterpillars to.  Having larger sample groups would have improved the experiment by allowing for more room for error as well as more room for comparison of the treated group relative to the controll group.  

It is also quite possible that repeating this investigation could yield more accurate results because the information from previous studies highly suggests that the alternative hypothesis is very plausible.  As the study of the effects of Rapamycin in JH deficient caterpillars indicated the necessity of JH for regulating pupation, it still leaves room to investigate the role that E20 plays in pupation [Hatem et al: 2015].  In addition to this study, it is known that E20 is important for pupation [Johnson: 2018].  Therefore, this experiment is worth conducting again to determine whether or not the alternative hypothesis is true.
