Title: The supplementation of azadirachtin to the diet of manduca sexta does not significantly affect their weight 

Abstract:
The results of supplementing the diet of manduca sexta with azadirachtin was studied. The change in weight was studied and the diet manipulated for our two groups, control and experimental. We predicted the experimental group fed azadirachtin would weight more after seven days due to its inability to pupate but its continued eating. After feeding and weighing the caterpillars for seven days, it was found that the averages of each groups difference in weight were not statistically different, although the control group did gain more weight than the experimental group. This is potentially because the blocking of Ecdysterone changes its ratio with Juvenile Hormone, changing its hormone balance and caused the caterpillars consuming azadirachtin to lose weight. The research on azadirachtin’s potential effects on the hormone balances of the manduca sexta can increase productivity in the agricultural field.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms) are caterpillars that are considered pests in their larvae form. Hormones are largely in charge of controlling their developmental processes. Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that regulates the timing of molting for insects. It works with Juvenile Hormone (JH) to control the development of these manduca sexta and their ratio with each other is important to the developmental process. [Johnson: 2016]. On the other hand, azadirachtin is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that blocks 20E. It has been linked to causing the inability to moult and mortality in locusta migratoria [Sieber: 1982]. Better understanding how 20E affects insect development and how azadirachtin interacts with it can aid in the agriculture industry. Therefore, will adding AzaMax (containing azadirachtin) to the diet of manduca sexta affect its weight? In our experiment, the dependent variable we tested was weight of the caterpillars while the independent variable used was quantity of azadirachtin being fed to the caterpillars. I predict supplementing azadirachtin to the diet of the experimental group will cause them to weigh more because it will prevent them from pupating; however they will continue eating and therefore, growing. 

Materials and Methods:
We began with eight caterpillars, four named a control group and four in an experimental group. They were all fed 10 grams of food each. The control groups’ food was supplemented with seven drops of water per 10 grams of food and the experimental group was supplemented with seven drops of AzaMax (concentration 1.25:1.00) per 10g of food. The caterpillars were weighed each day, their boxes cleaned out, and their food replenished when dried out or eaten. All caterpillars were kept in identical conditions and obtained from identical conditions. This process of evaluation and feeding was repeated for seven days. A T-Test was used to determine if the difference in weight of the control group from the experimental group was meaningfully different. 

Results:
When analyzing both groups’ weight change, there were initial spikes in body weight the first few days. The control group added more weight longer than the experimental group but eventually both began to lose some of the initial weight they gained. The control group, on average, weighed 4.15g more on day seven than day one and the experimental group weighed 1.19g more on day seven than on day one. In graph A, the two bars represent these two average weight differences and the error bars represent the standard deviations. The control group had a standard deviation of 2.757 and the experimental group had a standard deviation of 1.492. Therefore, the control group found 4.15+/- 2.757 and the experimental group found 1.19+/- 1.492. When utilizing a one-tailed T-Test, a p-value of 0.054 was found, a t-value of 1.887 was found, and 6 degrees of freedom were used. Using this data, we conclude that the control and experimental group are not statistically different from one another.

Discussion:
Based on our results, we can accept the null hypothesis that the experimental group fed azadirachtin will weigh more than the control group. However, our data does suggest that although the two averages are not statistically different, the control group did gain more weight on average than the experimental group. This is potentially because previous research has shown feeding inhibition occur after the locusta migratoria was injected with doses of azadirachtin [Sieber: 1983]. The effects of azadirachtin shift the ratio of JH and 20E as it blocks 20E [Johnson: 2016], therefore altering the chemical balances in their bodies and changing their diet. This lack of diet caused the experimental group to gain much less weight than the control group. In the future, a replication of this study with differing quantities of azadirachtin added to the diet of caterpillars would be useful to test whether azadirachtin itself causes the lack of diet or if it is simply the quantity that the caterpillars in this experiment consumed that initiated their chemical imbalance. As hormones play a role in insect development, the blockage of them is equally responsible for their maturation. Discovering how to best manipulate and maintain these potentially pestful species can lead to bettering the crop yields of farmers and growers of plants these caterpillars cause harm to.
