Title: Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta Fish in Colored water

Abstract:
This study looks at the behavior of the male Betta splendens fish. Male betta fish exhibit highly colorful and aggressive intraspecific behaviors. We want to see the affects a color stimulus would do to their behavioral response times. To do this experiment we used 6 different male betta fish. We also utilized two fish tanks. One tank had clear water while the other tank had darkly colored water. Our hypothesis was that the responses times should take longer in the colored water. This would be due to the fact that vision would be reduced in the colored tank, it would act as camoflauge for some fish. However, our results said the reverse. In looking at our statistical test we can conclude that our data had no significant value. 


Introduction:
In this study we are looking at the behavior of the male Betta splendens (siamese fighthing fish). In further detail, we will be observing the intraspecific behaviors of the fish. Intraspecific behaviors happen between two organisms within the same species. We are utilizing the male betta fish because of there exciting displays when put into the vicinity of another male of the same species.Robertson and Sale (1974) studied Betta displays toward eight different models comprised of specific shapes and body patterns.The overall results suggested that male Betta displayed aggressive behavior in the presence of certain stimuli (e.g. shape and body pattern) (Craft:2003). In more detail, we will look at the affect that coloration in water will have species-specific responses of the male betta fish. In an quarium it is visibility is very high. What would happen if the fish were to be put into murky or darker colored water that impairs vision? We hypothesize that discolored or murky water would lead to a decrease in vision which would correlate to a decrease in agression response times. 


Materials and Methods:
In this study we utilized six different male betta fish with similar coloration.One fish would be more red while the other more blue. This helped us to be able to distinguish the testing subjects. We also used two different testing aquariums. One aquarium was filled with regular clear water. The other aquarium was filled with dark blue/black colored water.  In testing we timed how long it took for each male to iniatiate an agressive response towards the other. To do this we placed a peice of clear plastic inside of the tank creating two different sections. To move the fish in and out of the tanks we used a fish net. In starting the study we first put each fish of a different side of the plastic splitting the aquarium. We then used an opaque peice of plastic to block their view of each other. We waited about 5 minutes for the betta fish to become familiar with the new environment then let them see each other. We recorded the lengths of time it took each fish to exhibit aggressive behavior towards the other. We did this for each set of fish inside of the clear and colored water. We recorded down the results of each trial. In processing our results we utilized a 2-tailed statistical T-test.This type of test utilizes P and T values for understanding the significance of the data. The cut off for significant data is P.05.


Results:
The data depicted in Figure 1 shows the average of the results of each lab trial. In the first set of fish we saw longer reaction times in the clearer waters. In the second trial it takes longer for each fish to become aggressive when placed in the colored water. In the final trial it takes each the red and blue fish roughly 1 minute 30 seconds to react to each other in the colored water. However, the males never reacted, or showed any signs of aggression in the clear water tank. Our statistical test show (t-stat=-1.107, df=2, P=.3834) for our data. 


Discussion:
In looking at the data we find a big difference between the response times to behavior in different colored water. On average it took elevan seconds longer to see a response in clear water than it did in the colored tank. We hypothesized that it would take longer inside of the colored. Our hypothesis was proven incorrect. Even so, in looking at the data we also see very large standard deviations. This means that a lot of values tend to stray from the mean suggesting that our data is not that precise. The p-value for our data was 0.3834. This means that our results hold no significance.
