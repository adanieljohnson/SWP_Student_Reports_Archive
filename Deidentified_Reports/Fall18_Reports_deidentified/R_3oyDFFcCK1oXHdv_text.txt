Title: The Calculation of Root-to-Shoot Ratios to Determine Resource Allocation Methods in Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
With temperatures rising, water evaporating, and species disappearing, climate change continues to prove that increased human activity and exploitation of fossil fuels has its consequences. More of the global biosphere becomes susceptible to permanent destruction, particularly plant species. This study works to explore how plants can allocate their resources in adjustment to temperature changes, and the extent to which phenotypic plasticity plays a role in a plant's ability to survive. The study focuses on field peas, classified scientifically as Pisum sativum L. These plants use a process called resource allocation, concentrating energy on the growth of either the roots or the shoots for the plant to live most effectively within its environment. Six groups of the Pisum Sativum plant were used, placing three in the greenhouse as the control group and three in an incubator as the experimental group. The data from the root:shoot weight ratio (p=0.0263, df=4, t-stat=2.726) and the root:shoot length ratio (p=0.0241, df=4,t-stat=0.0481) were statistically significant. The field peas in the incubator had larger root-to-shoot ratios, showing the plant's adaptability to climate change. This conclusion can aid in the prevention of plant extinction as climate change progresses.

Introduction:
The 20th century experienced the strongest warming trend of the last millennium with average temperatures rising by about 0.6°C [Jones: 2001]. This trend is primarily in response to human activity. During the last two centuries, a large increase in the human population has led to the exploitation of fossil fuel reserves and the destruction of a substantial amount of the world's natural ecosystems [Huntley: 1991]. The levels of 'greenhouse gases' have risen at great speeds and are continuing their patterns at accelerating rates. A predicted consequence of climate change, among many others, is the global increased risk of extinction among species [Thomas: 2004]. It is for this reason that it has become progressively more important for research to be conducted as to how particular species will respond to the earth's rising temperatures. This tends to raise questions such as: how are species currently using their changing environments to survive efficiently based on the effects of climate change? To address these questions, this report focuses on a specific species and gathers information from an experiment that could jumpstart a research project regarding the prevention of species extinction due to climate change. Vegetation is responsible for much of the biomass that exists on earth today. It is for that reason that we chose to study a plant species, as it will more accurately depict how the biosphere might respond to climate change of the projected magnitude in upcoming centuries. This report discusses the examination of phenotypic plasticity and resource allocation in field peas exposed to two distinct environmental conditions; in this case, differences in temperature. Plasticity among phenotypes can be defined as variation in phenotypic expression of a genotype that occurs in response to environmental conditions and which enhances the capacity of the individual to survive and reproduce under those conditions [Sultan: 1987]. Though genetically identical, two organisms of the same species can display notably different characteristics because of the environment in which they reside. This individual adaptability occurs through the process of resource allocation. Allocation of resources by plants is a fundamental and vital activity [Bazzaz: 1997]. An element that allows for variation among plant phenotypes through differences in resource allocation techniques is temperature change, an abiotic factor that has become increasingly relevant in the study of evolutionary and ecological biology due to the alarming effects of climate change. For our research we narrowed our study to the examination of field peas in two different temperature environments. Field peas (Pisum sativum L.) are the most widely grown temperate grain legume in Europe and the second-most in the world [Iglesias-García: 2017]. They are a versatile and inexpensive protein source for animal feeding with a widely acknowledged beneﬁcial role in cropping system, making them a credible species on which to conduct research [Iglesias-García: 2017]. In addition, given our time constraints, their ability to grow and sprout quickly was also taken into consideration. The experiment presented an opportunity to discover how resource allocation differs within field peas depending on temperature changes in their environment, and what trade-offs are created for each group to exist and survive as successfully as possible. The independent variable in our experiment was the two field pea groups, and the dependent variable was temperature, which was regulated by a greenhouse for the control group and an incubator for the experimental group. By being placed in an environment with higher temperatures, the experimental group would experience faster water evaporation. This would in turn cause the field peas in the incubator to grow larger roots than the roots of the group in the greenhouse to absorb enough water to prosper. If two pea plant groups are placed into two different environments, one containing normal conditions and the other containing the abiotic factor of increased temperature, then the pea plant group with the abiotic factor will have a larger root-to-shoot ratio.

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, we planted seedlings of field peas for two groups. First, we soaked the field pea seeds in water for thirty minutes. After soaking, we took six four-inch by four-inch pots which we split to have three containers for the control group and three containers for the experimental group. We then placed three pots on a large black tray with holes in the bottom and repeated the same for the second set of three. We filled the pots with vermiculite, then added pre-water and 50 mL of Miracle Grow to each pot. We made an indentation in the vermiculite about 2-3 times the size of the field pea seeds, then planted at least three seeds in each hole. We covered the holes gently with vermiculite and watered each container. We labeled each tray and placed one in the biology lab greenhouse, which was set at a temperature of 23°C. We then placed the other in an incubator set at a temperature of 28°C. For the next two weeks, both the control group and the experimental group were watered equally each day. They were on similar day and night cycles, as the incubator was set to mimic the amount of sunlight that would be received in the greenhouse environment. After two weeks, the plant groups were removed from the controlled and experimental environments and the root-to-shoot ratios were measured. Each replicate group had three plant shoots and their corresponding roots. They were weighed and measured in mm. 

Results:
The data collected for the weight control group (0.94mm ± 0.14), weight experimental group (1.24mm ± 0.13), height control group (0.48mm ± 0.07), and height experimental group (0.64mm ± 0.069) are in line with the stated hypothesis. Based on these results, and our calculated two-sample t-test, the results we gathered are statistically significant (Weight: p= 0.026, t= 2.726, df= 4) (Height: p=0.024, t= 2.814, df= 4).

Discussion:
Based on the results of our experiment, the hypothesis was supported. Pea plants growing in the warmer environment of the plant incubator will produce a larger root:shoot ratio than plants growing at room temperature. Due to the exposure to an increased temperature in the experimental group (5°C) the field peas in the incubator allocated their resources by growing longer roots than the plants in the greenhouse. This allowed the experimental group to adapt to the given environmental conditions and absorb enough water to survive efficiently. This caused the experimental group's root-to-shoot ratios to in turn be larger. 
The results of this experiment suggest that the root:shoot ratio was larger in the experimental group because it was exposed to an environment with a higher temperature. Higher temperatures increase evaporative water processes within an environment and cause plants to lose water more quickly as a result. This produces a reaction from the plants that causes them to use their energy to grow longer roots. This process of resource allocation ensures that the plant maximizes its ability to consume enough water to survive successfully, giving the incubator pea plants longer and heavier roots. The plasticity demonstrated through the variations between the control and experimental groups explains how pea plants along with other plant species change individually as a result to environmental stimuli and present patterns specific to the conditions to which they are exposed. Limitations for this experiment could include discrepancies in the day and night cycles of the two environments and the amount of water given to each group.
 It is important to understand, especially in this day in age, how plants allocate resources depending on their exposure to climate change. As the planet continues to get warmer due to global warming and water becomes increasingly scarce, phenotypic plasticity in plants will be a deciding factor on which plants will be able to withstand the environmental patterns of the future and which will suffer. A study exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a functional relationship with geographical range size predicts that, following average climate-warming scenarios, 15-37% of species in their sample species alone will be extinct by year 2050 [Thomas: 2004]. Directions that can be taken may include further research on which plants may be in danger of extinction due to climate change and what steps can be taken to prevent that from occurring. Strict precautions to monitor the extent of future climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions are necessary [Huntley: 2001].
