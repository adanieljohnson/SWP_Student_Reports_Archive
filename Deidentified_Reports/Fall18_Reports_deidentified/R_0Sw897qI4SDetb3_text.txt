Title: The result of excess juvenile hormone in the diet of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm, is most commonly found on tobacco farMland and considered a pest in its larval state. We hypothesized that by treating the tobacco hornworms with the juvenile hormone we will be able to controll their life cycle by forcing them to remain in the juvenile stage and never travel into the adult life to reproduce. Hormones are used to exert an organizational effect on the body structure and reduce growth in the hornworm through input signals being sent to the brain and output signals from the brain telling the body how to respond. The juvenile hormone, present in Methoprene, will force the hornworm to continue growing but never reach pupation, thus preventing the reproduction of pests. The hornworms were split into two groups; a controll that was fed with a diet of food plus water and an experimental group that was fed with a diet of food plus Methoprene, a JH analog. After two weeks the hornworms fed with JH gained significently more weight than the hornworms fed with water. The hornworms in the experimental group also never reached pupation. A two-tailed t_test gave us a p_value of 6.31 x 10(-5), supporting our hypothesis. 


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or commonly referred to as the tobacco hornworm, is native to American colonies and found in tobacco fields. The tobacco hornworm takes 19-23 days to complete its life cycle. Sequentially, it travels through the life stages of egg, 1st through 5th instar larva, pupa, and finally adult moth. As an adult, the Manduca sexta is considered a pest because it eats at the tobacco plant and destroys the crop. In order to prevent the insect from becoming a pest, their life cycle must be halted before they reach pupation. The juvenile hormone is a necessary factor for the maintenance of the larval state. Just before the caterpillar enters pupation, in its last instar state, the brain secretes the prothoracicotropic hormone and ecdysteroid hormones rise drastically while juvenile hormones decrease. The work of these hormones allows the caterpillar to go into pupating. This was studied and observed in the study in Poland. They studied the role of juvenile hormone on the larval-pupal transformation of Spodoptera littoralis. They wanted to know if the juvenile hormone would exhibit the same effect on Spodoptera littoralis as it did on Manduca sexta. After applying juvenile hormone to the food of the insects and observing them over a period of 5 days. They observed a drastic change in weight of the insects fed with JH, concluding that the JH exhibits the same effects on Spodoptera littoralis as it does on Manduca sexta. [Kiguchi : 1978]. This infers that in order to keep the hornworms in their harMless larval stage, the juvenile hormone must remain at high levels. In this experiment, the methoprene hormone was used to work as a JH analog and keep the Manduca sexta juvenile. If the hornworm is exposed to such hormone in the larval stage, it will never pupate and mature into the adult stage. It will simply continue to grow in the larval stage until it ultimately dies. We hypothesize that if the tobacco hornworms are treated with JH hormone they will never reach the pupation stage and thus never become pests and reproduce. 


Materials and Method:
We separated eight tobacco hornworms into two groups; a controll group of four hornworms and a experimental group of four hornworms. The controll group was fed 10 grams of food with 10 drops of water each. The experimental group was fed 10 grams of food with 5 drops of Methoprene, the JH analog hormone, each. The hornworms were stored in an incubator. The eight hornworms were weighed daily and continuously refilled on food for 14 days. Their growth and appearance was observed and recorded daily. Once the hornworm began pupation, we stopped recording weight. We used a two-tailed t test with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine the significance of our data. 


Results:
At the end of the experimental period, we took the average change in weight of both groups. The average change in weight of the controll group was 4.615 grams. The average change in weight of the experimental group was 11.61. The standard deviation of the controll group was 0.3395 g +/-. The experimental group had a standard deviation of 1.5689 +/-. The degrees of freedom was 6. The one-tailed p_value was 6.31 x 10(-5). Within the first week of the experiment, there were drastic changes in the weights of the experimental group of caterpillars. They were growing by approximately a gram a day. The experimental group was much larger than the controll group and the 3rd caterpillar in the controll group began to pupate in the second week. The second week of the experiment the experimental caterpillars were only growing by less than half a gram each day and started looking slightly more sickly at the end of the experiment. The controll group stayed about the same weight each day of the experiment, all between 4-6 grams, as seen in Figure 1. 


Discussion:
We rejected the null hypothesis with a statistically significent result and supported that the addition of JH analog hormone increased and accelerated weight gain and prevented pupation into the adult stage. When the JH levels are elevated for a long period of time, they prevent the hornworms to transition into the pupal state of their life cycle [Kiguchi : 1978]. Throughout the hornworms early life cycle, during the 1st through 3rd instar larval stage, the juvenile hormone is kept at high levels. However, just before the commitment pulse, juvenile hormone levels decline. The commitment pulse is produced when signals indicate the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients and is large enough to undergo pupation. If the juvenile hormones are kept at high levels, then the commitment pulse will never be released and the caterpillar will continue to grow. However, there was a point where the hornworms body could not support it as it increased in volume and surface area. At this point in the experiment, around about the 10th day, the hornworms weight gain slowed dramatically. Farmers are able to use results from this study to  prevent the population of pests in their fields. If the hornworms are treated with pesticides that utilize the juvenile hormone, they will never transition into their adult stage, thus never becoming pests and furthermore, never having the chance to reproduce.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Effect of JH on average weight gain of tobacco hornworms. Eight tobacco hornworms were split into two groups of four, the experimental group and the controll group. The experimental group was exposed to JH in their diet while the controll group was not. Each day for 14 days weights were measured. Each bar is average weight change for each group over the 14 day period with standard deviation bars as +/-.
