Title: The Effect of Increasing Concentrations of Calcium Chloride on the Growth and Movement of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime-mold organism that responds to both external and internal stimuli. It is a flat, yellow mass that migrates and responds to stimuli through the process of cytoplasmic streaming which is initiated by the interaction between actin and myosin filaments. Myosin II is the driving force of cytoplasmic streaming and it thought to be inhibited by Ca2+ ions at high concentrations. This experiment studied the effect of CaCl2 on the growth of Physarum polycephalum over a 72-hour period. It was hypothesized that during the first 48 hours, the calcium had an excitatory effect on growth, however, during the third 24 hours the growth of Physarum polycephalum was inhibited by the calcium. PDA plates were treated with varying concentrations of CaCl2 and a culture of Physarum polycephalum was placed in the center of the plates. The migration of the slime-mold under each condition was measured each 24 hours for 72 hours. The results could not be interpreted due to an unexpected inhibition of normal growth of the Physarum polycephalum cultures. The possible biological mechanism that could have potentially caused the growth inhibition is the cessation of cytoplasmic streaming during mitosis due to the decrease in the ATP activity of myosin during mitosis.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum is a slime-mold organism used in laboratories to explore cell signal transduction pathways: allow cells to respond to the stimuli in both internal and external environments [Terry: 2009]. This organism is a multinucleate syncytium, which is a cell that has multiple nuclei within a single plasma membrane [Terry: 2009]. Therefore, each Physarum acts a a single cell visible to the human eye which aids in analyzing stimuli responses. Physarum polycephalum is a flat, yellow mass which crawls through the process of cytoplasmic streaming, a fast back and forth movement of the endoplasm [Terry: 2009]. The interaction between the actin and myosin filaments, which are located within the walls of plasmodial tubes, initiate the cytoplasmic streaming [Terry: 2009]. Myosin II is hypothesized to be the large force driving the cytoplasmic streaming which allows the mold to migrate [Farkas: 2003]. The slime-mold functions optimally under conditions of darkness with high humidity [Terry: 2009]. In general, the migration of Physarum polycephalum is directed by the search of food; however, in the presence of other stimuli, the movement and growth of the organism may be redirected, excited, or inhibited. In this experiment, the effect—either excitatory or inhibitory—of calcium on the growth and movement of Physarum polycephalum is explored. 
	Previous studies state that Ca2+ ions regulate the motility of Physarum polycephalum [Holmes: 1979]. If calcium is not present for Physarum polycephalum then the organism does not indicate to have contractile movements [Terry: 2009]. A previous experiment indicated that calcium ions regulate the contraction of the slime-mold by directly binding to the myosin and inhibiting the ATPase activity of the myosin [Farkas: 2003]. Another study has shared that initially calcium has an excitatory effect on the slime-mold, yet later inhibits the growth and migration of the organism [Terry: 2009]. 
	Therefore, in order to determine if the effect of calcium on Physarum polycephalum is excitatory or inhibitory, the organism was grown on PDA plates—potato dextrose agar in which nutrients for the organism are evenly distributed—with varying concentrations of CaCl2 and the migration of the organism was monitored over 72 hours. It was hypothesized that if Physarum polycephalum is exposed to calcium chloride over a 72-hour period, then during the first 48 hours the calcium will have an excitatory effect on the migration of the slime-mold. However, during the third 24 hours CaCl2 will begin to have an inhibitory effect on the organism’s migration. In addition, the increased concentration of calcium chloride will increase the inhibitory effects on the growth of Physarum polycephalum over the 72 hours measured.

Materials and Methods:
Firstly, the varying concentrations of calcium chloride—0mM, 2mM, and 5mM—were made by diluting a solution of 50 mM calcium chloride with distilled water. Five milliliters of each concentration were then poured onto three PDA plates and soaked for 10 minutes. Therefore, the control test (0mM) and both the two CaCl2 concentration tests (2mM, 5mM) each had 3 PDA test plates. After the 10 minutes of soaking, the excess solution on the plates was poured off and a kimwipe was used to blot off the remaining excess liquid. 
	Secondly, the cultures of Physarum polycephalum were added to the treated plates. A metal spatula was used to cut 1mm × 1mm squares of the slime-mold from the Physarum polycephalum stock culture plate. The spatula was then used, after sterilization in ethanol, to remove a 1mm × 1mm square of agar from the middle of each treated PDA plate. Sterilized forceps were then used to remove the centralized agar square from each PDA plate. The forceps were used to transfer the cut 1mm × 1mm squares of Physarum polycephalum into each of the open square spaces in each of the treated PDA plates. The forceps were sterilized between transfers with ethanol. 
	The migration of Physarum polycephalum in each of the plates was measured with a metric ruler each 24 hours for a 72-hour period. The distance of migration was measured from the current edge of migration back to the nearest edge of the originated slab of the Physarum polycephalum in the center of the plate. Direction of migration was not recorded since the concentration of calcium chloride was evenly distributed among the PDA plates. 
The data was planned to be analyzed by using a two-sample t-test to determine if there was a significant difference between the rate of migrations (mm/hr) of the slime-mold on the control CaCl2 concentrated (0 mM) agar and that of the slime-mold under both the 2 mM CaCl2 conditions and the 5 mM CaCl2 conditions, separately, for each of the three 24 hour periods. Secondly, a line graph showcasing the incremental migration of Physarum polycephalum on the varying concentrations of CaCl2 treated agar over 72 hours would have been made.

Results:
Since the growth data of Physarum polycephalum on the CaCl2  treated plates was not interpretable due to the unexpected shutdown of normal growth by the slime-mold, the expected results are explained.
	It was expected to see growth and migration of the slime-mold during the first 48 hours under all of the varying CaCl2 concentrated agar conditions: 0 mM, 2 mM, and 5 mM. However, according to the hypothesis, under the 2 mM and 5 mM CaCl2 concentrated agar conditions the slime-mold should have migrated further than slime-mold under the control condition, since Ca2+ ions initially excite the cytoplasmic streaming process. In addition, the incremental migration of the slime-mold should have progressively decreased during the third 24 hours under both the 2 mM and 5 mM CaCl2 concentrated agar conditions, since high concentrations of Ca2+ ions bind to myosin and directly inhibit cytoplasmic streaming. However, the inhibitory effect of the Ca2+ ions should have been more significant since increased concentrations of Ca2+ ions directly increase the inhibition of cytoplasmic streaming. An example of the incremental migration of the slime-mold under the varying concentrations of calcium during the 72 hours of measurement is shown in Figure 1. 
The two-sample t-test should have indicated a statistically significant difference between the rate of migration of the slime-mold under the control conditions and that of the slime-mold under both the 2 mM CaCl2 conditions and the 5 mM CaCl2 conditions, separately, for each of the three 24 hour time periods. However, in the experiment, two-sample t-test did not indicate a statistically significant difference between the rate of migration of the slime-mold under the control conditions and that of the slime-mold under both the 2 mM CaCl2 conditions and the 5 mM CaCl2 conditions.
	In the experiment performed, it was observed that, during the second 24 hours, the growth of the Physarum polycephalum under the control conditions, the 2 mM CaCl2 conditions, and the 5 mM CaCl2 conditions was inhibited. Many of the migration values that were recorded for the Physarum polycephalum under all conditions were 0 mm due to an unexpected, yet consistent shutdown of normally functioning growth by the organism. Therefore, with many cultures of Physarum polycephalum in the experiment not exhibiting normal growth, or any growth at all, the results could not be interpreted for accuracy. The recorded incremental migration values of the slime-mold under the varying concentrations of calcium during the 72 hours of measurement is shown in Figure 2. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis could be neither supported nor unsupported by the data collected from the experiment, since the data was not interpretable. The biological mechanism that potentially could have inhibited the normal growth of the Physarum polycephalum in the experiment is the cessation of cytoplasmic streaming during mitosis due to the decrease in the activity of motive force: myosin [Gotoh: 1982]. During normal growth of Physarum polycephalum, the forward streaming of the endoplasm of the organism lasts longer than the backwards streaming; therefore the organism migrates forward [Terry: 2009]. If the organism is not engaging in normal cytoplasmic streaming activity—a fast back and forth movement of the endoplasm—then the Physarum polycephalum is not migrating across the plate to indicate normal growth. ATP is necessary for myosin to interact with actin filaments to cause cytoplasmic streaming, and in a previous experiment it was determined that ATP levels decrease during mitosis [Gotoh:1982]. Therefore, if a majority of the Physarum polycephalum culture that was utilized in this experiment was undergoing mitosis, then normal growth was inhibited due to the halting of cytoplasmic streaming, since the myosin were not being activated by ATP. This biological mechanism of mitosis would support the observation that many of the Physarum polycephalum cultures had shutdown normal growth, as specifically shown under the control conditions, and consistently recorded a migration of 0 mm. 
	Another proposal, besides the proposed biological mechanism that inhibits normal growth of Physarum polycephalum, for why the cultures placed in the treated PDA plates did not exhibit growth is that the there was very little cultured Physarum polycephalum placed in some of the PDA plates. It was observed during the experiment that the stock culture of Physarum polycephalum that was provided did not have a lot of growth. Therefore, the initial concentration of Physarum polycephalum present on each of the treated PDA plates is another variable that could have indicated a shutdown of normal growth by the slime-mold.
