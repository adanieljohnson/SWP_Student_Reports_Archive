Title: The Lack of Effect of cAMP Phosphodiesterase Inhibitor on Physarum Polycephalum Mobility

Abstract:
In this experiment, the goal was to explore the effect of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor such as caffeine on physarum polycephalum mobility. Physarum polycephalum’s cAMP-mediated pathway is similar to that of humans. And caffeinated beverages are regularly consumed by many. Studying caffeine’s effect on physarum polycephalum cAMP-mediated pathway could reveal how caffeine affects human bodies. Physarum polycephalum is a simple organism and can be observed using the naked eye. Physarum polycephalum poses little threat to the environment and human bodies, which all makes it an ideal lab testing subject. Physarum polycephalum were separated into two groups; one group is treated with caffeine solution, another receives no treatment. The average rate of movement toward the food source of the physarum polycephalum is calculated after 48 hours. It is hypothesized that the introduction of the caffeine will make the physarum polycephalum move at a faster rate towards the food source. However, the participants were unable to find a statistically significent difference between sample groups. The null hypothesis that caffeine will not make the physarum polycephalum faster towards the food source cannot be rejected. Further testing is needed to produce a definitive conclusion.

Introduction:
Signaling systems are critical for organisms. Every action conducted by the living species are closely related to the various signaling pathways. Generally, when stimuli, such as mechanical forces and ligands, are perceived by receptors, a second messenger would be released, which would bind to a designated effector to initiate certain cellular responses like the transcription of specific genes, secretion of certain compounds, or post-translational transportation of some proteins [Johnson: 2016]. The cAMP-mediated pathway is a common signaling pathway. This pathway includes a G-protein coupled pathway that could activate adenylate cyclase and cAMP as the second messenger [Sassone-Corsi, 2012]. Adenylate cyclase is an enzyme that would convert ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate or cAMP, which could freely move within the cell. The second messengers can then bind to effectors such as protein kinase A or PKA, which would add a phosphate group to other proteins to induce conformational changes. Different confirmations correspond with the different functionality or states of the proteins and eventually lead to different cellular responses. Physarum polycephalum, also known as slime mold, is a simple organism. It is large enough to be observed with naked eyes. Evidence has suggested that it exhibits some intelligent behaviors similar to that of a highly organized ant colony [Johnson: 2016]. Additionally, physarum polycephalum is relatively harMless to the environment and human bodies, which make it an ideal testing subject. Physarum polycephalum has demonstrated its ability to optimize the route to the food source or chemoattractant and away from chemorepellents and harsh environment. Physarum polycephalum could find the shortest route to the food source due to the signaling system such as cAMP-mediated signaling pathway, which is similar to that found in humans in some ways, despite physarum polycephalum’s simple structure and lack of complex neural system [Alim: 2017]. When the food source becomes scarce, Physarum polycephalum would randoMly send out many branches looking for new food sources. The branches move by extending its actin filaments. cAMP, the second messenger in the cAMP-dependent pathway, is required for the organization and synthesis of the actin filament [Prat: 1999]. The signal for actin filament synthesis is transmitted and amplified by cAMP molecules. The cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) breaks down the cAMP molecules and terminates the synthesis of new actin microfilaments, which stops the movement of the physarum polycephalum. Caffeine is a known cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, which would inhibit the activity of the cAMP PDE. Therefore, the presence of caffeine could prolong the effect of the cAMP. As a result, caffeine theoretically should stimulate the movement of the physarum polycephalum by inhibiting the breakdown of the second messenger. It is hypothesized that the introduction of the caffeine will make the physarum polycephalum move at a faster rate towards the food source.


Materials and Method:
Ten water agar plates were evenly separated into two groups, a controll group and an experimental group. Stock caffeine solution was diluted to 20mM with distilled water. Each experiment plate was soaked in 5 Ml of diluted caffeine solution for 10 minutes. Excess caffeine solution was then carefully removed from each experimental plate. A 1cmX1cm well was cut off from the bottom of each plate from both groups, 1cm away from the edge. The wells were filled with 1cmX1cm stock physarum polycephalum culture plate cubes. One oatmeal flake was placed at the opposite end of the stock physarum polycephalum, 1cm away from the edge. The 10 plates are loosely sealed with tapes and placed in opaque bags. The bags were placed in the incubator and kept at 37˚C for 48 hours. The progression of the physarum polycephalum was then measured and recorded. The average rate of movement was calculated for both the controll and the experimental group. The average rate of movement of the two groups was then compared using a two sample t_test with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
After 48 hours, the physarum polycephalum in the controll group had thicker branches than physarum polycephalum from the experimental group. In some plates from of the controll group, the physarum polycephalum almost entirely migrated onto the oatmeal flake after 48 hours, while no visible physarum polycephalum can be observed in two plates from the experimental group. Physarum polycephalum in other experimental plates also appear to be dry and grey compared to the moist and bright yellow branches observed in the controll plates. The average movement rate of the experimental group is slower than the controll group. The statistical test yields a two-tail p_value of 0.345 and degree of freedom of 8.

Discussion:
The null hypothesis that the introduction of caffeine will not make the physarum polycephalum move at a faster rate towards the food source cannot be rejected. The t_test yields a two-tail p_value of 0.345, which is higher than the alpha value of 0.05. The statistical test suggests that the difference between the average rates of the experimental and the controll group is not statistically significent. One possible explanation is that the caffeine’s inhibition of the cAMP phosphodiesterase prevents the breakdown of the second messenger, cAMP. The constant presence of the second messenger would affect the effectors responsible for actin filament synthesis continuously. As a result, the actin filaments are constantly being synthesized. This continuous synthesis of actin filaments might initially increase the rate of the movement of the testing subject. However, at the same time, the constant presence of cAMP hinders physarum polycephalum’s ability to stop the synthesis of certain actin filaments when they fail to reach the food source leading to unnecessary waste of energy and raw material for constructing new branches that might lead to the food source. Eventually, physarum polycephalum might exhaust its energy and components for actin filament synthesis before it reaches the food source. This will result in the starvation of the physarum polycephalum, which corresponds to the observation that no physarum polycephalum was visible from some of the experimental plates after 48 hours. Another possible explanation for this result is that caffeine not only inhibits the activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase, it also affects the calcium ion channels. Research has shown that caffeine would open calcium ion channels [Olorunshola: 2011]. The excess amount of caffeine in the medium kept the calcium ion channels in the physarum polycephalum open for 48 hours, which might exhaust the calcium ion storage of the testing subject rapidly. During the elongation of the actin microfilaments, calcium ions would bind to one end of the actin filament allowing more monomers to be added [Yin: 1981]. Therefore, when the physarum polycephalum is low on the calcium ion stock, it would not be able to extend its branches to reach the food source, which will lead to the starvation at the end. In the future experiment, the concentration of the caffeine in the physarum polycephalum medium could be reduced to minimize the negative effect brought by the introduction of caffeine, which might yield a more conclusive result regarding how caffeine could affect the cAMP-mediated pathway. Humans share similar cAMP-mediated signaling pathway with the testing subject, physarum polycephalum. Studying the signaling system of physarum polycephalum would help the scientist understand the underlying mechanisms of this pathway in human bodies. Especially when caffeinated beverages have become an integrated part of many people’s daily life, a better understanding of how caffeine would affect this pathway might contribute to improving the overall wellbeing of many individuals.
