Title: The Effects of different stimuli on the aggressive behaviors shown by male Betta fish (Betta splendins)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if different stimuli provoke a difference in aggression in male Betta fish (Betta splendins). Male Betta fish show various aggressive behaviors with varying levels of aggression. The hypothesis was that the male Betta fish will be more aggressive in the presence of another male and food. In order to determine this, we will test a controll group with just two male Bettas and two treatment groups: one with two males and a female and the other with two males and fish food. After recording the aggressive behaviors during each trial and tallying the point totals, the main observation is that there was no significent evidence that there was a difference in the aggressive behaviors in male Betta fish in the three trials, and, as a result, our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Consequently, we were able to conclude that the male Betta fish do not have different levels of aggression in the presence of different stimuli. 


Introduction:
In this experiment, we will be observing animal behavior amongst Betta fish, scientifically known as Betta splendins. These fish are naturally very aggressive and certain stimuli cause these fish to react in varying levels of aggressiveness. For example, male Betta fish are typically a grayish brown or green; however, they become a more vibrant red or dark blue when triggered by a stimulus [Johnson: 2018]. These aggressive acts are interesting to observe as it is very common for these acts to be directed at other male Bettas, otherwise known as intraspecific behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. Male Betta fish display either broadside movements, which is when their side is directed towards their foe, or facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. Within broadside movements, there are varying levels of aggressive acts. The least aggressive act is pelvic fin flickering, then tail beating, and the most aggressive broadside movement is tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. The facing movements also increase in the same fashion beginning with erect pectoral fins, then the expansion of its gill covers, and the most aggressive maneuver occurs when the Betta protrudes its branchiostegal membranes [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we will be observing male Betta fish in two different environments and recording the frequency of each type of movements and how many times they are repeated. We will be testing whether the male Bettas become more aggressive in the presence of another male and food or in the presence of another male and a female. In a study of the behavior of Betta fish, it was found that fish had an increased swimming speed, and they rationalized that this could mean that they respond stronger to the presence of food [Bols and Hogan: 1979]. Therefore, the hypothesis is that the male Betta fish will be more aggressive in the presence of a male and food. 


Materials and Method:
We conducted two trials with three different treatments in this experiment. During each trial, we recorded the amount of times the two-fish performed their aggressive behaviors. As, there were two trials for each treatment, there were four males total. In order to give the aggressive behaviors a quantitative value, we assigned points to each level of aggression. The least aggressive acts were worth one point, these acts included pelvic fin flickering and erect pectoral fins. The next level of aggressiveness included the behaviors of tail beating and the spreading of its gill covers. These behaviors received two points. The most aggressive were given three points and included tail flashing and the protrusion of the branchiostegal membranes. Every time the act was stopped and then repeated we tallied more points and kept track of each individual male in the trials. The first trial tested the aggressiveness of the two males together with no other stimuli for five minutes. They were each then given a rest period where they were completely isolated from each other for five minutes. The next trial we ran was with the same two males and a female in the same space for five minutes. They were all then given another five-minute rest period. The final trial was with the same two males in the presence of six flakes of fish food. The scores were all tallied and recorded. The process was then repeated with two new males in a second trial and their aggressiveness was also recorded during the same three treatments. An ANOVA statistical test was used for this experiment. 


Results:
The difference in aggressive behaviors in the three trials were not significently different from one another (d.f. =2, p_value = 0.56, Fs = 0.618). Although there is no significance between the trials, it is important to note that the average aggressive behavior points for the two males with the female (13.25 +/- 3.057) was higher than with the two males (6.0 +/- 3.057) and with the two males and food (8.0 +/- 3.057) (Figure 1). 


Discussion:
The main observation in this experiment is that there was no significent evidence that there is a difference in the aggressive behaviors in male Betta fish in the three trials. As a result, the data does not support our hypothesis that aggression would be significently different in the trial with two males in the presence of food. Despite this, there are differences in the average aggressive behavior points between the three trials, as seen in Figure 1. It can be noted that certain males displayed more aggression than others. Specifically, in the second round of males, as they had overall lower raw data for aggression in comparison to the first round of males. After further research, it was interesting to find that a similar study had found a difference in behaviors of males in the presence of a female [Doutrelant et. al: 2001]. In the study, males increased their aggressive behaviors when in the presence of a female versus in the presence of a third male [Doutrelant et. al: 2001] In addition, internal hormones are known to controll behaviors in the Betta fish. In particular, serotonin is known to controll aggression in certain animals [Lynn et. al: 2017]. In a previous study, it was found that aggression did not necessarily change with stimuli, but it diminished in the presence of an abundance of serotonin due to fluoxetine, which prevents the reuptake of serotonin [Lynn et. al: 2017]. This may suggest that our experiment does not show significent evidence of a difference between the different stimuli because we did not hormonally affect the Betta fish.
