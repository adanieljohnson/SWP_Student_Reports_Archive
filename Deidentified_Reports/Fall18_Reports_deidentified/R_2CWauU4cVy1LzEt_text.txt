Title: Energy Allocation In oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus)

Abstract:
Plants exist across most landscape such as desert, tropical forest, plateau. Resource allocation is an essential strategy that plants evolved to adapt to the different environmental condition. The adaptation shown as the phenotypic variation in plants. This experiment was mainly focused on the root to shoot ratio of oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) plant treated with and without herbivore. We hypothesized that the plants treated with herbivore would have a lower R:S ratio. Our data showed no significant difference in both length and weight of R:S ratio. This probably due to both systematic error and random error in our experiment. 

Introduction:
Light is a form of energy, and it can be converted to other forms of energy such as heat or chemical (Sadava et al., 2017). Plants convert light energy into chemical energy through a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which cells synthesis condensed carbon compound from the inorganic molecule such as CO2 and H2O in the presence of sunlight and chloroplast, which provide the primary source of energy for the plant’s growth. In the real world, plants had evolved specific strategies in the response of both abiotic and biotic stress. Resource allocation is crucial for plants developed in different environment. The plants grow in arid area will tend to develop longer root than the plants grow in tropical forest, therefore a larger root:shoot ratio. A more extended root system allows plants to grow in arid area absorb nutrient from the deeper soil. Thus plants will allocate more resource on root development. Plants change its root:shoot ratio through two hormone: Auxin and cytokinin. The pioneering work has shown that a high auxin/cytokinin ratio induces root regeneration, whereas a low ratio promotes shoot induction(Skoog F, Miller CO., 1957). This experiment evaluates the influence of the amount of light energy captured on the root:shoot ratio. This experiment treats one group of oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) with herbivore and one without. Oilseed radish is chosen due to its relative short seedling time. Under favorable conditions, oilseed radish seedlings can emerge as soon as 3 days after planting, and provide full canopy cover to shade out weeds in 3-4 weeks (Weil et al., 2006). We hypothesize that the plant treated with herbivore will have smaller R:S ratio than those not treated with herbivores. Since plants treated with herbivore will have less leaf area therefore less photosynthesis occur to provide sufficient amount of energy allocate for growth in root system.

Materials and Methods:
This experiment had chosen oilseed radish(Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus) as the experimental subject.
There were two groups in the experiment, one controlled group and one treated with herbivore. For each group, there were 20 replicates. 5 seeds were planted in one pod separately. Planting seeds: The seeds were soaked 30 minutes before planting, then filled the pots to top with vermiculite. Pre-water and add mir gro(50ml) to each pot. The plants were watered daily until at least 3 branched leaves appeared. Then the leaves were cut 1/3 by nail clipper to simulate the effect of herbivore. The plants were watered daily for another 3days. Harvest and measurement. Then, plants were washed and dried off. The roots were separated from the shoot at the conjunction part. Both length and weight were recorded. One tailed two sample t test was used to determine significant difference in the average length and weight of plants’ R:S ratio. 

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of control plants was 0.18 and the mean root:shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.22 (Fig.1). The mean root:shoot ratio for length in the control plants was 1.20 and the mean root:shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 1.14 (Fig.1). The standard deviation for mass in the control plants was 0.0737 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.0553 (Fig.1). The standard deviation for length in control plants was 0.273 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.254(Fig.1). We used a one-tailed two sample t-test to analyze our results. The mean of the weight controlled group was not statically significant compare to experimental group.(t-stat = -1.594, df= 38, P = 0.119) The mean of the length controlled group was also not statically significant compare to experimental group(t-stat = 0.6388, df= 38, P = 0.5267) When observing the plants on the final day, there was not much visible difference. Based on the data, the growth pattern for both groups were the same. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that the plants treated with herbivores would have smaller R:S ratio than those not treated with herbivores was not supported. Based on the data, there was no significant difference of the R:S ratio between the treated group and the controlled group. There are no relations between the amount of energy captured and plants’ resource allocation pattern. However, the past experiment done by J. Nathaniel Holland suggests that “significant negative relationship between herbivory and carbon allocated to root”[ Holland, J. Nathaniel et al., 1996) Our experiment has both systematic error and random error. First, the plants might need a longer time to have the response to the leave lost. Instead of record the data 3 days after we clipped the leaves, we should allow a longer period for the plant to have the response. Also, we didn’t distinguish the size of leaves and applied a unified standard on the amount of leaves been cut. This could explain that the plant still has enough amount of photosynthetic rate to provide enough chemical energy. The amount of energy lost is not significant enough for plants to change its resource allocation. Therefore, the R:S ratio didn’t have a significant difference. Besides, new shoots were observed after we cut the leaves. It is possible that the plant could regulate the shoot development to compensate for the leave lost. Instead of measure the R:S ratio to represent the energy allocation of the plant, using C-14 carbon dioxide to trace the carbon allocation of plants is a more direct way to show the relations. Isotope-labeling is a technique to track radioactive isotopes in the metabolism pathway (Schlecht, Matthew, 2011). As plant take in C-14 CO2 to carry out photosynthesis, the glucose synthesized will also carry traceable C-14 isotopes. By using the mass spectroscopy we could examine the percentage abundance of C-14 in particular area of the plant.
