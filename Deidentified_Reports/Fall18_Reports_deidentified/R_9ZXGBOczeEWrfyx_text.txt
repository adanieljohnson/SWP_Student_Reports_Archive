Title: The Effects of Water Color and the Presence of Glass Dividers on the Aggressive Behavior of Betta Fish

Abstract:
Ethology is an important aspect in determining how species interact with one another, as well as interact with other species. In this study, we were able to observe how Betta Splendins behavior changed when introduced to another male of the same species in different colored water and with and without a physical but transparent barrier. We predicted that there would be no significent difference in the behavior of Betta males when placed in clear, red, and green water. Our data did not show a significent difference in behavior of Betta males in different colored water conditions and with the presence of a glass divider. Our results suggest that water color does not have an affect on behavior, as the males were similarly aggressive in all three conditions. This helps explain how Betta males react when in the presence of another male, which is not affected by water color or glass. This study also helps to demonstrate how Betta fish use their physiology and fitness to compete with other males for female attention and to ensure their survival.

Introduction:
This experiment examines the effects of water color and the presence of glass on the behavior of two pairs of Betta Splendins. In order to measure and examine intraspecific behavior or ethology, we used Betta fish because of their tendency to demonstrate aggressive reactions when they come in contact with one another. It is important to study animal behavior in order to understand how behaviors have evolved, how specific behaviors affect the fitness of animals, and how interactions affect behavior and an organism’s physiology [Johnson: 2018]. When in contact with other males, which they view as opponents, Betta fish will display varying levels of aggressive behavior, such as broadside movements, facing movements, and agnostic behavior. Broadside movements are when a Betta turns its side toward its opponent and include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. Facing movements occur when a Betta male directly faces its opponent and include erect pectoral fins, spreading of the gill covers (opercula), and producing a red “mane” caused by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane below the opercula [Johnson: 2018]. Other agnostic or aggressive behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head, arching the back, darkening the skin, darting, biting, and nipping [Johnson: 2018]. Before they were domesticated in 1850, Bettas used to change color to a dark blue or red in the presence of a threat; however, they retained these “fighting colors” after selective breeding during the aquarium trade in the United States from 1910-1930 [Johnson: 2018]. We plan to test the effect of different water color on the aggressive behavior between two Betta males with and without a glass divider. We predict that there will be no significent difference in behavior when in clear water compared with green and red water. The independent variable is the color of the water and the dependent variable is the aggressiveness of the Bettas.

Materials and Method:
Two tanks separated into three sections by a glass divider were filled with water. The first tank was clear and the second take was dyed red. Two different pairs of male Bettas were placed in both tanks and each pair was to be tested in all three conditions of water color (clear, red, and green). For each trial, the Betta’s behavior was examined with the glass divider and then without the glass divider. Each trial was conducted for five minutes and then the Bettas were given five minutes of rest. After the trials with the clear water were complete, the Bettas were transferred to a temporary tank while the first tank was dyed green. After one pair had finished both trials for one water color, they were transferred to another tank with a different water color. Each pair of Bettas underwent six trials in three water colors with and without the glass divider in each. Behavior of each male under each condition was recorded on a scale of 1-5, one showing no aggressive behavior and five showing the most aggressive and agnostic behavior. An ANOVA test was used to test if there was a significent difference in behavior of Betta males in different water colors with and without a glass divider.

Results:
For the trials in the three water colors with the glass divider, the results were not statistically significent (F (11) = 0.842, P=0.462). For the trials in the three water colors without the glass divider, the results were also not statistically significent (F (11) = 0.206, P=0.818). Although the highest average level of aggression was seen in the green water without the glass divider (4.00 +/- 2.00), this result was not significent enough to determine if water color and the presence of glass affects the aggressive behavior of Betta males.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis for the level of aggression in Betta males was supported, as there was no significent difference in behavior due to water color or due to the presence of a glass divider. Although the glass divider physically separated the males so they could not attack each other, they still displayed similar amount of aggression with and without the divider. We also found that the color of the water did not affect the behavior of the individuals when in the presence of another male. However, through our observations, we did find that the group of two blue males displayed very different levels of aggression, as one proved to be more dominant than the other. This pair also seemed to display the most aggressive behavior when in the clear water, yet one was still inferior to the dominant Betta. Through this study, we also found that the smaller male can make himself seem larger by spreading his fins in order to compensate for his smaller body size and can dominate the larger male. As the experiment continued, we found that the fish were not displaying the same degree of aggressive behavior, even after five minutes of rest between each trial, suggesting that they were fatigued or had begun to familiarize themselves with their opponent. In another study where two groups of Bettas, one that was provided with a visual of other Bettas for ten days and another that was visually isolated from other Bettas for ten days, found that previous social experience may have an effect on the intensity of Betta behavior, as the isolated Bettas displayed aggressive behavior more often when introduced to another male Betta compared to the visually experienced Bettas [Miley: 1977]. If we were to further investigate this experiment, we would switch the pairs so that the same males were not together for every trial in order to test if behavior changes when introduced to a new male. The red and blue pair displayed similar levels of aggression under each condition, showing how Bettas typically mimic the other male’s movements and match their level of aggression. Understanding how Betta males react to one another under different conditions helps explain animal behavior and physiology, as well as how different behaviors affect a species’ fitness.
