Title: The Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition on Manduca sexta Development

Abstract:
In Manduca sexta, as in most organisms, fluctuating distributions of various hormones regulate the stages through which physiological development proceeds. In Manduca sexta specifically, three hormones play crucial roles in prompting development: ecdysterone, juvenile hormone (JH), and prosthoracicotopic hormone. This experiment seeks to gauge the effects of an ecdysone inhibitor on the development of Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that introducing the ecdysone inhibitor would result in a diminished or nonexistent commitment pulse, thereby yielding unregulated and unsustainable growth. We predicted this result would occur because we believed the commitment pulse had directly regulatory effects on growth. We fed a control group a standard diet, while an experimental group was fed a diet with a low concentration of ecdysone inhibitor. The control group grew to a greater maximal weight on average than did the experimental group, and pupated where as the experimental group did not, indicating that although the commitment pulse was prevented, growth did not continue. Our statistical analysis, with a p value of 0.0002, concluded that our results were significant. Potentially, the ecdysone inhibitor only inhibited the commitment pulse but did not have...

Introduction: Manduca sexta is an insect in the order Lepidoptera. Its development is regulated by three hormones: ecdysterone, juvenile hormone, and prosthoracicotopic hormone. Previous research has identified certain insect growth regulators which have the capacity to inhibit or over-exert the regulatory processes responsible for the development in insects. Ecdysterone is responsible for moderating the restructuring and death of certain motorneurons, and for signaling that growth has reached a milestone in the developmental process [Levine: 1996]. The commitment pulse, a small peak in ecdysone, facilitates the next stage of development. Understanding the mechanisms by which pest insects grow and develop is necessary for agricultural advancement, as mitigating the impacts of pest insects is an important agricultural factor. With the information gained by studying hormonal regulation, certain insects which are pests in specific stages of growth can be exterminated by manipulating their hormonal activities with specifically formulated pesticides. This experiment will test the effects of an ecdysone inhibitor on the development of Manduca sexta. A control group will be fed a standard diet, while an experimental group will be fed a diet with a low concentration of ecdysone inhibitor. We hypothesize that introducing the ecdysone inhibitor will result in a diminished or nonexistent commitment pules, thereby yielding unregulated and unsustainable growth.

Materials and Methods:
To assemble the experiment, we obtained two identical plastic containers which were subdivided into 4 self-contained sections. We randomly divided eight similarly sized Manduca sexta caterpillars into two groups of four, and placed each caterpillar in one chamber, with each group of four in one container. We then measured ten grams of food per caterpillar and deposited a ten gram clump into each chamber. We mixed four drops of water into the control group’s food, and four drops of ecdysone inhibitor into the experimental group’s food. We placed the containers in an incubator, and proceeded to record each caterpillars weight for two weeks. During this time, we also recorded observations of color change and any other pertinent visual data. After the conclusion of the experimental period, we used a two sample, one tail t-test to determine the statistical significance of the results.

Results:
The control group caterpillars grew to maximum weights that were on average 4.33 ± 0.213 grams greater than their beginning, while the group treated with the ecdysone inhibitor grew to maximum weights that were on average 3.21 ± 0.380 grams greater than their initial weights (Figure 1). The statistical tests showed that the results were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. In comparing the average growth from initial weight to maximum weight, we found that t-stat= 6.852, P=0.0002, df=6. The caterpillars in the control group retained a bright green color until they pupated, forming a brown semi-transparent shell. The experimental group adopted a duller green color, showed little movement, and displayed indicators of partial pupation, such as patches of tough brown shell material.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that treating Manduca sexta with a low concentration ecdysone inhibitor would result in unregulated and unsustainable growth was not supported by the resulting data, which showed that the control group experience greater growth (4.33 grams) than did the group treated with the inhibitor (3.21 grams) (Figure 1). We did predict that the commitment pulse would be nonexistant, substantiated in the data by the failure of the experimental group to pupate. Ecdysterone is responsible for certain changes that promote metamorphosis [Levine: 1996]. It is therefore likely that the reduction of ecdysone minimized the commitment pulse. However, because growth did not continue throughout the experiment, but rather reached a peak lesser than that of the control group’s and decreased, it may be possible that ecdysone does not itself regulate growth stoppage, but rather communicates when it has occurred. Thus, the experimental Manduca sexta ceased growth as normal but without occurrence of the commitment pulse could not pupate. This knowledge is pertinent to the agricultural and insecticide industries, as certain regulatory processes within pest insects can be manipulated to mitigate the pest’s impacts. Further research conducted to determine the mechanism by which juvenile hormone is allocated during earlier instars could be beneficial in eradicating the pest at an earlier stage in its development.
