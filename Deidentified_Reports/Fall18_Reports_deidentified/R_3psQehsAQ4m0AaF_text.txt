Title: The Effect of Caffeine on Chemotaxis in Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum was tested in the presence of caffeine in order to determine its effect on the cAMP mediated signal transduction pathway that allows chemotaxis to occur. Caffeine has been found in one publication to be an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, said to promote positive chemotaxis, and in another to inhibit the activation of cAMP through the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, said to inhibit positive chemotaxis. The hypothesis was that the rate of growth towards food in the presence of caffeine would increase relative to a controll sample of physarum. The data supported the hypothesis, showing that caffeine promotes positive chemotaxis in physarum, but was not statistically significent.

Introduction:
Slime Mold, physarum polycephalum, is a multinucleate syncytium, composed of a mass of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane [Johnson-2016]. Due to its structure, it is a specimen that enables scientists to observe a variety of cell processes without the use of a microscope [Johnson-2016]. One of these processes, signal transduction, is a process that allows the cell to communicate with itself to activate a variety of processes through a series of messengers [Johnson-2016]. A specific behavior that uses signal transduction in physarum is chemotaxis, which is the retracting or attracting of movement in the physarum towards or away from a chemical [Johnson-2016]. Movement in chemotaxis towards food is monitored by the cAMP mediated signal transduction pathway through its role in metabolism [Johnson-2016]. The effector enzyme that is activated by the G protein is adenylate cyclase, which is able to convert ATP into cAMP[Johnson-2016]. Protein Kinase A is a second messenger that is activated by cAMP, and results in a variety of signals created to allow the physarum to function, such as in movement towards food [Johnson-2016].  Phosphodiesterase is a inhibitor that is able to break down cAMP, and when the phosphodiesterase is inhibited, can create the same responses as stimulating the creation of cAMP [Johnson-2016]. The positive and negative chemotaxis that physarum uses has been analyzed in previous experiments using the molecule caffeine [Kinkaid 1979]. In one study, caffeine has been found as an activator of positive chemotaxis towards food due to its inhibition of phosphodiesterase [Kinkaid 1979], while in another study as an inhibitor of the activation of adenylate cyclase, and therefore an inhibitor of positive chemotaxis [Brenner 1984]. This contrast in information on the effects of caffeine on the signal transduction pathway involving cAMP is one that must be further explored and will be tested in this experiment. The hypothesis is that when in the presence of food and caffeine, the phosphodiesterase will be inhibited, and therefore the leading edge of the physarum sample will be promoted to grow towards the food. The impact of this study is to clear up contradicting case studies and determine the effects of caffeine on an organism. As that caffeine is one of the most popular consumed beverages, it is a molecule that should be investigated for its effects on the signal transduction pathways in the human body, as that some studies have seen immunomodulatory actions of caffeine due to its inhibition of phosphodiesterase, therefore increasing the cAMP concentrations [Horrigan-2006].

Materials and Method:
Additional materials that were required to what would be typically found in a lab were 40 Ml caffeine solution, 40 Ml dibutryl cyclic-AMP (db-cAMP) solution, oatmeal, 10 water agar plates, 1 negative, 1 pint of ethanol, spatula, ruler, forceps, foil, and plate of physarum culture.
10, 100 mm petri plates containing 2% agar in water were brought to the table. On the back of the plates were written the names and date. On the back, a one 1 cm x1 cm square was drawn on the far-left side on each of the 10 plates. On 3 plates ‘Caffeine’ was written. On 3 other plates, ‘Control’ was written. On 3 other plates, ‘db-cAMP’ was written. On 1 plate, ‘Blank, negative controll’ was written. The10 plates were turned over, lid up. 20x caffeine solution was diluted by using 5 Ml of caffeine and filling a beaker to 100 Ml with distilled water, creating a 20: 1 solution. 20x dibutryl-cAMP solution was diluted by using 5 Ml of db-cAMP and filling a beaker to 100 Ml with distilled water, creating a 20: 1 solution. On the 3 caffeine plates, 10 Ml on plate were applied, then liquid was removed from plate after 10 minutes. On the 3 db-cAMP plates, 10 Ml were applied on plate, then liquid was removed from plate after 10 minutes. The spatula was sterilized, let cool, then one, 1 cm x 1 cm squares to far left was cut into the agar in EACH of the 10 water agar plates. The block of agar was removed. The spatula was returned to the ethanol. The spatula was sterilized in ethanol, 10, 1 x 1 cm square slabs were cut from the physarum plate. Using sterile forceps, one slab was inserted into each of the corresponding 10 plates, over the correct labeled square. For all plates except the blank plate, between 6-8 pieces of oatmeal were inserted 3.5 cm away from the square of physarum culture. The lid of each plate was taped to hold it in place. All 10 plates were wrapped completely in foil, labeled, then placed into the incubator, dark drawer, or side cubby overnight (24 hours). The growth from the leading edge of the physarum was recorded. A two tailed T-test was used, comparing the growth rates of the treatment groups (caffeine and db-cAMP) to controll group.  


Results:
In order to determine the effects of caffeine on the chemotaxis involving the cAMP pathway in physarum, we determined the rate (cm/hour) that the physarum grew from its starting point towards the oatmeal placed at the other end of the agar plate, and is recorded in Figure 1. We found that the physarum culture grew the most towards the food in the caffeine solution environment (P-value=0.076, t_stat=1.8, d.f.=4), while the physarum culture exposed to the db-cAMP grew the least towards the food (P-value=0.08, t_stat=1.7, d.f.=4). This means that chemotaxis was more inhibited in the db-cAMP treatment, while the caffeine increased the chemotaxis of physarum relative to the controll group. The data was not statistically significent when using a two-tailed T-test to compare directional statistical significance between the controll and each of the treatment groups.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment are in favor of the hypothesis, which stated that the rate of growth towards the food would be the greatest in the presence of caffeine. However, because the data was statistically insignificent, the hypothesis cannot be statistically supported. The movement of the different treatment groups, however, shows that the caffeine treatment, with an increased growth rate compared to the controll group, had an increase in positive chemotaxis towards the food, suggesting that the study by Kinkaid, which explained that caffeine acted as an inhibitor for phosphodiesterase, which is the molecule that is responsible for shutting off the production of cAMP, and therefore would promote positive chemotaxis, was supported [Kinkaid-1979]. Due to the inhibition of the inhibitor phosphodiesterase, the production of cAMP most likely increased, increasing the cAMP-mediated signal pathway that promotes movement [Kinkaid-1979]. The study by Brenner that showed caffeine as an inhibitor of growth, claiming that it blocks the adenylate cyclase, therefore inhibiting the signal pathway promoting positive chemotaxis, was not supported in the results of our research. The sample that had the db-cAMP solution decreased in its rate of growth towards the food. It has been shown that db-cAMP was intended to activate PKA, which in turn was predicted to increase the rate of positive growth of the Physarum [Johnson-2016]. This aligns with studies that have shown the overactivation of PKA inhibits further growth of spores [Saran 2003] and that although activation of PKA is required for chemotaxis, an overactivation or inhibition of PKA impedes the mobility [Howe 2005]. The reason why this study is important is because it shows that contradictory studies may be published, that further research of any experiment is important, and that the effects of caffeine on mobility, although increasing rates of growth in physarum, must be taken into consideration for long term effects on the increased concentration of cAMP and effecting of altering a signal transduction pathway’s rate in other organisms [Horrigan-2006].
