Title: Effects of Light on Photosynthetic Activity in C3 and C4 Plants

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important metabolic process for all living organisms. Photosynthesis includes the process in which the chlorophyll molecules absorb energy from sunlight and synthesize ATP and NADPH. C3 plants and C4 plants have different mechanisms of photosynthesis; C4 plants have additional C4 light-dependent pathway in order to adapt to the wet and dry tropics. The hypothesis is that C4 plant photosynthesizes more efficiently than C3 plant does, and C4 plant photosynthesizes better under light conditions. The results show that the difference between light and dark group, and the difference between photosynthetic activity in C3 and C4 plants are not significent; p value was 0.185 for light and dark condition, and 0.160 for C3 and C4 plant. Despite of the research done by scholars, our results refuted the hypothesis; there was no significent difference in photosynthetic activity between C3 and C4 plant, and light intensity. 

Introduction:
The two most important metabolic process for organisms are photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Plants use the process of photosynthesis to capture and store energy from the sun. The process of photosynthesis involves two main pathways: a light dependent reaction and light independent reaction which is also known as Calvin cycle. In the light-dependent reaction, the chlorophyll molecules absorb energy from sunlight and synthesize ATP and NADPH. In the light-independent reaction, synthesized ATP and NADPH are used up for the synthesis of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide. 
	C3 plants and C4 plants have different mechanisms of photosynthesis. C4 plants go through additional C4 pathway due to adaptations to the wet and dry tropics, and two steps of C4 photosynthesis are light-dependent. They use an alternate enzyme for the first step of carbon fixations, called PEP carboxylase which has higher affinity for CO2 than rubisco which uses ATP and reducing power in NADPH to create 6-carbon glucose molecules. C4 photosynthesis represents “modification of C3 photosynthesis to reduce Rubisco oxygenase activity and thereby increase photosynthetic rate” [Ehleringer: 2002]. C3 and C4 plants have different response to light as well. C4 plants carry out C4 photosynthesis more efficiently as C4 plants’ light saturation point, which is the point where the rate of O2 evolution levels off and any further increase in light does not affect the rate of photosynthesis, is higher and the light compensation point where the net CO2 assimilation is zero, is lower than that of C3 plants [Levai: 2013]. 
In this lab, we used Chrysanthemums as our C4 plants and Spinacia oleracea as our C3 plants to compare how they photosynthesis differently in the presence and absence of light. Photosynthetic activity was measured by DCIP reduction which can be measured using the decrease in light absorbance at 600nm. Our hypothesis is that C4 plant photosynthesizes faster than C3 plant does, and under light condition, they will photosynthesize better. 


Materials and Method:
The experiment was performed with leaves of Chrysanthemums and Spinacia oleracea. They were prepared by grinding with 20Ml of cold grinding buffer and filtered using cheesecloth. Chloroplasts were extracted by centrifuging solution of grinded leaves. Total of 14 test tubes were prepared – 7 for Spinacia oleracea and other 7 for Chrysanthemum. The two test tubes were for blank which had no reagent and 130mM DCIP, and had 8 Ml of distilled water and 2Ml of 100mM phosphate with pH of 6.5. Each of 12 test tubes had chloroplasts, 6 Ml of distilled water, 2 Ml of 130mM DCIP and 2Ml of 100mM phosphate with pH of 6.5. 
	We divided each plant into two groups – 3 tubes were placed under the glow light, and 3 tubes were placed in a dark drawer to test the effects of sunlight on photosynthetic activity. After 30 minutes, absorbance of each tube was recorded using the spectrophotometer.  We conducted two-way ANOVA to determine if photosynthetic activity differs between C3 and C4 plants, and between light and dark activity. 


Results:
As depicted in Figure 1, both Spinacia oleracea and Chrysanthemums had the bigger percent change in absorbance under light conditions, meaning that the electron transfer reaction was more active under light condition. However, the difference in percent change in absorbance between dark and light conditions for Spinacia oleracea was larger than that for Chrysanthemums. According to the two-way ANOVA test, p_value for light and dark condition is 0.185 and p_value for Spinacia oleracea and Chrysanthemums is 0.160 which indicates that the difference between light and dark group, and the difference between C3 and C4 plants are not statistically significent. 

Discussion:
The result did not support the hypothesis that C4 plant photosynthesizes faster than C3 plant does under any conditions, and they will photosynthesize better under light conditions. The difference in photosynthetic activity between C3 and C4 plant was insignificent. However, Figure 1 shows that both plants reacted to the light in the same trend: the percent change in absorbance was larger under light conditions indicating that electrons reduction reactions were carried out more under light conditions for both plants.  
Despite of the fact that the efficiency of C4 photosynthesis is greater than the C3 type under conditions that promote high rates of photorespiration [Osborne: 2012], the electrons reduction reactions were more active in C3 plants. C4 plants should have higher efficiency in photosynthesis because the oxygenase activity of Rubisco, which is essential for carbon fixation is effectively suppressed and the PCR (photosynthetic carbon reduction) cycle operates more efficiently [Furbank: 1995]. However, Figure 1 shows that Chrysanthemums, C4 plant, had less difference in percent change in absorbance between dark and light conditions. This may indicate their constancy of photosynthetic activity under both dark and light conditions.  The research done by Bunce stated that C3 plants have high reactivity towards light intensity because the reduction in in rubisco activity is strongly effected by low light and atmospheric CO2 concentration [Bunce: 2016]. 
	It is still questionable what led to C3 plant’s higher percent change in absorbance; it can be assumed that Chrysanthemums has relatively lower photosynthetic activity than Spinacia oleracea does. Therefore, the results refuted that C4 plant photosynthesizes better than C3 plant does, and photosynthesizes faster under light conditions, even though C4 plant showed less reactivity towards light.
