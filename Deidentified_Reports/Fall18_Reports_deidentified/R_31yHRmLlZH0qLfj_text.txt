Title: The Effects of NaCl and MgCl2 on the Photosynthetic Processes with the use of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
A plants ability to complete the process of photosynthesis is imperative to its survival. Plants use the photosynthesis to break down sunlight into nutrients that can be used for their daily living. Photosynthesis can be inhibited by many factors, most importantly chemicals and other elements. Spinacia oleracea, or spinach, chloroplasts have the ability to photosynthesize and is easily usable for testing inhibition of photosynthesis. NaCl and MgCl2 both act as inhibitors, however, MgCl2 should decrease the percent absorbance of the light molecules significently better than NaCl. In other studies, NaCl has acted as a temporary inhibitor, however, as the time passes, the membrane of the leaves become thicker to resist the salinity. This showed in the following experiment as well, in that the chloroplasts in the presence of NaCl had little to no inhibition. The chloroplasts in the presence of MgCl2 had significent inhibition and therefore the lowest percent absorbance of all of the groups. 


Introduction:
Plants and some other green autotrophs undergo the process of photosynthesis in order to create nutrients for themselves. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to synthesize nutrients from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis is possible through the plant organelle called the chloroplasts. The chloroplasts contain the green pigment chlorophyll that allows for the process to occur. The process of photosynthesis also created other byproducts including oxygen. The entire chemical formula for the process is  6CO2 + 6H2O  C6H12O6 + 6O2, and the process cannot completely occur without solar energy. There are several factors that can hinder the process, which include reducing the light a plant receives, reducing the needed factors, the treatment of herbicides and the addition of various other chemicals. Photosynthetic inhibition can be measured by measuring the 2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) absorbance. DCIP is the electron receptor that is used in lab to measure how much photosynthesis is occurring. Chemicals such as NaCl and MgCl2 have proven to have a photosynthetic reductive effect on plants. However, it is unknown whether MgCl2 has more of an effect on photosynthetic reduction than NaCl. In a 1989 study, it was determined that MgCl2 caused the thylakoids to lost approximately 80% of their activity in photosystem II, but not photosystem one; however, this was in the presence of sorbitol [Sundari: 1989]. If similar concentrations of NaCl and MgCl2 are placed with enriched isolated chloroplasts, then MgCl2 will have a greater inhibiting effect on photosynthesis than NaCl. It is also expected that the percent change of DCPIP absorbance will be significently lower in MgCl2 than in NaCl.


Materials and Method:
Retrieve four large spinach leaves, 20 Ml 100mM NaCl, 20 Ml 100mM MgCl2
50 Ml 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (grinding buffer), ice, cheesecloth, 30 Ml DCIP, and 25 Ml Hill Reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Then a mortar, pestle, 150-250Ml beaker, and three, 50Ml centrifuge tubes were place into crushed ice to cool. Once the mortar and pestle cooled, the spinach was crushed with 10 Ml of400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer (cold grinding buffer). A spinach slurry was then created. Once all the large, prominent pieces are grinded, add an additional 10 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer. Then strain the entirety of the slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transfer the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A” and spin it at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4C, being sure to balance the centrifuge. Once the sample is centrifuged, pour the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B”. Centrifuge the 50 Ml tube “B” at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4C. Again, pour the supernatant, into a clean 50 Ml tube marked “C”. Placed tube “B” on ice. Once tube “B” is on ice, add 20 Ml of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer to the pellet and stir it gently with a transfer pipet. Placed the enriched chloroplasts on ice while preparing the test tubes. Labeled 10 large test tubes and place them in a tube rack. Prepared 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes:

Mixed each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts and transfer the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Then immediately blanked the spectrophotometer using Tube #0. Took the absorbance of all the samples (these are your Time Zero data points). Placed the samples in a rack on a sunny windowsill, or under the glow light. After 10 minutes, blanked the spectrophotometer with Sample #0. Then read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After recording absorbance, returned samples to light source. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in light, blanked the spectrophotometer, then measure the absorbances a second time for each sample. Returned samples to light source after reading absorbance. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total), blanked the spectrophotometer and measure absorbances one more time for the samples. Recorded results and perform a one-tailed t test. 


Results:
The results yielded both expected and unexpected results. The test tubes with the MgCl2 had significently reduced DCPIP absorbance levels than the test tubes with NaCl and with only chloroplasts (Figure 2). A t_test was run with an alpha level of 5. With a t of 0.684, the results yielded a statistical significance, meaning that the results had a large enough difference that it can be stated that the results are not due to random error, but do to the treatments (Figure 2). 



Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported by the experiment, in that, the chloroplasts in MgCl2 had significently lower percent absorbance of DCIP than those in NaCl. However, the samples with NaCl, had more percent change in absorbance than the samples with only chloroplasts (Figure 2). This was unexpected because it was thought that NaCl would have some effect on the percent absorbance. In several studies, the use of NaCl had some inhibitive effect, however, over a period of time, the leaves began to adjust to the environment and began to become thicker [Robinson, et al.: 1983]. Using this information, it was thought that due to the experiment being thirty minutes and not two weeks, the chloroplasts would not have the time to adapt. These unexpected results could have been due to experimentation error. 
Over the 30-minute period, the average percent absorbance of DCIP for the chloroplasts containing NaCl was approximately 31%, while it was 8% for the chloroplasts in MgCl2 (Figure 1).  The MgCl2 inhibits the ability of photosystem II to work by changing the ionic environment around the thylakoids in the photosystem. The salt and ions of the MgCl2 caused for the membrane potential in the thylakoids to be thrown off and causes them to become inoperable, which was a similar result to a study done that showed the same effect, however, the results showed that photosystem I was still fully operational, which doesn't entire align with our results [Baker: 1978].  Although the NaCl percent absorbance levels were higher than they should have been, it can still be expected that the percentage would have been higher if there were no errors. The percent changes are also different than those calculated in the lab due to the absorbances having been measured 5 minutes after the addition of chloroplasts and not immediately. To accommodate for this error, the percent changes for the first ten minutes were set to zero, which also helped corrected that the percent absorbances that were calculated were calculated as negatives for all groups. The negative percent changes were caused by not correctly blanking the spectrometer with the blank, which caused the spectrometer to read the rest of the values as negative absorbances and not as absorbances relative to the data.  
Future experiments could include running the experiment over a longer amount of time, which could yield more significent results. Also, testing again would allow to determine if the percent absorbances for the NaCl occurred due to error or not.
