Title: The effects of Ecdysterone in Manduca Sexta in preventing pupating

Abstract:
In this experiment, we present evidence that proves that adding a 20E blocker to a Manduca Sexta food will result in the Manduca Sexta to not pupate. We had two groups of 4 caterpillars each and added 6 drops of ecdysterone, or 20E, to every 10 grams of food that we served to the treatment group of the caterpillars. We replaced the food every other day for 13 days and in our results, we discovered that the 20E blocker slowed the growth of the treatment group and prevented them from pupating and not eat as much which in result, causes them to be as much of a pest.

Introduction:
Hormones regulate the growth in Manduca Sexta like they would in humans or any other animal. Manduca Sexta are pests and an agricultural problem when they are juvenile. They destroy crops and are hard to prevent. There was an experiment that was posted by the Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry. This experiment was for insect pest control in use of insect growth regulators, or IGR. They found that paper towels used in the rearing jars resulting in low egg hatch rates for the Pyrrhocoris apterus L. "They contained juvabione, an IGR compound produced by balsam fir trees, which were the primary pulp tree used in the United States paper industry at the time" (Tunaz,2004). They concluded that the IGR found in the paper towels did cause the insects to have lower egg hatch rates than their controlled group. In our test, we gave the Manduca Sexta a 20E blocker with 6 drops of 20E per 10 grams of food.  Ecdysterone, or 20E, is a steroid hormone that regulates timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects. The hypothesis is that when we give the treatment group of caterpillars more ecdysterone, the caterpillar will never develop past the larva stage and will have a larger body mass than the controlled group.

Materials and Methods:
We will use 2 groups of 4 caterpillars each. One is a control group with no 20E blocker and there is a treatment group with the 20E blocker containing 6 drops of 20E per 10 grams of food. We used a baseline of 10 grams of food per caterpillar, which we changed every other day for a 13-day period. We weighed them out every day to see if the 20E blocker would affect the growth of the Manduca Sexta. We ran a t-test to compare the results of the control and the treatment group to see if there was a noticeable difference.

Results:
In our results, we discovered that the 20E blocker slowed the growth of the treatment group and prevented them from pupating. The treatment group gained weight the first 2-3 days then gradually lost weight and then they started to lose a significant amount of weight towards the end of the experiment. 

Discussion:
The 20E blocker prevented the treatment group from pupating which caused them to not eat as much. They were smaller than the controlled group because of them not eating as much. If they're not eating as much food, then they are less of a pest. From an agricultural standpoint, if the caterpillars are not eating as much food then they are not damaging as much crops, therefore they aren't as big of a pest. In the hypothesis, we stated that the body mass would be bigger than the controlled group and that they would never develop past the larva stage. The treated group of caterpillars never did pupate, but they didn't end up bigger than the controlled group. The treated group started out growing and getting bigger the first 2-3 days, then they started to lose their weight and even dropping below their starting weight.
