Title: The relation of size similarities and differences in aggression levels exhibited by Betta splendins 

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment conducted stemmed from whether size plays an active role in the levels of aggression displayed between male Betta splendins. Based on the energy cost of agnostic behaviors towards a smaller individual compared to interactions of similar sized Betta splendins, it was predicted that similar sized individuals would require the highest aggressive displays to intimidate their opponent. Multiple interactions were arranged to test this. Interactions were organized involving three categories of sizes labeled as: small, medium, and large. Two Betta splendins were included in each category. Levels of aggression were measured on a scale of 0-6, each level increasing in aggressive displays. As for the interactions, all similar sizes were permitted to interact while separated by a glass sheet. The same applied for contrasting sizes, such as small and large, small and medium, as well as medium and large. It was determined size does play an active role in the levels of aggression displayed between male Betta splendins, although it did not support the hypothesis stated. The highest aggression levels displayed originated from the large and medium Betta splendins interactions, not of individuals of similar size.

Introduction:
Under the concern of how size variation effects the displayed aggression levels in Betta splendins, various environments were developed. The purpose of these environments was to actively expose the male individuals to similar or a varying size of another male Betta splendins. Male Betta splendins, also referred to as Siamese fighting fish, was chosen as a suitable candidate due to their extreme aggression expressed towards other males [Miley, 1977]. It displays visible signs of aggression such as the following, listed in increasing order, pectoral fin flickering, erecting of the dorsal fin, tail beating, tail flashing, and expansion of branchiostegal membranes; also known as “red mane.” The varying environments provide the ability to measure the levels of aggression that are shown between the interactions of two Betta splendins that are of similar size and Betta splendins that have sizable differences. The question of whether the size of the individuals involved in the interaction relate to aggression levels is to decipher if there is a direct correlation to the amount of energy needed to portray these aggressive actions. Due to overtly portraying these locomotive actions, the Betta splendins require excess energy to perform. This can be detected by the increased oxygen consumption; indicating raised metabolic rates of the individuals [Becker, 2006]. Through this experiment, it would be possible to determine how the energy cost of aggressive actions correlates with size variation in Betta splendins interactions. Due to the energy cost of these actions, it was hypothesized that aggression levels displayed between Betta splendins of similar sizes would be the highest compared to interactions between Betta splendins of varying sizes. This is in relation to the need to conserve energy. There is more competition for mating between Betta splendins of similar size than, for example, a large Betta splendins and a smaller one. The larger individual would be able to portray lower levels of aggression to intimidate the other, smaller individual compared to Betta splendins of similar size; therefore, using less energy. 

Materials and Method:
Initially, six different Betta splendins were obtained of three size categories. Two small, two medium, and two large Betta splendins. Each were separated in three aquariums by category; as well as being separated while in the aquarium. In order to measure the levels of aggression for data recording, each level was assigned a ranking from 0-6. The numbers stood for the following: 0 being no response, 1 being pelvic tail flickering, 2 being dorsal fin erecting, 3 being tail beating, 4 being tail flashing, 5 being the displaying of the red mane, and 6 being the attacking of the other individual. Although, each pair were separated by a glass sheet for the entirety of the exposure to avoid possible maiming. The exposure time was a length of five minutes, with a five minute rest period after, where the fish would be secluded from each other. This is necessary to allow relaxation and to prevent habituation from exposure. The level of aggression was recorded every thirty seconds during the five minute exposure. The first interaction recorded was the small-small Betta splendins exposure. The following was medium-medium Betta splendins, and lastly the large- large Betta splendins. After the rest period past for each of the fish, the size variance interactions began. The following interactions were arranged between the Betta splendins: Large-medium, large-small, and medium-small. It was important not to use a fish twice in this arrangement though, to prevent altering reactions through habituation or previous exposure to a larger or smaller Betta splendins. After the data was recorded it was applied to an ANOVA test to find whether size played a significent role in aggression levels displayed. 

Results:
The results of the ANOVA test showed that there was a significent relationship between similar size interactions of Betta splendins and varying size interactions. With a significance threshold of .05, the reported p_value was .000144 with a total degree of freedom being 59.

Discussion:
As seen in the results, the three highest levels of aggression displayed are from the groups, from highest aggression to lowest, large-medium, large-small, and large-large. With the reported p_value being .000114, which is lower than the significance threshold of .5; meaning our results were significent. Therefore, there is correlation between the sizes of the Betta splendins and the aggression levels displayed in their interactions. Although the data was significent, it didn’t support the stated hypothesis that Betta splendins of similar sizes would display the most aggression towards each other. If this were true, the highest recorded aggression levels would be collected from the similar sized interactions opposed to the actual interactions that displayed the highest aggression. 
Based on the data, there is a correlation between the groups that displayed higher aggression levels. The top three groups involved large Betta splendins. This could result from the larger, energy storage held in the large fish compared to fish of smaller size [Elser, 1996]. Due to the larger Betta splendins having more energy to dedicate towards aggressive displays, and in turn intimidating their opponent, the overall energy cost is less detrimental to the larger Betta splendins in contrast to smaller individuals. 
There are also other possibilities that could have been in play. For instance, the color of the Betta splendins could correlate to the aggression levels displayed. To obtain results with increased accuracy, it would be wise to only utilize individuals of the same color. An additional obstacle was that the Betta splendins used in the medium group weren’t remarkably larger or smaller than their opponents in the other size categories; which could affect the end results.
