Title: Effect of Light Availability on Phenotypic Variation in Fagopyrum esculentum Buckwheat plants

Abstract:
Phenotypic variation among Buckwheat plants, Fagopyrum esculentum, was explored by imposing environmental stimuli. By altering the light availability, changes in resource allocation can be measured by calculating the root-to-shoot ratio for length (mm) and weight (grams). It was expected that the root-to-shoot ratio would be larger for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with a varying light source because plants with unlimited light would not have to grow their shoots longer to obtain sunlight. This was not observed, however. The root-to-shoot weight ratio for the unlimited light plants was much smaller than that of the natural light plants (0.0559 mm – unlimited light, 0.1493 mm – natural light), and was statistically significent ((t=4.935, d.f.=6, p=0.001308). The root-to-shoot length ratio was very close (0.4386 mm – natural light, 0.43306 mm – unlimited light), and was not statistically significent (t=0.0776, d.f.=6, p=0.4703). Overall, the data collected was not supportive of the hypothesis and was not strong enough to make any conclusions. Further testing would be necessary to support the relationship between environmental changes and phenotypic variation. 

Introduction:
This experiment explores phenotypic variation in plants, specifically how it is affected by varying levels of light. Biotic factors, effects from living organisms, and abiotic factors, effects from non-living sources, both contribute to a plant’s fitness, or its ability to reproduce. Certain environmental conditions can lead to a change in resource allocation, and in turn change the phenotype of the plant. Plants can adapt to environmental conditions in order to survive and reproduce, thus improving their fitness. Most often resource limitations are what trigger these changes, referred to as a trade-off. For instance, pollen limitation causes resource allocation in perennial plants, and sparks phenotypic variation in seed sizes (Huang: 2017). 
Plants obtain different resources from different parts. For example, energy is obtained through photosynthesis in the leaves, while nitrogen and phosphorus are obtained by the roots. All of these resources are allocated to the plant for further growth. Thus, by altering the environment, plants may react differently to different resource changes in order to reproduce effectively, stimulating phenotypic plasticity. Changes in phenotype benefit the plant and increase its chance of survival and chance of reproduction. This can be seen in the savannah landscapes of Brazil. By comparing the different abiotic characteristics of two landscapes, researchers concluded that “individuals of the same species inhabiting different habitats have distinct functional trait values as a response to local environmental conditions.” (de Cássia-Silva: 2017) 
This experiment will test the effect of light availability on resource allocation in Buckwheat plants. Buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, is a major grain crop in many Asian countries. Understanding how the plant reacts to environmental stimuli is crucial for agricultural and financial success. It is also cheap, easy to plant, and grows quickly. In doing this experiment, we hope to determine how plants change their resource allocation in response to different levels of light. 
According to a study conducted on the effect light on basil plant growth, “light manipulation significently [influences] main shoot length,” where shading induces stem elongation (Stagnari: 2018). The change in resource allocation can be best measured by the root-to-shoot ratio. We expect the root-to-shoot ratio to be larger for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with a varying light source because plants with unlimited light will not have to grow their shoots longer to obtain sunlight. 


Materials and Method:
To begin, the group gathered about 250 Buckwheat seeds and 10 soil containers – five for the experimental group and five for the controll group. In each soil container, there were nine holes, with 2-3 seeds planted in each hole. By planting more seeds than was required, this ensured that there would be enough surviving plants to carry out the experiment. The controll containers were placed in front of a window and received natural patterns of light and darkness for two weeks. The treatment containers were placed in a “light box” and received constant, or unlimited, light for two weeks. Both the controll and treatment groups were watered daily and kept in the same temperature. After two weeks of growing, the plants were harvested. Four plants from each group were harvested, making sure the roots were intact and had no soil on them. This was done by moving the soil containers into a bucket of water and breaking down the soil from the roots, then patting them dry. For each plant, several measurements were recorded ¬– overall plant weight, root weight, shoot weight, longest root length, and shoot length. All weights were recorded in grams and all lengths were recorded in millimeters. These measurements were used to calculate the root-to-shoot ratio for both length and weight. The root-to-shoot ratio (R:S) was calculating the root value (length or weight) divided by the corresponding shoot value. These ratios were then used in two separate two-sample t_tests, one comparing the weight ratios and one comparing the length ratios between the two groups. Both two-sample t_tests were one-tailed and conducted at the alpha level 0.05 with the degrees of freedom of 6 (Method are adapted from the WFU Biological Principles Laboratory Manual). 

Results:
After growing for two weeks, the required measurements for each group were recorded. The average root-to-shoot weight ratio for the natural light plants was much greater than that of the unlimited light plants (0.0559 mm – unlimited light, 0.1493 mm – natural light), had similar standard deviations (0.02588 – unlimited light, 0.0276 – natural light), and show in Figure 1. In contrast, the average root-to-shoot length ratio was very close for two groups (0.43306 mm – unlimited light, 0.4386 mm – natural light), but had differing standard deviations (0.0673 – natural light, 0.1263 – unlimited light), as shown in Figure 2. 
Two separate two-sample t_tests were conducted, one comparing weight and one comparing length. The weight t_test produced a p_value of 0.001308 and the length t_test produced a p_value of 0.470335, as seen in Table 1. 


Discussion:
It was predicted that the root-to-shoot ratio for both weight and length would be larger for the plants placed in the unlimited light because these plants would not need to grow to get more resources. After analyzing the statistical test data (Table 1), we cannot support our hypothesis. 	
The results can be broken down into the weight and length ratios. The mean root-to-shoot weight ratio for the unlimited light plants was much smaller than that of the natural light plants (0.0559 mm – unlimited light, 0.1493 mm – natural light), although the group predicted the opposite. After running the two-sample t_test, this data was found to be significent (t=4.935, d.f.=6, p=0.001308) at the alpha level of 0.05. A possible explanation for this data is the number and weight of the leaves. In the previously mentioned study on basil growth, researchers also found that light manipulation has an effect on leaf area (Stagnari: 2018)	. 
Additionally, the mean root-to-shoot length ratio was very close for the natural and unlimited light groups (0.4386 mm – natural light, 0.43306 mm – unlimited light), although the standard deviations were different (0.0673 – natural light, 0.12628 – unlimited light). This data, however, is not significent, as determined by the two-sample t_test (t=0.0776, d.f.=6, p=0.4703) and the alpha level 0.05. Therefore, no conclusions can be made regarding the root-to-shoot length ratios. 
	Overall, half of the collected data did not support our hypothesis, and half was not significent. The root-to-shoot ratio is a measure of resource allocation when resources are limited. It was expected that the unlimited light group would distribute resources more evenly due to no lack of resources, resulting in a large root-to-shoot ratio. According to the data, however, the unlimited light plants allocated more resources to their stems in order to grow to the light. This resulted in more plant growth and an improved fitness. In the basil growth study, researchers also focused on the type or color of light imposed on the plants. It is possible that the light emitted from the light box effected the plants differently than the natural sunlight imposed on the controll group, thus acting as a confounding variable (Stagnari: 2018). 
	There are several limitations to this study. The amount of water given to the plants during the two-week growing period was not measured or recorded. Although the plants received roughly the same amount, it was not precise and could have affected the data. There were most likely measuring inaccuracies in the weight and length recording. The most important limitation is that of sample size. Only four plants were used from each group and most certainly do not represent the entirety of the Buckwheat plant population. 
	In terms of our hypothesis, the data collected was not supportive and did not supply significent data. Further testing would be required to make any conclusions on the resource allocation of Buckwheat plants.
