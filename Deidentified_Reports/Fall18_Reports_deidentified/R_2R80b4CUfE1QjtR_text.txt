Title: The extent to which the twitch amplitude of the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemus system is decreased in frog legs that have been injected with lanthanum chloride.

Abstract:
The presence of calcium is essential in the signaling of muscle contraction in organisms. Specifically, the release of calcium into the sarcoplasm prompts the formation of myosin-actin crossbridges, which allow for the muscle fibers to shorten. Here we observe the effect that lanthanum chloride, a calcium blocker, has on the intensity of the gastrocnemus muscle twitch in a frog. We hypothesized that after injecting this calcium blocker into the frog leg, the intensity of the muscle contraction would be lowered. To test this, we tested three separate frog legs, each being their own controll and then re-tested after the lanthanum chloride injection. Our data showed a significent difference between the amplitudes of the controll and the amplitudes of the experimental in two out of the three frog legs. Even though only two of the three trials showed a significent difference, the was an overall consistency of much lower-amplitude muscle twitches in each of the legs after the treatment and when each trial was compared at the same voltage stimulus, the differences between the controll and experimental amplitudes were overwhelmingly obvious (Figure 1). Therefore, our hypothesis was supported and this finding is beneficial because it provides strong evidence against an organism’s exposure t

Introduction:
There are a multitude of ways that cells communicated within an organism’s body, aside from hormone signaling. Particularly in the neuromuscular system, the stimulus-response process takes place in milliseconds, which is significently quicker than that of hormonal systems. In this type of cell signaling, action potentials typically travel down axons, become depolarized, and acetylcholine binds to its receptor on the muscle fiber. This opens the sodium channels, which causes action potentials to spread throughout the fiber, calcium ions activate the muscle fiber contractile mechanism, movement of the myosin causes myofibers to shorten, and reuptake of the calcium ions allow muscle fibers to relax. Focusing on calcium specifically, the release of calcium in the sarcoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers the binding of myosin to actin. The globular heads of myosin attach to the actin, and after the inorganic phosphate is released, the power stroke occurs. This allows the myosin head to change conformation, shortening the length of the sarcomere, therefore contracting the muscle fibers [Johnson:2016]. Lanthanum chloride is a chemical that replaces calcium ions at receptor sites on muscle fibers, which inhibits the mobility of calcium in essential binding sites involved in muscle contraction [Weiss: 1969]. Due to the fact that calcium is so integral in the initiation of muscle contraction, we hypothesize that injecting lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog will hinder the intensity of the muscle contraction, which would be depicted by a lower amplitude. 


Materials and Method:
Three separate frog legs were placed on three separate trays. The gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve of each was exposed and the tissues were kept moist with frog ringer solution. The gastrocnemus muscle of each frog leg was raised to a 90-degree angle to allow for observation of the muscle twitch. The sciatic nerve of the first frog leg was draped over an electrode. A series of voltage stimuli were applied to the nerve and the amplitudes of the muscle twitches was recorded; this data was used as the controll for the first frog leg. Then the same frog was injected with 2 milliliters of lanthanum chloride and we waited 5-10 minutes before further experimentation. The same series of voltage stimuli were applied to the nerve and the amplitudes of the injected muscle twitches were recorded. These steps were repeated with the two remaining frog legs. A t_test was used to compare the twitch amplitudes of the controll muscle twitch and the experimental muscle twitch in each frog leg. 

Results:
For frog leg 1 at the 1.0 V stimulus, the twitch amplitude of the controll was 1.265 V and the experimental was 1.001 V (Figure 1). For frog leg 2 at the 1.0 V stimulus, the twitch amplitude of the controll was 0.817 V and the experimental was 0.352 V (Figure 1). Finally, for frog leg 3 at the 1.0 V stimulus, the twitch amplitude of the controll was 1.068 V and the experimental was 0.815 V (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the amplitude of the twitch of controll frog leg 1 was 0.054 and the experimental was 0.501. The standard deviation for the amplitude of the twitch of controll frog leg 2 was 0.357 and the experimental was 0.060. The standard deviation for the amplitude of the twitch of controll frog leg 3 was 0.139 and the experimental was 0.139. The standard deviation data refers to the amplitude of the muscle twitches from the threshold stimulus to the 1.0 V stimulus. The results of the t_tests for legs 1 and 3 were that the twitch amplitudes of the controll were statistically significently different than those of the experimental (leg 1: t_stat=3.713, d.f.=6, P=0.005; leg 3: t_stat=3.573, d.f.=8, P=0.004). The result of the t_test for leg 2 was that the twitch amplitudes of the controll were not statistically significently different than those of the experimental (t_stat=1.856, d.f.=6, P=0.056). 

Discussion:
Upon completion of this experiment, it was determined that our hypothesis was supported. There was an observed significent difference in two out of the three trials, which suggests that the frog legs injected with lanthanum chloride did not contract as intensely as they did without lanthanum chloride. Even though frog leg 2 did not show a significent difference at an alpha of 0.05, the remaining data in that same trial depicts a consistently lower twitch amplitude at every voltage stimulus beyond the threshold. The amplitude of the twitch at the threshold stimulus may have been higher in the experimental of frog leg 2 due to an error in the electrode connection or physiological tendencies of the frog leg. This trial would have been statistically significently different if this single reading was omitted. Aside from this discrepancy, the results of this experiment make sense. By blocking the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, the calcium is unable to be released into the sarcoplasm from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. With this reduction of calcium ions in the sarcoplasm, myosin-actin crossbridges are not as easily formed [Johnson:2016]. This results in the contraction of muscle being less intense due to the fact that there are not enough calcium ions in supply to contract every muscle fiber in the gastrocnemus muscle under these conditions due to the decreased mobility of calcium ions [Weiss: 1969]. On a global scale, defective formation of myosin-actin crossbridges leads to decreased performance of the muscle. This general muscular weakness may result in muscular atrophy and paralysis, making it difficult for the organism to carry out necessary functions for survival [Bradley:2018].

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. The recorded muscle twitch amplitudes of each frog leg without the injection and with the injection of lanthanum chloride. The amplitudes are recorded in volts and the data recorded in this table, for each frog leg, corresponds to a voltage stimulus of 1.0 V. Error bars are not included in this figure because each frog leg is independent and the standard deviations of each are not comparable. *************************************************************************
