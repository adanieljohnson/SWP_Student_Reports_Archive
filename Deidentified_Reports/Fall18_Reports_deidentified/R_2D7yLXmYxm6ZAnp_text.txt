Title: Difference In Absorbance Rates In Collards And Spinach As It Relates To Shade Of Green

Abstract:
Phenotypes of plants can have an important direct impact on a plant's rate of photosynthesis and can also be important predictors of how quickly they might do so (Kume: 2017). In this experiment our lab studied both spinach and collards. We hypothesized that because the collard’s leaves are much darker than the spinach leaves, they will have more chloroplasts, and therefore a greater or quicker reduction of DCIP (a higher rate of absorbance). We tested the two groups enriched chloroplasts at room-level lighting and direct lighting at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. A two-tailed t_test was used on our 30-minute data (data at the conclusion of the experiment) to statistically analyze our data. Our results indicated only one statistically significent value which was our comparison of absorbance between collards and spinach under lamp light (p_value: 0.0166, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 3.97). All comparisons were found to be statistically insignificent. Our hypothesis that collards would have a higher/quicker rate of absorbance than spinach was proven to be largely incorrect. In our pre-lab research we thought the contrast in color would be starker and because it was not that could be the reason we achieved very few statistically significent results.

Introduction:
Plant species all have their own set of distinctive characteristics that drastically vary from plant to plant. Some may have thorns and thick membranes while others possess short hairs or large leaves. Of this wide number of traits that plants can and do have there are many related to the energy harvesting system developed by plants: photosynthesis. Each plant species has evolved their own best method to getting what they need. Color or shade of green is a very visible trait among most plants and it is not unreasonable to assume that the shade of green might correlate to the level of light absorbance in any given plant (Kume: 2017). Spinach and collards are two plants with leaves that have varying shades of green. This week our lab group ran our own set of experiments that were based around the principles of our last lab in this section. Primarily we are measuring absorbance levels of the two different plant species (spinach and collards). To do so we repeated a similar process to last week’s lab (i.e. mortar and pestle the leaves, get a chloroplast rich group, and place under different light settings). Also, like last week, we used DCIP as a measure for our plant’s different absorbance. We will be comparing both spinach and collards at room-level lighting and direct lighting and at 10, 20, and 30 minutes we will record each group’s absorbances. We hypothesized that because the collard’s leaves are much darker than the spinach leaves, they will have more chloroplasts, and therefore a greater or quicker reduction of DCIP (a higher rate of absorbance).

Materials and Method:
First we created two pastes for both species of plants so that we could then perform centrifugation to enrich chloroplasts of both plants. We did this by grinding up leaves from both spinach and collards in a mortar and pestle mixed with a buffer. After we performed two centrifugations we obtained our enriched chloroplast samples. Using these enriched chloroplast samples for both species, we set up an assay of reactions to test their absorbance levels. Each tube contained chloroplasts, DCIP, water, and a reaction buffer. We tested the two groups at room-level lighting and direct lighting at 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Absorbance levels were measured using a spectrophotometer and each group contained 3 replicates. A two-tailed t_test was used on our 30-minute data (data at the conclusion of the experiment) to statistically analyze our data.

Results:
Our results indicated only one statistically significent value which was our comparison of absorbance between collards and spinach under lamp light (p_value: 0.0166, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 3.97). All comparisons were found to be statistically insignificent: spinach/collards at room level lighting (p_value: 0.390, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 0.962), spinach at room/lamp (p_value: 0.0572, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 2.65), and collards at room/lamp (p_value: 0.209, degrees of freedom: 4, t-value: 1.50). Figure 1 shows the absorbance as measured using DCIP over time at increments of 10 minutes.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that collards would have a higher/quicker rate of absorbance than spinach was proven to be largely incorrect. Figure 1 shows the trends of our data and the only group that visually sticks out when compared to the others is spinach under direct lamp lighting, but when we look at the trends from the other three groups we see less significance because they all have a very similar trend. Figure 2 is a photo of our pastes we made and it is very clear that they were not too different in their shade of green. We found there was a significent difference between the rates of absorbance of spinach and collards under direct lamp light, but all other categories showed no significance. However, we believe we have a reason for why this is so. When our lab group conducted research before the experiment, we examined online photos of collards and spinach to compare the colors of their leaves. In these photos the color difference appeared to be starker than when we obtained these plants on lab day. The actual difference in color was miniscule when we finally saw our plants with our own eyes. We believe that if we had hand selected our plants based on how they appeared outside of a digital setting then we might have obtained more statistically significent results. Plant phenotypes can and do have a major impact on how they obtain light energy through photosynthesis (Sarlikioti: 2011). Our expectation is still that plant color can be a major predictor on how quickly light is absorbed in the chloroplasts of leaves.

Figure 2: A photo of our pastes that exemplifies the less-than-stark color contrast between the two greens. It is likely because these two did not differ much in color that our experiment showed few statistically significent results.*************************************************************************
