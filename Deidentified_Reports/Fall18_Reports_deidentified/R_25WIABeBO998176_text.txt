Title: Physarum polycephalum does not grow in the presence of calcium surface receptor inhibitor or activator 

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold, can act as a model for the effect of abiotic factors on cell signaling. We predicted that when exposed to an inhibitor treatment the Physarum polycephalum would not grow, and when exposed to an activator treatment it would show increased growth. This was tested by preparing three treatment groups, one soaked in the calcium channel inhibitor EDTA+ strontium chloride, a controll group containing no added chemicals, and another soaked in excess calcium ions, which was the activator treatment. The experiment did not support our hypothesis as no growth was observed in any of the groups. Biologically, this could have occurred because the stock Physarum polycephalum entered a resting state before the experiment began, and therefore could not grow. In the future this test should be repeated with healthy slime mold. Additional tests could also be performed to test how calcium signaling is affected by different toxins, drugs, and metals. 

Introduction:
The plasmodial slime mold, Physarum polycephalum is a model organism for the study of signaling and complex behaviors in protists. The organism is comprised a network of veins containing multiple nuclei within a single, large cell. It has multiple life stages; however, most research is performed during the plasmodium life stage [Akita: 2017]. While slime mold does not have a nervous system, extensive research has proved that this relatively simple protist is capable of complex behaviors. For example, researchers have found that this slime mold can solve a maze in order to find the shortest pathway to a food source [Vallverdú: 2017]. This demonstrates how the organism can travel in specific directions in response to abiotic stimuli such as light and chemicals in a process known as taxis. In the cases of light and chemicals it is referred to as phototaxis and chemotaxis respectively. It does so through the extension of actin and myosin cytoskeletal elements and motor proteins that allow the slime to move.  Experimentation has also indicated that the organism is capable of a multitude of regulator behaviors, such as a change in morphology in harsh environmental conditions and optimizing shape and surface area when foraging so that its cytoplasmic projections can reach more food sources. While the mechanism of communication in this slime mold are not entirely clear, scientist have determined that some regulatory behavior is dependent upon signaling cascades [Alim: 2017]. 

Calcium is one of the most common signaling ions in cells, including those of both protists and humans [Clapham: 1995]. A signaling cascade occurs when Ca+2 ions enter surface calcium ion channels and binds to a specialized receptor known as the ryanodine receptor. This will then trigger the release of more calcium from the smooth ER. This process is necessary for the functioning of actin and myosin filaments, which are responsible for taxis in Physarum polycephalum [Zhang: 2016]. This pathway can be manipulated using both chemical activators and inhibitors. 
In this experiment, we will study how manipulation calcium ion surface channels influence the growth and taxis of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This will be done through the use of EDTA+ strontium chloride, which acts as an inhibitor for this pathway, and the increased concentration of calcium ions outside the cell, which should further activate the pathway. Because of the role of calcium in actin and myosin microfilament functioning, we hypothesize that Physarum polycephalum growth will increase when exposed to calcium ions but stop when exposed to EDTA+ strontium chloride. 


Materials and Method:
This experiment involved two experimental groups and one controll group, each of which were made up of three samples.  We soaked three PDA plates in 5Ml of calcium ion solution (1 microliter of calcium ions per 1mM of solution) each. We proceeded to soak the three more PDA plates in 5Ml of 1mM EDTA+ strontium chloride solution each. Our final controll group contained three normal PDA plates. The plates were left to sit for 10 minutes before the liquid was decanted off the surface of the agar. Using forceps sterilized in alcohol, we cut a 1×1cm cube out of the center of 9 PDA plates. Using another pair of sterilized forceps, we cut 9 squares of the same size out of a provided Physarum polycephalum stock plate. One of those blocks was placed in each of the 9 wells created in our plates. The plates were then labeled based on their group (experimental group 1, experimental group 2, and controll) and wrapped in aluminum foil. They were then left in an incubator set to 27°C for 48 hours, after which we would quantify their growth in mm traveled from the original well. The data was analyzed using 3 one-sample ANOVA test comparing growth in experimental group 1 and experimental group 2, in experimental group 1 and the controll group, and experimental group 2 and the controll group [Johnson: 2016]. 

Results:
No usable data was obtained from this experiment, as only one of the 9 plates showed any growth. The ANOVA test was not performed, as all of the observed growth values were 0.

Had we received the expected results, the following patterns would have been observed: the calcium ion treatment group having the greatest amount of growth, the controll group having a moderate amount of growth, EDTA+ strontium chloride having no growth (Fig. 1). This would have been followed by three one sample ANOVA tests, one comparing the controll group to the calcium ion treatment, one comparing the controll group to the EDTA+ strontium chloride group, and one comparing the EDTA+ strontium group to the calcium ion treatment. All of these tests should have had a p value of less than 0.05. 

Discussion:
The experiment was unsuccessful and did not support the hypothesis. However, it is likely that the failure of this experiment was not the result of the inhibitor or activator solutions used, as the controll group did not show growth either. It is likely that the Physarum polycephalum stock used was not viable, and its growth was shut down before it was placed in the incubator. 
Under harsh environmental conditions slime mold can enter a life cycle known as sclerotia. This occurs when the organism stops growing and instead forms a crystal-like structure. This hardened form, which is often referred to as spherules, helps the organism survive in those conditions. During this life stage the multiple nuclei of the organism will not divide, and the structure will remain stable. This is not the same as cell death, as the slime mold can transition to the plasmodium stage and continue growing once placed in more favorable conditions. Usually, this life cycle is associated with a lack of moisture that prevents healthy slime mold growth, but experimentation has indicated that multiple environmental factors can trigger this morphological change. For example, certain concentrations of metals, lack of food, and cold temperatures can result in the formation of sclerotia [Guttes: 1961]. One study found that exposed Physarum polycephalum to polyols, or organic compounds with multiple hydroxy groups, can induce spherulation after only 35 hours [Chet: 1969]. As the stock solution in this experiment was not exposed to such organic compounds and was provided a food source, it is likely that it either dried out, or was in too cold of an environment prior to the experiment.  
This experiment was not successful, but it is important that we continue to study signaling in protists and other simple organisms. Many of the signaling cascades observed in slime mold also occur in humans. Furthermore, Physarum polycephalum uses actin myosin complexes similar to those of the human muscular system in order to grow and move. Because slime mold can be grown with relative ease in labs and can be maintained for long periods of time, it is a model organism for the study of similar signaling pathways in humans. For further studies, this experiment should be repeated with a healthy sample of the model organism in the plasmodium life stage. Similar tests should also be performed to determine how cell growth is affected by the presence of metal ions, as this can provide insight into how signaling pathways in humans respond to toxic metals.
