Title: The Effect of Tetraethylammonium chloride on the Threshold of Action Potentials

Abstract:
Tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) is a ganglionic inhibitor that is primarily responsible for treating diseases surrounding myocardial complications. TEA functions by inhibiting the release of K+ ions into the nerve, during an action potential. Previous studies indicated that TEA can lead to higher threshold voltages, due to an elongated depolarization process. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of 100 mM of TEA on the resulting threshold voltages of the action potentials in the frog leg. In each of the three frog legs, the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve were isolated and stimulated by electrical impulses before and after injection of the compound at the determined threshold voltage. Then using the determined threshold for the control group, the threshold voltages for TEA injected legs were found. The results show a higher threshold voltage for each of the frog legs without the TEA, while the TEA injected legs had an overall lower threshold voltage. The results were considered to be not statistically significant (p=0.465), proving the inefficiency of the TEA injection.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system consists of muscles and parts of the nervous systems, which work in conjunction to create body movement. This system is usually studied in vertebrates, to comprehend how these organisms respond to certain stimuli or maintain specific functions. For muscle contraction to occur in vertebrates, a stimulus passes through neurons in the form of action potentials. As the action potential depolarizes the targeted area of the body, calcium vesicles bind to acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter)  and causes the ACh to travel over the synaptic cleft, where it binds to the muscle. Then, the myosin and actin filaments in the sarcomeres of muscle fibers work together to contract the muscles. For the action potential to start, it needs to reach a certain threshold for sodium-gated ion channels and potassium channels to depolarize or hyperpolarize the nerve [Johnson: 2016]. 
	Due to growing number of myocardial and muscle complications such as hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, there has been a growing interest in inhibiting the transfer of action potentials towards certain areas of the body. Therefore, there are pharmacological drugs, ganglionic blockers, that target towards inhibiting the transmission between preganglionic and postganglionic neurons in the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). Tetraethylammonium chloride is a type of ganglionic blocker that generates effects at the neuromuscular junction and at sympathetic nerve terminals. Specifically, TEA affects the conduction of action potentials by blocking voltage-dependent K+ channels in nerves [Barret: 1988]. Voltage-gate K channels are responsible for repolarizing the nerve, after it fully undergoes depolarization. The ammonium ions of the TEA block these channels, when applied either on the external or internal membrane of the nerve.  TEA prohibits the access of internal K+ ions by binding to a site on the external part of the potassium channel [Armstrong: 1971]. As a result, resting potential is depolarized, causing an extended action potential and increasing the duration of the depolarization process. The depolarization process increases the threshold potential of the action potential, since the voltage-gated K+ ions channels are inhibited and cannot allow for the hyperpolarization of K+ ions [Armstrong: 1971].
	To understand the efficiency of TEA, an experiment can be modeled using the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve of the Northern Leopard frog. The purpose of the experiment is to observe the effects of tetraethylammonium chloride on the overall threshold of the action potentials. It was hypothesized that if a frog gastrocnemius muscle is injected with .1 ml of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium chloride, then the threshold of the sciatic nerve will increase. 


Materials and Methods:
First, three frog legs were collected. The skin of the legs was removed with forceps and moistened with Ringers solution. The inner thigh muscles were detached to determine the sciatic nerve, which was freed by removing it from the connective tissue. The gastrocnemius muscle was cut through the middle of the tendon, and thread was tied tightly around the Achilles tendon. The rest of the leg was pinned down, and the other end of the thread was tied to the force transducer. For each leg, the electrical impulses were introduced by draping the sciatic nerve over the electrode. The threshold voltage was found by using different voltages of the electrode, until a response occurred. These results were recorded as part of the control. Afterwards, .1mL of 100 mM of TEA was injected into the frog leg using a syringe. Five minutes was given leg to allow for the solution to settle in the nerve. Afterwards, the electrode was used to determine the thresholds for the legs with the TEA. The thresholds for the injected legs were then recorded, after a response occurred at a specific voltage. A paired t-test was used to determine whether the differences in the threshold voltages between the control (no fluid) and the experimental (TEA injected) groups were statistically significant. 

Results:
The threshold voltages for the first two legs with TEA decreased, while the third one increased. Second leg in control group had highest threshold voltage of 0.057, while the second leg with TEA had the lowest threshold voltage of 0.005. It was observed that all three frog legs injected with TEA continued to twitch, after the electrode stimulation. The reported average and standard deviation for the No TEA group was 0.0343 +/- 0.0196 (Figure 1). The reported average and standard deviation for the TEA group was 0.0174 +/- 0.0161 (Figure 1). From the pair t-test with an alpha of 0.05, the t-value was 0.896, p-value of 0.465, and degrees freedom (df) of 2. 

Discussion:
	The mean of the control group was not statistically different than that of the experimental group. Therefore, the hypothesis of the experiment was not supported. According to Barret, the TEA is expected to increase the amplitude (threshold voltage) and duration of the after-potential [Barret: 1987]. The increase voltage is attributed to the TEA blocking the K+ ion channels, by binding to a specific receptor site [Barret: 1987]. Not only does TEA block active K+ ion channels, but also resting channels. Apart from blocking voltage gated dependent K+ ion channels, certain concentrations of TEA are expected to eliminate K+ channels. Khodakhah states how the addition of  a concentration greater than 10mM of TEA, can remove K+ channels [Khodakhah: 1997]. This would allow for more sodium ions to enter the nerve and further increase the threshold. Instead, the thresholds for the legs with TEA were drastically lower than the thresholds control group, though it was expected to either block or eliminate the K+ channels. From Khodakhahâ€™s results, TEA does not affect K+ channels, if they are kept closed [Khodakhah: 1997]. Rather K+ channels are functional, depending on the type of depolarizing pulses. Stronger depolarization tends to release a higher amount of K+ ions and cause a greater response, while weaker ones secrete a lower influx of K+ ions leading to no or little response in a muscle. Further studies can involve increasing  the TEA concentration and observing its effects, but also increasing the number of legs for repeated trials. Results of these studies would help to find ways of regulating nerves and muscles involved in the circulatory and nervous system.
