Title: The Effect of Curcumin the cAMP Pathway of Physarum Polycephalum

Abstract:
In Physarum polycephalum, signal transduction coordinates and regulates responses to outside stimuli. One response to outside stimuli is chemotaxis, the movement of an organism in a certain direction as a response to the concentration of particular substances in an immediate environment. Due to chemotaxis’ relationship with cellular motility, the cAMP-mediated pathway is suspected to play a large role. The cAMP pathway has been known to play a role in cellular motility by facilitating and inhibiting actin-based migration. To understand the role of the cAMP in actin based migration, Physarum’s rate of growth was monitored on a 2% water agar plate that was soaked in the chemical curcumin, a known inhibitor of the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA) and a vital component of the cAMP-mediated pathway. The distances used to calculate the rate of migration were taken by measuring the longest strand of Physarum; the direction of the growth did not matter. It was predicted that curcumin would inhibit Physarum’s growth. Ultimately, no significant difference was discovered between the rate of migration of Physarum between the control group and the curcumin group, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove the deactivation of PKA results in a decreased rate of growth in Physarum.


Introduction:
Slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, is a unicellular protist and a multinucleated syncytium [Oettmeier: 2017]. Being both multinucleated and unicellular means that a mass of Physarum has multiple nuclei contained inside of a single plasma membrane resulting in each mass behaving as a single cell. When a small piece of plasmodium is split off, it forms a new organism that is a clone of the original organism. Due to acting like one large cell, its shared ancestry with humans and intelligent behavior, physarum is a commonly used model organism to study signal transduction pathways [Johnson: 2016].


During its life cycle, Physarum spends most their time in the plasmodial stage and appears to be a flat, yellow gooey mass. In this stage, they live in moist conditions and move by extending their leading edge using actin microfilaments. As long as they live in humid, dark and damp conditions, Physarum slowly moves engulfing bacteria and organic debris that it comes into contact with digesting them by actively transporting hydrolytic enzymes into their food vacuoles. When Physarum produces waste it transports it to a singular location and migrates away. [Johnson: 2016].


	One of Physarum’s observable behaviors is chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism in a certain direction as a response to the concentration of particular substances in an immediate environment [Schurr: 2013]. Depending on the chemical, Physarum may undergo positive or negative chemotaxis. Negative chemotaxis is when a substance repels an organism while positive chemotaxis is when a substance attracts an organism [Johnson: 2016]. If an organisms is surrounded by a repellent chemical, the organisms chemotactic response will be to reduce its overall growth. 


	Physarum does not have a nervous system or use hormones to sense and react to its immediate environment. In order to coordinate and regulate responses to outside stimuli, responses are controlled by one or more intracellular signal transduction pathways. One of these pathways is the cAMP-mediated path which is a G-protein coupled pathway. The G-protein, adenylate cyclase, activates the effector enzyme converting ATP into cAMP. cAMP acts as a second messenger activating the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA). PKA uses phosphorylation to either activate or deactivate enzymes. In addition to this, many cells have been found to contain cAMP-binding transcription factors. Once cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase, the signaling pathway stops thus the inhibition of phosphodiesterase mimics the production of cAMP [Johnson: 2016]. The cAMP pathway has been known to play a role in cell motility by facilitating and inhibiting actin-based migration [Howe: 2004]. The direct inhibition of PKA activity or its ability to interact with PKA results in the inhibition of chemotactic cell migration [Howe: 2005].


	Curcumin is a naturally occurring polyphenol known for its medicinal properties. It has been found that curcumin may have anticancer, antiviral, antiarthritic, anti-amyloid, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Also, it is known to influence transcription factors, growth factors, inflammatory cytokines, protein kinases and enzymes [Zhou: 2011]. It has these properties due to being able to inhibit protein kinase A (PKA) [Johnson: 2016] which is responsible for the inhibition of microfilament formation [Howe: 2004]. 


Understanding how signal transduction pathways work, especially the cAMP G-protein coupled pathway, is important for understanding cell growth and motility. In this experiment, we investigated how curcumin affects the growth and motility of Physarum Polycephalum. It was predicted that Physarum will display slower growth in a water plate soaked in curcumin than in just water agar plates. The longest strand of Physarum will be used to generate the data.


Materials and Methods:
Preparation of the Physarum Polycephalum stock plate:
Special equipment used: metal spatula, flat-tipped forceps and 100mm Physarum stock plate

First, we sterilized the metal spatula and flat-tipped forceps by placing them in ethanol. Next, we opened the Physarum stock plate and cut the plate into 1cm by 1cm blocks of agar. Then, we prepared one block of agar with Physarum culture (1cm x 1cm) for each control and experimental group. In between preparing blocks of agar for each control and experimental group, we resterilized the spatula and flat-tipped forceps in ethanol.


Preparation of the control plates:
Special equipment used: metal spatula, flat-tipped forceps, 100mm 2% water agar plates and an incubator 

First, we sterilized the metal spatula and flat-tipped forceps by placing them in ethanol. Next, we labeled the 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar medium with our names and the date. Then, on the back, we drew a line dividing the plate in half. On the line, we drew one square (1cm x 1cm). Next, we removed and dried the spatula from the ethanol. Then, we opened the three plates of water agar and used the spatula to cut out the center square, sterilizing with ethanol in between each use. Next, we slid a 1cm by 1cm cube of agar with Physarum culture (pre-prepared already) into each of the empty space of the three water agar plates with the Physarum culture facing up. We made sure to sterilize the flat-tipped forceps with ethanol between each block transfer. Then, we carefully added two pieces of oatmeal near one of the far edges of each plate. Next, we taped and closed every plate. Lastly, we covered each plate in foil and labeled them “control group”, with our names and the time. We placed the three plates into the incubator for 24 hours.



Preparation of the experimental plates: curcumin
Special equipment used: metal spatula, flat-tipped forceps, 100mm 2% water agar plates, stock solution (200mM curcumin) and an incubator 

First, we sterilized the metal spatula and flat-tipped forceps by placing them in ethanol. Next, we labeled the 100 mm petri plates containing 2% water-agar medium with our names and the date.  Then, on the back, we drew a line dividing the plate in half. On the line, we drew one square (1cm x 1cm). Next, we diluted our curcumin stock solution (200mM curcumin) by adding 1.5mL of stock solution to 30mL of water (10 mL of dilution solution was needed for each plate) resulting in a 10mM curcumin dilution. Next, we added 10 mL of the dilution to each agar plate and let them soak for 10 minutes each. After the 10 minutes were over, we poured out the excess dilution. Then, we took out and dried the spatula. Next, we opened the three plates of water agar and used the spatula to cut out the center square, sterilizing with ethanol in between each use. Then, we slid a 1cm by 1cm cube of agar with Physarum culture (pre-prepared already) into each of the empty space of the three water agar plates with Physarum culture facing up. We made sure to sterilize the flat-tipped forceps with ethanol between each block transfer. Then, we carefully added two pieces of oatmeal near the one of the far edges of each plate. Then, we taped and close every plate. Lastly, we covered each plate in foil and labeled them “curcumin group”, with our names and the time. We placed the three plates into the incubator for 24 hours.


Check the results approximately 24 hrs later
After 24 hours, we unwrapped the foil of all 6 plates. Next, we measured and recorded the longest distance traveled by the Physarum in both the control and experimental groups. Lastly, we disposed of all plates and waste products. We wiped and cleaned our station with bleach to ensure no unwanted Physarum growth.



Results:
In order to understand how the role of the PKA in the cAMP pathway affects the growth and motility of Physarum Polycephalum, the chemical curcumin, a known enzyme protein kinase A inhibitor, was tested. 2% Water agar plates with oatmeal flakes and Physarum were used as a control group in this experiment.  The experimental groups used 2% water agar plates that were soak in 10mM curcumin with oatmeal flakes and Physarum. As shown in Figure 1, the average rate of migration of the control group was 0.729土0.526 mm/hr. The average rate of migration for the curcumin group was 0.751土0.402 mm/hr. Compared to the control group’s rate of migration, the curcumin group’s rate of migration value was 2.99%  faster (n=3, p=0.963). Based off figure 1, curcumin did not have a have a significant impact on the growth and motility of Physarum and the cAMP pathway. The experimental and control groups were not statistically significant due to the p-value of 0.963. All statistical analysis was done through double tailed T-tests. 


Discussion:
It was predicted that curcumin would inhibit the growth of Physarum due to its ability to inhibit protein kinase A [Johnson: 2016]. A study published by the Biochimica et Biophysica Acta of Molecular Cell Research found strong data that suggests that one of PKA’s various responsibilities is the regulation and formation of microfilaments and actin [Howe: 2004]. Building on this idea, a different study by the American Chemical Society: Biochemistry found that curcumin’s ability to inhibit PKA allows for the inhibition of actin’s ability to self-assemble which leads to the disorganization of actin networks. Due to affecting actin networks, it was found that PKA plays a vital for cell adhesion, actin-based cell migration, and chemotactic cell migration. In addition, this study found that curcumin binds very close to the actin binding site causing conformational changes and disrupting interactions between adjacent actin monomers thus interrupting filament formation [Dhar: 2015].  Despite what was predicted, curcumin did not inhibit PKA or the growth of Physarum and had little to no effect compared to the control.  This discrepancy could be attributed to Physarum’s sensitivity to chemotaxis but more specifically its sensitivity to the chemoreception of curcumin.


For potential and future experimentation, Physarum’s sensitivity to chemotaxis and the chemoreception of curcumin could be investigated. These variables may have affected how Physarum reacts to curcumin and if taken under consideration could possibly lead to more statistically relevant data. In this lab, after the dilution, the concentration of curcumin used was 10mM. The concentration of 10mM may be too low or perhaps curcumin requires a longer soaking time in water agar for maximum absorption. In a study done by The Journal of General Physiology, it was found that Physarum distinguishes different chemicals such as ATP, sugars, and inorganic salts at different concentration. In addition, it was also found that chemical recognition occurs as result of structural changes of the membrane at the threshold point. Once the threshold has been overcome, signal transduction occurs resulting in a behavior which in this case is the inhibition of PKA and cellular motility [Ueda: 1975]. This study did not directly test curcumin but curcumins known ability to regulate microfilament based on its effect on PKA, a vital component of the cAMP pathway, is similar to the chemicals tested in the study. It is plausible that the concentration of curcumin used in this experiment was not high enough to effectively change the membrane potential thus not creating a conformational change. Without this conformational change, curcumin is not able to make a significant difference in Physarum’s behavior.


	Understanding the relationship between cellular motility, cell growth, the cAMP pathway and curcumin’s ability to inhibit PKA in Physarum could potentially lead to better more effective anticancer and anti-cell growth treatments in the future.  A study done by The Prostate Journal investigated curcumin’s potential to inhibit growth in cancer cells. It was found that curcumin decreases the proliferative potential and induces the apoptosis potential of androgens in prostate cancer cells [Dorai: 2001]. This means that curcumin lowers growth potential while inducing apoptosis levels in prostate cancer cells. This study opens up the possibility that curcumins ability to inhibit KPA could be applied to organisms besides Physarum to slow the spread of cancerous cells.   


In conclusion, no significant difference was discovered between the rate of migration of Physarum between the control group and the curcumin group, therefore, our data was not successfully able to prove the deactivation of protein kinase A results in a decreased rate of growth in Physarum polycephalum. In the future, similar experimentation could bring a better understanding on the relationship between actin and curcumin and how they affect cell growth, cellular motility and the inhibition of PKA. These studies could possibly lead to beneficial medication for humans such as anti-cancer drugs.
