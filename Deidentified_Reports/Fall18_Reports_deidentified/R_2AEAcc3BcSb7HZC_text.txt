Title: The Allocation Patterns of Pisum sativum when Grown within Herbivorous Conditions

Abstract:
For this experiment, Pisum sativum plants were put under herbivorous conditions, and their allocation patterns were studied.  Pisum sativum plants are also known as field peas, and they are commonly grown throughout Northern temperature regions.  Every plant is exposed to some sort of predator.  This experiment consists of simulating plant predation upon the Pisum sativum plants.  The section of the plants being preyed on is their shoots.  Therefore, the hypothesis being tested is: will the plants being exposed to herbivorous conditions attempt to grow larger roots so that they can compensate for the loss of resources due to shoot loss?  The data of the experiment showed an extremely small difference between the control group’s and experimental group’s shoot to root ratio.  Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected.      

Introduction:
Evolution has made it so that plants will adapt in order to survive in the environmental conditions hat are present around them.  If a plant can successfully adapt to its environment, it will be able to sustain its life, and live long enough to produce offspring.  However, if a plant fails to adapt, it will simply die, due to the hazardous environmental conditions.  
The plant species that is being tested is entitled Pisum sativum.  Pisum sativum plants are also known as field peas, and they are commonly grown throughout Northern temperature regions.  In this experiment, we are attempting to create hostile environmental conditions to see how the plants will adapt in order to survive.  We will be creating an environment that exposes the plants to herbivorous-like conditions.  To do this, we will simulate the plant being eaten by insects.  
The environment being simulated is as if the insects only eat the leaves of the plants, the soot.  Therefore, the hypothesis is that the experimental plant group, the group of Pisum sativum being exposed to herbivorous conditions, will attempt to grow larger roots so that they can compensate for the loss of resources due to shoot loss.    


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was designed so that there were two groups: the control group and the experimental group.  The control group consisted of three plant groups that were only exposed to the environmental conditions in which they needed in order to survive: water, sunlight, and soil.  The experimental group was exposed to the same essential environmental conditions; however, every three days, the experimental group would have leaves cut off.  This occurred for two weeks.  Each time the leaves were cut, ½ of each leaf on each plant would be cut.  
After the two weeks were complete, the two sets of plants were examined.  Twelve plants were taken from the control group and twelve plants were taken from the experimental group.  Each plant was washed off and cut right above the gametes.  This split the roots from the shoots.  Each root and shoot were measured in centimeters and weighed in grams.  The data was then collected (in the form of a two-tailed t-test), recorded, and used to determine if the hypothesis was supported or rejected.  


Results:
The data of the experimental group and the control group are very similar.  Therefore, the factor we tested did not affect the root:shoot ratio of this plant.  

Discussion:
The results show that there was not a considerable difference in root:shoot ratio between the control group and the experimental group.  This data does not support the hypothesis because, if the hypothesis was supported, the experimental plant group would have had, on average, a larger root:shoot ratio.  This indicates that Pisum sativum plants do not respond to having their shoot eaten by herbivores by growing larger roots.  Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected, and the plants may have some other biological process that allows them to adapt to herbivores eating their shoot.
