Title: Carbonated water’s role in the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is dependent on multiple systems to function properly, one of them being carbon dioxide. The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effects of carbonated water on rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesize would increase with carbonated water. The test consisted of running photosynthesis with three different samples over a period of 30 minutes. One sample had no carbonated water, the second had a mixture of 50% carbonated water and 50% water, and the third had 1000% carbonated water. The results concluded that there was no significant difference between the rate of photosynthesis with normal water and the rate of photosynthesis with carbonated water. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that carbonated water increases the rate of photosynthesis from this experiment. This newly found knowledge will be helpful for future studies as well as the agricultural and environmental studies communities to help further push the question of how to increase crop yields as well as increase growth rates. 

Introduction:
	Photosynthesis is the foundation off the life cycle that all organisms depend on to survive. Photosynthesis is broken down into two major parts, photosystem I and photosystem II. The main components that are necessary to make photosynthesis work are chloroplast, glucose, carbon dioxide, light, chlorophyll, and some electron transport complexes. Photosynthesis absorbs solar energy from the sun, then transfers and converts the energy with electron transfer from water to NADP+, producing ATP generation and a series of enzymatic reactions that assimilate carbon dioxide and synthesize carbohydrate” [Tanaka: 2009]. In this experiment, we will examine how carbonated water affects the rate of photosynthesis through the use of the Hill reaction. The Hill reaction plays a role in photosynthesis with carbon dioxide and its process of transferring electrons [Good: 1963]. 
Other studies have analyzed the Hill reaction and the major components to create a strong foundation of how it plays a significant role in photosynthesis. Warburg’s and Krippahl’s demonstration (1, 2) that the Hill reaction needs CO2 and are inhibited by the removal of CO2. The Hill reaction is stimulated by the addition of CO2. [Stern: 1961]. The Hill reaction relies on chloroplast, water, and CO2 to function properly and carry out photosynthesis. Electron transport and the activation of light as well as the use of DCIP to act as a colored die that turns blue when photosynthesis occurs carry out this process.
	The proposed question is how will this carbonated water affect the rate of photosynthesis in spinach plants. We hypothesize that the rate of photosynthesize will increase in the presence of carbonated water. Our findings will help the agricultural community of farmers have a better understanding of how to increase crop production and maximize healthy crop yields. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted using the Spinacia oleracea, a centrifuge, and a spectrometer 20 machine. The first step was pulling the veins out of four to five spinach leaves. Then, place the leaves and 10mL of grinding buffer into the pestle to be ground up. Once a past was starting to form in the mortar another 10mL of grinding buffer was added and ground to a paste. The paste was then filtered through three to four layers of cheesecloth placed over a beaker. The liquids were then placed in a centrifuge and spun at 2000G for 3 minutes at 4 degres Celsius. Then the liquid was spun at 1000G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Once complete, the top liquid was added with 20mL of grinding buffer. 
	The blank test tube was filled with eight mL of DI water, no 130 mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and no carbonated water. The three tubes of water received six mL of DI water, two mL of 130 mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and no carbonated water. The three test tubes of 50:50 water and carbonated water got three mL of DI water, two mL of 130mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and three mL of carbonated water. The last three tubes of carbonated water got no DI water, two mL 130mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and six mL of carbonated water. Then 100 microliters of chloroplast were added to every tube and then solutions were transferred into cuvettes. The spec 20 machine was set to a wavelength of 600 nm and the absorbance’s were recorded, starting by blanking the blank. Then the cuvettes were placed in sunlight for 10 minutes before recording the absorbance’s again. Then, they were placed in the sunlight for another 10 minutes and the absorbances were recorded. Finally there were placed in the sunlight for a final 10 minutes and the absorbances were then recorded. A one-way ANOVA test at the 0.05 alpha level was then run for each10 minute interval, comparing the percent change of the rate of photosynthesis [Johnson, AD: 2016]. 


Results:
An ANOVA test was conducted for percent change of absorbance at the time stamps of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. At all three time intervals the data were not significant at the 0.05 alpha levels. At the 10 minute interval the p value was p=0.503, at the 20-minute interval the p value was p=0.313, and for the 30-minute interval the p value was p=0.974. The graph below (Figure 1.2) shows the percent change of the rate of photosynthesis over the time span of 30 minutes. The trends in the data showed that the rate of photosynthesis increased in the first ten minutes, then decreased in the next 10 minutes, and finally increased again in the last 10 minutes.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that carbonated water would increase the rate of photosynthesis throughout the 30 minutes of the experiment. However, our results were insignificant making it inconclusive if carbonated water really does increase the rate of photosynthesis. The graph below (Figure 1.1) has a trend of the percent change absorbance decreasing as time went on and then increasing in last ten minutes. One observation that was noted during the experiment was it was a cloudy day, meaning the samples did not receive much sunlight and inconsistent amounts of sunlight as the sun came in and out of the clouds. Also, upon adding the DCIP to the carbonated water sample the sample turned a lilac color instead of a blue color, meaning that carbonated water changed the pH to a more acidic environment. This probably contributed to the results not being significantly different. Other experiments similar to this one have been conducted and have had significant results. These data from other experiments suggest that CO2 is an active species involved in stimulating the Hill reaction by increasing the rate of photosynthesis when present in high concentrations [Sarojini: 1981]. Carbon dioxide affects the rate of photosynthesis by increasing the amount of sugar present in the reaction, giving the Hill reaction energy to carry out its processes and increase its rate [Sarojini: 1981].
This being the case, other experiments have been conducted to see the effects of carbonated water on photosynthesis and came up with conclusive results. These experiments looked at how aquatic live is affected by looking at the concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen and how they fluctuate depending on the relative importance of photosynthesis and respiration but also are strongly influenced by physical processes, such as gas exchange with the atmosphere and mixing [Wissel: 2008]. They concluded that carbonated water increases photosynthesis and as a result algae plums arise. Others have concluded that carbon dioxide levels do not affect photosynthesis as much as bicarbonate levels, making bicarbonate the more effective factor for increasing photosynthesis [Batra: 1965]. This lab is important because it has agricultural and marine impacts that will help the communities create more effective ways of regulating crops and deadly algae plums that can kill thousands of fish. This experiment also lays the foundation for future experiments in seeing how DCIP alters the pH of the solution in photosynthesis.
