Title: SALINITY DOES NOT IMPACT PHOTOSYNTHETIC ACTIVITY IN KALE PLANTS

Abstract:
All autotrophs rely heavily on photosynthesis to produce energy intracellularly. The rate of photosynthetic activity in chloroplasts can be observed through the reduction of DCPIP, a substance that changes color when reduced, and is a reliable product for observing the Hill Reaction. Salinity is also an environmental consideration in plants and may have a larger role than perceived. In recent years, salt-runoffs and ocean acidification has placed environmental stress on plants that do not tolerate salinity well, resulting in plants’ ion channels being stall with a swelling of sodium ions and intercellular communication. In this experiment, photosynthetic activity was observed across various levels of salinity (NaCl salts) to determine if there was a statistically significent difference between the photosynthetic rate in a non-salty environment versus in a highly-salty environment, with the hypothesis being that an increase in salinity would be matched with a decrease in photosynthetic activity. The results did not support this hypothesis, but were close (d.f.= 8 and p= 0.067). Likely this indicates that the chosen salinities were not different enough and that with a higher set of salinity, such as one with a molarity of 0.9M, the results may have been statistically more significan

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is an energy dependent reaction that converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose, water and oxygen [1]. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts in the cells absorb solar radiation to trigger the reaction and produce a flow of electrons through photosystems I and II. This electron transfer in the presence of light is called the Hill Reaction, which takes water and an electron receptor and protonates the receptor, reducing several complexes of the photosystem until it reaches a terminal electron acceptor [2]. The Hill Reaction can be observed using DCPIP, which is a naturally bluish color that turns progressively clearer in the presence of photosynthetic activity, which reduces the conjugated structure of DCPIP [1]. At the same time, salinity has proven to be an important environmental factor in various plants that may regulate photosynthetic activity, with seawater plants being much more adapted to a salty environment than mainland or freshwater plants [3]. In this lab, chloroplasts from the kale plant, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, were isolated from the plant and suspended in DCPIP regulated solutions of varying salinities to observe how photosynthetic activity would be impacted by increasing salinity, with the hypothesis being that as the salinity increased, the rate of photosynthetic activity would decrease. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, leaves from the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica plant were stripped of their veins and then grinded up in a grinding buffer to a paste. The paste was filtered through cheesecloth and then spun down in a centrifuge for 4 minutes where the chloroplasts formed a pellet. The supernatant was removed and then the pellet was re-spun in a centrifuge with a new solution of grinding buffer for a total of 12 minutes. Finally, the supernatant was removed again and the chloroplast pellet was re-suspended in more grinding buffer, which became the source of the isolated chloroplasts later in the lab.

In 10 test tubes, samples were prepared equimolar in triplicate of the chloroplast solution, general Reaction Buffer, the DCPIP indicator, water, and an NaCl salt water solution. One tube was the blank that set the standard for spectrophotometer; the other 9 test tubes were split into three groups. The first group combined reaction buffer with no salt water to create a 0.0 M salinity environment; group two received both salt water and reaction buffer to create a salty environment of 0.3 M; and the third group had an environment of 0.6 M of NaCl in solution. All other variables were kept constant.

The tubes were recorded every 10 minutes for 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm. The blank set the standard for the readings, and then each reading’s absorbance and percent change was recorded.  At the end of the lab, a one-way ANOVA test was used to determine if the difference in the percent change in photosynthetic activity between the three differing environments was statistically significent.  


Results:
Overall, the results of the experiment were not statistically significent, so there is not enough evidence to say that the outcome of this experiment was not due to random chance (d.f.= 8, p= 0.067, Fs= 4.04).  For the results to have been statistically significent, the p_value of the ANOVA would’ve had to have been 0.05 or smaller. In general, the increase in salinity resulted in the decrease of photosynthetic activity in the kale plant, but this cannot be conclusively said. Figure 1 highlights the important results from the experiment. 

Discussion:
Although the effect of salinity on kale may be remarkable, their results were not statistically significent, and thus the initial hypothesis that as salinity increased, the rate of photosynthesis would decrease, was not supported. These data show that it can be said with only 94.3% confidence that the effects of salinity on photosynthetic rate were not due to random chance. There is, however, a clear difference between the average rate of absorbance between the 0.0 M salinity environment versus the 0.6 M environment. As the rate of photosynthesis increased, the blue tint from the DCPIP decreased, resulting in the data being negative (the trend shows a smaller level of absorbance of blue light [at 600 nm]). The data suggests, however, that by increasing the salinity, perhaps to a molarity of 0.9M or above, the difference in photosynthetic rate could become statistically significent. Another possible option would be to observe a plant more sensitive to changes in salinity, such as a plant that only grows in freshwater sources. 
The study of salinity on photosynthetic rate is perhaps more important now more than ever. The increase in ocean acidification and salt deposits in freshwater sources from fertilizer runoff have placed environmental stress on many species of plants. Kale can be grown in most environments but is easily stressed by salty environments [4]. Like all living systems, plants must maintain a system of homeostasis to continue carrying out normal functions. When high levels of salinity enter the cell, water tends to leave the cell, dehydrating the plant and killing it [5]. The sodium-potassium pumps in plants can receive an influx of Na+ ions from the salted soil which could damage or slow the loss of K+ ions from the cell, disrupting everything from cellular respiration to intercellular communication [5]. If phenomena like ocean acidification and fertilizer runoff are allowed to continue to occur without consequence, this could be incredibly damaging to plant species nearest these occurrences, resulting in the death of many species of waterfront plants. Therefore, it is imperative that plants are either genetically modified to withstand a more stressed environment (in terms of salinity), or that environmental efforts are taken to reduce unnecessary salts from entering the environment. 

Overall, this experiment was not necessarily successful, but it does provide hope for further studies. Although the differences between 0.0 M, 0.3 M and 0.6 M salinity environments were not statistically significent amongst each other, an increase in the upper-level molarity would likely lead to statistical significance and could further help advance the case against using salt-based fertilizers within a certain proximity to waterways. If continued to progress, these environmental phenomena would put species of plants sensitive to salinity stress in danger of dying off by shocking their systems with high levels of salts that would stall ion pumps and intercellular communication.
