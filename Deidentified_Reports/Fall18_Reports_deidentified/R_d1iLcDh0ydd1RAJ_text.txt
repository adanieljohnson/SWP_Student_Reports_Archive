Title: Blocking pupation by reducing E20 hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars

Abstract:
The life cycle of a Manduca sexta caterpillar is drastically altered with the introduction of a 20E blocker. Without both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone, Manduca sexta are likely to die. Blocking ecdysterone, with 1 part Aza guard, 1250 parts water, at the commitment pulse inhibits growth, preventing the caterpillar from molting. By the conclusion of the experimental tests, the group introduced to 20E blocker were dead or close to it while the controll group had molted. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta has a homometabolous life cycle. The stages of the cycle, which is typically 39-48 days long, include egg/embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. The pupal stage can be identified by reduced movement. The transition between stages is induced by hormones. Ecdysterone (20E) regulates the timing of molting, which occurs during the transition between stages. Juvenile hormone (JH) regulates the type of molting. Without both of the hormones, the Manduca sexta will die, however, the amount of these hormones alters the cycle of the Manduca sexta. During the commitment pulse, which occurs during the 5th instar period, JH levels drop slightly and 20E rises. This is the first time 20E has risen while JH is low. At this stage, the caterpillar changes to a pupa. If we block the hormone ecdysterone (20E), then the growth of the caterpillars with halt and, therefore, their weight will remain constant. If the hormone (20E) is blocked, then the caterpillar will be unable to go through molting/ecolosin into the next life cycle stage. 

Materials and Method:
Two groups of four caterpillars in the 4th or 5th larval instar were selected. Each caterpillar received 10g of food. The controll group received 7 drops of distilled water while the experimental group received 7 drops of the 20E blocker, Aza guard (1: 1250). The two groups were placed into identical plastic containers with four separate slots and a removable lid. Holes were punched in the containers, so the caterpillars could breathe, and the containers were placed in the incubator. At about 2pm daily, the caterpillars were massed, waste was removed, and food was replaced as needed. A two sample T-test was used. The independent variable was the introduction of the 20E hormone blocker. There were two dependent variables: quantitative was the weight of the caterpillars and qualitative were the observations made of their life cycle stage changes, or lack thereof. 

Results:
A two-sample t_test was used to analyze the results. The calculated p_value (t_stat 1.051969, P=0.370066), mean percent increase, was much larger than expected (Tab. 1). It was not statistically significent in comparison to the experimental group and, therefore, does not support the hypothesis. However, the collected qualitative data does support the findings. The caterpillars were visibly changed on the final day of measurements (Fig. 1). Of the controll group, three of the four caterpillars had pupated and the fourth had a hard coating but had not yet pupated. In the experimental group, three appeared to be dead, as they did not respond to any stimuli. Two remained a light green/white color while the other two were brown. All were very squishy. The difference in weight of the controll group ranged between 2.96, -0.52, -2.31, and -0.19 and between -0.45, -0.66, -1.73, and -0.30 for the experimental group. 

Discussion:
The Manduca sexta caterpillars did not pupate, which supports our hypothesis that the 20E blocker would halt or slow the growth cycle of the caterpillars. 20E cause them to either attempt to molt and die or stop the cycle all together and then die. Our controll group had only one caterpillar that did not pupate but was very close. The mean percent increase was not statistically significent because of the use of final and initial masses for each caterpillar. This does not take into account the growth Manduca sexta sustain during their lifetime. As each caterpillar reaches a maximum, critical weight before the commitment pulse, whereupon the caterpillar stops eating and will sustain a loss of nutrients and water [Nijhout; 1974].
