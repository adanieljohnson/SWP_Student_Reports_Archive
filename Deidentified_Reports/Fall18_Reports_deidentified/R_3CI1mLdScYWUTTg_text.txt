Title: Weight changes in Manduca sexta due to Precor-Methoprene

Abstract:
Hormones are signals used to communicate throughout an organism. Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analog. It was hypothesized that there will be a statistically significent difference between the amount of weight change between the Manduca sexta with 10 drops of precor-methoprene in their food compared to the controll group with no precor-methoprene in their food. There was a statistical significent difference between the average weight gained between the experimental and controll group (t_stat=2.81, d.f.= 6, p_value=0.031). This could be due to the interaction of methoprene with the retinoic acid receptor pathway.

Introduction:
Hormones are chemical signals produced in an organism that move to other parts of the organism. Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analog that retains juvenile characteristics during development [Tatarazako: 2003]. The model organism for this lab is the Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm. In a study conducted with Daphnia magna, the population was controllled using juvenile hormone analog to prevent larvae from metamorphosing [Tatarazako: 2003]. It can be hypothesized that there will be a statistically significent difference between the amount of weight change between the Manduca sexta with 10 drops of precor-methoprene in their food compared to the controll group with no precor-methoprene in their food.

Materials and Method:
First, two plastic containers with four compartments were obtained. Two holes were made using scissors on the outside of each compartment in order for the Manduca sexta to have an oxygen source. Then, label one container controll and one experimental. Label each compartment number one through four for both the controll and experimental containers. Place ten grams of food with zero drops of precor-methoprene in each controll container compartment. Use a disposable pipette to place ten drops of precor-methoprene in ten grams of food. Mix the food and precor-methoprene well before placing the food in the compartments. Obtain eight Manduca sexta; record the weight of each Manduca sexta and place them in their designated compartments for 14 days. Place the containers with the Manduca sexta in the incubator at 25 degrees Celsius. Utilize a two-sample t_test to analyze the difference between the experimental and controll groups average weight gained across the fourteen-day period.

Results:
The mean weight gained by the controll group was less than the experimental group, as seen in Figure 1. The average weight gained by the controll group was 4.1025±0.83974 grams. The average weight gained by the experimental group was 8.7525±3.20567 grams. There was a significent difference between the average weight gained between the experimental and controll group (t_stat=2.81, d.f.= 6, p_value=0.031). The Manduca sexta in the controll group had started pupating at day eleven, so the data for the controll group was limited to eleven days. Whereas, the experimental group never started to pupate, so the data presented difference. The data collection was interrupted for three days due to inclement weather, so there were points where the experimental group lost weight because they did not have enough food to eat. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported; the p_value was less than 0.05. We can reject the null hypothesis because there was a statistically significent difference between the amount of precor-methoprene in the food and average weight gained in the controll and experimental groups of Manduca sexta. In one study, the action of juvenile hormone in insects was mimicked by methoprene by activating the retinoic acid receptor pathway [Harmon: 1995]. It is possible that this interaction by methoprene with the receptor pathway allows for the controll of the Manduca sexta population. However, the model organism in the study was Drosphila, not Manduca sexta. This hormone-receptor interaction could aid agricultural farms in need of a hormonal pesticide to controll insect populations.
