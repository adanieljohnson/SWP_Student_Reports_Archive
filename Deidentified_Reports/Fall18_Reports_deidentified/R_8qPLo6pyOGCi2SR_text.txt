Title: Effects of pH on the Rate of Electron Transfer in Brassica oleracea

Abstract:
Brassica oleracea are commonly known as kale leaves. They are a plant that takes part in photosynthesis, a process in which plants capture light energy to use as fuel for metabolic processes.  In photosynthesis, electrons are transferred. The rate at which they are transferred indicates the rate at which photosynthesis is occuring. Brassica oleracea thrive at a pH of 6.0-7.5. We hypothesized that if the pH was changed to both an acidic condition (pH 2) and a basic condition (pH 10)  then electron transfer would slow, indicating a decrease in photosynthetic activity. When electrons are transferred DCIP is reduced which can be see in its transition from blue to clear color. Therefore, absorbance values were used to indicate electron transfer. The effects of basic and acidic conditions were examined over 30 minutes using enriched chloroplasts to make the reaction occur. Absorbance was recorded and percent change was found. Two, two-sample t-tests were used to compare the basic conditions to the control and the acidic conditions to the control. Results were not statistically significant, however data showed noticeable differences in photosynthetic activity as pH changed. Acidic and basic conditions led to a decrease in the rate of electron transfer. 


Introduction:
All living organisms must directly or indirectly extract their energy from one or more external sources. Plants capture and store energy from the sun using the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis involves taking carbon dioxide and water and converting it in to glucose, water, and oxygen. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. Electrons excited by captured solar energy leave carrier molecules. Electron excitement triggers a chemical reaction that cleaves water. The high energy electrons are stored as NADPH and a proton gradient powers ATP synthesis. The electrons of NADPH and the ATP are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize glucose. Photosynthesis occurs in three distinct stages. ATP production, or reduction of NADP+ can be summarized by the Hill reaction:
	
2H2O +2A → 2AH2 + O2

2,6-dichlorophenol, or DCIP, will be used as the alternative electron acceptor. Oxidized DCIP is dark blue, while the reduced form is colorless. Therefore, DCIP reduction can be measured as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm. The DCIP assay can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. The purpose of this lab is to use enriched chloroplasts from brassica oleracea leaves to reduce DCIP and measure the effects of both acidic and basic pH conditions on photosynthetic activity in brassica oleracea. The key components in this reaction are enriched chloroplasts, grinding buffer, water, the reaction buffer with a pH of 6.5, and solutions with pH 2 and pH 10. A pH of 6.5 was used as the control because kale leaves grow optimally in a pH of 6.0-7.5 (Noisopa et al: 2010). The treatment with acidic, basic or neutral pH is the independent variable.  In research done, a low pH inhibited electron transfer and root growth (Yan et al:1992). Therefore, we hypothesized that a pH of 2 and 10 would significantly decrease the rate of electron transfer indicating a decrease in photosynthetic activity. 


Materials and Methods:
Packed a mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker, and 3, 50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle cooled, removed the central veins from one large brassica oleracea, or kale leaf. Rinsed remaining leaf pieces with water, then blotted off any excess moisture. Added kale leaf to mortar and pestle. Added 10mL of 400mM cold grinding buffer (pH 8). Ground the kale until it was a thick paste. Added an additional 10mL of grinding buffer, mixed with the kale slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. Transferred the 200 microliters of the filtered liquid from the beaker into a microtubule labeled ‘Sample of A” and stored it on ice. Transferred the remaining green liquid to a chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked “A” and spun it at 200 X G for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. Poured the supernatant out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. Did not transfer the debris at the bottom of tube “A”. Next, removed 200 microliters of the liquid from the 50mL tube marked “B”, placed it in a microtubule labeled “Sample of B”, and stored it on ice. Centrifuged the 50mL tube containing chloroplast suspension (Tube “B”) at 1,000 X G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. Poured the supernatant into a clean, 50mL tube marked “C”. Placed tube “B” on ice. Added 15mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Transferred 200 microliters of this resuspended pellet in to a microtubule labeled “Sample “B” pellet and stored it on ice. Used this sample in the treatment part of the experiment. 
Labeled three centrifuge tubes pH 2, 6.5, and 10. Put 5mL resuspended pellet in each. Added 5mL pH buffers respectively. Let rest for 10 minutes. Centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2800 rpm. Poured out liquid and added 5mL grinding buffer to each tube. Resuspended. 
Labeled 13 large test tubes 1 through 13 . Prepared tube 1 with 6 mL of water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, and 2 mL of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 2-4 were prepared with no chloroplasts, 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, and 2mL pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 5-7 were designated for acidic condition testing and were prepared with 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, and 2 mL of pH 2 buffer. Tubes 8-10 were designated for control condition testing and were prepared with 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, and 2 mL of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 11-13 were designated for basic condition testing and were prepared with 6 mL of water, 2 mL of DCIP, and 2 mL of pH 10 buffer. To begin the assay, 100 uL of the enriched chloroplasts were added to each of the 13 tubes. Transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Blanked spectrophotometer then measured absorbances at 600nm every 10 mins for 30 mins. Recorded absorbances and calculated percent change. 
The statistical tests used to analyze the significance of the results were two, two sample t - tests. One compared acidic conditions to the control and the other compared basic conditions to the control. The test was completed by documenting the average percent change for each rate of electron transfer reaction. 


Results:
In figure 2, or both acidic and basic conditions there was an increase in absorbance in the 30 mins. For the control group, absorbance decreased in the first 20 minutes and the increased in the last 10 minutes. In figure 1, the control group of pH 6.5 had negative percent change values. In figure 1 the basic and acidic conditions both had decreases in percent change and positive percent change values, indicated by the fact that they were less than 100 percent.  
The mean value for the acidic pH 2 condition’s rate of electron transfer was not statistically significantly different than that of the control condition at pH 6.5 (t-stat = 1.7332, df = 4, P = 0.158). The mean value for the basic pH 10 condition’s rate of electron transfer was also not statistically significantly different than that of the control condition at pH 6.5 (t-stat = 1.446511, df = 4, P = 0.22157). 


Discussion:
In the control group, the negative percent change in the first 20 minutes indicates photosynthetic activity. In the last 10 minutes there was a positive percent change indicating a decrease in photosynthetic activity. This could have been due to the fact that the chloroplasts were isolated from their roots and so there was a decrease in photosynthetic activity.
The increase in absorbance of acidic and basic conditions indicates a decrease in the rate of electron transport. This means that photosynthetic activity is decreasing and, therefore, the plant would not be able to survive. The experiment was not statistically significant so, therefore, the hypothesis is rejected that a pH of 2 and 10 would significantly decrease the rate of electron transfer. However, the results still show that acidic and basic pHs negatively affect plant growth so it can be concluded that a change in pH in the plant would negatively affect it. Acidic and basic conditions also had positive percent changes in contrast to the control group which had negative percent change values indicating that electron transport and photosynthetic activity was occuring.  A positive percent change again indicates a decrease in the rate of electron transport. 
Basic and acidic pH values are not favorable because the electrons cannot be transferred as quickly which is why the color did not change to clear as fast and the absorbances increased over time rather than decreased, which is not the desired effect.  This is shown in research conducted on sunflowers that indicated alkaline conditions, or basic conditions sharply decreased the rate of seedling survival (Lui et al: 2010).  The findings, along with those of this experiment, stress how changes in pH will harm plant life. Environmental hazards such as pollution would create a basic soil that would slow down electron transfer in brassica oleracea and decrease its photosynthetic activity which could lead to a death of the plant over time. 
	To further research, different acidic and basic pH levels could be tested to see if more intense pH changes lead to a significant decrease in electron transfer.
