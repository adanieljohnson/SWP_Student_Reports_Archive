Title: The Prevention of Molting by AzaGuard in Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
In all vertebrates and some invertebrates, hormones play a critical role in developmental changes. In a Manduca sexta caterpillar (or larva), the main hormones that govern its life cycle are juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E). In this experiment, the effects of AzaGuard on pupal eclosion of this species of caterpillar was tested. Because AzaGuard acts as a blocker for the hormone 20E, a delay of pupal eclosion was expected for the group of caterpillars treated with AzaGuard in comparison to the untreated group of caterpillars. These caterpillars were also expected to not be able to gain as much weight as the untreated caterpillars. The data collected displayed a statistically significance difference in the average maximum growth rate between the two groups of caterpillars, and on the final day of measurement, 3 out of 4 of the controll caterpillars had pupated and none of the experimental caterpillars had pupated. This information combined suggests that blocking 20E prevents Manduca sexta larva from becoming pupa and keeps them in their larval state until they die. This information can also be used as support for the use of AzaGuard as an insect growth regulator in a more sustainable pest management system.

Introduction:
A Manduca sexta insect goes through a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that it starts as an egg, transitions through 5 larval instars (in which it is called a caterpillar), metamorphosizes into a pupa, and then develops into an adult moth [Johnson: 2018]. Each transition during this life cycle is marked by molting (or eclosion), which involves the shedding of the outer layer of skin. The insect species, Manduca sexta, has been chosen for use in this experiment because of its role in extensive studies on the effects hormonal controll on development [Riddiford: 2012]. Two main hormones, juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E), regulate most of its developmental processes. JH, produced by the corpus allata, regulates which molt occurs (i.e. molt into another larval instar or into a pupa). This hormone has also been shown to play a significent role in guiding the action of 20E [Riddiford: 2012]. 20E, produced in the prothoracic glands, regulates the timing of each molt. 20E is also responsible for inducing the molting and the production of a new epidermis for the caterpillar [Copenhaver: 1982]. During the fifth larval instar of the life cycle, the amount of JH drops and the amount of 20E rises, creating the commitment pulse that causes the larva to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. Before pupation, certain physiological signs and phases have been noted in Manduca sexta caterpillars, including the termination of feeding, fluid excretion, and reduced movement. The phase of fluid excretion has been linked to nearly 40% of larval weight [Reinecke: 1980]. It would be expected then for the larva to lose a substantial amount of weight due to water loss leading up to pupation.
In this experiment, AzaGuard is used to inhibit the release of 20E. Therefore, two hypotheses have been formulated, one based on quantitative results and the other on qualitative results. First, if the 20E hormone is blocked, then molting (eclosion) will not occur, meaning that the treated caterpillars will not pupate. Second, if the 20E hormone is blocked by AzaGuard, then the growth of the caterpillars will slow and eventually halt, which would be shown by constant weight measurements. Each of these hypotheses is based on the information that 20E stimulates molting so therefore, in the absence of that hormone, it is inferred that molting will not take place. It is also inferred that due to the lack of molting, those same caterpillars would be unable to grow in their smaller bodies and growth would stop.


Materials and Method:
8 Manduca sexta caterpillars were weighed and randoMly placed into one of two groups. Each caterpillar had one of the 4 equal-sized compartments in one of two plastic containers. One group received the controll treatment, which was prepared with 40 g of caterpillar food and 28 drops of distilled water. The other group received the experimental treatment, which was prepared with 40g of caterpillar food and 28 drops of AzaGuard, with a concentration of 1: 1250 (one part AzaGuard to 1250 parts water). The same dropper was used to measure each liquid solution to ensure the consistency of the food was not a factor in the decision of the caterpillars to eat. Each caterpillar was given 10 grams of food mixture dependent on the group that they were in. Each caterpillar was observed and massed daily using an electronic balance at the same time for 2 weeks, and that data was recorded. Both plastic containers had the same number of holes punched in the sides for oxygen and were placed in the same incubator daily between measurements. For the duration of data collection, the caterpillars’ food was replaced as needed, according to the details written previously. After the last measurements were taken, daily growth rates, an overall growth rate, and the highest growth rate for each caterpillar were calculated. A 2-sample t_test was used to determine if the difference in overall growth rates and highest growth rates was statistically significently different between the caterpillars that received AzaGuard and the caterpillars that did not receive AzaGuard.

Results:
All 8 caterpillars followed the same general trend of weight change over the measurement period; all caterpillars gained weight, then began to lose weight, and then showed minimal change in weight towards the end of the measurement period (Fig.1). The mean overall growth rate for the caterpillars in the experimental group was -1.82%, while the mean overall growth rate for the caterpillars in the controll group was 15.10%. The average overall growth rate of the experimental group was not statistically significently different from the average overall growth rate of the controll group (t_stat=1.0514, d.f.=6, p_value=0.1668). However, the average maximum growth rate for the experimental group was statistically significently different from the average maximum growth rate for the controll group (t_stat=2.3654, d.f.=6, p_value=0.0279). The mean maximum growth rate for the experimental group was 63.77% with a standard deviation of 30.80%, while the mean maximum growth rate for the controll group was 128.79% with a standard deviation of 45.54% (Fig.2).
Qualitatively speaking, each of the caterpillars appeared to be the same until the fourth day of measurements. All the caterpillars to that point were growing steadily in weight, exhibited minimal movement, and were the same blue color from the start of the lab. However, on day 4, the experimental group, the ones treated with AzaGuard, started to exhibit less movement than their counterparts in the controll group and started to show signs of color loss, becoming pale and yellow as opposed to the bright blue. On Day 9 of measurement, one caterpillar in the controll group had pupated, and the other three caterpillars in that group showed signs of approaching pupation. On Day 13 of measurement, 3 out of 4 caterpillars in the controll group had pupated, and all the caterpillars in the experimental group were moving very little, were squishy, and appeared to be dead. On the final day of measurement, the caterpillar in the controll group that had not yet pupated had a hard, brown coating but was not quite a pupa (Fig.3). On the other hand, 3 out of 4 of the caterpillars in the experimental group had died and the other barely responded to touch (Fig.3). 


Discussion:
The first proposed hypothesis, that the use of AzaGuard would prevent the caterpillars from pupating, has been supported as shown by the delay in pupation in the group treated with AzaGuard. This result is inferred to be a result of the action of AzaGuard to block the 20E hormone, thus preventing the initiation of the commitment pulse to prompt the caterpillars into pupal eclosion [Copenhaver: 1982]. This inhibition causes the caterpillars to remain in the larval stage and attempt to pupate but eventually cause them to die.
The second proposed hypothesis, that the use of AzaGuard would produce lower growth rates in treated caterpillars, has also been support as shown by the statistical significance of the difference between maximum achieved growth rates of the controll caterpillars and of the treated caterpillars. The comparison of maximum growth rates was performed to demonstrate the difference in capacity between treated and untreated caterpillars to gain weight in preparation for eclosion. This statistical significance suggests that AzaGuard does cause a decrease in growth rates of Manduca sexta caterpillars compared to their untreated counterparts due to the lack of initiation of eclosion which would elicit stages of growth to prepare for the coming pupal stage. However, the insignificance of the difference between the overall average growth rates of untreated and treated caterpillars shows the consistency of physiological changes during the caterpillars’ life cycles despite the prevention of the release of 20E.
It can be inferred from the results collected in this experiment that with an abundance of 20E, instead of a deficiency with the use of AzaGuard, could potentially induce pupal eclosion early as confirmed by some previous studies [Copenhaver: 1982]. The data collected also suggests that the use of AzaGuard as an insect growth regulator (IGR) could be a sustainable method of pest management, since the chemical impacts a hormone in a specific insect instead of several insects that would be affected with the use of a pesticide. In studies of preventing crop damage in California, it was shown that AzaGuard when paired with another organic pesticide significently reduced pest numbers [Dara: 2015]. In the future, knowledge about the impacts of chemicals that target developmental hormones in pest species could assist farmers in making more sustainable pesticide choices.
