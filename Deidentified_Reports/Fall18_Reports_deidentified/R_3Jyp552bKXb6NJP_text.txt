Title: Behavior of Betta Splendens affected by Water Clarity

Abstract:
The study of animal behavior, or ethology is vital to the broad field of evolutionary biology. By looking at behavior under the lenses of understanding adaptive traits, scientists seek to understand why animals do what they do. For my experiment, I sought to understand how alternating environmental circumstances will have an impact on the behavior of the fish species Betta splendens. I conducted an experiment that tested whether water clarity would have an impact on the reactionary agonistic behavior of Betta splendens. After collecting my data and conducting a two-sample paired t-test, I discovered that there was no statistical difference between the reaction times of the fish in water with less water clarity and those in clear water. However, there were some flaws in my experimental design such as the confounding variable of an injured fish and the presence of reflections within the aquariums.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is vital to the field of evolutionary biology. By taking a look at animal behavior, scientists gain a better understanding for the genetic and physiological adaptations that animals have developed as evolutionary selection acts upon them, including ourselves. Many scientists study animal behavior because it sheds light on human beings. Research on non-human primates, for instance, continues to offer valuable perspectives into the causes and evolution of individual, social, and reproductive human actions [Tenny: 2014]. Ethologists will focus almost entirely on the way species behavior develops [Soft school :2018] In our experiment, we sought out to understand animal behavior under certain conditions and stimuli in the species, Betta splendens, or more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. The betta was first discovered in Southeast Asia. Making its home in rice paddies, drainage ditches and the warm floodplains of the region, the betta became accustomed to frequent storm flooding and devastating droughts [Pet Sitters International: 2018]. Because of the cyclical environment of droughts and flooding, Betta splendens have adapted the ability to breathe oxygen in the air (for a short period of time) using their labyrinth organ and from in its gills while submerged in water [Pet Sitters International: 2018]. Warriors by nature, their aggressive behavior stems from the male Betta’s need to protect his territory [Short: 2013]. For my experiment, I’m going to test whether water clarity, our condition, will have an impact on Betta splendens behavior. My hypothesis is that less water clarity will increase the amount of time it takes for the fish to display agonistic behavior too each other. 

Materials and Methods:
For my experiment, I am going to be using 3 different groups of two male Betta splendens. For each group I am going to put the betta fish through a control test and a treatment. First for my control, I am going to place the two males in an aquarium with clear water separated by a glass and plastic divider. For my control, I will remove the plastic divider separating the fish while keeping glass divider intact. I will then record how long it takes for the fish to display agonistic behavior toward each. I will begin the timer as soon as one fish displays agonistic behavior and stop the timer as soon as the second fish reciprocates an agonistic behavior. The time between the agonistic display of both the fish is what we will use as our data. After the control group, I will place the same two males in the less clear water and give them a five-minute resting period. For my treatment group, we mixed an aquarium filled with clear water with 500 milliliters of water mixed with 9 drops of green (3), red (3), and blue (3) food coloring. This constituted as our substance to decrease water clarity in our aquarium. After the five-minute resting period, I removed the plastic divider just as we did in the control group and used the same timing methods to record the reaction time to each other. I replicated the experiment with two more groups of male Betta splendens. Once I collected all of the data, I will test whether our data shows a statistical difference between the control and treatment group using a two tailed paired t-test. 



Results:
The mean reaction time for the fish in colored water was 3.65+/- 4.48 (figure 1). The mean reaction time for the fish in the clear water was 14.96+/-16 (figure 1). After conducting our two-sample paired t-test we discovered that our data did not show statistical difference between the reaction times of agonistic behavior between the fish in clear or less clear water  (t-stat =-1.07, df=2, P=.38).

Discussion:
After collecting our data, I reject my hypothesis that less water clarity will increase the amount of time it takes for the fish to display agonistic behavior too each other. Our data showed that there was no statistical difference our control and treatment group.  This can be attributed to the adaptive physiology of Betta splendens. The Siamese fighting fish is native to the Mekong delta in south-east Asia and although the Siamese fighting fish can today be found naturally in Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia, it is thought to have originated from Thailand [Burnie:2008][Kindersley:2008]. These waters are far from being clear, so it is possible that our “murky” water was not enough to overcome the physical adaptations that the Betta fish has developed over its evolutionary history. Another observation that I made as I was conducting the experiment was that the fish appeared to be able see their reflections through the glass of the aquarium. A lot of the time, the fish were too busy focusing on their reflections rather than reacting to the other males. This experiment can be improved by covering exterior of the aquarium glass with plastic dividers so they aren’t able to see themselves. Another observation that I made conducting this experiment is that one of the group of males that I used for my study is the same group of males that my group used for an experiment in a previous experiment. In the former experiment, we noticed that one of the males had been injured in the brief physical interaction with the other male. The blue male had sustained a tear in his pectoral fin. For this experiment, the injured male failed to display agonistic behavior in response to the red male’s agonistic behavior. The blue male appeared to have shown submission. This may have drastically skewed my data. To improve this experiment, it would be advisable to use Betta fish that are not injured from other fish, even if the injury is slight.
