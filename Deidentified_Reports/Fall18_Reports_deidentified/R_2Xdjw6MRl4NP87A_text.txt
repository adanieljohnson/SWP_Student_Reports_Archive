Title: Spinacia oleracea: Increase in Salinity Decreases Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to use Spinacia oleracea to test the hypothesis that if salinity concentrations surrounding leaves are increased, then photosynthetic activity will decrease. Increased salt concentrations will decrease photosynthetic activity because they will dehydrate the chloroplasts and pull water out of the cell, which is a necessary input of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic activity will be measured through percent changes of absorbances at 600 nm. The absorbances reflect photosynthetic activity through the use of electron acceptor DCPIP which becomes colorless when reduced. The experiment treats chloroplast mixtures of different salinities seen in nature. The study found a trend within significent data that the higher salinities had a lower percent change, however only the pairs 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M were found to be significent. The experiment used a one-way ANOVA test and the p value was 0.016. The trends presented by these two pairs supports previously published studies that describe the inhibiting effects of excess salt on photosynthetic activity. Salt concentration is significent in plants because it negatively impacts photosynthesis which can disturb the stability of the environment and organisms surrounding those plants.

Introduction:
The specific organism used in this experiment is Spinacia oleracea, which uses photosynthesis to obtain energy from the environment. This organism is used because it is not difficult to isolate chloroplasts to examine the effects of different conditions like pH, temperature, and salinity on photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis, a proton gradient is generated to produce ATP, which is the main source of energy for plants. The equation for photosynthesis is as follows: 6 CO2 + 12 H2O → C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2. DCPIP is an electron acceptor that is used to measure photosynthetic activity. DCPIP is a dark blue compound that becomes colorless when reduced [Johnson: 2018]. The reduction of DCPIP reflects photosynthetic activity because it signifies that electrons have moved through the electron transport chain indicating that the cells are producing ATP. Therefore, spectroscopy is used to measure the absorbances in the chloroplast mixtures as a means of identifying photosynthetic activity. Decreases in absorbances reflect an increase in photosynthetic activity and percent change of absorbances can be used to identify activity differences between different salinity concentrations. 
Excess salt can have a negative effect on photosynthesis because it will interfere with osmosis and pull water out of a plant when it is needed for different metabolic pathways, like photosynthesis. Osmosis is the movement of water across a membrane. When the salt concentration is higher outside the cell, water will follow in order to maintain equal salinities inside and outside of the cell. Through the cell’s attempt at achieving this equilibrium, excess salt is capable of pulling water out of the cell. Salinity changes can be due to runoff in the area a plant grows or location closer to a body of water that contains salt. Therefore, different plants in different locations can have varying amounts of salinity in their environment. It is important to understand the influence of salinity because it can help evaluate how plants adapt to different environmental conditions. 
It has also been discovered that excess salt can affect the conductance of CO2 diffusion, specifically in spinach, which led to an inhibition of photosynthesis [Wang: 2018]. The decrease in conductance of CO2 diffusion was due to increased stomatal limitation attributed to low leaf osmotic potential caused by the high salinity of the soil [Wang: 2018]. Stomata are pores in leaves responsible for the transport of CO2 into the plant. If the CO2 levels are too low in a plant then photosynthesis will not occur since it will disrupt the equation presented above by not providing the starting materials for photosynthesis. Leaves have the ability to increase thickness with less chlorophyll per unit area when treated by salt to decrease stomatal conductance and intercellular partial pressure of CO2. This is accomplished without inhibiting photosynthesis and by increasing water use efficiency [Downton: 1985]. The response of the plant to increase thickness of leaves highlights the importance of salinity to plants because they will physically change their structure in order to combat changes in the environment. This finding also demonstrates the important of studying salinity in order to understand changes in cells to maintain homeostasis. Conclusively, if the salinity of the spinach chloroplast mixture increases, then the calculated rate of photosynthesis derived from the absorbances of the chloroplasts at 600 nm will decrease.

Materials and Method:
Mixtures of chloroplasts were obtained by grinding four spinach leaves and 20 Ml of cold grinding buffer. This mixture was drained through three layers of cheesecloth into a beaker. This mixture was transferred to a centrifuge tube and spun at 200 X 6 for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After these three minutes, the supernatant was transferred into a separate centrifuge tube that was spun at 1,000 X G for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After these ten minutes, the supernatant was poured into a third centrifuge tube and 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added. The mixture was stirred until the pellet was broken up at the bottom of the tube. 13 test tubes were obtained and specific solutions were prepared. The first tube was labeled blank and prepared with 8 Ml of distilled water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Tubes 1-3 were the 0 M solutions and prepared with 6 Ml of distilled water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer. Tubes 4-6 were the 0.2 M solutions and prepared with 5 Ml of distilled water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 1 Ml of salt solution. Tubes 7-9 were the 0.4 M solutions and prepared with 4 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 2 Ml salt solution. Tubes 10-12 were the 0.6 M solutions and prepared with 3 Ml distilled water, 2 Ml DCPIP, 2 Ml reaction buffer, and 3 Ml salt solution. 100 microliters of chloroplasts were added to each test tube and mixed in. The mixtures were transferred to spectrometer cuvettes. The spectrometer was turned on and set to 600 nm. The spectrometer was blanked and the absorbances were obtained for each tube to obtain data for the initial time. The cuvettes were placed on the windowsill to allow sunlight to reach the chloroplasts. After a total of 10, 20, and 30 minutes the process of obtaining absorbances was repeated. Percent changes were recorded between each time period. One-way ANOVA tests were used to determine if the data was statistically significent. The alpha value was 0.05.

Results:
The salinity concentration of 0.2 M had the highest percent changes throughout the experiment, which was followed by the controll group at 0 M [Figure 1]. The groups treated with 0.4 M and 0.6 M reaction buffer had very similar results of lower percentages than the other two groups. At each time interval, the 0.2 M group had the highest percent change that consistently increased over time [Figure 1]. The percent changes for the controll group also increased over time, however those for the 0.4 M and 0.6 M groups remained relatively constant especially after 20 and 30 minutes [Figure 1]. The ANOVA tests concluded the following information: Fs = 4.02, d.f. = 3, p = 0.016. The only two pairs that were statistically different from each other were between 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M.

Discussion:
The significent data in the experiment (between 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M) supports the hypothesis which stated that higher salt concentrations would have lower percent changes. As a whole, the data could not support the hypothesis because not all of the data was significent. However, in regards to those two pairs of data, they are able to support the trend presented in the hypothesis. Salt stress affects plants through both osmotic and ionic stress. Osmotic stress is caused by a decrease in water availability and salt stress induces this through an excess amount of sodium ions [Sudhir: 2004]. When there are an excess of sodium ions outside of the cell, water will be pulled out in an attempt to balance the sodium ion concentrations in and out of the cell. This pulls water out of the cell and decreases the amount of water available for plants to use in metabolic processes, specifically photosynthesis. Ionic stress occurs because there is an excessive accumulation of sodium and chloride which reduces the uptake of other nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium that are necessary for the cell [Sudhir: 2004]. This excess amount of sodium can also inactivate enzymes and inhibit metabolic processes in plants, like photosynthesis [Sudhir: 2004]. Therefore, increased salinity of the chloroplast mixtures will decrease photosynthetic activity. This is translated by the data because the absorbances represent the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. The DCPIP is used since when it is reduced through photosynthesis, it becomes colorless. This will decrease the absorbance obtained. Therefore, higher percent changes represent higher photosynthetic activity.
The overall results were not expected because the only two significent groups out of the six tested were between 0.2 M and 0.4 M and 0.2 M and 0.6 M. It was predicted that all groups would demonstrate a trend that an increase in salt concentration would lead to a decrease in photosynthetic activity. The lack of significent data is most likely due to a small sample size. However, the results obtained from the significent data do support other studies which have concluded that salt stress has negatively affected photosynthetic activity in spinach. These two sets of data represent the experiment’s expected data. Researchers have discovered that salt accumulation in spinach leaves inhibits photosynthesis by negatively affecting the function of mesophyll cells. Reduction of mesophyll conductance that is observed with excess salt in plant leaves is associated with changes in leaf anatomy [Delfine: 1999]. In a specific study, salt accumulation caused a 25% reduction of the intracellular spaces in the mesophyll of spinach leaves which was believed to be responsible for the decreased photosynthetic activity associated with the low mesophyll conductance [Delfine: 1999]. Mesophyll cells are the primary location for chloroplasts in plant leaves, therefore if salt stress decreases intracellular spaces in these cells, then there will be a decrease in sites for photosynthesis to occur. Salt not only has an affect on water, but on other ions in a cell. A separate study discovered that salt accumulation caused a drop of calcium and magnesium which can decrease membrane stability and chlorophyll content [Delfine: 1998]. This would also have a negative effect on photosynthesis by disrupting the stability of the chloroplasts in the spinach leaf cells. This experiment proposes an idea of future study that could examine the overall function of spinach leaves and the effect of salinity rather than solely focusing on chloroplasts. This would allow for study of mesophyll cell function that has been seen to be impaired by salt stress in previously published studies.
