Title: The supplementation of azadirachtin to the diet of Manduca sexta does not significantly affect their weight

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta, a Tobacco Hornworm, naturally molts into a moth in roughly 39-48 days. Our experiment manipulated this molting cycle with the hormone blocking agent, azadirachtin. After supplementing the diet of an experimental group of Manduca sexta with azadirachtin, the two groups’, control and experimental, change in weight was studied. We predicted the experimental group, which was fed azadirachtin, would weigh more after seven days because it would continue to eat and gain weight as a caterpillar, with its lack of a commitment pulse and its inability to pupate. After feeding and weighing the caterpillars for seven days, it was found that the averages of each group’s difference in weight were not statistically different with a p-value of 0.054. After further research, we concluded that a possible trend in weight difference does occur in other similar experiments in which azadirachtin blocked the production of Ecdysterone, decreasing the weight of other insects due to a feeding inhibition from the change in ratio of 20E and JH. Further research on azadirachtin’s potential effects on the hormone balances of the Manduca sexta can increase productivity in the agricultural field.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta (commonly known as Tobacco Hornworms) are caterpillars that are considered pests in their larvae form. Hormones are largely in charge of controlling their developmental processes. Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that regulates the timing of molting for insects. It works with Juvenile Hormone (JH) to control the development of these Manduca sexta and their ratio with each other is important to their developmental process. [Johnson: 2016]. On the other hand, azadirachtin is an insect growth regulator (IGR) that blocks 20E. When added, this block will change 20E’s ratio with JH at a crucial point in their maturation, as a rise in 20E is necessary for a commitment pulse and a block prevents this. Their pupation depends on this commitment pulse. In another experiment, azadirachtin has been linked to causing the inability to molt and mortality in Locusta migratoria, which, similar to the Manduca sexta, is in the Insecta class [Sieber: 1982]. This allows us to believe they undergo similar maturation and would experience similar effects from the addition of azadirachtin to their diet. The lack of a commitment pulse and proper maturation could therefore account for the experimental group’s weight gain as it never undergoes pupation without its commitment pulse yet continues to eat and gain weight. Better understanding how 20E affects insect development and how azadirachtin interacts with it can aid in the agricultural industry. Therefore, will adding AzaMax (containing azadirachtin) to the diet of manduca sexta affect its weight? We predict weight will change because blocking 20E will change the concentration ratio of 20E with JH and block the commitment pulse, changing the weight as a result of the lack of pupation. In our experiment, the dependent variable we tested was weight of the caterpillars while the independent variable used was quantity of azadirachtin being fed to the caterpillars. I predict supplementing azadirachtin to the diet of the experimental group will cause them to weigh more because it will prevent them from pupating; however they will continue eating and therefore, growing. 

Materials and Methods:
We began with eight caterpillars, four named a control group and four in an experimental group. They were all fed 10 grams of food each. The control group’s food was supplemented with seven drops of water per 10 grams of food and the experimental group was supplemented with seven drops of AzaMax (concentration 1.25:1.00) per 10g of food. The caterpillars were weighed each day, their boxes cleaned out, and their food replenished when dried out or eaten. All caterpillars were kept in identical conditions and obtained from identical conditions. This process of evaluation and feeding was repeated for seven days. A two-sample t-test was used to determine if the difference in weight of the control group from the experimental group was meaningfully different. 

Results:
When analyzing both groups’ weight change, there were initial spikes in body weight the first few days. The control group, on average, weighed 4.150g+/- 2.757g more on day seven than day one and the experimental group weighed 1.188g more on day seven than on day one. In Figure 1, the two bars represent these two average weight differences and the error bars represent the standard deviations. Therefore, the control group found 4.150g+/- 2.757g and the experimental group found 1.188g+/- 1.492g. When utilizing a two-sample t-test, a p-value of 0.054 was found, a t-value of 1.887 was found, and 6 degrees of freedom were used. Using this data, we conclude that the control and experimental group are not statistically different from one another.

Discussion:
Based on our results, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no statistical difference in change in weight between an experimental group fed azadirachtin and a control group not fed azadirachtin. However, if this experiment were repeated, we might instead expect a statistically significant difference in weight between the experimental group fed azadirachtin and control group due to 20E’s change in ratio with JH, possibly causing feeding inhibition. This is potentially because previous research has shown feeding inhibition occurred after the locusta migratoria, another Insecta, was injected with doses of azadirachtin [Sieber: 1983]. The effects of azadirachtin shift the ratio of JH and 20E as it blocks 20E [Johnson: 2016], therefore altering the chemical balances in their bodies and changing their diet. This lack of diet caused the experimental group to gain much less weight than the control group because the concentration ratio shifted, altering their level of hunger. In the future, a replication of this study with differing quantities of azadirachtin added to the diet of caterpillars would be useful to test whether azadirachtin itself causes the lack of diet or if it is simply the quantity that the locusts in this experiment consumed that initiated their chemical imbalance. As hormones play a role in insect development, the blockage of them is equally responsible for their maturation. Discovering how to best manipulate and maintain these potentially pestful species can lead to bettering the crop yields of farmers and growers of plants these caterpillars cause harm to.

Figure 1. The effect of azadirachtin on Manduca sexta. Control group shows a higher average change in weight. The experimental group (AzaMax) shows a smaller average change in weight. Each group is an average of four caterpillars change in weight; the control group being fed water-supplemented food while the experimental group was fed azamax-supplemented food. The control group had a standard deviation of +/-2.757g while the experimental group had standard deviations of +1.492g and -1.190g.*************************************************************************
