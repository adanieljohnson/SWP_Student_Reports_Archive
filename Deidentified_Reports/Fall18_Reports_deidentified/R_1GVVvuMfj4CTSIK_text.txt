Title: The effects of pH on the rate of electron transfer in Spinacia oleracea leaves

Abstract:
Spinacia oleracea is a plant that carries out the process of photosynthesis through which sunlight is absorbed, resulting in ATP synthesis and electron storage as NADPH. While these two things are difficult to measure, the rate of transfer of electrons can be measured with DCIP and the Hill Reaction. It was hypothesized that if the reaction proceeds under acidic conditions, the rate of electron transfer will increase in spinach leaves. S. oleracea leaves were treated with basic and acidic conditions over a period of three thirty-minute time periods. Enriched chloroplasts were created in order to allow the reaction to occur. Conclusions were drawn based on the means of the controll and experimental condition absorbances. It can be concluded that there is a statistical difference between the means, leading the experimenter’s to accept their hypothesis and supporting the idea that in alkaline environments, there is a slower rate of electron transport, and ultimately lower rates of photosynthesis occurring.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants to store energy. Once light has been absorbed by chloroplasts, electrons become excited, causing a set of chemical reactions to occur. This series of chemical reactions, better known as the electron transport chain, involves a series of coupled oxidation reduction reactions. The first high energy electrons from NADH are donated to the first complex. Energy loss from the electrons passing through the electron transport chain complexes is converted to conformational changes in the proteins that allow proton pumping across the inner membrane to produce a proton gradient. These set of reactions results in ATP synthesis and electron storage as NADPH. These two are used in the Calvin cycle, where CO2 and ribulose phosphate are combined to create glucose [Iwasa: 2016].
	While ATP production and reduction of NADP+ are difficult to measure, the rate of transfer of electrons can be measured with DCIP (2,6-Dichlorophenolindophenol) and the Hill Reaction. Using this means of electron transfer rate measurement, other environmental and chemical conditions can be tested for their impact on the process [Cellular Biology Laboratory Manual]. It has been found that in land plants, the principle organs of photosynthesis are the leaves. Leaves have evolved to expose the largest possible area of green tissue to light and entry of CO2 to the leaf is controllled by small holes in the lower epidermis called stomata [Johnson: 2016].
	In this work, experimenters tested how acidic and basic conditions affect the photosynthetic rate of electron transfer. Spinacia oleracea, or spinach leaves, will act as the model organism due to the fact that they are easily accessible and have large leaves. Furthermore, S. oleracea is a leafy, green vegetable grown as an annual, making this model organism readily abundant to use. Treatment with either basic, neutral, or acidic pH buffer will act as the independent variable. DCIP is also integral to the reaction as the rate at which it is reduced can be utilized to measure the transfer rate of electrons. Furthermore, DCIP undergoes chemical rearrangement, resulting in a change from blue to clear when it is excited by an electron. Reaction conditions were held constant, proceeding under direct light and utilizing the spectrophotometer over three ten-minute intervals to record the absorbances. The percent change of the rate of electron transfer was able to be calculated, ultimately allowing the experimenters to determine the effects of pH on the rate of electron transfer. It was hypothesized that acidic conditions will result in a higher rate of electron transfer compared to that of the basic conditions in S. Oleracea. 


Materials and Method:
In order to obtain the enriched chloroplasts needed for the experiment, four Spinacia oleracea leaves were collected. The large central veins were removed and thrown away while the remaining leaf pieces were rinsed with tap water and dried off. Then, the pieces of leaf were placed in a pre-chilled mortar and pestle where 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added. The leaves were ground into a paste and an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added. Next, the spinach slurry was strained through three layers of cheese cloth into a chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “A”. This was spun at 1200 rpm with a balance for three minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was then poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 Ml centrifuge tube marked “B” and was spun at 2800 rpm for ten minutes at 4oC. The supernatant was poured out and the pellet at the bottom was kept for future use.
	It was discovered that an additional step was needed due to the fact that the acidic pH buffer changed the solution to a light pink color, as seen in Figure 1. After the second spin with “B”, 15Ml of reaction buffer (pH 6.5) was added to the pellet and was suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. After, the mixture was aliquoted into three 5 Ml volumes and was then placed in three small conical tubes in which 5 Ml of the reaction buffer was added to each. The tubes were spun again at 2800 rpm for ten minutes at 4oC. The pellet was then resuspended in 3 Ml of grinding buffer in order to concentrate the chloroplasts. These three tubes were used to place 100 uL into the ten test tubes.  
	Ten large test tubes were labeled Blank and 1through 9 while the enriched chloroplasts were being spun. The blank was prepared with 8 Ml of H2O, no DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 1 through 3, assigned for acidic conditions, were prepared with 6 Ml of H2O, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 6.5 buffer. Tubes 4 through 6, assigned for controll conditions, were prepared with 6 Ml of H2O, and 2 Ml of pH 3 buffer. Finally, tubes 7 through 9, assigned for basic conditions, were prepared with 6 Ml of H2O, 2 Ml of DCIP, and 2 Ml of pH 10 buffer. 
	The assay began when 10 uL of the prepared enriched chloroplasts was added to all of the tubes, including the blank. The tubes were immediately mixed after adding the chloroplasts and the mixtures were then transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Using a spectrophotometer set at 600 nm, the absorbance values were recorded for Time 0 and then the tubes were placed under direct light for ten minutes. After blanking the spectrophotometer, the absorbances were measured three additional times, placing the samples under direct light and waiting ten minutes in between each measurement. The percent change over time was then calculated for each set of absorbances. Two two-sample t_tests were employed to compare the means of the two pH conditions that were tested-acidic and basic conditions- to the controll condition which was a pH of 6.5. The average percent change for each rate of electron transfer reaction was noted. The results were plugged into the template provided to the experimenters in order for the results to be achieved. 


Results:
When the mean values were compared, the rate of electron transfer was significently different between that of the controll condition at pH 6.5 and the acidic condition at pH 3 (t_stat=7.410, p_value= 0.002). It must be noted that there was an outlier absorbance value that was recorded for Tube 2 at a pH of 3, 0.091nm, that was disregarded when calculating the standard deviation. Furthermore, the mean value for the rate of electron transfer was also significently different between that of the controll condition of pH 6.5 and the basic condition at pH 10 (t_state= 15.77, p_value= 0.001). Based on figure 2, it can be concluded that the acidic conditions at a pH of 3 had a higher electron transfer rate of -24.209% compared to basic conditions with an electron transfer rate of 6.05%. Figure 3 reveals that the absorbance values resulting from the reaction with acidic conditions had a much larger increase in values compared to the basic conditions. Furthermore, over the thirty-minute trial period, acidic absorbances decreased while basic absorbances increased (Fig. 3).

Discussion:
The results from the two, two-sample t_tests revealed that there was no correlation between basic or acidic conditions and the rate of electron transfer in S.Oleracea. The null hypothesis can be rejected due to the fact that the data was statically significent in highlighting the variances between the means of the two target groups. According to the data, basic conditions lead to a decreased rate of electron transfer whereas acidic conditions lead to an increased rate of electron transfer. As previously mentioned, an outlier existed in test tube 2 of the acidic condition. This absorbance value was removed but this outlier could have resulted from the fact that the pH buffer was added to the DCIP before the enriched chloroplasts were added. This ultimately means that the pH buffer and the DCIP had the chance to interact before the desired reaction with enriched chloroplasts could begin. To avoid this consequence in the future, the buffer should be added after the addition of the enriched chloroplasts, thus reducing the possibility of multiple interactions to occur.
	The absorbance values from the basic conditions could be utilized to highlight the fact that alkaline conditions impact the electron transfer rate, ultimately resulting in a decreased rate of transfer. Basic conditions are not favorable due to the fact that the electrons are not transferred as quickly which is why the color change happened at a slower rate. This could also help explain why the basic pH value absorbances increased over time trials. The acidic conditions reveal contrasting information and as electrons are being transferred, the rate of electron transfer is increasing. The color changes from clear to blue a lot faster which means that the electrons are being transported exponentially quicker. 
	Although these findings are important for consideration, it must be noted that enriched chloroplasts can only be applied so far. Most studies on the effects of pH on electron transport have been carried out with isolated thylakoids or chloroplasts as seen here, because it was not possible to measure pH across the thylakoid membrane in intact leaves. Further testing must be done in intact leaves in order to see the measure of pH across the thylakoid membrane [Schönknecht: 1995]. The photosynthetic electron transport inside an intact spinach leaf may be regulated at a different pH and this is worth further examination.
