Title:  Effects of Ecdysterone Inhibition on Growth in Length and Weight of Manduca sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The objective of the experiment is to determine how Azaguard, an Ecdysterone (20E) inhibitor, effects the larval growth of Manduca sexta, or the tobacco hornworm. 20E is a prominent hormone in many insects, mainly ones that go through metamorphosis. Because of this, there is great importance behind research in 20E and this experiment in particular. The effect of 20E blocking in Manduca sexta can be applied to many other insects in their molting behaviors and patterns. Our data suggests that the introduction of 20E inhibitors such as Azaguard, decrease the average weight and length of the larvae, Along with detrimental health effects to the larvae. The applications of our results can be used in the creation of new pesticides and other chemicals to combat insect infestations. Inversely, it also helps with biologists knowing how to take care of insects and keeping them unexposed to 20E inhibitors.
Introduction


Introduction:
In the experiment, the effects of Azaguard on Manduca sexta growth was tested.  Azaguard acts as a 20E inhibitor. 20E is a group of insect hormones that regulates times of molting and relies on transcriptional agents [Adams, Kingan: 2000]. Azaguard disrupts transcription inside insect cells and because of this, the lack of 20E means that pupation is impossible for the larvae treated with Azaguard. This particular molting between the larval and pupal stages are what the experiment focuses on. Pupation is caused by cellular changes in the epidermis of larvae, induced by 20E [Riddiford: 1977]. There are two doses of 20E that leads up to full pupation of Manduca sexta larvae. The first dose results in the discontinuation of larval feeding, while the second dose causes the pupation to begin [Riddiford: 1977]. Inversely, JH, or juvenile hormone is what induces different types of molts and functions while insects are in their larval stages. The right balance of JH and 20E is required to cause pupation. With this dependence between pupation and 20E, the hypothesis formulated states the that the larvae would not undergo pupation and, furthermore, the larvae would continue to grow as a result of continued eating, resulting in a larger average weight and length for the experimental group. 

Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were divided up into two groups of four larvae. Each group was separated into its own plastic container with four compartments. Each compartment housed one caterpillar. One group was given 10 grams of food along with 10 drops of water for each larva. All food and water is replaced in exact amounts to the nearest 100ths place after food and water is depleted. The other group was given 10 grams of food and 10 drops of Azaguard. All food and Azaguard was replaced when depleted. The food was weighed in a plastic boat on a standard lab balance, and both the water and Azaguard was transported using a micro-pipet. Every day the caterpillars were weighed (g) and measured (mm) by the researchers (excluding 4 days due to inclement weather). Each larva was weighed using a standard lab balance, and they were measured using a centimeter ruler. Statistical analysis of the data received throughout the experiment was done via two-sample t_tests. A two-sample t_test was conducted for both comparing weight and comparing length between the controll and experimental groups.



Results:
The average weight for the controll group was far larger than the average weight throughout the experiment for the experimental group, with the controll group’s average weight being 3.53g and the experimental group’s average weight being 1.16g throughout the experiment (Fig. 1). Similarly, the difference in average weight at the end of the final day is 4.17g (fig. 1). The difference in average weight began between day 5 and day 6 of recording data (fig 3). The standard deviation for the experimental weight is 0.20 and the standard deviation for the controll weight is 2.27. As with the weight, the controll group’s average length throughout the experiment is larger than the experimental group’s (47.71mm and 39.56mm respectively) (fig.2). The difference between the average length on the final day is 11.3 mm (fig.2).  The standard deviation of the lengths of the controll group was 9.68 and the standard deviation of the lengths in the experimental group was 4.14 (fig. 2). The 2-tailed p values for the two-tailed t_test conducted on length and weight respectively were 0.024 and 0.004. 

Discussion:
While the p_values collected indicate that the data is statistically significent, our null hypothesis is not rejected due to the fact that the low p_value indicates a significent difference in the experimental and controll group in either direction. Because the average weight and length of the experimental group treated with Azaguard was significently lower than the weight and length of the controll groups, the p_value was below 0.05. Our alternate hypothesis was that the experimental larvae would be much larger than the controll group in both weight and length. Because of this, we would see similar p_values between both scenarios. The controll group had significently larger average weights and lengths, and because of this, our alternate hypothesis that stated the group of larvae that was exposed to Azaguard would not pupate and continue to grow larger than the controll group cannot be supported. However, is important to note that, while our group was incorrect concerning the growth of the larvae, the experimental group had no pupations while all surviving organisms in the controll group did.  Also, interestingly, the standard deviation in the weights of both controll and experimental groups was relatively small to the experimental and controll length’s standard deviation. This is likely due to the difficulty in straightening the larvae out to measure them. Because at times this was impossible, many of the lengths recorded were likely inaccurate, resulting in a much higher standard deviation for both the controll and experimental group. Another setback in the experiment was our inability to access our lab during hurricane Florence. Because of this, we were unable to identify how quickly the drop in weight of our controll larvae experienced (fig.3).
