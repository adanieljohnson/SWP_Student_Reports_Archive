Title: Weight Change in Manduca sexta due to Precor-Methoprene

Abstract:
Hormones are signals used to communicate throughout an organism. In Manduca sexta, the hormone ecdysterone, regulates the timing of molting and juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt. Methoprene is a juvenile hormone analog. It was hypothesized that there will be a statistically significent difference between the amount of weight change between the Manduca sexta with 10 drops of precor-methoprene in their food compared to the controll group with no precor-methoprene in their food. There was a statistical significent difference between the average weight gained between the experimental and controll group (t_stat=2.81, d.f.= 6, p_value=0.031). This could be due to the action of methoprene to block the release of the hormone ecdysone.

Introduction:
Hormones are chemical signals produced in an organism that move to other parts of the organism. The model organism for this lab is the Manduca sexta, or more commonly known as the Tobacco Hornworm. In Manduca sexta, the release of the prothoraciotropic hormone by the corpus cardiacum in the brain sequentially ecdysone, released by the prothoracic glands, a hormone that regulates timing of molt is excreted. Another hormone in Manduca sexta is the juvenile hormone, released by the corpus allata in the foregut, regulates the type of molt. There are 5 larval instars that are separated by molts in Manduca sexta development. During the commitment pulse, juvenile hormone levels drop and ecdysone levels rise; this results in the pupation of the Manduca sexta. In a study looking at the controll of molting and metamorphosis in the Tobacco Hornworm, the continued presence of juvenile hormone inhibits the release of the prothoraciotropic hormone which controlls the release of ecdysone and thus the molting of the Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1974]. If the presence of high levels of juvenile hormone prevents the Manduca sexta from pupating it can be said that the presence of methoprene, a juvenile hormone analog, will prevent pupation in Manduca sexta [Harmon: 1995]. The prolonged larval stage will result in an increased weight due to the inability to pupate into an adult. It can then be hypothesized that there will be a statistically significent difference between the amount of weight change between the Manduca sexta with 10 drops of precor-methoprene in their food compared to the controll group with no precor-methoprene in their food.

Materials and Method:
First, two plastic containers with four compartments were obtained. Two holes were made using scissors on the outside of each compartment in order for the Manduca sexta to have an oxygen source. Then, one container was labeled controll and one experimental. Next, each compartment was labeled number one through four for both the controll and experimental containers. Ten grams of food was placed with zero drops of precor-methoprene and ten drops of distilled water in each controll container compartment. Disposable pipettes were used to place ten drops of precor-methoprene and ten drops of distilled water in ten grams of food. The food, precor-methoprene, and water were mixed well before placing the food in the compartments. Eight Manduca sexta were obtained; the weight of each Manduca sexta was recorded and they were placed in their designated compartments for 14 days. The containers with the Manduca sexta were placed in the incubator at 25 degrees Celsius. A two-sample two-tailed t_test was used to analyze the difference between the experimental and controll groups average weight gained across a fourteen-day period.

Results:
The Manduca sexta in the controll group had started pupating at day eleven, so the data for the controll group was limited to eleven days. Whereas, the experimental group never started to pupate, so the data presented difference. The data collection was interrupted for three days due to inclement weather, so there were points where the experimental group lost weight because they did not have enough food to eat. The mean weight gained by the controll group was less than the experimental group, as seen in Figure 1. The average weight gained by the controll group was 4.1025±0.83974 grams. The average weight gained by the experimental group was 8.7525±3.20567 grams. There was a significent difference between the average weight gained between the experimental and controll group (t_stat=2.81, d.f.= 6, p_value=0.031). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported; the p_value was less than 0.05. We can reject the null hypothesis because there was a statistically significent difference between the amount of precor-methoprene in the food and average weight gained in the controll and experimental groups of Manduca sexta. In a study looking at the action of juvenile hormone in Manduca sexta, it had been found that headless Manduca sexta development could be prevented by the daily injection of juvenile hormone [Safranek: 1980]. This resulted in the further weight gain of Manduca sexta [Safranek: 1980]. The juvenile hormone during the investigation accelerated the development of Manduca sexta even after brain removal, so they determined that the brain and prothoraciotropic hormone inhibition cannot be the sole targets of juvenile hormone [Safranek: 1980]. Further research needs to be done to investigate the targets of juvenile hormone in either ecdysone synthesis and secretion by the prothoracic gland, conversion of a-ecdysone to b-ecdysone, ecdysone inactivation and excretion or response at the cellular level to surrounding ecdysone [Safranek: 1980]. The investigation proved that the juvenile hormone analog, precor-methoprene, as well as other juvenile hormone analogs allow for the controll of pupation in Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta are pests when they are larvae, but preventing the larvae from developing into adults eliminates the possibility of reproduction. The addition of methoprene can result in the decrease of the pest Manduca sexta in agricultural fields.
