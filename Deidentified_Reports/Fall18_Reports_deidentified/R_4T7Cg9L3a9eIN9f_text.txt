Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Resource Allocation and its Resulting Phenotypic Expression in Vigna radiata.

Abstract:
This experiment's focus is resource allocation in plants, specifically sunlight and its effect on the growth of roots and shoots in Vigna radiata. Based on the functional equilibrium principle, plants grown in environments deprived of above-ground nutrients will allocate their resources into growing their shoots while plants deprived of below-ground resources will allocate their resources into growing their roots. V. radiata plants were grown in direct sunlight and as well as in the shade to restrict a vital resource. Root to shoot ratios were established for each after two weeks by separating the roots and shoots and measuring them independently for mass and length. A significent difference was found when comparing the ratios of plants in the shade compared to the plants in the sun for both mass (t_stat = 3.024, d.f. = 22, P = 0.003), and length (t_stat = 3.609, d.f. = 22, P = 0.001), supporting the functional equilibrium principal. The plants in the shade were deprived of an above ground resource and so they allocated the available resources into growing their shoots.


Introduction:
Plants survive through the uptake and use of the resources in their surrounding environments [Bazzaz: 2008]. Environments, however, differ in the nutrients they have available; some environments may have an ample amount of sunlight while lacking in nitrogen, while others may lack carbon dioxide but have plenty of water available. Therefore, another key to plant survival is the allocation of the available resources, or rather the specific distribution of the resources to promote the most efficient growth pattern [Bazzaz: 2008]. A model to explaining this phenomenon termed “functional equilibrium” holds that when plants experience a decrease in above ground nutrients, like sunlight or carbon dioxide, they allocate their resources into growing their shoots, the part of the plant that grows above ground. The same is true then for reverse, when plants experience a decrease in below ground nutrients, like nitrogen and other macromolecules, they distribute their resources to invest more energy into growing their roots, the portion of the plant that grows below ground [Poorter: 2000]. Previous studies have supported this model finding that changes in water, sunlight, and soil nutrients influenced the root to shoot ratio in a way that corresponded to the functional equilibrium [Poorter:200]. This study looks specifically at the effect of sunlight on resource allocation in V. radiata, commonly known as mung bean plants. V. radiata grows rapidly and also has distinctive roots and shoots making it a good model organism. It is hypothesized that the plants grown in a condition with more sunlight will have a greater root to shoot ratio because their resources will be allocated into growing their roots, while the plants grown in conditions with less sunlight will have a smaller root to shoot ratio because they will allocate their resources into growing their shoots. 


Materials and Method:
V. radiata seeds were soaked in water for 24 hours prior to the study. Four replicates were used, two pots for the shade environment and two pots for the light environment. All four pots were filled to the top with vermiculite. All four were then pre-watered with 50 Ml of water and 50 Ml of mir grow. In each pot, nine holes were made and each hole was filled with three seeds. All four pots were placed in the greenhouse which controllled for temperature. Two pots were placed in direct sunlight and the other two pots were placed under a black mesh tarp that created a shaded environment. The pots were watered daily for two weeks, each time using 100 Ml for each pot. After two weeks the plants were taken out of their pots, separated from one another and washed to remove excess dirt. Twelve plants from each condition were used, so twenty-four plants total. Each plant was cut where there was a change in color indicating a switch from root to shoot. The shoots were measured separately for length in centimeters and massed in grams. The same was done for the roots. The root to shoot ratio was then established for each plant individually and then used to calculate the mean ratio. A one-tailed two-sample unpaired t_test was then used to analyze the data, one test for the mass and one test for the length. 


Results:
The plants in both conditions grew well in the two week time frame. All plants appeared to be healthy and there were no obvious hindrances to overall plant growth based on the light condition in which they grew. Over all the plants grown in the light environment had a greater root to shoot ratio in respect to mass when compared to the shade environment plants (Figure 1). The difference in the root to shoot ratios when comparing mass was statistically significent (t_stat = 3.024, d.f. = 22, P = 0.003). Additionally, the plants grown in the light environment had a greater root to shoot ratio in respect to length (Figure 2). This difference in ratios is also statistically significent (t_stat = 3.609, d.f. = 22, P = 0.001).  

Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis that the plants grown in the shade will allocate their resources into growing their shoots more so than their roots. For both mass and length, the ratio of roots to shoots was smaller in the shaded plants than the ratio established for the plants in the sun. Based on the set up of the ratio, the roots served as the numerator while the shoots served as the denominator. Therefore, the plants with a larger shoot mass or greater shoot length will lead to a smaller ratio. From the ratios, it was determined that the difference between the root:shoot ratio when comparing plants in the sun versus plants in the shade was significent. We can therefore conclude that the plants in the shade allocated their resources differently from the plants in the sun, specifically that the plants in the shade allocated their resources into growing their shoots. Our results also align with the functional equilibrium [Poorter: 2000]. Sunlight is an above ground resource and in the case of the plants in the shade, the resource was reduced, and so resources were allocated to growing the shoots. In continuing to study resource allocation, a below ground resource should be the variable of experimentation, like nitrogen. The results of this experiment could confirm the counterpart of the functional equilibrium. Similar findings were reported in a paper studying plant evolution. Resource allocation, specifically in regards to sunlight, is used by plants when in competition for limited resources. The above ground competition results in the growth of more shoots to absorb the limited sunlight through resource allocation [Grime: 1997]. Those plants which are able to better allocate their resources stand to better their chances at survival. Resource allocation may, therefore, be a mechanism of plant natural selection and evolution.
