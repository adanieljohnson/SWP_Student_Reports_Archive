Title: The Use of Lidocaine in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana pipens caused Lower Muscle Contractions at Higher Stimuli 

Abstract:
Nerves stimulate muscle contractions when they are brought up to action potential. This occurs when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes sodium channels to open. The opening of these sodium channels allows sodium to flow in and generate an action potential of the muscle fiber. The opening of these sodium channels is required to get the cell to threshold to cause an action potential. In this experiment, the use of lidocaine was used in three Rana pipens legs to determine if the legs would have a lower response to the same stimulus used on frog legs that had been unaffected. A myogram was used to determine the levels of response and a paired t-test was run (t-stat=8.481, df=9, P=1.38E-05). The results of this test were significant, and the alternate hypothesis was accepted. This shows the importance of sodium and sodium channels in the action potential system in our cells. 

Introduction:
There are individual myofibers in vertebrates and invertebrates that are bound together by connective tissues to form functional groups called skeletal muscles. These skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons whose cell bodies are located in the grey matter of the spinal cord. These nerves stimulate muscle contractions when they are brought up to action potential. This occurs when nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction and cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then binds to a receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber and causes sodium channels to open. The opening of these sodium channels allows sodium to flow in and generate an action potential of the muscle fiber. The opening of these sodium channels is required to get the cell to threshold to cause an action potential. The spike threshold is logarithmically dependent on sodium channel density [Brett:2010]. Lidocaine is a drug that inhibits the opening of sodium channels. In this experiment, lidocaine was used in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana. It was hypothesized that if lidocaine was introduced into the gastrocnemius muscle, there would be a much lower response to the same stimuli used on an unaffected gastrocnemius muscle. 

Materials and Methods:
There were three Rana pipens legs that were used in this lab, and they were first all prepared to complete the experiment. The skin of the leg was grabbed at the top and pulled off in the direction of the frog’s foot. A dissecting probe was used to separate the inner thigh muscles, starting at the top of the leg moving down towards the knee. At this point the sciatic nerve was revealed and the it was gently freed from its attaching connective tissue. The sciatic nerve was not pulled to tightly, exposed too far down toward the knee, or exposed to metal during this procedure. The gastrocnemius muscle was then separated from the bone. The muscle was then cut at the lower end with scissors, making sure to include some of the achilleas. The achilleas was then tied right where it met with the gastrocnemius muscle and hung so the muscle was at 90 degrees. The sciatic nerve was then put on the probes and stimulated with different stimuli; 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0. The legs were kept moist with frog ringer’s solution. A myogram was used to determine the muscles response at each stimulus. This was done for all three legs and then they were injected with 1mL of lidocaine directly into the gastrocnemius muscle. They then went through the same experiment again. A paired t-test was used to determine significance of the experiment. 

Results:
There was a significant difference between the control average and the experimental average (t-stat=8.481, df=9, P=1.38E-05). It took longer for the experimental group to respond to the stimulus (Table 1). When the experimental group legs started to respond, the values were significantly lower than that of the control group (Figure 1). The average values of response were also higher among the control group than the experimental group (Figure 2).

Discussion:
The results of the t-test show the data collected in this experiment were significant and the alternate hypothesis was accepted. The reasons the trends that were observed can be explained is due to the use of lidocaine in the gastrocnemius muscle. The results show that lidocaine did not completely block all of the sodium channels from opening. An action potential was eventually reached because some sodium channels remained open and a threshold level of excitation was reached [Brett:2010].  If less sodium channels are open, it will be harder for the cell to depolarize enough to cause an action potential, so a higher stimulus is required to create a response in the experimental group. The cells were less depolarized in the experimental group, which meant when the cells created the action potential the response would be lower. This experiment could be done again using a larger amount of lidocaine to see if there is a base number of sodium channels that would not be affected, or if there is a way to keep the leg from giving a response at all.
