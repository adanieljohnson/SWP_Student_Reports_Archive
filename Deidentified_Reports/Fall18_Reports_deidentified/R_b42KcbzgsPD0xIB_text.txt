Title: Higher pH Environment Increases Photosynthetic Activity

Abstract:
	In this experiment, we made an enhanced chloroplast from Spinacia oleracea and observed the Hill reaction to determine the rate of photosynthetic activity via measuring the rate of photosynthetic reduction. We enhanced the chloroplasts through a series of grinding the leaves, spinning them in a centrifuge, and suspending the remaining pellets. The Hill reaction creates an electron acceptor, NADP+, which is reduced at the end of the photosynthetic process to NADPH. We used the Hill reaction to measure photosynthetic rate because the quicker the final electron acceptor is reduced, the quicker the rate of photosynthetic activity. We altered the pH of the spinach solution to see how this affected photosynthetic rate, as environmental changes (such as changes in pH) can affect photosynthetic rate by changing the organismâ€™s primary productivity, which is the amount of energy converted into usable energy by that organism. We measured photosynthetic rate via absorbances in a spectrophotometer by putting DCIP in the spinach mixture. A lower absorbance means higher photosynthetic rate, because when DCIP is reduced at the end of the Hill reaction, it becomes colorless which leads to a lower absorption. We hypothesized that a higher relative pH solution would result in higher photosynthetic

Introduction:
	All living organisms undergo a process that extracts energy from external sources; plants create energy from light via photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide, water, and light from the environment reach the thylakoid membrane of the plant, which causes the molecules to split in to molecular oxygen and water. This light energy is stored and released via glycolysis in the cytoplasm of the cell [Barth: 2015].  Photosynthesis undergoes a REDOX reaction, which is when electrons are transferred through a system called an electron transport chain from one molecular complex to the next [Chaudhry: 2018]. The electrons remaining from the carbon dioxide and water travel through the electron transport chain. In this lab, we will observe the Hill Reaction, which is a process of electron transport in the presence of chloroplasts in light [Arnon:  1956]. A spectrophotometer will be used to collect data in the experiment by measuring absorbance of the solutions. The spectrophotometer determines absorption by measuring the protons absorbed when a light with the wavelength of 600nm passes through the solution [Nilapwar: 2011]. In this specific experiment, the absorbance of DCIP is being measured in the spectrophotometer, as it functions as the final electron acceptor in the Hill reaction of photosynthesis. The more photosynthetic activity there is in the solution, the lower the absorbance will be due to DCIP becoming reduced and made colorless [Johnson: 2018]. DCIP is typically used to measure photosynthetic activity because, as photosynthesis occurs in the enhanced chloroplasts, DCIP turns into DCIPH2 (a final electron acceptor) due to reduction from excess hydrogen from the electron transport chain and the splitting of water. In this experiment, we hypothesize that a higher relative pH (less acidic environment) will result in a quicker formation of DCIPH2; therefore, higher photosynthetic activity. This question could tell us more what ideal environments are for optimal photosynthetic activity, and how this study could apply to other plants as well.

Materials and Methods:
	We packed a mortar and pestle, one 150 mL beaker, and 3, 50 mL centrifuge tubes into crushed ice and let it cool. While these were cooling, we removed the main veins from four medium sized spinach leaves, rinsed the remaining leaves with tap water, and dried any excess water. Once the mortar and pestle were cool, we wiped them dry and added the spinach leaves. We then added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer and grinded the spinach until it is thick and blended. After this, we added 10 more mL of grinding buffer to the spinach mixture and strained all of the spinach mixture through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We took this filtered mixture and transfer 200 microliters of it into a microtubule and ice it. After this, we took the remaining mixture and transfer it to a chilled, 50 mL centrifuge tube and spin it at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We poured this supernatant into a separate, chilled, 50 mL centrifuge tube and removed 200 microliters of liquid from this 50 mL tube and stored it on ice. After this, we centrifuged the 50 mL tube with the chloroplast suspension at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We then took this supernatant and put it in a separate 50 mL tube and placed it on ice. After this, we added 200 mL of grinding buffer to the pellet and suspended it, transferred 200 microliters of this pellet into a microtubule and iced it. After this step, we added 4 mL of pH3 buffer to one centrifuge tube, 4 mL of pH 5 buffer to another centrifuge tube, and 4 mL more of grinding buffer to the last centrifuge tube. The grinding buffer served as the control. We centrifuged these at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius, then resuspended the pellets with 20 mL grinding buffer after pouring out the supernatant. We then transferred 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuge tubes, separated them into 9 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube as the blank. We added 6 mL of distilled water to all the tubes, and 8 mL of water to the control. Then, we added 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP to all experimental tubes and 2 mL reaction buffer to all the tubes. Each tube sat for 10 minutes, and we measured absorbance at 600nm. We measured absorbance again after 20 and 30 minutes. We conducted an ANOVA test using our raw data, and the alpha value was 0.05.  

Results:
Our results show the relation between varying pH values and time, because absorbances were measured every ten minutes for a total of thirty minutes. This bar graph shows the percent change in absorbance over time, which shows the rate of photosynthetic activity. The larger the percent change over time correlates to a larger change in photosynthetic activity over time, which was dependent on varying pH values of the solution. The data was used to conduct an ANOVA test with 8 degrees of freedom, which gave us an f-ratio value of 0.526 and a p-value of 0.616, which means our results were not significant. A Tukey-Kramer test was used to confirm that the results between the experimental and control groups were not significant. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups.  

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was rejected because our data was not statistically significant, which is proven by our p-value of 0.616 being greater than the alpha of 0.5. This means that more protons would not be released by photosynthesis, which is indicated by the little percent change in absorption which was analyzed by the spectrophotometer. Since a lower absorbance means that the chloroplasts were more active and therefore had a higher photosynthetic activity, we found that the pH 3 solution had higher photosynthetic activity because it had a higher percent change [Figure 1]. We know this because the DCIP, when reduced, is colorless [Noorudeen: 1982]. In REDOX reactions, specifically the Hill Reaction, a reduced product is formed. Since the DCIP is colorless when it is reduced into DICPH2, we believe that the chloroplasts were active and that there was high photosynthetic activity because the solution had a low absorbance. However, since our p-value was 0.616, our results are insignificant. Our results had large error margins as well, which could be due to an inaccurate waiting time between measuring absorbance in the spectrophotometer. The wavelength of the spectrophotometer could have impacted the results as well, saying that photosynthesis is significantly influenced by light and certain wavelengths. Previous studies led us to believe that a more acidic, photosynthetic environment would lead to destruction of some photosynthetic apparatus [Kramer: 1999]. However, while we saw the greatest percent change in the pH 3 solution (the more acidic solution), our results were not significant. A prerequisite for functioning well at a low pH is the reduction of the proton influx paired with an increase in proton pump efficiency [Gross: 2000]. For our sample to thrive more in the pH 3 solution, these functions would have to take place. It is possible that the chloroplasts in our spinach leaves did not have a reduction of proton influx and an increase in proton pump efficiency, which would explain the unreliable data we collected. In future studies, we could test plants that grow in more or less acidic environments and measure how acidic or how basic the environment can be until photosynthetic activity is decreased, using similar methods to our experiment. Other environmental effects, such as high concentrations of metals and precipitation of certain nutrients, could cause unexpected effects on a plant in regard to acidity as well [Gross: 2000]. Our results and those of previous studies lead us to believe that, upon repeating this experiment with different plants or performing the spectrophotometer analysis with more accuracy, we could obtain more significant, thorough results.
