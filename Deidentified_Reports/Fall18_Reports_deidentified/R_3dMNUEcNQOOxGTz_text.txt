Title: The Influence of 20E on Manduca Sexta Development

Abstract:
Abstract: Ecdysterone (20E) is a hormone that controlls the timing of molting in insects and regulate various other functions in adults. This experiment tested the effects of a high dosage of ecdysterone blocker on the growth rate and pupation in the caterpillar, Manduca sexta. I hypothesized that a high dosage of 20E blocker would cause Manduca sexta caterpillars to grow at a slower rate than those not treated with any hormone blocker. To conduct this experiment, my lab group used eight different caterpillars with four in the controll group and four in the experimental group in order to have four replicates for each group. The controll group received 10g of food with 10 drops of water in it and the experimental group received 10g of food with 10 drops of Aza Guard, the 20E blocker, in it. The caterpillars were weighed daily. The hypothesis was statistically supported from the findings of this experiment (P = 0.04). The data gathered from the experiment showed that caterpillars given a high dosage of 20E blocker will grow slower than those that do not receive it.


Introduction:
Introduction: The development, molting, and pupation of insects is controllled by the hormones such as prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), ecdysterone (20E), and juvenile hormones (JH). My lab focuses on the effect of 20E. 20E is secreted by prothoracic glands, groups of cells in the back of the insect’s head and thorax. 20E most specifically regulates the timing of an insects molting and regulates other functions in adult insects. The metamorphosis of insects treated with high amounts of ecdysterone inhibitor is halted. Blocking 20E in insects can cause the them to become pupal-adult intermediates [Socha: 1972]. Manduca sexta, or tobacco hornworm, has a holometabolous life cycle in which they go through the process of molting, pupation, and finally metamorphosis to complete its development. The blockage of ecdysterone slows the caterpillar’s completion of their developmental cycle. Therefore, the blockage of 20E must lead to a delayed growth pattern in these caterpillars, causing them to reach pupation at a slower rate or never reaching pupation at all. Rather, they would exist as a “pupal-adult intermediary” or die as a result of not receiving a sufficient amount of the hormones needed for development. Based off of Socha’s experiment and knowledge of the effect of growth hormones on insects, my group hypothesized that if Manduca sexta caterpillars are given a high dosage of 20E blocker they will grow at a slower rate than Manduca sexta caterpillars that are not given a dosage 20E blocker. 


Materials and Method:
Method: Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were kept in clear, plastic containers for the duration of two weeks. Each container was subdivided into 4 compartments to house individual caterpillars. Each compartment had 2 holes poked into it for air and was labeled #1-#4 to label the individual caterpillar. The two containers were labeled either controll or experimental. Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were randoMly selected for this experiment. 4 were determined to be in the experimental group and 4 were determined to be in the controll group. The experimental caterpillars were individually weighed in grams and then placed into their selected labeled compartments in the experimental container. The experimental group received 10 grams of food with 3 drops of Aza Guard, a 20E blocker, placed into it using a pipette. The food and hormone mixture were rolled into a ball and placed in the caterpillar’s compartments. The controll group received 10 grams of food with 10 drops of tap water placed into it using a pipette. This food was also rolled up into a ball and placed in the controll caterpillar’s containers. The caterpillars were kept in an incubator for the duration of the experiment. Over the course of two weeks, lab group members came to the lab every day to weigh the caterpillars, record observations, and check on the caterpillar’s food. Food was replaced only when it felt dry to the touch or was depleted. A two sample one tailed T-test was carried out in order to determine if the difference in growth, measured in grams, between the controll group and the experimental group was statistically significent. The values used in the T-test were the average of the controll group’s weight and the average of the experimental group’s weight for a single day.

Results:
Results: The mean value for the controll group was 5.50 ± 1.77 grams while the mean value for the experimental group of caterpillars was 4.46 ± 0.86 grams overall. The mean weight value for the controll group was statistically significently greater than the experimental group (t_stat = 1.84, d.f. = 22, P = 0.04). The caterpillars in the experiment greatly fluctuated in weight. During the first week the caterpillars were much more responsive than in the second week, squirming around when they were picked up and weighed. Day five of the experiment marked the peak weight of both the controll and the experimental group. On this day, the average weight of the controll group reached 8.81g and the average weight of the experimental group reached 5.32g. After this peak in weight, caterpillars in both the controll and experimental groups began to lose weight. By day ten, 3 out of 4 of the controll caterpillars has pupated while none of the experimental caterpillars had. On the last day of the experiment, all four of the controll caterpillars had pupated. None of the experimental caterpillars pupated. Three of the experimental caterpillars were a yellow-green color but turning brown. All of them were extremely unresponsive and lethargic. The fourth caterpillar in the experimental group was dead on the final day of the experiment.  


Discussion:
Discussion: My hypothesis, that Manduca Sexta caterpillars given a high dosage of 20E blocker will grow at a slower rate than those not given it, was statistically supported by this experiment. The results of this experiment show that the caterpillars given 20E blocker will develop slower than the ones not given it and as a result, not pupate at the same time. In the natural development of insects, there is a spike of 20E at each instar. Giving insects a high dosage of Aza Guard, which blocks or inhibits 20E, makes them grow at a decreased rate. The controll group grew at a quicker rate and grew heavier than the experimental group (Fig. 1). The controll group also had a larger difference between the average weight of the caterpillars at Day #1 than at Day #5, the day of maximum average weight for both controll and experimental groups (Fig. 2). 20E controlls development in insects, specifically the timing of their molting. A decrease of 20E, disrupts the system and causes the caterpillar to stay in juvenile state. This decrease of 20E leads to the existence of the pupal-adult intermediates of the insect species [Socha: 1972]. This is because the insects are still developing but they do not have the hormone available to pupate and become a full adult. The results from the experiment, along with the two tailed one sample T-test, supported the hypotheses because the results were statistically significent. These results correspond with the information from the Socha (1972) article. Our Manduca sexta experiment occurred during the time Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina. A possible source of error in this experiment was that my lab group was not able to check and weigh the caterpillars every day because the school was closed as a result of the hurricane. We are missing three days of data, which has the possibility to alter the results of the experiment. Another possible source of error was that the weights of the caterpillars selected varied greatly from the onset. In repeating this experiment, one should select caterpillars that all start at a weight within a gram of one another. In future research, it would be interesting to look at the effect of seasons and climate on the artificial pupation of insects. Most insects develop during a certain time of year. Therefore, a good experiment would be to test if the temperature in which the ecdysterone inhibitor is given or the environmental conditions the caterpillars are raised in effect their maturation rates.
