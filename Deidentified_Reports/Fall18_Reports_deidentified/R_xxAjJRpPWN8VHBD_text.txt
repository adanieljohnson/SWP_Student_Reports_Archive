Title: The Negative Effects of Acidic Water on the root-shoot ratio of the Buckwheat Plant

Abstract:
Plants must have an even ratio of nutrients and light to function properly, if this is unbalanced they must allocate their resources to grow either more stems or roots to make up for the limited resources. The root-shoot ratio will be considered at a steady-state when the plant has achieved a more structural ratio either by its length of roots and shoots or by weight. Acid rain is a result of air pollution that causes there to be a lack of nutrients in the soil. It is hypothesized that if the experimental group receives an extremely acidic water (pH of 3.5) the root-shoot ratio will be smaller in those plants than the controll group receiving regular water that is already slightly acidic. Two groups of the buckwheat seeds were formed each with 3 pots containing 12 seeds in each. The controll group was given regular water while the experimental was given acidic water with a pH of 3.5. After conducting a two-sample t test, the results were shown to not prove the hypothesis. The results were insignificent, meaning there was not much of a difference between the average R:S growth of the experimental group versus the controll group. 

Introduction:
Plants require nutrients from within the soil as well as sufficient light in order to survive within its surrounding. Their ability to use the resources depends on things like climate, pH levels and the oxygenation of soil. When resources are limited plants have adapted by having a pattern in which they distribute and use those limited resources, this is known as plant allocation. Plants must have an even ratio of nutrients and light to function properly, if this is unbalanced they must allocate their resources (phenotypic plasticity) to grow either more stems or roots to make up for the limited resources [Tilman: 1988]. The root-shoot ratio will be considered at a steady-state when the plant has achieved a more structural ratio either by its length of roots and shoots or by weight. Acid rain is one of many things that could cause a plant to have limited nutrients. Acid rain comes from air pollution and sources like sulfure dioxide and nitrogen oxide. These chemicals can produce stronger acids (pH of about 3.0-4.5) and therefore a lack of nutrients within the soil [Menz:2004]. Based on the information, it is hypothesized that if the experimental group receives an extremely acidic water (pH of 3.5) the root-shoot ratio will be smaller in those plants than the controll group receiving regular water that is already slightly acidic. 

Materials and Method:
Several buckwheat seeds were placed into a cup of water and were soaked for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, six black 4x4in. pots were obtained and filled with vermiculite. The pots were then separated into two groups (each containing 3 pots), the ‘controll’ group receiving water, and the ‘experimental’ group receiving water with an added pH of 3.5. Once the pots were watered, (the first day both groups received water to begin germination of seeds) about 50 Ml of miracle grow was added to each pot. In order to allow space for the seeds, twelve (4x3) small holes were made into each pot. Once the seeds have been soaked for 30 minutes, one seed was placed into each hole previously made in each pot and covered up with the soil. The two groups were then placed into the greenhouse and were watered daily until soil was dampened (experimental receiving the acidic water). After about two weeks of allowing the plants time to germinate and grow, the R:S ratio was taken for the length and weight of the plants. The results were then recorded and interpreted using a two-sample t_test. 



Results:
After conducting a two-sample t test, the data was shown to have no significent difference. The p value was greater than 0.05 (p value = 0.6985, t value=0.4163, d.f.=4). This is shown in figures 1. And 2. being that the experimental group did not have much differences in values compared to the controll group. 



Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported, the differences between the experimental and the controll groups were not significently different being that the p value was over 0.05 (p value= 0.6985, t value= 0.4163, d.f.= 4). This meaning the experimental group did not show much difference in growth in comparison to the controll group. Due to the results being close in ratio, the experiment did not help show if the more acidic water had an effect on the R:S ratio. However, in an experiment conducted to see the effects of acid rain (low pH levels) on soil nutrients, their results proved that low pH values led to a reduction in soil strength [Menz: 2004]. Places of errors that could have contributed to the experiment not having a significent difference could be that when watering the plants, the group that was receiving the acidic water was not watered for a couple of days due to the acidic water supply running out. This could have potentially affected the amount of time the experimental group had to react to the acidic water. It would also be wise to have more replicates in the future in order to have better averaging results. For future experiments I would like to test different amounts of acidic water to see how much of an affect different levels of acidity would have on the nutrients available to plants. In order to have a better understanding on long term effects of a changing global climate and the affects of soil nutrients, it would be essential to conduct experiments related to testing acidic levels in the soil and its effect on the plants overall. This will help us have an understanding on the factors controllling biomass allocation in order to prevent plants inability to adapt to its harsh environments and in the end unable to survive. Acid rain can cause nutritional imbalance which can ultimately decrease the plants ability to adjust to fit its needs if there is an extreme case of acidity within the soil. the effects of acid rain on soil will become more dangerous if the rainwater continues to be polluted by heavy industrialization [Ericsson: 1995].
