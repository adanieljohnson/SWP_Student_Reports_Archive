Title: Effect of Nitrogen Supplementation on Field Pea (Pisum sativum) Growth

Abstract:
In ecological communities, organisms encounter biotic and abiotic factors. Plants interact frequently with abiotic factors like nitrogen and oxygen. Plants must adequately allocate these resources as they are limited. Though allocation has basis in genetics, organisms are capable of modifying their allocation pattern, and subsequently their phenotype, based on environmental factors, a trait called allocation plasticity. Our study sought to determine if there were any effects of nitrogen supplementation on the growth of field peas (Pisum sativum). It was hypothesized that nitrogen supplementation to Pisum sativum would have an effect on the growth of the plant. In this experiment, two groups were created, one experimental and one control. Each group was composed of three pots, each pot containing 12 individual plants. Every pot in the experimental group was watered with 100mL nitrogen solution, while every pot in the control group was only watered with 100mL water. After two weeks, the root:shoot ratio of 12 plants from each group was calculated. The results found that addition of nitrogen had a significant effect on the length of the plants but not on their weight. Therefore, our hypothesis was somewhat supported. 

Introduction:
In any ecological community, organisms interact with one another. These environmental stimuli that originate from other organisms are called biotic factors, while those that arise from non-living factors like wind are abiotic factor [Johnson: 2018]. Nutrients are essential for plants to grow and live, but are not unlimited. This resource limitation affects which species are present in a community, and organisms must use trade-offs in expense of energy and resources when determining resource allocation. Resource allocation is the pattern which a species uses to distribute its limited resources [Johnson: 2018]. While this pattern is genetically determined, it is not inflexible, organisms can modify this pattern in response to different abiotic factors. Allocation plasticity differs among species, as some have greater tolerance for adaptation than others. Phenotypic plasticity is a property that characterizes how organisms allocate resources based on environmental conditions [Johnson: 2018]. Plants don’t pull resources out of existing tissues to another, but the growth pattern will change over time in order to modify new growth. In plants, resources for growth are divided into those acquired above and below ground. The shoots of plants, which include the leaves and the stems, capture sunlight for photosynthesis and support, while the roots serve as the absorptive organ for nutrients like nitrogen and water [Johnson: 2018]. One way to measure allocation in plants is the root and shoot ratio where the biomass of the root is divided by that of the shoot. The relative allocation of biomass can indicate the ability of a plant to allocate resources in a given environment [Johnson: 2018]. In a previous study, it was found that nitrogen supply had a significant stimulatory effect on shoot dry matter production of sunflowers, supporting the possible effects of additional nitrogen to plant growth [Cechin: 2004]. In this lab, we tested the effect of a nitrogen solution on the resource allocation of field peas (Pisum sativum). I hypothesized that the addition of nitrogen would have an effect on the growth of the plant.


Materials and Methods:
We had two groups of field peas, one experimental and one control group, each of which was comprised of three pots. Each pot contained up to 12 individual plants. The experimental group of plants was treated with nitrogen solution, while the other, the control, was only given water. Over the course of two weeks we watered each group with its associated solution: 100mL nitrogen solution for the experimental group and 100mL water for the control. After two weeks, we took each group and placed them in a large tray. We laid out paper towels for each group and labeled nitrogen (N) on one side and control (C) on the other side of the paper. We then took one bin of the experimental group, washed all of its plants in water to remove the vermiculite they were grown in, and selected four individual plants. This was done for the other bins in the experimental group, for a total of 12 experimental plants used. The plants were then placed on the paper towels while being weighed and measured. Scissors were used to separate the roots from the shoot at the base of the seed. The mass of the root and shoot were then weighed and recorded, and the length of each of these were measured and recorded. This process was repeated for the control group, with 12 individual plants being weighed and measured. We then calculated the root:shoot ratio using Microsoft excel, as well as the root:shoot mean and standard deviation. A two-tailed paired t-test was also used on the data.


Results:
When performing the paired two-tailed t-test, the results for the length were significantly different (t-stat = 4.49, df = 22, P =0.000184), while the results for the weight were not (t-stat = 0.97, df = 22, P = 0.342).  From Figure 1 we can see that the experimental nitrogen group had a lower R:S ratio than the control group for both the length and the width.


Discussion:
From Figure 1, we can see that the experimental nitrogen group had a lower R:S ratio for the length than the control group. This suggests that the nitrogen group didn’t have to grow longer roots as nutrients were easily made available for them to grow, while the control group had to grow longer roots in order to find sufficient nitrogen. The results of the t-test for the length were significant, suggesting that the addition of nitrogen had an effect on the growth of the plant. This result is similar to that of Schulze and Ehleringer [1984] who found that saplings with higher nitrogen content showed growth rates that were sevenfold times greater than those with lower nitrogen content [Schulze: 1984]. The experimental nitrogen group had a lower R:S ratio for the weight, suggesting that the control group had to grow larger or more numerous roots in order to find sufficient nitrogen compared to the experimental nitrogen group. The t-test values for the weight were not significant, suggesting the addition of N may not have had a significant effect on the plant as hypothesized. Therefore, our hypothesis was somewhat supported.
