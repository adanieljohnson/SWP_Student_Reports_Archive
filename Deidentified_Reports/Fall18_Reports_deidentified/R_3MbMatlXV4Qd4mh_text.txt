Title: The effects of acidic and basic conditions on the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to test the effects of varying pH levels on the rate of photosynthesis in the species Spinacia oleracea. The hypothesis is that if the chloroplasts of the spinach are placed in acidic and basic conditions, the rate of photosynthesis will decrease as indicated by low absorbances. Photosynthesis occurs within an organelle known as a chloroplast, and it requires a multi-step process that includes both light-dependent and independent reactions. In order to test the productivity of the chloroplasts under acidic, basic, and neutral pH conditions, they had to be isolated from the spinach. The chloroplast mixtures were placed into their respected environments and their absorbances were measured at ten minute intervals. A decrease in absorbances would indicate a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. The percent changes between each interval could then be recorded. An ANOVA test was used to test for statistical significance. We found that there was no significance in the difference in the rates of photosynthesis between the different environments. As a result, we were able to conclude that our hypothesis was not supported by our results. 

Introduction:
Plants, protists, and bacteria undergo a process known as photosynthesis which captures and stores light energy from the sun. Carbon dioxide and water react to create glucose, water, and oxygen in photosynthesis [Johnson: 2018]. The process is composed of both light dependent and independent reactions. As a brief overview, the process can more simply be described as follows. The beginning stages of the process involves chlorophylls to capture solar energy and the conversion into chemical energy [Arthur, Strehler: 1956]. This is part of the light-dependent reactions. The captured light excites electrons into a higher energy state (excited state) and as a result, trigger a reaction that ultimately cleaves water [Johnson: 2018]. This then creates a proton gradient which provides the energy for ATP synthesis while remaining electrons are kept as NADH. Another part of the light-independent reactions involves electrons from NADPH and ATP to be captured to create the final product of six glucose molecules. In addition, the electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts can be measured by using a process called the “Hill Reaction.” Electron transport chains in chloroplasts pass off electrons, typically to NADP+, and when they go to various other electron acceptors, we can measure the other acceptors more easily. For example, DCIP is a good alternative electron acceptor to base measurements off of as its original blue color becomes clear as it accepts electrons. In this experiment, we will be using DCIP to help gauge and measure if the rate of photosynthesis is affected over time when exposed to acidic, neutral, and basic conditions. The hypothesis is that if the chloroplasts of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) are separately placed in an acidic (pH of 5) environment and a basic (pH of 10) environment, then we will see lower absorbances, indicating that the rate of photosynthesis is decreasing.


Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, there were two separate exercises. In the first exercise, we had to cool a mortar and pestle, a medium (150-250mL) beaker, and three 50mL centrifuge tubes in crushed ice. Meanwhile, we had to remove the large central veins form four medium sized leaves, throw the veins away, and rinse the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. The leaves then had to be dried off. After the mortar and pestle was cooled, they had to be dried before the spinach was added. Then, 10mL of cold grinding buffer was added to grind the spinach leaves until it was a thick paste. Another 10mL of grinding buffer was added to the spinach paste and then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the cooled beaker. Next, 200 microliters of the filtered liquid in the beaker had to be put into a microtubule and labeled “Sample of A” then put on ice. The remaining green liquid was then put into a chilled 50mL centrifuge marked “A” and spun in at 1200 rpm for three minutes at 4˚C with a balance tube. The supernatant was then poured out of tube marked “A” and into a second chilled 50mL centrifuge tube marked “B.” However, the debris at the bottoms of “A” was not transferred.  A 200-microliter sample of the liquid from the 50mL tube marked “B” was removed and placed into a microtubule labeled “Sample of B” and put on ice. The 50mL tube B was then centrifuged at 2800 rpm for ten minutes at 4˚C. The supernatant was then poured into a 50mL tube marked “C” without removing the pellet. Tube B was then put on ice. 15mL of grinding buffer was then added to the pellet and suspended by being stirred gently. 200 microliters of the re-suspended pellet were transferred into three, 5mL volumes and put into three conical tubes. We then added 5mL of pH buffer to each tube before they were spun again at 2800 rpm for ten minutes at 4˚C. The re-suspended pellets were then mixed with 3mL of grinding buffer after spinning. We then removed 200 microliters from Tube “C” and placed it into a microtubule labeled sample of C and put on ice. We then began exercise two by labeling 13 large test tubes 1-12 and one was labeled “blank,” and placed in a tube rack. The following tubes had to be created. The single tube labeled blank only had 8mL of water, and 2mL of the reaction buffer. Tubes 1-3 contained 6mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, and 2mL of the reaction buffer. Tubes 4-6 had 6mL water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Tubes 7-9 had 5mL of water, 2mL of 130mM DCIP, 2mL of the reaction buffer, and 1mL of pH buffer 5. Tubes 10-12 had 5mL of water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL of the reaction buffer, and 1mL of pH buffer 10. After preparing the tubes, 100 microliters of enriched chloroplasts from exercise 1 (tube C) were added to the blank tube and tubes 4-12. Each were immediately mixed after adding the chloroplasts. The mixtures were then transferred to spectrometer cuvettes. The spectrometer was blanked with the blank sample cuvette and the absorbances of all the samples were measured at time zero. The samples were then all placed under a grow light for 10 minutes before their absorbances were measured again. This process was repeated two more times and the results were recorded. An ANOVA statistical test will be used for this experiment.  


Results:
The ANOVA test indicated that there was no significance in the difference in percent changes (df = 3, p-value = 0.704). Figure 1 shows that the smallest percent change occurred in the environment with no chloroplasts. Conversely, the largest percent change occurred in the acidic environment, as the standard error bars are the biggest (60.40+/- 102.366). In comparison, the percent change in the basic environment (28.20+/- 37.207) is smaller than that of the neutral environment (34.37+/- 52.742). 

Discussion:
The main observation is that there is no significant evidence that there is a difference in the rate of photosynthesis in the presence of different pH’s. Consequently, the data does not support out hypothesis that there would be a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis in the acidic and basic environments. Despite this, the average percent changes seen in Figure 1 does show that the chloroplasts in the basic environment had a lower averaged percent change than the acidic environment. However, there may be no significant difference between the different pH environments due to the homeostatic nature of chloroplasts. They are known to adapt to varying environmental conditions and growing stages [Jarvis, Lopez-Juez: 2013]. This might explain why there were not stark differences in the photosynthetic rates in the acidic and basic conditions. Conversely, other research dictates that increased pH does have an impact on certain plant species and has been found to decrease the rate of photosynthesis [Semesi, et. al: 2009]. This contrasts to the results that we have found, as the basic conditions did not yield a significantly different rate. In addition, other studies showed that certain plant species are actually adapted to function in lower pH environments and have a larger range of pH’s in which they can thrive [Gerloff-Elias, et. al: 2005]. This research further emphasizes how chloroplasts have a homeostatic nature where they are able to perform their roles within a plant even when exposed to different types of environments. Overall, our data was very inconsistent and made it difficult to analyze. These fluctuations could be due to errors while using the spectrophotometer.
