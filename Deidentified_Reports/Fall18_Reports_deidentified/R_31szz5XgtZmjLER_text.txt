Title: Agressive Behaviors in Male Betta Fish, Betta splendens, When Opposing Another Male Betta Fish and a Fake Betta Fish

Abstract:
Betta fish, Betta splendens, have many behaviors with varying degrees of aggression represented in each behavior. Showing many behaviors is the way that betta fish show themselves to other fish. This lab looks at the aggression in male betta fish and scores them on the degree of aggression they show towards a real male betta fish and a fake betta fish in a 5 minute time span. It was hypothesized that the fish would score more aggressively towards a real betta male than a fake betta. A two sample t-test showed that the aggression score of male betta fish opposing real and fake betta fish was not statistically significant. Concluding that our hypothesis was not supported by the results of this lab.

Introduction:
The behavior of male betta fish, Betta splendens, becomes aggressive on different levels when encountering another fish. This includes fish from other species as well. However, Male betta fish tend to be more aggressive toward other males than females [Simpson: 2013]. The different behaviors represent different severities of aggression. There are two types of aggressive responses. The first is broadside movements, which are displayed when a fish turns its side toward the other fish and exhibit behaviors. In increasing order of aggression the behaviors exhibited on broad side effects are pelvis fin flickering, tail beating, and then tail flashing. The second type of aggressive behaviors are expressed in facing movements. These in increasing order of aggression are facing opponent with pectoral fins erect at the same time as spreading its gill covers, opercula, and then even more threatening is protruding their branchiostegal membranes creating a red "mane" [Johnson: 2018]. A beta can also raise its dorsal skin, dart toward the other fish, and event bite or nip another fish. In this lab male betta fish were observed and scored based on aggressive behaviors exhibited when opposing a real male and a fake male. It is hypothesized that the betta fish will have a larger aggression score when opposing a real male betta fish than when opposing a fake betta fish.  

Materials and Methods:
A male betta was places in a tank with a piece of glass and white plastic in between it and another male betta fish. First a ranking of aggressive behaviors were given numbers so the male betta fish could be scored. The ranking system used was 1 point awarded for pelvic fin flicking and pectoral fins erect, 2 points for tail beating, and 3 points were awarded for tail flashing and creating a red mane. Each time the male fish exhibited the one of these behaviors the male received points. The white shield was then removed and the amount of aggressive behaviors were counted and scored for the first fish for 5 min. Then the white plastic was stuck back between the fish and the fish rested for 5 min. The second male fish as removed and replaces by a fake betta fish. Then the white plastic was removed between the fake fish and the real fish. This was observed for 5 min and the fish was scored based on the same aggression ranking. These steps were redone with 3 other fish. The results were average and a paired two-sample t-test was taken and data was analyzed. 

Results:
The results showed that there is no statistical difference between the male betta fish reacting to a real or fake betta fish (t-stat=1.817, df=6, p=0.157). The average aggressive score for the real male versus a fake male was 6.5+/- 9.7 which is lower than the average of the aggressive behaviors of the real male betta fish versus another real male betta fish at 57.25 +/- 62. Figure 1 represents the average aggressive behaviors with standard error bars that shows that there is a large standard deviation of the aggression scores of the beta fish for both fake fish and real fish reactions. 

Discussion:
The results of this lab did not support the hypothesis that a male betta fish will score higher on aggression against another real male betta fish instead of against a fake betta fish. In figure 1 the the standard deviations are taken into account to state that our hypothesis is not supported by our research due to the large variation in the reaction of different animals. The score rankings of the male fish observed were done on a basis of aggression that had only focused on the two main categories of behaviors in male betta fish, broad side movements and facing effects [Johnson:2018]; therefore, one way that this lab could be improved would be to add other aggressive behaviors like color change because it was noticed on several separate occasions but not a variable in research. The results of the two-sample t-test did not provide a p-value that supported the hypothesis. However, research stated that male betta fish will be the most aggressive against another male fish, therefor further testing would be beneficial [Simpson:2013]. The results of this lab conclude that our data did not support out hypothesis and it would be beneficial to re-do this lab with more trials per fish.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 shows the Aggressive Behaviors of the real male versus a fake betta and another real male betta. The whiskers on the graph represent the standard deviation. It reflects that the betta fish in observation had a higher average aggressive score when opposing a real male over a fake male betta. *************************************************************************
