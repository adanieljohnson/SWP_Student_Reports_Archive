Title: Caffeine effect the level of contraction in frog legs

Abstract:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments, and neuromuscular system can happen in milliseconds and is unique in animals. However, nerves and muscle contractions can be affected by many factors. In this experiment, we look at how the injection of caffeine in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle on the leg can affect its level of contraction with same stimuli. The hypothesis was that if we inject Caffeine in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, there will be greater contraction. We randoMly selected three frog legs, unskinned them and exposed their nerve. Then we add the same stimuli on the same muscle of each three frog legs, test and record the amount of contraction individually. Then, we inject the caffeine to every frog leg, test and record the amount of contraction after the injection individually. Then we calculated the difference of the amount of contraction before and after the exam and measured the t and p value for our paired measurement t test. Our data showed that there was a significent difference of contraction between the pre and post injection. Our hypothesis was supported by our data. This experiment shows that Caffeine effect the amount of contraction in frog legs. 

Introduction:
Neuromuscular system is one of the most important parts that controll our movement and reaction to the inner and outer stimuli. This experiment examined if caffeine can change the contraction of muscle. As we learned previously in class, nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause release of acetylcholine (Ach) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Ach binds with its receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that length of the fiber, stimulating the release of Ca2+ from internal storage sites. The release of Ca2+ activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten [Johnson:2016]. According to the research done by J. Mark Davis and many other researchers, Caffeine ingestion can delay fatigue during exercise through central nervous system mechanism by blocking adenosine receptors [Davis: 2003]. Also, caffeine has a direct effect on skeletal muscle contractile properties both before and after fatigue [Lopes: 1983]. Since Caffeine directly affect muscle, we want to know how much the level muscle contraction it can affect. In order to answer this question, we need to artificially inject Caffeine into the muscle on the frog legs and measure the difference of the amount of contraction it has before and after the contraction using iWorx EP on the computer. In this experiment, our hypothesis is that if we inject Caffeine in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle, there will be greater contraction. We use frog leg as our model because their body provide a good overview of the organ system of a complex living thing. Also, frog legs are in appropriate size for lab experiment so that we can easily controll them. Furthermore, the reproductive rate of frog is very high. 

Materials and Method:
First, we randoMly selected three frog legs from a box. Then, we place the legs in a dissecting pan. After that, we followed the video and used the forceps grasp the skin at the top of the leg and pull the skin down toward the foot. We then use the dissecting probe to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee, and used the dissecting needle and forceps to free the nerve from its attaching connective tissue. We did that for each of three frog legs. After preparing the frog legs, we connected the muscle to the Forth Transducer. We determined our threshold as the voltage point where the output is zero. We found out that the amount of contraction had a big difference when the stimuli was at 0.5V. With that, we found out that the threshold was at 0.5V. After that, we increased our stimuli to 1.0V and press the record button to record the amount of contraction five times on the same frog leg. Then, we injected 0.1 Ml of caffeine in the muscle and recorded the amount of contraction of the frog leg five times. We did the same procedure for all three frog legs. After recording all the data, we disconnected all the equipment. Then, we calculated the mean of the five contraction before the injection and the mean of the five contractions after the injection for all the three frog legs. We also calculated the mean difference of the contraction before and after the injection, the t value, and one tailed p value for the three frog legs to see if there was a significent difference between the two conditions. 

Results:
The threshold for three frog legs is 0.5V. The mean of the contraction before the injection for three frog legs are 0.1236V, 0.079V, and 0.1518V, the mean of the contraction after the injection for three frog legs are 0.4788V, 0.5384V, and 0.5808V. (Table 1) Then average difference of the contraction between two conditions is 0.415V. We used paired measurement t test to analyze our results. The one-tailed p_value is 0.0055 with t value= 13.399 and d.f.=2. (Table 2) The mean of contraction after the injection of Caffeine is significently different from the mean of contraction before the injection of Caffeine. (Figure 1) 

Discussion:
The hypothesis, if we inject Caffeine in the frog’s gastrocnemus muscle there will be greater contraction, of our experiment was supported by our data. According to our data, we get our p value which is much smaller than 0.05. This means that the difference between the contraction before the injection and the contraction after the injection of Caffeine is significent. Also, according to the average difference of the contraction between two conditions is positive, the contraction after the injection is greater than the contraction before injection. As we learned, the release of Ca2+ from internal storage sites activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber and causes the muscle to shorten. Moreover, past investigations have found that Caffeine directly stimulates catecholamine release from adrenal glands perfused with Calcium. The stimulant effect of caffeine is potentiated by preloading the gland with calcium and also by exposure to thiocyanate [Poisner: 1973]. This could further explain why Caffeine can stimulate greater contraction on muscles. Since the contraction is caused by Ca2+, Caffeine can promote the release of more Ca2+ and thus cause greater contraction on muscles. Although the data supports our hypothesis, we can still improve the experiment by measuring the length of the contraction for each frog legs. Instead of just testing three frog legs, we can repeat the test with more frog legs next time to make sure that the differences are not due to the chance or sampling error. Furthermore, since we already know that Caffeine can delay the fatigue, we can measure how long it can actually keep the contraction of muscle on the frog legs for our further study on caffeine and neuromuscular system. 
By doing this experiment, we learned that Caffeine can have positive effect on the muscle movement. This can explain the reason why a lot of beverage, like Red Bull add Caffeine to make the customers more energetic. However, since Caffeine stimulate the muscle contraction by promoting more Ca2+ to release, too much Caffeine can make our bones to become weaker.

Figure 1. Effect of caffeine on the output voltage. Three frog legs were being tested in the experiment. Before the injection of the caffeine, the output voltage for all three frog legs were less than 0.2V. After the injection, the contraction immediately went up, and all three went above 0.4V. *************************************************************************
