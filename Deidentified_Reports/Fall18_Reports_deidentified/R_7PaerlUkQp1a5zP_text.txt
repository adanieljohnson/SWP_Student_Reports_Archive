Title: Effect of Caffeine on the Growth of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is an acellular slime mold that can be used to study the effects of chemicals on cell signaling, as signaling in Physarum largely signals for growth of the slime mold. Caffeine, one such chemical, is a cyclic AMP (cAMP) analog and should inhibit cAMP production, inhibiting growth by blocking the formation of a cAMP gradient essential to growth. In this study, 1 cm2 samples of Physarum were exposed to either caffeine or control conditions and allowed to grow for 48 hours. No significant difference in growth was found between samples exposed to caffeine and the controls. This is in contrast with reported literature and may have been due to old or defective Physarum or an insufficient caffeine concentration. 

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum spends its life in a plasmodial stage crawling with the use of actin microfilaments [Johnson: 2018]. All nuclei are diploid [Johnson: 2018]. Physarum thrives in dark, high humidity environments and reproduces by splitting off small clone organisms [Johnson: 2018]. It travels in search of food and waste is left behind the organism [Johnson: 2018]. The organism can also form a suspended stage in the absence of food or moisture called a sclerotium [Johnson: 2018]. Additionally, when stressed in the absence of food, the organism will reproduce using spores that will make a zygote with a non-similar mating type swarm cell [Johnson: 2018]. Several behaviors can be observed during the plasmodial stage as a result of cellular signaling, which most often result in plasmodial growth; this makes Physarum a good choice for a model organism of cellular signaling as the signals typically signal for one thing rather than a variety as is the case in other organisms such as humans [Johnson: 2018].
	Caffeine is an analog for cyclic AMP (cAMP). A previous experiment showed cAMP production is important in generating a cAMP gradient essential to Physarum growth [Kincaid & Mansour: 1979]. We hypothesized that caffeine would inhibit Physarum growth by inhibiting cAMP production. Caffeine is an antagonist for cAMP, which is a second messenger that signals growth in Physarum cells. Therefore, inhibiting cAMP should inhibit growth of the organism.

Materials and Methods:
We cut out a 1 cm2 block from the center of 6 water-agar plates, as shown in Figure 1. Three plates were treated with 5 mL 20 mM caffeine for ten minutes. Seven oatmeal flakes were placed at the cardinal directions of the petri dish, as shown in Figure 1. Each 1-cm2 well was filled with a 1-cm2 block of Physarum from a stock plate. The plates incubated in a black-out bag for 48 hours. The change in area of Physarum was found by determining the width and length of the Physarum in centimeters and multiplying them together, and then subtracting the original area (1 cm2). The areas from the control plates and the caffeine plates were averaged to find the means and standard deviations, and were compared using a one-tailed independent samples t-test, assuming equal variance; the alpha value was set to .05.

Results:
The average change in area of the Physarum on caffeine plates was 17.12 cm2, SE = 9.86. The average change in area of the Physarum control plates was 30.54 cm2, SE = 6.39. A one-tailed independent samples t-test did not show the change in growth as determined by area to be significantly different between the caffeine and control groups, t = 1.142, df = 4, p = .159. The change in area of the Physarum for each plate is shown in Figure 2. 

Discussion:
Statistical testing showed that our results did not significantly differ between groups. We speculated that caffeine would inhibit Physarum growth by inhibiting cAMP signaling. However, the decrease in growth in the presence of caffeine seen in Figure 1 was shown to not be statistically significant compared to the growth of the control plates. This is in contrast with reported literature. Caffeine has been found to inhibit Physarum growth and Physarum can even “learn” to avoid it, due to the observed behavior of chemotaxis [Boisseau & Dussutour: 2016]. The experiment may have been limited by the defective samples of Physarum used; significant results may have been obtained with an unaffected sample of Physarum. The problems with the Physarum samples may have been either the age and chemical exposure of the Physarum; neither were known at the beginning of the experiment. The contamination could have come from microorganisms that the sample was exposed to or from other treatments at the biological supply plant that provided it. Another possibility is that the plant provided old samples of Physarum. Additionally, the concentration of caffeine may have been insufficient to significantly inhibit growth; the dilution needed for the caffeine stock solution was not clearly stated. In a future experiment, a healthy sample of Physarum should be used in a higher concentration of caffeine to increase the chances of finding a significant result. As shown in Figure 2, two of the caffeine replicates did have lower changes in area and so a higher concentration of caffeine may have produced significance.
