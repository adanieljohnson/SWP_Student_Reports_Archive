Title: Comparative Growth of Physarum P. Using A23187 and Neomycin

Abstract:
Physarum P. is an excellent model organism that is useful for better understanding how cell-level processes work using very basic scientific equipment. Physarum can undergo mitosis in synchrony, so it acts like a giant cell. For this experiment A23187 will be used as an activator in our cultures and Neomycin will be used as an inhibitor for the physarum. The hypothesis stated that Ca2+ channels will be inhibited by Neomycin therefore showing less movement toward the food source when compared to our physarum group activated by A23187. We used 9 water-agar plates for this experiment (replicates of 3). Each had a standardized food source and the group came back into 24 hours to observe and record growth of physarum. Only one statistically significent p_value was found (0.043) for our Neomycin group when compared to the controll group and all of the samples in that group did show growth away from the food source. The physarum provided was found to be defective and this is believed to be a major confounding variable for the experiment because our data suggest an odd or unexpected growth pattern for physarum. Our hypothesis was not supported by our data, but if we eliminated this major confounding variable it is possible that the original hypothesis could be proven correct.

Introduction:
Physarum P. is an excellent model organism that has aided in better understanding of how cell-level processes work. Physarum is a slime mold that can undergo mitosis in synchrony, so it acts like a giant cell. This organism behaves in several similar ways to humans and this can allow for extrapolation of results. In this lab the group formulated an experiment for physarum to perform that would help understand more about how signaling pathways can play an important role in the growth and development of physarum. Specifically these experiments used A23187 and Neomycin to test their impacts on signal transduction pathways in our physarum. These two compounds have direct effects on IP3 signaling pathways in cells (the pathway is activated by A23187 and is inhibited by Neomycin). IP3 signaling pathways are important for many organisms given that they are a fairly common signal transduction pathway (Johnson: 2016). Inside the smooth ER which contains plentiful amounts of calcium, IP3 binds to a receptor which opens channels to allow the out-flow of calcium from the smooth ER. This allows calcium to do its job in the cell and bind to calcium receptors which will go on to either activate or inhibit the channels. The group took this all into consideration and hypothesized that the Ca2+ channels will be inhibited by Neomycin and show less movement when compared to the activated group treated with A23187.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment the group began with nine water-agar plates. The experiment called for three replicates of each group (controll, activated, inhibited). Also provided were two plates of pre-cultured, healthy physarum. Initially, 5Ml of A23187 was placed on three plates. This compound was a 1Ml dilution of the 20x stock solution in 19Ml of water. Similarly, Neomycin was placed on three plates with the same dilution process already completed beforehand. Three of the plates were left absent of added compounds to act as a controll. Each plate was soaked for ten minutes without interference to allow the chemicals to settle. The next step was to remove 1.5cm x 1.5cm squares from each of the nine water-agar plates and transpose equitable sized squares of physarum sample onto the nine test plates. Each plate then had food placed on it in a standardized number and place. For this experiment approximately five oats were placed on each plate at the bottom/south location of the plates. Each plate was labeled preemptively detailing which group it belonged to and which compound was being used. The plates were then  wrapped in foil and transferred into a dark bag to controll for light. Approximately 24 hours later the group observed the results and measured the distances covered by the physarum and also noted which direction relative to the food it travelled. The group ran two-tailed t_tests comparing each of the two experimental groups to the controll.

Results:
The data collected showed one significent p_value of 0.043 when comparing our Neomycin group to the controll, but between the A23187 group and the controll there was no significent data (p_value of 0.094). Figure 1 shows the three groups of the experiment and their expected average displacement from their boxes. It can be seen from this that A23187 showed the highest average displacement while Neomycin shows the lowest average and the controll group sits right in between. The results our true experiment yielded are displayed in figure 5. The controll group showed no growth while the other two showed inconsistent/inconclusive patterns of growth. The experiment’s controll group all showed no growth in any direction, but the furthest the physarum traveled was 40mm away from the oats in the A23187 group. All of the Neomycin physarum traveled away from the oats in a way that was shown to be statistically significent. The physarum cultures that were provided to the labs on water-agar plates can be seen in figure 2. Each plate had large chunks of oats that the physarum had been nourished on. Figure 3 is a photo of our controll plates before having physarum transplanted on and before the oats were placed. Also seen in the photo is the tool with which the group standardized the 1.5cm x 1.5cm cubes with (the flat end of the tool is approximately 1cm, so the experiment used 1 1/2 of these edges for length). Figure 4 is a photo of the water-agar plates without any lids on them and before the cubes were removed from them. At the time this photo was taken the plates were being soaked with the various solutions to prepare for the experiment.

Discussion:
Understanding better the mechanisms of signal transduction pathways in physarum is crucial because unlike other organisms it lacks a nervous system and hormones. This lab’s intent was to design an experiment testing the IP3 pathway that would yield results to support a confirmed, informed hypothesis. Unfortunately, in this experiment the physarum provided appeared to have been defective. They showed improper growth and this is a major error within this experiment. The lab group was later informed that during the initial culturing of the physarum, before the lab groups even received their physarum plates, they might have been put into resting phase. Resting phase in physarum is characterized by stunted growth, comparable to hibernation of the organism (Grube: 2016). The reason it is thought our physarum cultures went into their resting phase is because when they were initially left to grow in the incubator they were not placed in the dark bags. This means during their initial development the physarum was exposed to light which is known to be a strong inhibitor of physarum activity (Johnson: 2016). This seems very likely because we saw one of our physarum plates with the A23187 compound show growth away from the food source which was not supportive of our hypothesis. The two experimental groups were compared to the controll group using a two-sample t_test. However, our results yielded no significent p_values for the growth of the A23187 activated group (p_value 0.094) towards the food source. It is possible human error should be considered as a possible confounding variable here because when the group soaked the water-agar plates with our solutions no excess solution was poured off as instructed. Further background research suggests that too much stimulation from an activating agent might actually yield results like our own (Boisseau: 2016). It was also unusual that the controll group showed no growth at all towards the food source because a normal physarum would show growth towards a food source under normal circumstances. It is possible that because the physarum cultures provided to the labs were already fully nourished they would not necessarily grow towards any food source (Johnson: 2016). The hypothesis was shown, by our data, to not be supported. Physarum did not have statistically significent growth toward the food source in our activated A23187 group. It is difficult to make any definitive understandings from this experiment about how IP3 signaling might be impacted by inhibiting/activating compounds given that the provided physarum was found to be defective, but if the experiment was run again after eliminating this confounding variable then the hypothesis that physarum, activated by A23187, would travel more efficiently towards the food source than physarum inhibited by Neomycin might still be proven true.
