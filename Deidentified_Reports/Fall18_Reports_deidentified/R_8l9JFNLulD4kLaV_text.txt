Title: Testing the behavioral differences between the red and blue Betta splendins in response to the same stimulus

Abstract:
The actions of Betta splendins in response to a certain stimuli is the focus of this lab.  Observing the visual reactions of the fish in response to aggressive stimulus will aid in making conclusions about the evolutionary basis for these behaviors.  Due to patterns seen in previous labs, it was hypothesized that the color of the fish could indicate its level of aggressiveness.  In order to test this, we placed a decoy fish showing signs of aggression in the tank with each color fish, red and blue and observed what aggressive behaviors were displayed and how frequently.  In the end, the p_value 0.2923 showed that the difference in aggressive behaviors shown in the red fishes versus the blue was not significent and therefore our hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
This lab focuses on the behavior of Betta splendins, more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, towards the same stimulus.  Siamese fighting fish reach to about 4-5 cm and at rest, the males tend to be less colorful and change color when excited by another male presence (intraspecific behavior).  Siamese fighting fish are known for their aggressive behavior (agnostic), which can be shown through broadside displays and front facing displays.  Each type of display has sublevels of visible actions that indicate levels of aggressiveness [Johnson: 2016]. These visual communications allows us to observe the behavior of the B. splendins in certain stimuli.  Through observing their colorful displays and agnostic behaviors, typical behavior patterns will be revealed, allowing a basis for conclusions surrounding the evolutionary basis for their behaviors.  In the base B. splendins observation lab, through our initial behavioral observations revealed that the blue fighting fishes showed overall more aggression than the red fishes.  It is hypothesized that certain color fish will be more aggressive in the same stimulus.


Materials and Method:
Gather three red Betta fish and three blue Bettas.  For each individual fish, place the same decoy fish, which is showing signs of aggression, in the tank for five minutes.  Observe how the Betta fish reacts to this decoy and mark down which aggression signs are displayed and how many times they are displayed.  In order to rank levels of aggressiveness, split behaviors into three levels.  Level 1 will be the least aggressive behaviors-pelvic fin flickering, erect pectoral fins.  Level 2 behaviors include, tail beating and spreading of their opercula (gills).  The most aggressive behaviors are in Level 3 and consist of tail flashing and protruding branchiostegal membranes, known as the red “mane”.  There will be two 5 minute trials conducted with each fish.  The fish must have 5 minutes rest in between each trial.  Once all the behaviors are observed and marked down, spread out the numbers (1s, 2s, and 3s) to find the means, use the raw data in a unpaired t_test, and use the highest mean of each trial per fish as its graphing point.


Results:
Most of the fish showed very low levels of aggressiveness towards the decoy fish, however as seen in Figure 1, the Red 3 Betta fish demonstrated high levels of aggressive behaviors.  Comparing raw data of aggressive displays in blue Betta fish versus red Betta fish in an unpaired t_test (t_stat: 1.077, d.f.:23, p:0.2923).


Discussion:
According to the p_value, there is not a significent difference between the aggressiveness of the blue versus red B. splendins and therefore the hypothesis was not supported.  Most of the fishes showed no signs of interest in the decoy fish, besides occasional glances, and few signs of aggression.  This could be due to the fact that the decoy did not imitate an aggressiveness and threatening Betta fish and therefore the test fish did not consider it a threat.  Possible future method that could improve results would be to have the decoy swim around the tank by utilizing a mechanical decoy, which would better convince the test fish that this decoy is a possible threat.
