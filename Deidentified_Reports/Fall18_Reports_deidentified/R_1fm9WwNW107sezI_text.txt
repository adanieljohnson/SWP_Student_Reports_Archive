Title: Chloroplast activity difference proved insignificent in C3 and C4 plants in both light and dark conditions

Abstract:
Plants make up a significent part of almost every ecosystem in the world and produce extremely large amounts of the oxygen in the world. However, without light plants would not be able to produce energy, as they rely on photosynthesis. The way that each plant in the world does photosynthesis have vast similarities, however there are minor differences in the ways that plants use photosynthesis. For instance, C4 plants are more efficient in producing energy than C3 plants, due to C4 plants having one extra step before the Calvin cycle. To test the differences in efficiency of C3 and C4 plants, four treatments were created and tested. Two treatments were run on a C3 plant(Spinacia oleracea) and two treatments were run on a C4 plant(Chrysanthemum idicum). Two treatments were in dark conditions and two treatments were exposed to. One dark treatment and one light treatment were performed on both types of plants. Using DCIP and spectrophotometry, the average efficiency of the chloroplasts were measured, and using a two way anova, these results were analyzed. It was found that none of the trials had a significent effect on photosynthetic rates in chloroplasts. These results suggest that neither light exposure nor difference between C3 and C4 plants had any effect on photosynthetic rates.

Introduction:
Every organism requires energy in order to survive, however, there are a variety of different ways in order to obtain this energy. Plants produce their energy through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis uses six carbon dioxide atoms, 12 water molecules, and sunlight in order to produce a glucose molecule, six water molecules and 6 oxygen atoms [Johnson: 2016]. While sunlight is not a compound that directly contributes to a photosynthetic reaction, without sunlight photosynthesis will not occur. This is well understood, and it has been studied extensively. It has been established that higher exposure to sunlight will result in more chloroplast activity, leading to more plant growth [Dana: 2010]. The process of photosynthesis is done through a variety of oxidation-reduction reaction which produce proton gradients, which then drive the synthesis of ATP. Transferring high energy electrons onto carrier electrons such as NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH then allow electrons to be stored and used for other reactions in the plant. While all plants use some form of photosynthesis, different plant types have minor differences in their photosynthetic processes. Two types of plants that have minor differences in their photosynthesis processes are C3 plants and C4 plants. C3 plants are much more common than C4 plants, representing about 95% of plants on earth. C3 plants are plants such as trees, beans and wheats. C4 plants are plants such as corn, grasses, and sugarcane. C4 plants tend to be better at surviving in hotter and drier climates than C3 plants. This is because C4 plants are more efficient in creating energy than C3 plants [Zhu, et. al: 2008] because of one extra step before the Calvin Cycle, which helps to reduce the carbons lost in the entire process. This extra step occurs when carbon dioxide enters the leaf. At this point, C4 plants can binds the carbon dioxide and produce a 4-carbon compound that can then transfer and concentrate the CO2 in cells around the Rubisco enzyme which will improve the plant’s photosynthetic and water use efficiency [Carleton College: 2018]. This difference in photosynthetic efficiency between C3 and C4 plants means that if equal numbers of chloroplasts are compared between the two types of plants, the C4 plants should photosynthesize faster and more efficiently. For our lab experiment we tested this differences in photosynthetic activity between C3 and C4 plants. We used Spinacia oleracea, commonly named spinach as our C3 plant and Chrysanthemum idicum, commonly named chrysanthemum as our C4 plant. To test these plant’s photosynthetic efficiency, we used 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP). DCIP was used as an alternative electron acceptor. DCIP is a blue liquid before it gains extra electrons, and after it gains extra electrons it becomes a clear liquid [Ernster: 2004]. Due to this color changing ability, spectrophotometry can be used before and after an experiment which utilizes DCIP to find a percent change in the color of the liquid. This percent change can then be used to determine how efficiently photosynthesis is occurring in the samples. For all of the aforementioned reasons, we hypothesized that since photosynthesis cannot occur without sunlight, chloroplasts will not complete photosynthesis in a dark drawer, and will therefore have a higher percent change in absorbance than chloroplasts that are exposed to sunlight. Additionally, we hypothesized that because C4 plants are more efficient in photosynthesizing than C3 plants, Chrysanthemum idicum samples would concentrate carbon dioxide better than the Spinacia oleracea samples. This would therefore lead to higher percent change in absorbance for the Chrysanthemum idicum samples. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment was begun by acquiring a C3 plant, Spinacia oleracea, and a C4 plant, Chrysanthemum idicum. Leaves were taken from the plants, about 4 leaves of Spinacia oleracea, and about a dozen leaves of Chrysanthemum idicum. The Spinacia oleracea leaves were deveined, washed, and added to a cold mortar and pestle. The leaves of the Chrysanthemum idicum were not deveined, but rather washed and added to a cold mortar and pestle. 10 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to each mortar and pestle, and the leaves were carefully ground into a thick paste. When a thick paste was achieved, 10 Ml more grinding buffer was added and mixed to make the paste a liquid. The Spinacia oleracea and the Chrysanthemum idicum mixtures were then strained through folded cheesecloths, into separate containers. Both mixtures were then placed into centrifuge tubes and spun for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius at a rate of 200xG. The supernatants were then poured into new tubes, and the pellets were discarded. The supernatants were then centrifuged again, but at 1000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatants were then discarded in order to obtain pellets, which contained the chloroplasts of the plants. These pellets were then diluted with 20 Ml of grinding buffer and carefully mixed with a micropipette so as not to destroy the chloroplasts. Then, 14 test tubes were set up and numbered in two sets of 1-7. Test tube 1 of each set were used as controlls and 8Ml of water were added. Then, 2Ml of reaction buffer were added to every tube including the controlls. Then, 2Ml of 130mM DCIP were added to every test tube except for the controlls. Finally, 100 microliters of the Chrysanthemum idicum liquid was added to tubes 2-7 of the first set of test tubes and 100 microliters of the Spinacia oleracea liquid was added to 2-7 of the second set of test tubes. The absorbance for all tubes were then measured with a spectrophotometer set at 600 nm. Results were recorded, and test tubes 2-4 for each group were placed by a window while test tubes 5-7 were placed in a dark drawer, and the controlls were left on the lab table. After 30 minutes, the absorbances were measured and recorded again, and percent changes in absorbance were calculated before the results were analyzed with a two-way anova test. An alpha value of 0.05 was established for this experiment.

Results:
The average percent change for the light expose group of Spinacia oleracea was -0.18%±0.043. The average percent change for the Spinacia oleracea placed in the dark drawer was -1.18%±0.004. The average percent change for the light exposed group of Chrysanthemum idicum was 1.09%±0.01. The average percent change for the Chrysanthemum idicum placed in the dark drawer was 0.41%±0.024 (Figure 1).
	When interpreting the results of this experiments a two-way anova test was used. An alpha value of 0.05 was established. The results of this anova proved to be insignificent for both light and dark tests (d.f.=1, p=0.587) and C3 and C4 tests (d.f.=5, p=0.613).


Discussion:
When it came to our experimental results, it was found that light exposure and dark drawer conditions did not have a significent effect on photosynthesis rates. Our experimental results also showed no significent difference in photosynthesis rates between C3 plants(Spinacia oleracea) and C4 plants(Chrysanthemum idicum). These results meant that in every trial performed, the clarity of the chloroplast and DCIP solution were not different enough to prove that any conditions had a non-random effect on the photosynthetic rates of the chloroplasts. These results meant that both proposed hypotheses were rejected for this experiment. These results also meant that there were no correlations between amount of light exposure to chloroplasts, or the different types of plants used.
While our results were not what we predicted them to be, it is possible that experimental errors and limitations could have contributed to these unexpected results. These limitations being a relatively small amount of trials and the trials could only be done over a short time period. Experimental errors encountered were problems such as not being able to measure exact amounts of chloroplasts, lack of sunlight, and human error.
A study similar to ours looked at photosynthetic rates of C3 and C4 plants when exposed to high CO2 conditions. This study found that C3 plants had higher photosynthetic rates in these elevated CO2 conditions [Wand, et al.: 2001]. The results from this study were in fact unexpected. The study believed that due to carbon assimilation efficiency being higher in C4 grasses than C3 grasses that photosynthetic rates would also be higher in C4 plants in excess CO2 conditions. Another study that compared photosynthetic rates in C3 and C4 plants focused specifically on these rates in elevated temperatures. This study found that C4 plants had higher photosynthetic rates in these elevated temperatures than C3 plants did [Sage and Kubien: 2007]. The results from this study suggest that C4 plants can handle and thrive in higher temperatures better than C3 plants can. The results from these two aforementioned studies suggest conflicting ideas. While it has been extensively studies and concluded that C4 plants are more effective in photosynthesis than C3 plants, rising temperatures due to global warming could cause major changes in ecosystems [Kramer, et al.: 2001]. Global warming is expected to increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere by up to 50% by the end of the century [Siegenthaler and Oescheger: 1978] and increase temperature levels by the end of the century [Stott, et al.: 2002]. While the previously discussed studies suggested that C4 plants should survive better than C3 plants in rising temperatures, studies also suggested that C3 plants should do better than C4 plants in rising/elevated CO2 levels. These results can be compared to what is understood about photosynthetic efficiencies in these plants in order to create accurate predictions of what the earth will look like in terms of plant survival in the future. 
The concepts that we tested in this experiment can also be utilized for bigger problems we are facing. For instance, if it can better be understood which types of plants have the highest rates of photosynthesis, we could make helpful suggestions to farmers. For instance, we could explain to farmers which crops will bring them the highest yields the most quickly, potentially increase their yearly incomes. Another extremely important outcome to understanding photosynthetic rates would be in feeding the rising population of earth. We are on pace to be unable to grow enough food on earth to feed the world population. If changes in how much we eat and what we eat is not made, by 2050 we will need 50% more land for food cultivation [Milman: 2015]. If we can understand how different types of plants react to different temperatures and CO2 levels, we could analyze the best places to plant either C3 or C4 plants to maximize crop production to feed our growing populations. While more research would need to be done to pinpoint these growth and photosynthetic levels around the world, it is an idea which may be crucial in the future.
Overall, this experiment did not prove to be successful in displaying the same results as previous studies have. We did not find significance in greater rates of photosynthesis in light conditions vs dark conditions. We also did not find significance in greater rates of photosynthesis in C4 plants than C3 plants. However, future studies such as the one we conducted could be extremely valuable. Understanding photosynthetic rates in different plant types is crucial to predicting future earth conditions and ecosystem change.
