Title: The Effects of Caffeine on Physarum polycephalum 

Abstract:
Abstract:
	The effects of caffeine were tested on Physarum polycephalum. Fully developed Physarum was cultured and cut into 1cm squares. Six agar-based petri-dishes were cut with a 1cm square in the center; three agar plates were used as the control and three plates were treated with caffeine (20mM for 10 minutes). Fully developed Physarum squares were added to the six Petri dishes and incubated at optimal living conditions for 48hrs. Growth was measured by area of Physarum and compared using a one tailed unpaired t-test. Results displayed there was no statistical difference or trend associated in Physarum area attributed to the addition of caffeine to the petri-dishes (P-value: 0.159). Results may be insufficient and should be repeated with an increase in sample size or caffeine exposure. 

Introduction:
Introduction:
Physarum is a slime mold that digests decaying leaves and log spores.  A cool, shady, and moist environment is ideal for Physarum to thrive and expand. Physarum’s ability to expand and grow is due to its cytoskeleton filaments that ‘crawl’ across plant leaves or logs, engulfing and digesting debris, bacteria, and spores [Dove: 1986]. Physarum is a diploid organism during the stage that it hydrolyzes debris for growth. However, when stressed physarum fragmentizes into sporangia that form spore capsules. These capsules can undergo mitosis and form haploid offspring that are spores. Spores are transferred and distributed to other locations by wind or rain before progressing in the growth cycle to swarm cells [Dove: 1986]. Swarm cells are single mating type cells that are prevented from mating with themselves, however are stimulated by opposite gene types to combine and reform a diploid organism [Dove: 1986]. 
	Chitin is a is a fibrous sugar polysaccharide filament that is used in the extension of mold cell wall filaments that helps support the molds cytoskeleton. The primary drive behind the extension of Physarum is the formation and expansion of actin filaments. Some slime molds lack chitin or other cytoskeleton components [Kwasniewska: 2018], [Jaiswal: 2012]. This experiment investigates if chitin is an active contributor to the expansion of Physarum. 
Caffeine has been shown to be an inhibitor of chitin kinase [Kwasniewska: 2018]. Chitin kinase is an enzyme that increases chitin production during mold cell wall expansion. With the implementation of caffeine chitin kinase is inhibited, thus inhibiting the growth of mold cell walls. Our experiment investigated the effect of caffeine on Physarum Polycephalum. Our hypothesis is that the growth of Physarum Polycephalum will be inhibited by caffeine due to the inhibition of chitin production. 

Materials and Methods:
Methods:
	One-centimeter square cubes were cut from the center of six agar petri-dishes and removed. Ethanol was used as a sterilization agent between each step of the protocol. Three of the six petri dishes were treated with 5mL of 20mM caffeine for 10 minutes before the six agar squares were removed.  Six  1 cm cubes were cut from a separate petri dish containing fully developed, based on branching and color distribution, Physarum.   Each 1cm cube was added to either the petri dishes that had been pretreated with caffeine or the non-treated agar petri dishes. Oats were added as a food source and was spread in a circle around the Physarum an equal distance from the 1 cm square.  All six petri dishes containing Physarum were then incubated for 48 hours before the growth (diameter cm2 of the furthest point) of the Physarum was measured. 

A one tailed unpaired T-test with equal variance and 95% confidence intervals was performed for statistical analysis of physarum area between the caffeine treated petri-dishes and control (non-caffeine) petri-dishes. 

Results:
Pretreatment of the 3 agar petri dishes with caffeine had a no statistically significant effect on the growth of Physarum (T-state = 2.353, df = 4, P = 0.159). The average growth of Physarum in the Control and caffeine treated petri-dishes was 30.536  6.39 (cm^2) and 17.12  9.86 (cm^2), respectively.

Discussion:
	Caffeine has been shown in previous experiments to inhibit the growth of molds through its effects on various receptors and enzymes. Our interest was to investigate the potential effect of caffeine on Physarum Polycephalum in order to determine if the same mediated cell response would occur similar to other mold types. Our results demonstrated that caffeine had no effect on the difference in the growth area of Physarum compared to a control (no caffeine) agar petri-dish: P value was 0.15, greater than 0.05. Figure 2 displays a difference in means from 30.536  6.39 control to 17.12  9.86 which suggests a trend, however, due to the highest caffeine area of growth (36.44) the P-value and t-test determined no significant difference. A Q-test was used to determine if any of the date points were outliers, however, no values were determined to be outliers and therefore all data were included in the results. This experiment should be performed again with a higher number of sets (n) in order to improve the power of the experiment. Possible explanations for these results are (1) Physarum Polycephalum does not have chitin components in its cytoskeleton; (2) The concentration of caffeine was not potent enough to promote Physarum growth; and, (3) The petri-dishes were not treated with caffeine for a long enough period of time. 
Some slime molds have been shown to contain chitin in their cytoskeleton composition, while others have not [Kwasniewska: 2018], [De Souza: 2008], [Farr: 1972], [McCormick: 1970]. It is possible that chitin is not present in Physarum and therefore caffeine would not affect its growth. 
The concentration of caffeine that was added to the petri-dishes was 5mL of 20mM. This concentration was dispersed on 3 of the agar plates for 10 minutes before being removed and the physarum was added. The concentration or the treated time limit may have impacted the amount of caffeine that the Physarum were exposed too. The concentration of caffeine may have been too low, or the time of exposure to caffeine too short to produce an effect on Physarum growth. Kukulies et al added Caffeine directly to Physarum for inhibition and blebbing of the membrane to occur [Kukulies: 1983]. Future experiments should increase the time, concentration, or both of caffeine exposure in order to find the optimal level of caffeine effects on Physarum growth. 
Our study aimed to test the effects of caffeine on Physarum Polycephalum growth. The results concluded insignificant with a P value greater than 0.05 (0.15). Possible reasons for our results are a low concentration of caffeine, inadequate time of agar exposure to caffeine, or the lack of cytoskeleton components (chitin) that are affected by caffeine and other slime molds may contain. Future steps should aim to increase the numbers of trials (power) and increasing the concentration or exposure time to caffeine.
