Title: How Sunlight Affects Root to Shoot Ratios in Oilseed Radishes

Abstract:
In this experiment, I tested how Oilseed Radishes (Raphanus sativus) allocate their resources by comparing root to shoot ratios of radishes grown in direct sunlight versus radishes grown in the shade. Resource allocation refers to how plants divvy out their resources based on their environments. In a dry, sunny environment, you could expect plants to have longer roots compared to their shoots in order for them to gather more ground resources like nitrogen. The opposite is true for plants grown in went, shady environments. Based on this information, I hypothesized that radishes grown in the sunlight would have a smaller root to shoot ratio than radishes grown in the shade. To perform this experiment, 40 oilseed radishes were evenly distributed into 8 pots. In a greenhouse, 4 pots were placed under a shade cloth and 4 were placed in direct sunlight. They were kept in the greenhouse for 2 weeks. At the end of that period, I preformed a two sampled, one-tailed t-test. Based on the results, the hypothesis was rejected because the average root to shoot ratio was higher than plants grown in sunlight than the ones grown in shade.

Introduction:
All living organisms, including plants, have to compete with other organisms for limited resources in their environment. The term for the way that plants use and distribute their resources is called “Resource Allocation.” In plants, resource allocation can be measured by examining root to shoot ratios (or how massive the root is compared to the shoot) between plants grown in different conditions. [Johnson: 2018] In this lab, I will be testing how the root to shoot ratios of Oilseed Radishes (Raphanus sativus) are affected by the amount of sunlight available. Sunlight was chosen as the testable condition because it is very important for most plants to live and photosynthesize. [Johnson: 2018] When plants do not have adequate access to sunlight, their investment in the production of “RuBisCo” (an enzyme that is involved in carbon fixation) decreases, leaving more resources allocated to the plants’ shoots. [Bazzaz: 1997] Any factor that limits carbon intake, like a lack of sunlight, would cause resources to allocate towards the shoots. [Coleman: 1989] Based on this information (and on information obtained from a similar experiment involving Buckwheat), I hypothesize that radishes grown in direct sunlight will have smaller root to ratios than radishes grown in the shade.

Materials and Methods:
I gathered 40 Oilseed radish seeds that had been soaked in water for 24 hours and a tray of 8 pots to plant the seeds in. The pots were filled with soil and I placed 5 seeds in each pot and covered the seeds with more soil. Next, I watered the seeds (with about 100mL of water) and moved the tray into a greenhouse. The tray was positioned so that half of the pots were under shade and half were in the sunlight. Every day for two weeks, the radishes were watered at about 6pm with about 100mL of water. After this two-week period, I harvested 3 of the plants from each pot and measured all of their root and shoots (in weight (g) and in length (cm)) in order to compare their root to shoot ratios. I used a ruler and scale to do this. After gathering the results, I performed two two-sampled, one-tailed t-tests, one for length and one for weight.

Results:
Generally, I noticed that there was not as much difference as expected between shaded radishes and radishes grown in sunlight in terms of both length and weight. The mean for the root to shoot ratios of radishes in adequate sunlight was 0.29 +/- 0.14 grams. With the plants grown in the shade, the mean root to shoot ratio for their rate was 0.18 +/- 0.12 grams (Figure 1). This is drastically different from the length root to shoot ratios of the 12 radish plants. When grown in sunlight the mean was 2.09 +/- 0.84 cm and, in shade, it was 1.65 +/- 0.81 cm (Figure 2). It is also worth noting that, when comparing root to shoot ratio means for length versus weight, the standard deviation is higher in the weight means than in the length. However, the difference in the means of root to shoot weight ratios were proven to be statistically significant under the two conditions (t-stat = 1. 927311, df = 22, P = 0. 033476). The difference in the means of root to shoot length ratios were not statistically significant when comparing sunlight versus shade (t-stat = 1.33078, df = 22, P = 0.098445).  

Discussion:
I reject the hypothesis that radishes grown in the sunlight would have smaller root to shoot ratios than those grown in shade. Overall, and on average, the plants grown in sunlight had larger root to shoot ratios in length and in weight. A similar research allocation experiment was performed on Buckwheat and it yielded very similar results. In that experiment, the root to shoot ratios in terms of length were also statistically insignificant. [data unpublished] Based on the fact that two experiments on resource allocation had statistically insignificant root to shoot length ratios, I believe that plants’ resources could simply apply to root mass rather than length. It is known that roots would (ideally) be larger in order to bring in more nitrogen, water, etc. It is also known that length would apply more to shoots because shoots tend to grow towards sunlight. [Johnson:2018] Alternatively, this insignificance could apply to planting error. Oilseed radishes grow best in cool, moist conditions, but the greenhouse the plants were grown in was fairly warm most of the time. The USDA claims that radishes are not “tolerant” of shade, so it is possible that some of the shaded radishes weren’t shaded enough or that the sunlit radishes were slightly shaded. [Jacobs: 2012] Additionally, I may have planted the radishes too deep into the soil since light can only penetrate the soil so far. [Hyo-Jun Lee: 2016] Radishes are grown best when planted ¼ to ½ of an inch below the soil and I did not measure this before planting the. Finally, I may have overestimated how much water radishes need and, as a result, overwatered them. [Ray Weil et. al.: 2009] If I were to re-perform this study, I would research more about how Oilseed Radishes should be planted and how they allocate resources in their natural environment to better design the experiment.
