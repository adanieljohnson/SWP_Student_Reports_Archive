Title: The effects of acid rain on the Root:Shoot ratio of the Fagopyrum esculentum plant

Abstract:
Abiotic factors are stimuli that come from non-living aspects of the environment. This is like wind, rain, or pollution. This study looks at how the Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plant adjust to abiotic factors of the environment through resource allocation. We grew mutiple replicas of the plant. Some were watered with acid rain, others were given fresh water. After a week we took the root to shoot ratios of each plant and compared the averages. Our hypothesis was that plants watered with acid rain would have larger root to shoot ratios. This is because the thought the plant would allocate more resources to their roots to become better at finding nutrients in the soil. Our results tells us that we have no significent difference between our data test. We can conclude this from having p_values that were many times greater than 0.05.  



Introduction:
In any environment a combination of biotic and abiotic factors interact with each organism. Plants and animals interact on a day to day basis so they learn to adapt to one another. Abiotic factors are stimuli that come from non-living aspects of the environment. This is like wind, rain, or pollution. This study looks at how plants adjust to abiotic factors of the environment. In further detail, we will be studying the resource allocation of the Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plant under the influence of acid rain. In resource allocation the plant is seeking to optimize the way it responds to environmental cues and to integrate these with the genetically determined elements of development in order to maximize its reproductive potential and ensure the production and survival of the next generation [Bennet: 2012]. Acid rain is an abiotic caused by pollution on the earth. Rain is a much needed resource of plants, so what affect does unsually acidic rain have? A study was preformed that simulated acid rain (SAR) at early plant growth on some morphochemical characters of two varieties of Mash (Vigna mungo L.) namely Mash 97 and Var. 95009.  The data revealed that low pH (3.5) of either sulphuric acid or the combination of H2SO4 and HNO3 aﬀected more severely at all parameters including number of leaves, shoot: root ratio, water contents of shoot and Potassium ion concentration. Whereas for a few parameters like plant height and number of branches the simulated acid rain of solution of pH 4.5 and 3.5 by using HNO3 proved a bit better for plant growth, the root length was increased in case of SAR of solution of pH 3.5 by using H2SO4+HNO3 [Imran:2014]. We hypothesize that acid rain would trigger a greater root:shoot ratio in the buckwheat plant. This is because resource allocation would cause the plant to focus more on the roots due to a lack of nutrients. This lack of nutrients would be caused by the unusually acidic rainfall. 

Materials and Method:
To start this study we first harvested 10 different Fagopyrum esculentum (buckwheat) plants. The reason for so many is due to the size of the species. If your plant is bigger only harvest one. The next step is to take the mass of the whole plant. From here we used siccors to detach the stim of the plant from the root. We made sure to cut at the same spot on every plant, this was at the first color change. Next we cut the point of the stem where all the leaves came together. We weighed and measured each processed section of the plant. We recorded this as controll data. The next phase of the study required the growing of our testing plants under the influences of acid rain. We made 8 pots with seeds of the buckwheat plant. With four pots we watered using regular water. With the last four we used acid rain. The plants were placed in a green house and for every day of that week we watered each respective pot with 25Ml of its designated treatment. Afterwards we harvested the plants and processed them in the same manner as the beginning procedures. 



Results:
 
 
The Data depicted shows the root to shoot ratios of height and weight for each testing sample. We can see that in weight plants that are treated with regular water are a little bigger. Plants watered with regular water have an average size of 0.9513g +/- 0.5410 sd. The plants watered with acid rain were slightly less massive with an average of 0.7339 +/- 0.4295 sd. For the average height root to shoot ratio the data is almost the same, with the acid rain group being just a little taller. The average height for the regular testing group is 1.0193 +/- 0.3285 sd. The average height of plants watered with acid rain was 1.0892 +/- .4010 sd. While plants that were watered with regular water grew to an average height of 1.0193 +/- 0.3285 sd. Our statistical 2 sample t_test showed a P-value of .338 for weight and .665 for height. 


Discussion:
In this study we looked into the concepts of plant allocation. To do this we utilized the buckwheat plant and placed it under controllled environmental stress. This stress was brought on by the use of acid rain water. Plants gain water and other resources by way of the root. Since acid rain lowers the acidity and nutrients in the soil we believed that the plant would allocate more resources to its roots. This would in response help it to take in more nutrients in a less nutrient rich area. Our data showed that when looking at root to shoot ratio for weight, plants that were given regular water were on average bigger than those given acid rain. This could be due to the lack of nutrients in the acidic water. The average weight for the regular water plants were .9518g +/- .5410sd, while acid rain had an average of .7339g +/- .4295 sd. Notice that the standard deviation values are very high. This tells us that there was a wide spread of data from the mean. In looking at the root to shoot ratio in terms of the height the acid rain caused a little bit better growth. The average for the acid rain sample was 1.0892 +/- .4010sd. The average for the regular group was 1.0193 +/- .3285sd. Here you can also see the trend of having a high values for standard deviation. Both sets of data were widely spread from the mean. In looking at our p_values, .338 for weight and .665 for height, we find that this data holds little significance. Our results tell us that both sets of data is not significently different from the other, there is no change.
