Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Growth and Development of Larval Manduca Sexta 

Abstract:
There is emerging research regarding the use of substances that impact the growth and development of insects. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) block the insect’s ability to pupate into an adult by regulating metamorphosis, so the likelihood of survival for these insects drops dramatically. Also, these insects will not be able to reproduce as they will never reach the developmental stage appropriate for reproduction. In this experiment, Martin’s IGR, a substance that blocks the processes regulated by juvenile hormones, is used on Manduca Sexta caterpillars to compare their growth with caterpillars not given the hormone, known as the control group. I hypothesize that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR in their food will weigh less, in grams, than the caterpillars in the control group after two weeks of observation. Eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars with weights ranging from 0.65 g-1.11 g were selected for observation. The control group’s food had five drops of deionized water mixed in the food while the experimental group had five drops of Martin’s IGR mixed into their food. After fourteen days, we recorded the final mass of each caterpillar after weighing them ten times over the duration of two weeks. A Two-Sample T-Test determined a p-value of 0.47. 

Introduction:
There is emerging research regarding the use of substances that impact the growth and development of insects. According to the Turkish Journal of Agriculture & Forestry “Growth and development of insects are under the control of hormones, including prothoracicotrophic hormones (PTTH) (brain hormone), ecdysteroids, and juvenile hormones (JH)” [Tanaz: 2004]. With this knowledge, it is evident that controlling these hormones will impact the timing and success of molting. Insect growth regulators (IGRs) block the insect’s ability to pupate into an adult by regulating metamorphosis, so the likelihood of survival for these insects drops dramatically. Also, these insects will not be able to reproduce as they will never reach the developmental stage appropriate for reproduction. In order for the juvenile hormone analogs (JHAs) process to be successful, it is crucial that the insects are injected at the beginning of their lives [Tanaz: 2004]; Tanaz and Uygun write “This is apparent in studies involving the tobacco hornworm larvae, M. sexta,” so this knowledge aids my argument in this experiment that when fed food injected with insect growth regulators, the larval insect will not grow or develop at the same rate as caterpillars not tested with the substance. This research is integral in increasing the sustainability and safety of other organisms and humans. IGRs are different than traditional insecticides as they are not toxic to the insect or other organisms that could potentially come in contact with the substance. The issue with insecticides is prevalent across the world as it contaminates water and “interfere[s] with other physiological processes” [Tanaz: 2004]. 

In this experiment, Martin’s IGR, a substance that blocks the processes regulated by juvenile hormones, is used on Manduca Sexta caterpillars to compare their growth with caterpillars not given the hormone, known as the control group. I hypothesize that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR in their food will weigh less, in grams, than the caterpillars in the control group after two weeks of observation. 


Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars with weights ranging from 0.65 g-1.11 g were selected for observation. Each caterpillar was placed in its own rearing container, which the food was placed into with two holes cut into each cubicle, so the caterpillars would have oxygen. All eight caterpillars were fed ten grams of food no matter their placement in either the experimental or control group. The control group’s food had five drops of deionized water mixed in the food while the experimental group had five drops of Martin’s IGR mixed into their food. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator placed at a controlled temperature range. After fourteen days, we recorded the final mass of each caterpillar after weighing them ten times over the duration of two weeks. 

To assess the data collected, we performed a Two-Sample T-Test using the means of differences for each group to predict a p-value which determined that our data was not statistically significant. 


Results:
Table 1 shows the differences of mass for each caterpillar, which is the final result of taking the difference in weight gain for each day the caterpillars were weighed. These data show the net total weight gain for each caterpillar. For example, caterpillar one in the experimental group gained 0.153 grams over the course of two weeks. This gain differs drastically from that of caterpillar four in the control group, who gained a total of 2.30 grams over the duration of the experiment. Finally, the mean difference from each group was taken, so each difference was added then divided by four to account for each caterpillar. 

As is evident in Table 1, the experimental group’s mean difference of mass was significantly lower than that of the control group. The raw data of the differences of means between the four caterpillars of each group shows a slight discrepancy, especially in the experimental group. Caterpillars 1 and 4 had a much smaller difference than the other two in this group. In addition, the caterpillars in the control group also had a collective difference of mass that was widespread. Also, Figure 1 displays the scale of how the means of the respective groups differ from each other. 

A Two-Sample T-Test was completed for the data collected, and it determined that the t-statistic for this data is 0.76, the degrees of freedom are 6, and the corresponding p-value is 0.47. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the experimental group. 


Discussion:
I fail to reject the null hypothesis as the data are not statistically significant (p=0.47) meaning that there is no difference in means for the groups, although our hypothesis was that there would be a clear difference since one group of caterpillars was given a growth regulator. This result could be due to the fact that we observed and weighed our caterpillars for two weeks, giving many of them sufficient time to pupate. The process of pupation for Manduca Sexta caterpillars causes them to terminate their eating in order to prepare for adulthood. This process caused many of the larval caterpillars to lose weight during our experiment, and this forced the mean difference to shift in both groups. For future experiments, it would be useful to compare the data from this trial to one that is only run for one week to determine if the length of study affects the weight gain of caterpillars, thus creating a smaller p-value. 

Two of the caterpillars in the experimental group had difficulty growing throughout the experiment, which was the expected outcome. I hypothesized that the caterpillars exposed to Martin’s IGR would weigh less at the end of the experiment than the caterpillars in the control group. The two caterpillars who followed the expectation of the hypothesis were observed trying to molt or begin metamorphosis, but it was apparent that part of their molting was stuck and did not proceed to completion. To support this, Herbert Oberlander and Donald L. Silhacek wrote that “injection of this extract [juvenile hormone] into pupae deplicated the effect of implanting active corpora allata, and resulted in the molting of the pupae into second pupae, instead of adults” [Oberlander: 2000]. Although this was true for two of the experimental caterpillars, the other two caterpillars in this group did not follow the same pattern as they grew at the same rate as many of the caterpillars in the control group. We treated the experimental caterpillars are the beginning of their life cycle, as Tanaz and Uygun recommend in their journal published in the Turkish Journal of Agriculture & Forestry. It is a possibility that, because the two caterpillars in the experimental group that defied the expectations of the experiment, were not given the IGR earlier enough in their life cycle. On the first day of the experiment, experimental caterpillars two and three already weighed more than the other two.
