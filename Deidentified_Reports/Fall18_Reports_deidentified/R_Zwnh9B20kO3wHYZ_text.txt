Title: Inhibition Effect of Tubocurarine on Frog’s Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
Muscle contraction involves many structures in the body to cooperate together. Muscle contraction can bring up the excitation-contraction coupling, which triggers the converting of the action potential (stimulus) into a response. In our experiment, we test the effect of 1mM-tubocurarine by adding it to gastrocnemus muscles in frog legs. Three frog legs were used in the experiments and stimulated by different amplitudes before and after injection of tubocurarine. Paired t_test was used to analyze data and the results lead to a conclusion that the injection of 1mM-tubocurarine to gastrocnemus muscle in frog leg will prevent its contraction.

Introduction:
Majority of the body is built upon by skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle [Sherwood:2010]. Muscle contraction involves many structures to work with each other. One of the most important structures, myofibrils, is composed of myosin (thick filaments) and actin (thin filament). In order to initiate a muscle contraction, many factors play a role. Muscle contraction can bring up the excitation-contraction coupling, and its purpose is to convert action potential (stimulus) into a response. During this process, the extracellular calcium influx into terminal button and brings acetylcholine vesicle merge into the presynaptic membrane. In addition, the acetyl chlorine will bind to the nicotinic Ach receptors which increase the sodium entry into the muscle fiber and cause a graded depolarization [Sherwood:2010]. 
The gastrocnemus muscle contains many muscle fibers. Each fiber has its own threshold and responds all-or-none when stimulated. Because fibers in muscle do not have the same threshold, stimulus applied to a muscle does not excite all the fibers. Threshold is the intensity of stimulus brings a response. As intensity increases above threshold, more fibers are stimulated, and the response becomes greater. When the stimulus intensity is reaching beyond which the response is constant, it’s called maximal stimulus. Then, stimulus above maximal stimulus are called supramaximal stimuli, while stimulus below are called subthreshold stimuli. 
The frog muscle—gastrocnemus—is used in this experiment and we explored the gastrocnemus muscles by adding 1mM-tubocurarine to it. Tubocurarine is an alkaloid that acts as an antagonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, meaning it blocks the receptor sites from acetylcholine. Our hypothesis is: if 1mM-tubocurarine is applied to the frog gastrocnemus, it will prevent contraction. 


Materials and Method:
Three frog legs were prepared for the experiment by peeling off the skin and exposing the nerves. Dissecting probes were used to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee. Gently freed the nerve from its attaching connective tissue, using dissecting needles and forceps. After preparation, one frog leg was suspended by its gastrocnemus muscle and two electrodes were connected to its nerve. Then, the nerve was stimulated with eleven different amplitudes (0V, 0.1V, 0.2V, 0.3V, 0.4V, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, 5V) and the values of response amplitudes were recorded. The second and third legs were treated the same as the previous steps. After that, 1Ml of 1mM-tubocurarine were injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of the three legs. After about 5 minutes of waiting time after injection, the three legs were treated again with the precious steps for stimulus and the response amplitudes were recorded. Paired t_test was run to compare the effect of tubocurarine on mean response amplitude for each stimulus amplitude before and after the injection; paired t_test was also used to compare the highest amplitudes of each leg before and after the injection. 

Results:
For Figure 1, the average respond amplitudes in controll group (without tubocurarine) were much higher than the average respond amplitudes in experimental group (with tubocurarine). From the first to the eleventh experiment, we each used stimulus amplitude 0V, 0.1V, 0.2V, 0.3V, 0.4V, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, 3V, 4V, and 5V. Also, we could visually notice the movement of the gastrocnemus muscle when the stimulus amplitudes were above 0.4V. The results for paired t_test had values: t=7.29, d.f.=10, p=2.6E-5. For figure 2, the highest respond amplitudes in controll group were higher than the response amplitudes in experimental group. The difference before and after injection for frog leg 3 was the smallest among the three, and the difference before and after injection for leg 2 was the largest. The results for paired t_test was: t=31.42, d.f.=1, p=0.02.

Discussion:
The analysis of data did support our hypothesis that the application of 1mM-tubocurarine prevents contraction of frog gastrocnemus. With the injection of tubocurarine, the gastrocnemus muscle’s contraction decreased. Since tubocurarine is a neuromuscular blocker and act as an antagonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), it competed with Acetylcholine (Ach) to bind with nAChR [Jenkinson: 1960]. Without Ach binding to nAChR, the muscle forces will decrease [Jenkinson: 1960]. So, the response amplitudes would decrease for our frog legs, which means tubocurarine prevents the contraction of muscle. For the phenomenon that the response amplitude of Frog 3 was higher than 1 and 2, we did not wait for enough time for the tubocurarine to have an effect on the muscle. Also, since frog leg 2 had the longest waiting time when we were doing the experiment (due to the order), the difference of amplitude before and after injection was the highest. Possible errors could be the accuracy of machines and the time we waited was not enough. For further experiments, we should inject different amounts of 1mM-tubocurarine into the gastrocnemus muscle and compare the effect. Finally, we came to a conclusion that the injection of 1mM-tubocurarine to gastrocnemus muscle in frog leg will prevent its contraction.
