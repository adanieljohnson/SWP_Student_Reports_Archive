Title: The Effect of Light Availability on Buckwheat Resource Allocation 

Abstract:
This lab pertains to the resource allocation of Buckwheat plants when altering the amount of sunlight they receive. In doing this the aim was to investigate the ways in which one group of plants would react in comparison to another group receiving less light than another. The results of the study did not support the initial hypothesis made thus requiring further testing. Both the t tests done on weight and length of the buckwheat plant served as insignificent or significent but disproving the hypothesis. The initial focus of the shoot length due to light was ultimately shifted to investigate the ways in which the root tissue was expanded in order allocate water. 

Introduction:
Resource allocation is a major part of survival within an environment specifically for plants because plants are stationary thus they must adapt in order to receive adequate resources. Some of the ways in which plants are able to achieve this is by achieving a large a longer shoot when requiring more sunlight, or putting new tissue growth into a vast network of roots when water becomes scarce. This adaptation in order to survive has allowed plants to live in all which then shapes their very structure. Thus for this experiment I investigated how the Buckwheat plant’s resource allocation was affected by light availability. The Buckwheat was the perfect model plant to choose for several reasons specific to this experiment. First, Buckwheat is a crop plant, so the information that is gathered from the data can be applicable to  real life farming and resource allocation on a larger scale. Secondly, Buckwheat is cheap and grows quickly, so the experiment was kept inexpensive and within a short time frame which was helpful for the time period provided. Thus the Independent Variable of this experiment is the root to shoot ratio of Buckwheat whereas the dependent variable is the amount of sunlight received by the plant and this will allow us to see how resource allocation is affected. Based On my prior knowledge of the topic I predict that the root to shoot ratio will be higher for plants with unlimited light availability compared to plants with a varying light source (natural light). 

Materials and Method:
To test this hypothesis I underwent a series of steps in order to ensure as much precision as possible. Initially to plant the Buckwheat we planted approximately 10 seeds per container (5 containers total) in order to ensure that I would have enough specimens to perform the experiment. The buckwheat was planted in containers that were filled with Miracle Grow and vermiculite allowing for more rapid growth. The buckwheat were grown for two whole weeks and where watered once a day, by a different member in the lab group everyday except for on the weekends. To measure how much the buckwheat was watered we decided that the plants had been adequately watered when the soil was moist. The controll group in this experiment was the plants that received limited light in (natural light) whereas the buckwheat that was receiving unlimited light was in the experimental group. First I harvested 1 to 10 buckwheat plants from the natural light condition Group by pulling the buckwheat directly out of their trays. then I wash the plants in their container with adequate water so that I could pull them apart from the soil and then gently drive them. then ayhan selected four different buckwheat plants to be tested on. next I weighed the entire plant and Recorded the data. I calculated the route to shoot mass by cutting off the shoot and weighing it. To calculate just the root mass I subtracted the shoot Mass from the whole weight of the buckwheat plant. Then I separated the root from the shoot by cutting the plant at the base of the route. After this I measured the shoot length and root length to the nearest millimeter and then recorded the mean and standard deviation of each group. after this I repeated the same exact process for the plant that were in the 24-hour Light Group. 


Results:

1→ controll (natural light)
2→ experimental group (unlimited light)

One tailed T-Test:
Root:shoot weight Ratio: (t value: 4.935387, p value: .001308, degrees of freedom: 6) → SIGNIFICANT
Root: shoot length ratio: (t value: .0776, p value: .470335, degrees of freedom: 6) → NOT SIGNIFICANT

Discussion:
Based on the information gathered from our results, our hypothesis is not supported by the data we gathered because we predicted the root:shoot ratio would be larger for the plants within the unlimited light group compared to the natural light, our data did not match our initial prediction. As it turned out the root to shoot ratio for the unlimited light was actually smaller than the controll group with natural light. Upon doing a one-tailed T Test our route to shoot ratio in terms of weight was significent (t=4.94, d.f.=6, p=0.001) but disproved our hypothesis, whereas the route to shoot length ratio was not significent (t=.078, d.f.=6, p= .47) so we would have needed to do further testing anyway in order to use it to support a claim. The mean of the controll group root to shoot weight was 0.1493 +/- .0276 compared to the root to shoot weight ratio of the experimental group which was 0.055 +/- .0259.  this data does not support our hypothesis because the root to shoot ratio Of the unlimited life group was smaller because the weight of the shoots were bigger. one potential reason for this is that there was more photosynthesis occurring within the plant because they received 24 hours of light a day.  this is a potential reason as to why the hypothesis was incorrect. a second possibility is that the data gathered had nothing to do with the buckwheat shoots and sunlight because both groups received Because both groups received adequate sunlight and sus it was not the limiting reagent. but rather it's possible to data was constructed based off of varying root weights.  the mean weight of the limited light Roots was larger than the unlimited light roots  because the roots were filled with more water. This is because the unlimited light water evaporated more quickly so there was less water to absorb into the roots. Some limitations of the study are that when we clean the plants out of the water extracted them from the soil they were so delicate that they were subjected to breakage in The Roots as well as dirt and Tangled in The Roots contributed to an incorrect weight error. Additionally the plants were watered by different people every day and not at all on the weekends. This inconsistency with watering the plants makes the experiment  more variables than just light. In order to improve this study a more consistent and regular watering schedule would be imperative. to tie it back to beat biology the roots are an imperative part of the plant in terms of resource allocation. Because light was not unlimited resource the focus on the plant would be to receive adequate water and soil nutrients with the network. Dust the root height would have a larger difference because the water was the resource that was more limited.
