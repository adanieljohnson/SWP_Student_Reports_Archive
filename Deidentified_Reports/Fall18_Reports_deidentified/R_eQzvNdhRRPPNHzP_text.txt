Title: The Effect of JH imitator on the Weight of Manduca Sexta Larvae

Abstract:
The ability to control the timing of the Manduca sexta’s lifecycle would be an important contribution to the scientific community as the organism is considered a pest for its damage to plants and crops. Also known as the Tobacco Hornworm, the Manduca sexta is regulated by the Juvenile Hormone (JH), which signals to the organism when it is large enough to pupate and transform into a moth, a non-pest state. In this study, a treatment group of larval Manduca sexta were fed a JH imitator in their normal, alongside a control group, which were given water as their diet supplement. Over the course of the fourteen-day experiment, the specimens were weighed and observed. While the mean difference in weight from the first day of experimentation to the last was greater in the treatment group than in the control, statistical analysis found this result to be insignificant. While the findings did not support a weight-gain effect of JH on larval Manduca sexta, the study suggests additional directions for future exploration and identifies a gap in knowledge of the effect of JH supplements to the physiology of the Manduca sexta. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta, or the Tobacco Hornworm, experiences a holometabolous life cycle, transforming from egg to larvae to pupa to adult, providing the species the benefit of avoiding competition for resources between larvae and adult individuals. Two hormones, among many, work together to regulate growth and passage through the stages of development: Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E). Before the Commitment Pulse—when the Manduca caterpillar begins metamorphosis—JH drops and 20E rises in comparison, signaling to the organism that it is ready to make preparations to pupate (Steel, 1985).
By manipulating the levels of JH in a Manduca caterpillar’s system, it may be possible to artificially control the timing of its lifecycle. Because the Manduca sexta is considered to be a pest in its caterpillar form, experimentation to test this idea might prove helpful and relevant. To answer this question, it is necessary to collect the comparative weights of Manduca caterpillars fed a JH supplement (or a suitable alternative to mimic its effects) with its normal diet to a control group that is not. I hypothesize that the mean difference in the starting weight and ending weight will be greater in the caterpillars fed Pre-Cor (an alternative to JH) than those who are not.


Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were selected and divided evenly into a control of four members and a treatment group of four members. Each group was allotted a plastic container and each container had four compartments to hold each member of the group in isolation. The compartments were numbered according to the animal number and a small hole was poked in each compartment to allow the organisms inside to breathe. Each caterpillar was weighed before being placed in their respective container and compartment and these measurements were recorded as the starting weights. All caterpillars were housed in an incubator and every two days over fourteen days, the caterpillars were observed, and weights were recorded to provide insight to the researchers later on. Upon each visit, each caterpillar received 10g of food. In addition, the control group diet consisted of 5 pipet drops of water per 10g of food, and the treatment group diet consisted of 5 pipet drops of Pre-Cor JH imitator per 10g of food. This schedule was followed faithfully, until the 13th day of the experiment, when weather and institutional operations prevented caterpillar visitation for a few days. While observations and record of weights for this time period are not available, the Manduca sextas had enough food leftover after the break in experimentation. 

Results:
By the 14th day, the mean difference in weight was greater among the caterpillars in the treatment group than among the caterpillars in the control group (Figure 1).
 
	It was also observed that  while all members of the control group had pupated, all members of the treatment group remained in the larval stage.


Discussion:
	Past research has indicated that JH regulates the weight of the pharyngeal gland in worker honey bees, such that the dry weight of the gland was higher in bees with high JH activity than in bees with low JH activity (Lüscher, 1982). This finding, however, was not replicated in total weights of the Manducta sexta larva subjects as anticipated. The mean difference in weight of the control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the treatment (t-stat=1.2231, df=6, P=0.261). Because the null hypothesis could not be rejected, these results do not support that JH imitator diet supplement causes weight gain in Manducta sexta larva. 
In another study, a plant producing Juvenile Hormone III was found to result in the underdevelopment of ovaries in the Melanoplus seguinipes that were exposed to it (Toong, 1988). This finding suggests that the hormone can have an adverse effect on the physiology of insects, perhaps including the Manduca sexta and could help explain the absence of a significant change in weight between the treatment and control groups as expected. Further research using more experimental groups fed varying percentages of JH imitator would contribute a better idea of the effects the hormone has on development.
