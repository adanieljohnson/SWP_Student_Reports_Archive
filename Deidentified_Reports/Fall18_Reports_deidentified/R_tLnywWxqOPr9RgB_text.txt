Title: The condition-dependent effect of increased carbon dioxide on photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea leaves 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process that occurs in plants and various organisms that turns sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into oxygen and energy in the form of glucose. Photosynthesis is regarded as one of the most important processes as it provides the air that all terrestrial organisms need to breathe. This experiment tested the impact that increased carbon dioxide, a key component in photosynthesis, would have on the rates of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea leaves using the Hill reaction and DCIP as the electron acceptor. The hypothesis predicted if the amount of carbon dioxide increases, so will the rate of photosynthesis. The experiment was performed by using three groups: one containing only water, another containing half water and half carbonated water, and the last containing only carbonated water. The results did not correspond with the prediction as the water group had a higher percent change in absorbance than the half-water, half-carbonated water group. Additionally, the percent change in absorbance of the carbonated water group was not too much higher than that of the water group. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which all plants and certain types of other organisms, like bacteria, synthesize energy in the form of glucose, by using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water, which subsequently releases oxygen. Chloroplasts are the structure with in the plant cells that absorb the solar radiation, allowing photosynthesis to occur. Spinacia oleracea, also known as spinach, performs photosynthesis, like all other plant species, to transform light energy into chemical energy, which can be used by the plant for other processes, including cellular respiration which transforms the glucose into ATP through glycolysis. Thus, photosynthesis is the most pivotal process that any plant can perform. Photosynthesis can be affected by a variety of factors including acidity of the environment, herbicides, nutrients available, temperature, sunlight, and carbon dioxide. For instance, increased carbon dioxide affects plants by increasing photosynthesis, dry matter production, and yield [Lawlor: 1991]. As stated above, carbon dioxide is a key component in the photosynthetic process. In a study performed by Basal Acock, he also acknowledged that there are many potential effects of increased carbon dioxide including, an increase in the rate of photosynthesis and decrease in the rate of transpiration. An increased rate of photosynthesis occurs because an increase in carbon dioxide causes an increase of carbon being absorbed into carbohydrates for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis [Acock: 1990]. Additionally, he stated how there are factors that could limit a plant's response to an increase in carbon dioxide including, light, temperature, nutrients, and water. However, these factors interact in a complex way, which makes plant response to increased carbon dioxide contingent on the environment and conditions [Acock: 1990]. In the experiment performed, the effect of increased carbon dioxide was tested using the hill reaction, which measures electron transfer in the presence of chloroplasts and light. DCIP, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, was used as the alternative electron acceptor since it is a light sensitive compound as there is a color difference between reduced and oxidized DCIP [Johnson: 2018]. In a study done by Norman Good, he found that the rate of photosynthesis based on the Hill reaction was slower in the absence of carbon dioxide, than when carbon dioxide was present [Good: 1963].Thus, we predict that as the amount of carbon dioxide increases, so will the rate of photosynthesis. 


Materials and Methods:
The preparation of the experiment began by preparing isolated chloroplasts. First, five spinach leaves were deveined and grinded up in a mortar and pestle. To make a paste, 10 mL of grinding buffer was added, followed by another 10 mL of grinding buffer. The paste was then poured through cheesecloth into a beaker to the separate the solid particles from the liquid. This was then transferred to a centrifuge tube, which was then spinned at 200G for three minutes at four degrees celsius. Then, the supernatant was transferred into a different 50 mL centrifuge tube, which was then centrifuged at 1000G for ten minutes at four degrees celsius. The supernatant was then poured out into a beaker and 20 mL of grinding solution was added. The experimental stage began by obtaining ten test tubes and separating the test tubes into four groups: one blank test tube and three groups of three test tubes. labeling 10 test tubes 1-10. The test tubes were then split into four groups. These test tubes were filled accordingly. The blank test tube contained 8 mL of water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The three water test tubes contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. The three half water-half carbonated test tubes contained 3 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM of DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 3 mL of carbonated water. Finally, the three carbonated test tubes contained 2 mL of 130 mM of DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer, and 6 mL of carbonated water. Additionally, 100 microliters of chloroplasts were added to every tube. Each solution was then transferred to cuvettes and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm. After each absorbance was measured, all samples were placed in light for ten minutes. The absorbance was then measured again for each sample at 600 nm. This process was repeated two more times, waiting for a total of 30 minutes. In the end, the percent change of each group at each time interval was compared to one another by using a one-way anova test with an alpha value of 0.5. 


Results:
The percent change in absorbance varied between each group. After twenty minutes, the percent change in absorbance decreased for all groups and then increased again after thirty minutes. The largest percent change observed was in the carbonated group, closely followed by the water group. This is displayed in figure 1, as the overall percent change after thirty minutes is similar between all three groups. Additionally, the standard deviation for the water group was larger than both groups containing the carbonated water as shown in figure 1. The results collected were not statistically significant for any of the time intervals. At the ten minute interval, degrees of freedom(df)=2, Fs=0.771, and the p-value=0.503. At the twenty minute interval, df=2, Fs=1.42, and the p-value=0.313. At the thirty minute interval, df=2, Fs=0.026, and the p-value=0.94. 


Discussion:
The results conflicted with the hypothesis as the rate of photosynthesis increased for not only the carbonated water samples, but also the water samples as well. The hypothesis was supported as the percent change in absorbance was the highest for the carbonated water group. However, the water group had a higher percent change than the half water/half carbonated water group (figure 1), which does not correspond to the prediction made. The percent change in absorbance decreased after the twenty minute interval for all three groups and then increased again after the thirty minute interval (figure 1). This indicates that the rate of photosynthesis was similar for all three groups, despite the presence of carbonated water. A reason for this occurring is the change in pH. DCIP is a compound that is blue in nature when it is oxidized. When the DCIP was added to the carbonated water, there was a color change from a blue to a lilac purple. Thus, the carbonated water may have decreased the pH of the solution, making the solution more acidic when carbonated water is present. It is known that when carbon dioxide reacts with water, there is an increase in hydrogen ions, which subsequently lowers the pH. In a study done by An Long, the effect of a low pH on photosynthesis was studied. It was found that a low pH will inhibit seedling growth and leaf carbon dioxide assimilation [Long: 2017]. This means that if a plant is in an acidic environment, the plant is unable to absorb and use the carbon dioxide that is present properly. Additionally, in this study it was acknowledged that a low pH decreased the rates of photosynthesis and transpiration [Long: 2017]. This further indicates that if the carbonated water reacted with the DCIP to make the environment around the chloroplasts more acidic, then photosynthetic rates would decrease because of the inability to assimilate carbon dioxide properly, thus affecting the photosynthesis that is occurring. Similarly, another study that focused on the effect of pH on seagrass indicated that the reason why photosynthesis decreases when the pH is lowered is because of the dissolved carbon dioxide availability [Invers: 1997]. In another study done by Norman E. Good, it was found that carbon dioxide influences the Hill reaction rate when the light intensity is saturating or nearly saturating [Good: 1963]. When the experiment was performed, there was not much light intensity. This suggests that the increased carbon dioxide did not have a significant effect on the absorbances of the samples as there was not enough light available. This is supported by Basal Acock’s study, in which he recognized that although increased carbon dioxide levels tend to increase the rate of photosynthesis, there are many limiting factors that affect this claim including light and temperature [Acock:1990]. Good also mentions how the Hill reaction is not dependent on carbon dioxide [Good: 1963], further supporting the results as the data collected was not statistically significant as mentioned in the results because all the p-values were too high. Thus, increased carbon dioxide may increase photosynthesis if it is in a specific environment. If the environment is not light saturated and acidic then, the effect of increased carbon dioxide is negligible.
