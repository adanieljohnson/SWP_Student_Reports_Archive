Title: The Effect of Increasing Juvenile Hormone on Development in Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta caterpillar is a tobacco leaf defoliator native to North and South America. Pest controll options have been explored in the attempt to controll this pest to manipulate their maturation, as they are only a pest when in their larval form. In this experiment, a JH+ group of four caterpillars were given Juvenile Hormone in their food for two weeks and were compared to a controll group of four caterpillars. At the end of the two weeks, the average maximum masses of the JH+ group were statistically significently higher than the average maximum masses of the controll group. The controll group also progressed into the pupal stage of development, unlike the JH+ group which remained in the larval stage. This concludes that the addition of Juvenile Hormone in Manduca sexta caterpillars does not allow them to progress into the pupal stage of development like normal. Juvenile Hormone should not be used as a pesticide on Manduca sexta caterpillars as it would keep the caterpillars in the larval stage longer and allow them to consume more tobacco leaves.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a moth native to North and South America. Naturally, the Manduca sexta has five larval instars that are each separated by a molting period. The progression of the insects’ development is driven by the presence or absence of several hormones [Byron: 2017]. One of these hormones is Juvenile Hormone (JH). Juvenile hormone is produced by the corpus allatum, glands located on either side of the foregut. In organisms, the role of Juvenile Hormone is to controll what the organism will become after a molt. If abundant JH is present, the caterpillar will molt into a larval stage caterpillar. If there is little JH, the caterpillar will pupate. In a case study in the lab manual, an experiment was previously conducted to determine the effects of giving Manduca sexta varying percentages of Blue Floss flower, a JH mimic, on length and mass the caterpillars when added to their food for one week [Johnson: 2016]. Similar to the case study, this experiment aims to discover the effect of increasing JH on the physical characteristics of the caterpillars, including mass. In contrast to the case study, this experiment also analyzes the development and maturation of the caterpillars, including the length of time until pupation, over the course of two weeks. I hypothesize the increase in JH will result in the caterpillars growing larger in weight(grams) compared to the controll group. I also hypothesize the caterpillars treated with Juvenile Hormone will not pupate and therefore remain in the larval stage until they die.

Materials and Method:
 Eight caterpillars were randoMly divided into two groups of four, controll group and JH+ group. Each group was placed in a container with four separate wells for each caterpillar. Each day, the caterpillars were given ten grams of food. The JH+ group was given four drops of Precor solution mixed in their food per day. The masses of each caterpillar were obtained each day. Qualitative observations, such as color and activity, were recorded each day.  The experiment lasted for two weeks, and the final weights of the caterpillars were recorded. A two-sample one-tail​ t_test was conducted to determine if the average maximum growth was significently different for caterpillars given Juvenile Hormone compared to a controll group. 

Results:
Both groups began at similar average weights with a standard deviation with 0.0864g. The JH+ Group began to have larger average masses than the controll group after only a few days, and after two weeks the difference between the average masses was very significent(Figure 1). All of the masses for the JH+ group were larger than the mass of the controll group(Table 1). The averages of the maximum changes in growth of the caterpillars were plotted and were used to conduct the two-sample t_test.  The results of the two-sample t_test are (t=5.603, d.f.=6, p= 0.000689).The JH+ group also had a higher average maximum mass, 16.88g  SD = 2.02g, than the average maximum mass of the controll group, 9.74g SD =1.58g, after two weeks(Figure 1).  As the experiment progressed, the JH+ group became a lighter blue and consumed and defecated considerably more than the controll group. All the caterpillars in the Control Group pupated after thirteen days. 

Discussion:
The results of the two-sample t_test indicate there is a significent difference in maximum growth between the JH+ and the controll groups over the course of two weeks. Since the caterpillars in the JH+ group did not pupate, and all the caterpillars in the controll group did, there is evidence to assume increasing JH has an effect on the time in which Manduca sexta pupate. Naturally, the Manduca sexta will decrease in weight just before pupating[Nijhout: 2006]. These decreases in weight can be seen in the controll group but not seen in the JH+ group(Figure1). This is further evidence that the addition of JH interferes with the natural timeline of pupation. The presence of abundant Juvenile Hormone at the time of the molt from the 5th instar to the pupa results in the 5th instar larva molting into a larger larval instar sometimes called the 6th instar. In order for the Manduca sexta to pupate, the JH levels must fall below the ecdysone levels[Johnson: 2016]. Since additional JH is added to the caterpillars, the JH levels will not fall below the ecdysone levels, and the caterpillars are unable to molt into the pupa stage.  This is why the caterpillars in the JH+ group experienced an increase in size at the same time the controll group formed pupas, as the JH+ group molted into a 6th larval instar[Johnson: 2016]. In the future, a similar experiment to this one could be conducted over a larger period of time to see if a group of caterpillars given extra Juvenile Hormone would eventually form pupas. As stated in the hypothesis, the caterpillars in the JH+ Group had a higher average mass than the caterpillars in the controll group at the end of the two weeks and did not pupate. In addition to the hypothesis, the JH+ Group also had a higher average maximum mass than the controll group over the course of the two weeks. In regard to pest management, it can be concluded that adding Juvenile Hormone will inhibit Manduca sexta caterpillars from progressing into the adult stage. Since Manduca sexta are not considered pests as adults, Juvenile Hormone should not be given to the caterpillars as it will cause them to remain in the larval stage and as pests.
