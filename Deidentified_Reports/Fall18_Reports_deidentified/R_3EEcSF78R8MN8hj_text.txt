Title: The Effects of Juvenile Hormone on the Development of Manduca Sexta Measured Through Average Weight Gain

Abstract:
Abstract: This experiment explores the effects of giving the Manduca Sexta excess Juvenile Hormone and the effects it has on its life cycle. By treating the treatment group with a Juvenile Hormone imitator (precor), we were able to compare the weights of the larva with and without the excess hormone. After the 14 day period, we calculated the average weight gain of both the control and the treatment group. We hypothesized that the treatment group would gain significantly more mass than that of the control group. The data was analyzed using a T-test which resulted in a T- value of 1.22. Since this value is smaller than .5, the data is statistically insignificant and the hypothesis was rejected. 

Introduction:
Hormones play a vital role in the growth and development of most organisms. Hormones allow for the regulation of homeostasis of organic systems as well as allowing changes of the body to occur. For example, hormones control the homeostasis of calcium levels in humans, while also allowing puberty to occur. The type of hormone, along with the cell it targets, dictates the effect it will have on the organism. This is true for the Manduca Sexta, which is studied in this experiment. The Manduca Sexta goes through metamorphosis which requires a major transformation [Hatem:2015]. It goes through a series of 5 Instars in which it molts until it finally becomes a pupa. During this molting phase, the outer layer of the caterpillar goes from its thick cuticle made out of varying ploidy levels into a thinner one [Nardi: 2018]. This transaction requires a division of cells and changing of ploidy levels all of which are initiated through hormones[Nardi: 2018]. Both Juvenile hormone and Ecdysone, moderate the process from the insects larval stage into adulthood. In this experiment, we explore the ways in which the ratios of these hormones affect the development of the larva. The hypothesis of this experiment is that if we give the Manduca Sexta a juvenile hormone imitator, it will inhibit pupation allowing the mass of the treatment group to be significantly larger than that of the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment eight Manduca Sexta of relatively equal size were selected.  Four caterpillars were assigned to the control group while the other four were assigned to the treatment group. Each group was placed into a plastic container that was divided into four cells (so that they were in the same container but separate from each other). A hole was punctured in each cell to ensure the caterpillar could breathe. Both containers were labeled and each cell was numbered in order to keep track of the data. Then, each caterpillar was weighed and the data was recorded. After placing each caterpillar in its assigned cell, 10 grams of food were prepared for each caterpillar. The control group was mixed with 5 drops of water while the treatment groups was mixed with five drops of precor. The containers were then capped and stored in an incubator. The caterpillars were observed and weighed every other day. Their food was regularly changed in order to make sure it wouldn’t dry out. After a 14 day period, the difference between their weights was taken and the average difference in weight for each group was calculated. In order to analyze the statistical significance of the data, a two sample T-test was used and the P- Value derived was a two tailed P- value. 

Results:
The results of the experiment consisted of a control average of .4575 and a treatment average of 1.9375 (figure 1). The standard deviation among the control group was 2.026 while the deviation between the treatment group was 1.336. The degree of freedom is 6. The two tailed P value is .267. Every caterpillar in the control group was pupating by the seventh day. On the contrary, by the seventh day each caterpillar in the treatment group was not pupating and seemed very stiff almost as if dead. The control group weights generally increased initially, then decreased around the time of pupation. The treatment group on the other hand seemed to increase mass by a smaller amount, but barely lost weight throughout the 14 days if at all. 

Discussion:
Giving the Manduca Sexta a synthetic form of Juvenile hormone did not support our hypothesis stating that they would grow significantly.  As shown in figure 1, although the results show a trend similar to that hypothesis, the changes in mass were not statistically significant. Although the hypothesis of this experiment were rejected, other studies have been shown that indicate a correlation between juvenile hormone and the prevention of metamorphosis. One study showed methoprene was directly correlated in preventing the Tobacco Hornworm from pupating [Meng: 2018]. This can be explained through the ratio of Juvenile hormone and Ecdysone in Manduca Sexta. During the larval stages of their life cycle Juvenile hormone is high while Ecdysone is low. When the larva is ready to start pupating, Ecdysone levels rise while Juvenile hormone levels drop. By giving the larva the excess hormone, the larva is unable to pupate and thus continues to increase in size in the larval state. It is possible that five drops of methoprene is not enough Juvenile hormone to make an adequate difference in the size of the larva. This study is important for many reasons. For one, it is important for the understanding of the importance of hormones in the regulation and changes in an organism. In this case, the Juvenile hormone regulates the larval stage, while a spike in ecodyne initiates the start of the metamorphosis process. This study is also important for the study of pest control. By manipulating the hormones of certain pest, it would be easy to eliminate pest problems without having to use hazardous pesticides. Future studies could focus on the exact ratio in which this happens, and can explore the effects of the two hormones further.
