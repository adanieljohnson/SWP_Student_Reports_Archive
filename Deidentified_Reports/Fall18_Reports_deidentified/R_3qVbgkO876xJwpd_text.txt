Title: Effects of NaCl Concentrations on the Photosynthetic Activity of Kale

Abstract:
Photosystem II and photosystem I are both vital reactions in the overall process of photosynthesis. Both processes are light-dependent reactions that use photons captured from the sun in order to extract electrons from water molecules. This extraction causes the water molecules to be cleaved into oxygen and H+ molecules, therefore resulting in a proton gradient in the plant cells which drives ATP synthesis. In the conducted experiment, various concentrations of NaCl were added to enriched chloroplast samples taken from kale leaves and their photosynthetic activities were measured using spectrophotometry. It was hypothesized that due to the salt stress, the photosynthetic activity of the plant would decrease. Based on the results, it was determined that the photosynthetic activity of the kale did not decrease as the concentration of NaCl increased. However, it was noted that the photosynthetic activity did decrease over time. In order to gather more information about the effects of salt stress on photosynthetic activity, future experiments should be carried out over longer periods of time as more time may have a better influence of the effects that NaCl could have on the kale’s photosynthetic activity. 

Introduction:
In order to survive, all living organisms must extract energy from at least one external force. For example, plants capture and store energy from the sun in a process called photosynthesis. The stored energy is then released in a process known as glycolysis, which is one of the main processes involved in cellular respiration. More specifically, plants take in carbon dioxide and water, and with the help of sunlight, convert it to glucose and oxygen. The glucose, which is the energy source of the plants, is broken down into pyruvate which is then utilized to form the high energy molecules adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and NADH, necessary in order for the plant to have energy, [Johnson: 2016].
	During the process of photosynthesis, there are two light dependent reactions: Photosystem II and Photosystem I. These reactions are responsible for generating the proton gradient within the cells of the plant that drive the synthesis of ATP which gives the plant energy. Photosystem II is the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. During this reaction, photons from the sun are captured and are used to extract electrons from water molecules, therefore, causing the cleavage of the water molecule into oxygen molecules, which bubble out, and hydrogen ions, which are used to drive the synthesis of ATP as a result of a proton gradient. Electrons continue to travel through the cytoplasm of the plant and flow into Photosystem I. During this reaction, the electrons reduce NADP+ to NADPH, which is then used in the Calvin cycle, the light-independent reaction in the process of photosynthesis, [Johnson: 2016].
In the conducted experiment, the effect of different concentrations of a saline solution on the photosynthetic activity of kale leaves was observed. It was hypothesized that as the concentration of the saline solution increased, the photosynthetic activity would decrease. This was hypothesized because, according to a study conducted by P. Sudhir and S.D.S Murthey, when there is an accumulation of intracellular sodium ions due to salt stress within the plant, the ratio of K: Na changes, which therefore affects the processes of photosynthesis [Sudhir: 2004]. 

Materials and Method:
Two main procedures were carried out in this experiment in order to test the effects of salt and time on photosynthetic activity in kale. In the first procedure, enriched chloroplasts were obtained for use in the second procedure. In the first procedure, the pertinent equipment was a RT-7 centrifuge, six 50 Ml centrifuge tubes (3 for the chloroplast solution and 3 for the balance), grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), kale leaves, and cheesecloth. The first step in the experiment was to place a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and three 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into a bucket of crushed ice to cool. While the equipment was cooling, the veins of a large kale leaf were removed and discarded and the remaining kale leaf was rinsed with water. Next, the kale leaf was ground with 10 Ml of the grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) in the cooled mortar and pestle until a thick paste formed and no large pieces of kale leaf remained. At this point, another 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the kale leaf solution and ground up more. Then the solution was strained in cheesecloth and the collected solution (approximately 30 Ml) was placed in a cooled 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “A” and was spun in the RT-7 centrifuge at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4℃ with a balance tube (30 Ml water). Once the solution was spun, it was then carefully transferred to another 50 Ml centrifuge tube labeled “B” so that the pellet at the bottom of tube “A” remained in the bottom of tube “A.” Centrifuge tube “B” was spun under the same conditions and the solution was carefully transferred to a tube labeled “C” so that the pellet in “B” remained in “B.” 20 Ml of grinding buffer was then added to the pellet in centrifuge “B” and was gently mixed. This solution is what was used in the second procedure of this experiment. 
	In the second procedure of the experiment, the pertinent equipment was a spectrophotometer set to read at 600nm, 16 test tubes, 16 cuvettes, saline solution (1M, 0.5M, and 0.1M), 130 mM DCIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). The first step in this procedure was to prepare 16 test tubes, each labeled 1-16. In test tube #1, 8 Ml of distilled water and 2 Ml of reaction buffer was added because this test tube is the blank, which was used to set the spectrophotometer. In test tubes #2-4, the effects of 1M saline were being tested so 6 Ml of 1M saline solution, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer were added. In test tubes #5-7, the effects of 0.5M saline were being tested so 6 Ml of 0.5M saline solution, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer were added. In test tubes, #8-10, the effects of 0.1M saline were being tested so 6 Ml of 0.1M saline solution, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer were added. Test tubes #11-13 were the positive controlls so 6 Ml of 0M saline (water), 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer were added to the test tubes. Test tubes #14-16 were the negative controlls so 6 Ml of 0M saline (water), 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer were added to the test tubes. The second step in this procedure was to add 100 µL of the chloroplast solution prepared in procedure one to test tubes #1-13 (all test tubes except for the negative controlls). Immediately after the chloroplast solution was added, the test tubes were mixed and the absorbances of the mixtures were read using the spectrophotometer that was blanked at 600nm with the blank solution in test tube #1. The test tubes were then placed in the light and after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes, the absorbances of the samples were measured again in the spectrophotometer that was set to 600nm All results were recorded and a paired two-sample t_test was run in order to analyze results.


Results:
In this experiment, two main procedures were carried out in order to test the effects of salt and time on photosynthetic activity in kale. The goal of the first procedure was to obtain enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation that would then be used in the second part of the procedure, which was quantifying photosynthetic reduction activity using the Hill reaction. The results of the experiment indicate that over time, the photosynthetic activity in the kale leaves decreases. This can be seen in Figure 1 because over time, the percent change in absorbance decreases. However, the results don’t show a strong correlation between the amount of salt stress and photosynthetic activity. In Figure 1, it can be noted that the sample in which the greatest percent change was seen was the sample treated with 0.1M saline followed by 1M then 0.5M. This indicates that the photosynthetic activity was the lowest in the 0.1M saline solution. The line representing the negative controll in Figure 1 has the lowest percent change in absorbance over time, as no chloroplasts were present in the solution, and therefore, no photosynthetic activity. In order to better interpret the results of the experiment, three paired t_tests were performed: 1M and 0.5M, 1M and 0.1M, and 0.5M and 0.1M. The respective results are as follows: p_values of 0.220, 0.146, and 0.135. These p_values indicate that the results of the experiment are not statistically significent.


Discussion:
The initial hypothesis of the experiment was that when kale leaves are placed under salt stress, their ability to photosynthesize will decrease over time. Based on the results of the experiment, and the p_values that are not statistically significent, the hypothesis cannot be supported. It was expected that the 1M salt solution would have the greatest negative effect on the photosynthetic activity of the kale, followed by 0.5M and 0.1M. However, the results showed that the kale leaves treated with 0.1M saline had the greatest percent change indicating the least amount of photosynthetic activity followed by 1M then 0.5M.
	According to a study conducted by Sebastiano Delfine, the accumulation of salt in spinach leaves will first inhibit photosynthesis by decreasing stomatal and mesophyll conductances to CO2 diffusion and then it will impair ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, the enzyme responsible for converting CO2 into energy-rich molecules, [Delfine: 1999]. While this isn’t the reaction in photosynthesis we were directly studying, the results of the experiment are what we were expecting: for photosynthesis to be inhibited/have decreased activity when placed under salt stress. 
A possible explanation for the insignificance of the results could be that the salt solution was not present in the enriched chloroplasts for a long enough period of time before the photosynthetic activity was measured. In a study conducted by JDS Garcia, the photosynthetic activity of mangrove plants was tested in various concentrations of saline solutions. This study was conducted because many plants, especially those in coastal climates such as mangroves, are constantly exposed to various levels of salt stress based on their environmental conditions, and the researchers were curious as to how they grew in fluctuating levels of salinity. In the study, mangrove plant seedlings were harvested and placed in various concentrations of saline solutions for a period of 30 days. The experiment did not yield significent results, however, when the mangrove plants were exposed to longer periods of higher salt fluxes, the plant growth was noted to be affected [Garcia: 2017]. 
As evident by the experiment conducted by Garcia, time is an important factor in the effect that salt can have on the photosynthetic activity of a plant. In order to continue testing the effects of salt stress on the photosynthetic activity of plants, future experiments should be carried out over longer periods of time, such as multiple months instead of just 30 minutes. By doing so, the salt has a better chance of affecting the photosynthetic activity of the kale, and more significent results may be discovered.
