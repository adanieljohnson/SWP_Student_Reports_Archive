Title: Effects of the addition of Calcium to Rania Pipiens Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
The effect of ions and ion channels is an important topic in nerve and muscle study in comparative physiology. When trying to understand what makes living things move and react to stimuli, it is important to understand how a certain chemical will affect the internal processes of plants and animals. In this experiment, we look at the effects of injecting calcium directly into the gastrocnemus muscle in the leg of the Rania pipiens frogs. The expectation was that the additional calcium ions would open more ion channels in the muscle, releasing more acetylcholine, thus creating a greater amplitude when stimulated by the sciatic nerve than the legs before calcium was added. However, our data and statistical tests showed no significent difference in amplitude of muscle twitch between the frog legs in their controll state and their experimental state.

Introduction:
Rania pipiens is a frog that is used as a model organism in laboratories. These organisms are vertebrates, so their skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction. Nerve impulses cause the release of acetyl choline from the presynaptic nerve terminal. This neurotransmitter binds with Sodium ions which open sodium channels that generate action potential. Action potential then spreads throughout the length of the muscle fiber, causing the release of calcium. This ion activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, which causes it to move [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium ions do this by targeting proteins in the muscle fiber called troponin. This attack allows actin and myosin to bind to contract a muscle [Rüegg: 1986]. Due to calcium’s activating nature, a calcium overload in muscles, especially those that have started to atrophy, can promote skeletal muscle breakdown, which can cause the cytoplasmic calcium not to be released in organisms, thus limiting muscle contraction [Gao: 2014]. Our group hypothesizes that if we add calcium to the gastrocnemus of one frog leg, then it will have different muscle contraction strength, in the form of amplitude, than before the addition of calcium.

Materials and Method:
First, we obtained three frog legs, each to be used as its own controll and subsequently as the test group. We prepared all three legs by skinning them and separating the sciatic nerve from the inside of the leg to make it easily assessible for electrical stimulation. Next, one frog leg was hung from the equipment by the Achilles tendon so that the gastrocnemus of the leg was at a 90-degree angle from the tray. The sciatic nerve was then directly stimulated at an interval of 0.2 voltages from 0.2-2.0 volts at 4 Hz. The nerve was pulsed ten times, and the amplitude was recorded each time. Following this controll, the gastrocnemus was treated with 0.1 Ml of calcium and waited one minute for the effects to take place. The sciatic nerve was then stimulated ten more times at the same intervals and voltage, and the amplitudes were recorded. This process was repeated on the remaining two frog legs. Once all of the data was recorded, we used a paired t_test to determine if the calcium causes a significent difference between the controll and experimental tests at 1.4 voltage

Results:
The mean difference in amplitude at 1.4 voltage was -0.268 [figure 1]. The standard deviation of amplitude in the controll group was 0.601 and the standard deviation of amplitude in the experimental group was 0.435. The p_value after performing a paired t_test was 0.182. The paired t_test value was greater than 0.05.


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if we add calcium to the gastrocnemus of one frog leg, then it will have different muscle contraction strength, in the form of amplitude, than before the addition of calcium, was not supported by the experiment because results for the experiment were not statistically significent. This means that we accept the null hypothesis that Rania pipiens that receive additional calcium in muscles do not have stronger muscle contraction than those that do not receive additional calcium. Compared to the mean values, the standard deviations for the amplitudes were relatively large. This is because the results from The first frog leg were much lower than the amplitudes from the second two frog legs. I think that a possible reason for this difference could be that the frog that the leg came from had been dead for a longer amount of time or that the sciatic nerve was partially damaged and not using it’s full power. Potential explanations for the general results of the experiment could include that the gastrocnemus muscles of the frogs could have fatigued from the repetitive stimulation before the addition of calcium ions. Additionally, results could have been different if the frog were alive to circulate the calcium injection as well. Throughout the experiment, we noticed that the baseline for the amplitude after the addition of calcium was higher than for the controll. We interpreted this observation as the muscle tensing up with the additional calcium. This could have been an example of Gao’s findings that a calcium overload inhibits calcium release from inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Gao: 2014]. However, our results only indicate that we cannot rule eliminate the possibility that the differences in amplitude were through chance. This study provided data of the effects of calcium on muscle twitches which more specifically provides information concerning the effects of excess calcium at the sight of neuromuscular junctions in animals. If the study were to be conducted again, it would be beneficial to focus on muscle tetany rather than muscle twitch amplitude because that would show a more long-term effect of additional calcium.
