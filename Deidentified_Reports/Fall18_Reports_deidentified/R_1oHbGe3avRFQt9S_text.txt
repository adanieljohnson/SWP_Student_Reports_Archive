Title: The Effect of Sunlight Intensity on Field Pea Biomass

Abstract:
It is well known that plants need sunlight to grow, but to what degree does the amount of sunlight plants get affect their biomass? In this experiment, we observed the biomass accumulation of pea plants (Pisum sativun) in direct sunlight and under a shade to reduce sunlight exposure. Because of this, plants exposed to a higher light intensity will have a different mean biomass than the plants exposed to a lower light intensity. Thirty pea plants were grown in direct sunlight, and another thirty were grown under a shade. These peas were planted as seeds and were watered for ten days. After the ten days, the pea plants were cleaned and their masses were measured for pea plants grown under high and low light intensity. The pea plants grown under a shade had a higher mean biomass (1.57 g) than those grown in direct sunlight (1.47 g). However, these results were not statistically significent (P = 0.3409), so these results do not support the hypothesis. 

Introduction:
It is well known that plants need sunlight to grow. This information is fundamental to photoautotrophs; plants need sunlight to grow, develop, and carry out life processes. Light is an important limiting factor when it come to plant development, growth, and biomass accumulation [Yasin: 2016]. Plants use captured light energy to convert water, minerals, and carbon dioxide into oxygen and organic compound filled with energy in photosynthesis [Lambers: 2018]. At medium to low light intensities, there is a direct relationship between the rate of photosynthesis and light intensity. The rate of photosynthesis increases as light intensity increases. Experiments have established that there is a trade-off between quick growth in high light intensity and survivorship in low light intensity [Kitajima: 1994]. When there is competition for light (for instance, in a canopy), plants may be exposed to different intensities of light [Yasin: 2016]. Reductions in light intensity impacts the balance of photoreceptor phytochrome. The phytochrome system regulates important plant responses to stimuli, including flowering, chloroplast development, leaf aging and separation. Plant use hormones to affect behavior as a response to stimuli. One of these types of hormones are auxins, which are formed in young growing plant organs [Berry: 2018]. Auxins are transported away from shoot tips and prompt cells to elongate and occasionally divide. Auxin distributions are responsible for phototropic responses like plant growth toward sunlight. Therefore, sunlight is greatly important to plant growth because of its role in photosynthesis and auxin hormones. Field peas, or Pisum sativun, are herbaceous annual legumes [Encyclopedia of Life: 2018]. Like all legumes, field peas are able to host nitrogen-fixing bacteria and maintain a symbiotic relationship [Smith-Martin: 2017]. Field peas should exhibit a response to sunlight that is similar to angiosperms. Therefore, I hypothesize that plants exposed to a higher light intensity will have a different mean biomass than the plants exposed to a lower light intensity.

Materials and Method:
Seeds were soaked for thirty minutes before they were planted. While the seeds were soaking, twelve four inch by four inch pots were labeled. The twelve pots were filled to the top with vermiculite. The vermiculite in all pots were pre-watered and miracle grow was added to all twelve pots. After the seeds had soaked for thirty minutes, five seeds were planted in each pot. The five seeds made the same pattern as five dots on a dice would. Using a finger, an indention was made in the vermiculite about two or three times deeper than the seed’s size. The planted seeds were covered with vermiculite. Six of the pots were treated with direct sunlight in a greenhouse, and the other six were placed under a shade to reduce the intensity of the sunlight. The pea plants were watered daily for ten days. After the ten days had passed, three random pea plants were carefully removed from each replicate pot to keep the roots intact. There were eighteen total plants from both treatment groups measured. The vermiculite was rinsed off the roots and patted dry. Each plant’s mass was measured and recorded. The mean mass and standard deviation of each treatment groups were calculated. A two tailed two-sample t_test was used to analyze these data at the ɑ=0.05 significance level. 

Results:
The plants in direct sunlight had a mean biomass of 1.57 +/﹣0.32 g (Fig. 1). The plants under the shade had a mean biomass of 1.47 +/﹣0.33 g (Fig. 2). The difference between the mean pea plant mass in the shade and the mean pea plant mass in the sunlight was not statistically significent (t_stat = 0.9659, d.f. = 34, P = 0.3409). 

Discussion:
My hypothesis, that the plants exposed to a higher light intensity would have a different mean biomass than the plants exposed to a lower light intensity, was not supported by these results. While there was a slight difference in the means, that difference was not statistically significent. These results could be due to the possibility that the difference in light intensity was not great enough to show significent results. Because the rate of photosynthesis increases as light intensity increases at low to medium light intensity, we thought that the mean biomass of the two treatment groups would differ [Lambers: 2018]. Perhaps using multiple shades would reduce the light intensity enough to reduce auxin production to an extent that would restrict growth and biomass accumulation. Additionally, another reason why these data did not produce statistically significent results could be because this experiment was conducted over a short period of time: only ten days. The plants did not use up their stored nutrients from their seeds (the seed was still visible on all the pea plants), so they did not have enough time to begin relying on photosynthesis to generate chemical energy. Given these possibilities, running a similar experiment for a longer period with more treatment groups could produce more convincing results.
