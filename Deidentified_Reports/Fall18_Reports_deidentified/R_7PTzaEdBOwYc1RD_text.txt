Title: The effect of lanthanum chloride on calcium channel in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
Rana pipiens is a northern leopard frog. They experience neuromuscular systems unique to animals. Motor neurons connect with muscle cells at synaptic junctions. A neurotransmitter is released at the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors that depolarize the muscle cell and generates an action potential. The action potential causes a release of a calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum generating a muscle contraction. We hypothesize that if calcium channel blockers are injected into the gastrocnemius muscle then the threshold of response will increase because the calcium channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum that triggers the contractile movement is inhibited. Three Rana pipiens frog legs were used as the control group then the gastrocnemius muscle was injected with lanthanum chloride and used as the experimental group. The threshold of the control and experimental group was observed. The first control exhibited a threshold higher than than the experimental, disproving our hypothesis. However, with the second and third frog leg, the experimental groups threshold was higher than the control. The anomaly of the first trial could be caused by human error or different neuromuscular effects of lanthanum chloride. A paired t-test gave us a p-value of 0.76, rejecting our hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Neuromuscular systems are unique to animals: the skeletal muscle is the basis for thousands of tiny, cylindrical, fussed aggregated called myofibers. Bound through connective tissue, myofibers form functional groups which thus make up skeletal muscle. At neuromuscular junctions, motor neurons and the muscle cell interact through synapse and acetylcholine (ACh) is released. The release and subsequent binding of ACh to receptors triggers an action potential that releases calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomeres in order to contract the muscle [Mezochow: 2010]. If the calcium channel is blocked, there will be no release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and muscle contraction will be inhibited. In order to contract, the muscle will need to work a lot harder because there will be no great release of calcium to trigger the muscle to shorten. In this experiment, we will observe the mechanism affected with and without calcium channel blockers in frog legs from Rana pipiens. We will track the activity and response through the iWorx software. We will be observing the response of the gastrocnemius muscle. We hypothesize that if calcium channel blockers are injected into the gastrocnemius muscle then the threshold of response will increase because the calcium channel that triggers contractile movement is inhibited. 



Materials and Methods:
We used three separate frog legs from Rana pipiens and isolate the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle by separating the sciatic nerve from the muscle tissue. We cut the achilles tendon of the frog leg. The leg hung from a contraption by its achilles tendon with the sciatic nerve laying on the experimental plate with the gastrocnemius muscle extended in air. The iWorx software was connected to a BNC connector in the gastrocnemius muscle record the voltage response of the muscle to various stimuli. Three separate frog legs were used and their response was recorded from stimulus through iWorx software with no injection. The stimuli started at 0.1 V, increase by 0.1 V until the threshold was found in each separate frog leg. This group acted as the control and the threshold of each was recorded. Then the same three frog legs were injected with 0.2 milliliters of lanthanum chloride into the Gastrocnemius muscle each. The same voltage was applied with an increase in 0.1 V until the threshold was reached. We observed the response of the three frog legs to the same stimulus and recorded the threshold again. A paired t-test was run with an alpha value of 0.5. 


Results:
Frog leg #1 control threshold was higher than the experimental threshold by about 0.2 V as seen in Figure 1. The threshold for the experimental for frog leg #2 was greater than the control by 0.2 V. Frog leg #3 experienced a threshold 0.1 V higher in the experimental than in the control. A paired t-test was run with the raw data from the experiment and the t-value recorded was 0.35 with a degrees of freedom of 2. The p-value was 0.76.  

Discussion:
We failed to reject the null hypothesis with a statistically significant result and rejected that the threshold of the response of the contractile muscle increased as a result of calcium channel blockers. Acetylcholine is released at the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the muscle cell. This activation results in an action potential that releases calcium into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in order to contract the frog muscle. When a calcium channel blocker is applied to the muscle, the calcium channel that leads out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcomeres is blocked and the process will halt. The muscle will not be allowed to contract if no calcium binds to the sarcomeres, or the muscle will need to work a lot harder in order to contract the muscle because there is no great influx of calcium into the sarcomeres. In the first frog leg, the addition of lanthanum chloride seemed to excite the contractile mechanism rather than inhibit it. In Mezochowâ€™s study, the effect of lanthanum chloride as a calcium channel was studied in crawfish to see if it would yield the same results of another study on plants that showed lanthanum chloride as a efficient calcium channel blocker. Their results showed that lanthanum chloride did not inhibit the calcium channel in the crawfish. This discovery may indicate that the lanthanum chloride functions differently in plants or does not have the same effect on animals. Lanthanum chloride might also have the ability to affect different neuromuscular pathways differently [Mezochow : 2010]. Due to the different responses of our frog legs, we also may be able to deduce that lanthanum chloride was able to block calcium channels in Rana pipiens and the first frog leg showed different results because of human error. The tension of the string had to be altered between the first and second frog legs which yielded different results. The first trial was compromised by human error of placement. Our hypothesis was rejected and may have been supported if we ran more trials. Use of this experiment with other inhibitors or agonists on the calcium channel would allow these theories to be further explored and further understanding of the calcium channel in Rana pipiens.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Thresholds of Rana pipiens legs from various stimuli. Three frog legs were used and injected with lanthanum chloride, a calcium channel blocker. Each frog leg acted as the control and then the experimental when the lanthanum chloride was injected into the gastrocnemius muscle. The frog leg was tested by stimuli voltage until the threshold of contractile movement was found. Each bar represents the twitch threshold in volts.
