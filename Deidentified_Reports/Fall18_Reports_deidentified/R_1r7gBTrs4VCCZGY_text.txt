Title: Effect of various salt concentrations on photosynthetic activity in kale leaves

Abstract:
In this study, we examined the effect of various salt concentrations on photosynthetic activity in kale leaves, measured through absorbance. Photosynthesis is the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen and utilizing carbon dioxide to help the plant function. The light-dependent reactions of Photosystems I and II utilize photon energy to help carry out photosynthesis. This is accomplished through reactions with the excited electrons. These electron transfer reactions were measured in our lab to test the photosynthetic activity of kale leaves under various levels of salt stress. It was our hypothesis that as the salt concentration increased, the electron transfer reactions, and thus the rate of photosynthesis, would decrease. To test this, we measured enriched chloroplasts treated with one of three salt solutions at different times up to half an hour. Although photosynthetic activity decreased with time, it remained the highest in the samples containing the salt solutions. In the future, this experiment should be tested over a longer period of time and including the light-independent aspects of photosynthesis as well.

Introduction:
Plants undergo a process called photosynthesis to extract energy from the sun. This stored energy can be released in plants through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen, glucose, and water in the equation shown below: 6CO_2+12H_2 O→C_6 H_12 O_6+6H_2 O+6O_2   One important aspect of photosynthesis is the processes of Photosystems I and II. These are the sites of the light-dependent reactions. These reactions use absorbed photons to generate reducing power. Photosystem II uses photon energy to move electrons out of the chlorophyll and cleave O2 from water molecules and create an H+ gradient. Photosystem I uses photon energy to drive excited electrons out of the chlorophyll and produce NADPH. In this lab, we were trying to measure electron transfer reactions, which are light-dependent, in chloroplasts. [Johnson 2018]. To do this, we will use the DCPIP indicator, which can be used to determine factors which affect reduction reactions. DCPIP is a blue indicator that becomes colorless in the presence of high photosynthetic activity. In this lab, we looked to determine the effects of various NaCl concentrations on photosynthetic activity. One study found that the accumulation of salt in spinach leaves inhibits photosynthesis by decreasing the conductance of the stomata and mesophyll involved in carbon dioxide diffusion. [Delfine 1999]. Given the knowledge of how the plant as a whole was affected, we aimed to explore how this same effect of inhibiting photosynthesis would be present in ground pieces of a leaf. Another study noted that salt stress had various inhibitory effects on photosynthesis [Sudhir 2004]. We elected to test photosynthetic activity in the plants at various levels of NaCl concentrations. It is our hypothesis that as the levels of NaCl increase, the photosynthetic activity will decrease.

Materials and Methods:
To complete this experiment, we isolated the enriched chloroplasts from kale leaves through differential centrifugation. For this procedure, we used an RT-7 centrifuge, 6 50mL centrifuge tubes (3 for chloroplast solution and 3 for balance), grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0), kale leaves, and cheesecloth. We first placed a mortar and pestle, medium beaker, and 3 50mL centrifuge tubes on ice. We then obtained 1 large kale leaf and removed the central vein. Next, we ground the kale leaf in the mortar and pestle with 10 mL of grinding buffer until we began to form a paste. To help continue grinding the leaf, we added an additional 20mL of the grinding buffer to get the kale leaf into a thick paste, with no large pieces of the leaf remaining. The solution was then strained through 3 layers of cheesecloth and placed into a chilled centrifuge tube. We spun the tube with our balance at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4C. Once the solution had finished spinning, we transferred the contents to a new centrifuge tube, careful not to transfer the pellet at the bottom. This tube was spun again, under the same conditions. The tube was then transferred to a new centrifuge tube, again careful not to transfer the pellet. 20mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet portion of the second tube, and gently mixed until the pellet was distributed throughout. This solution was then used for the next procedure of the experiment.  In this procedure, we first prepared 16 test tubes, labelled blank and 1-15. The blank contained 8mL of distilled water and 2mL of reaction buffer (this was used to set the absorbance on the spectrophotometer). Test tubes 1-3 each contained 6mL of 1.0M NaCl, 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL reaction buffer. In each of test tubes 4-6, there were 6mL of 0.5M NaCl, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL of reaction buffer. Test tubes 7-9 each contained 6mL of 0.1M NaCl, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL reaction buffer. Test tubes 10-12 were the positive controls, and each contained 6mL of 0M saline solution (distilled water), 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL reaction buffer. The negative controls were test tubes 13-15, each containing 6mL 0M saline solution (distilled water), 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, and 2mL reaction buffer. Next, 100µL of the chloroplast solution from the first procedure was added to the blank and test tubes 1-12 (all test tubes excluding negative controls). We then mixed the test tubes and measured the absorbance of each at time 0, after 10 minutes, after 20 minutes, and after 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer set to 600nm. To test whether our data was statistically significant, we performed a paired two-tailed t-test.

Results:
Over time, the photosynthetic activity in the kale leaves decreased for all the samples, though the p-values (0.220, 0.146, and 0.135) indicate our data was not statistically significant. We observed the highest absorbance in 0.5M solution, although both the 1M and 0.1M solutions had higher absorbances than the positive and negative controls [see Figure 1]. The negative control had the lowest absorbance rates, as was expected. There was a general trend of absorbance decreasing with time observed in all samples. The absorbance was the highest after 10 minutes for the 0.5M solution, and after 20 minutes for all other solutions [Figure 1]. The p-value of the 1M solution was 0.220, of the 0.5M solution 0.146, and of the 0.1M solution 0.135. None of these are statistically significant.

Discussion:
Overall, our hypothesis that the photosynthetic activity would decrease as salt concentrations increased was not supported by our experimental results. Although over time the photosynthetic activity did decrease, the absorbance remained highest in the 0.5M solution, rather than the positive control, as was expected. The fact that the 0.5M solution maintained the highest absorbance, and thus the highest photosynthetic rate, may illustrate that plants need small levels of salt nutrients in order to maintain their homeostatic processes such as photosynthesis. The p-values here indicate that our data was insignificant for all three NaCl concentrations. One study indicated that saline concentration affects mainly “CO2 assimilations… and the intrinsic efficiency of water.” The chlorophyll a was not significantly affected. [Garcia 2017]. This could indicate that possibly the areas most affected by high salt concentrations are not the light dependent reactions as we initially presumed. Thus, further study of the light-independent reactions and other photosynthetic components must be carried out before we can definitively state the effect of salt solutions on photosynthetic activity. Another explanation for the insignificant results could be exposure time. In the future, this experiment should be carried out over the course of multiple days to properly measure the effect.
