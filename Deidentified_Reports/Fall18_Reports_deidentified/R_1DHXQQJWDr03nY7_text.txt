Title: The Effect of Supplemental Juvenile Hormone on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment supplemental Juvenile Hormone was given to the insect Manduca Sexta through the chemical Precor. The reason this was tested, is to evaluate using hormones as a pest control system instead of using pesticides that directly kill the insects. Juvenile Hormone is necessary to the survival and development of Manduca Sexta.[Johnson:2017] 8 caterpillars were evaluated 4 given normal food and water and 4 were given food with precor. They were masses and evaluated over a 2 week period. The average increase in mass for the control group was 5.32 g and the average increase in mass for the experimental group was 8.1 g. The mean of the control group was not statistically significantly different from the experimental group (t=1.9 degrees of freedom = 5, P = 0.11). Some caterpillars in the control group were also seen to pupate and no caterpillars in the experimental group pupated. Based on this data precor affects the development of the caterpillar significantly as no experimental caterpillars entered the 5th instar of development.[Johnson:2017] Even though the chemical effected the caterpillars it is questionable whether or not it should be used as a pest control method because no Manduca Sexta died as a direct result of the Precor.


Introduction:
The chemical precor is said to contain Juvenile Hormone(JH) in it which is necessary to the survival of the Manduca Sexta and its development. In this experiment the affects of supplemental JH to the Manduca Sexta’s diet is being tested.[Johnson The reason this is being tested is because Manduca Sexta larvae are classified by the FDA as pests but the adult Manduca Sexta is not classified as a pest. So, the chemical precor could be used as a pest control method without the use of pesticides. These pesticides are classified as third generation pesticide because precor directly effects the insects development through the change of JH.[Banerjee:2002] The Manduca Sexta development is divided into different stages called instars. At the 5th instar the hormone JH drops and the hormone ectysteroid (20E) has a small rise. This point is called the commitment pulse. This pulse happens when the larvae is big enough and has enough resources to go through metamorphosis[Johnson:2017]. We hypothesize that the introduction of supplemental JH to the Maduca Sexta’s diet will never allow the commitment pulse to happen and the larva will continue to grow and eat then subsequently die due to the lack of a commitment pulse. 


Materials and Methods:
8 Manduca Sexta of similar age were taken and split into experimental and control groups. The control group was given The Great Lakes Manduca diet and it was prepared according to manufacturer instructions. 10g of the food was given with 3 drops of water to the control group. The experimental group was given 10 g of the Great Lakes Manduca diet with 3 drops of precor and then it was mixed.[Johnson:2017] The food was replaced every two days and Manduca Sexta was subsequently massed. The average change in mass over the two weeks was compared between the control group and the experimental group. A paired T test of the data was then taken after results were gathered.


Results:
Over the 2 week period the Experimental group were larger but remained the same color and in the same instar. The Control groups had gotten large with an average increase of mass of 8.1g but towards the end of the two week period some began to pupate and turned into a brownish color and began to lose mass due to the process. One caterpillar could not be counted in the data because it died 2 days into the experiment and no data was collected. After the paired T-test was performed the p value came out to be .11 which is not statistically significant.


Discussion:
Based on average change in mass shown in figure 3 it is obvious that the precor had an effect on Maduca Sexta’s growth and development. On average the experimental group had grown 3 g larger than the control group. The development of Manduca Sexta was also affected because some Larvae in the control group began to pupate and turn brown. None of the Larvae in the experimental group began to pupate. Based on this qualitative data the commitment pulse was affected by the chemical precor due to the supplemental JH added to the caterpillars diet.  In conclusion the data was shown to be insignificant and the growth differences were not significant. Although, the commitment pulse was never achieved and the caterpillar still fed to try and grow until it was ready to pupate. In terms of a pest control method, this is not a viable option because the experimental group were still larvae which are still considered to be pests and no death occurred as a result of the precor as well.
