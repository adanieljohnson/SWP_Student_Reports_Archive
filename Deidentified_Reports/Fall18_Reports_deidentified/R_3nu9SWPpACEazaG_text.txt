Title: The Affects of 20E Inhibitors in Manduca Sextas

Abstract:
 In this experiment, our purpose of our investigation was to find out the effects of a 20E inhibitor (an IGR) on Manduca Sextas. To understand this experiment one must understand the life-cycle of Manduca Sextas. We designated 4 Caterpillars as the experimental group and mixed their food with an E20 inhibitor. We found that those fed the E20 inhibitor all died before reaching the 5th instar, ergo not being able to pupate.  Polcyn states in his experiment, “ The dynamics of growth and the timing of release of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) in final instar larvae of Manduca sexta”.  The experimental on Day 9 is: 1, 1.6g, 2.10g, 3, DEAD, 4, DEAD. On Day 14, Control group’s data is: Control 1, 2.76g (PUPA), Control 2, DEAD, Control 3, 2.32g, Control 4, 2.91g. The Experimental group data is: Experimental 1,2,3,4 DEAD.  In other study, Bollenbacher states,  “During the final larval instar of the tobacco hornworm the presence of juvenile hormone (JH) inhibits the secretion of the brain's prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)...A functional failure of this normal mechanism is apparently responsible for the developmental standstill of Lepidoptera which diapause as mature larvae.”

Introduction:
In this experiment, we took eight caterpillars designating 4 as controls and 4 experimental. For this lab, we needed to know the eight stages of metamorphosis in the Manduca Sexta. The life cycle is as follows: first, they are eggs, 2-3 days later the caterpillar graduated to the first instar larva, 2-3 days later the caterpillars graduated to the second instar larva. This process is repeated until after 5th instar larva. After 5 days the 5th instar larva is called a pupe, 19-23 days later the pupa turns into an adult moth. The main hormone in insects that are used in development, molting, a formation of the pupa and emergence of adults is controlled by 3 hormones: prothoracicotropic/brain hormones, are mostly produced by the corpus cardiacum and regulates the release of ecdysterone by prothoracic glands, ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development and adult functions, the juvenile hormones regulate the type of molt. It also affects the insect growth regulator. 
We hypothesize that if a Manduca sexta experiences high amounts of IGR, then the insect will not live passed the pupa stage. If exposed to an E20 inhibitor, the caterpillar​ (experimental group) will not exceed the 5th instar of development (will not pupate) due to the change in hormones levels. 

Materials and Methods:
We choose eight caterpillars weighing .5-2 grams were selected and divided into two groups of four. We labeled four caterpillars as control and four as experimental. The control group was fed their food mixed with water, meanwhile the experimental group’s food was mixed with the E20 inhibitor. Each caterpillar received 10 grams of food. Then we kept all caterpillars in a cooler at 28*C. We measured and recorded their weight every 2-3 days.

Results:
The control group data is as follows (On Day 1): Control 1, .91g, Control 2, 1.08g, Control 3, .83g, control 4, .68g. Experimental data (On Day 1) is: Experimental 1, .94g, Experimental 2, 1.23, Experimental 3, .70, Experimental 4, 1.28g.  The control group data (On Day 3) is: Control 1, 2.96g, Control 2, 1.84g, Control 3, 1.65, Control 4, 1.20g. The experimental group data (On Day 3) is: 1.49g, 2.24g, .68g, 1.97g. On Day 6, the food was replaced with new, fresher food. On day 7, the data is: Control 1, 3.20g, Control 2, 4.20g, Control 3, 2.80g, Control 4, 4.90g. The Experimental Group (On Day 7) is: Experimental 1, 1.60g, Experimental 2, 2.20g, Experimental 3, DEAD, Experimental 4, 1.80g. On Day 9, the data for the control is, 1, 3.0g, 2, 2.6g, 3, 2.50g, 4,3.6g. The experimental on Day 9 is: 1, 1.6g, 2.10g, 3, DEAD, 4, DEAD. On Day 14, Control group’s data is: Control 1, 2.76g (PUPA), Control 2, DEAD, Control 3, 2.32g, Control 4, 2.91g. The Experimental group data is: Experimental 1,2,3,4 DEAD.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was correct because; all experimental caterpillars had died, insinuating that they did not live past the 5th instar stage. We observed significant differences between groups as well as differences between the caterpillars appearance when we first start recording date, until the last day. One of our control caterpillars had died. We can conclude that this is “normal” in an environmental setting because not all caterpillars will live to the pupa stage in the wild. Although, the remaining three caterpillars had metamorphosed into pupas. This further underscores our hypothesis because 75% of our caterpillars that did not receive the E20 inhibitor lived until the pupa stage.
