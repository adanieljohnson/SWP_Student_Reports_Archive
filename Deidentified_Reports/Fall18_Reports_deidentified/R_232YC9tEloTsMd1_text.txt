Title: Effects of Calcium on muscle contraction in Rania Pipien frog legs

Abstract:
Just like hormones, muscles and nerves allow an organism to sense and respond to different forms of stimuli. This includes amphibians like the Rania Pipien, which have thousands of individual myofibers that are bound together by their connective tissue. The release of acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction allow these muscle filaments to contract, depending upon the strength of their action potentials. In our study we wanted to observe the different levels of muscle contraction of the gastrocnemus muscle from electrical stimuli using electrodes. We also added the element calcium to our treatment group, in order to see if this group showed an increase in their force of muscle contraction compared to our controll group without the calcium injection. Considering that calcium plays an important role of muscle contraction, we hypothesized that once we injected the frog leg with calcium, then the force of the muscle contraction will increase. We set up an experiment using 4 Rania Pipien frog legs, divided into 2 groups. We observed the different forces of muscle contraction in our controll group using many different voltage amplitudes with our electrodes. The same was done with our treatment group, but with the addition of injecting the frog legs calcium. In the end, we found t

Introduction:
Skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates consist of cylindrical, multi-nuclear cells call myofibers [AD Johnson: 2018]. These myofibers are bound by connective tissue which allow them to be functional in the body of the organism. These skeletal muscles are controllled essentially by motor neurons, which are axons that branch out to innervate groups of individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. In Rania Pipiens, these motor motor neurons are triggered by action potentials, which are triggered by internal or external stimuli. Action potentials are the driving force that allow the release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction. The release of ACh is the final step that sends signals to the muscles to contract according to the strength of the action potential. Calcium is the element that fuels muscle contraction. It is pulled from the blood in order to go into muscle cells. Having too much or too little calcium has a direct effect on an organism’s action potentials and muscle contraction. According to an article found in Developmental Biology, Nicholas Cross states in one of his calcium experiments that “activation potentials were elicited by Ca2+ injection into either region, but the initial depolarization of the activation potential was strikingly slower when Ca2’ was injected” [Cross: 1981] … This excerpt shows how Cross’s injection of calcium had a direct effect on the speed of the action potentials in Rania pipiens. 

Materials and Method:
First, we started by placing 4 frog different frog legs onto our lab tray. 2 for our controll group and 2 for our treatment group. We then proceeded to deskin each of the frog legs so that the gastrocnemus muscle and sciatic nerve were both exposed. We then tied thin sewing thread around each of the frog legs so that they could be suspended over our lab tray. This made it easier to insert our electrode over the sciatic nerve. Next, we stimulated both of our controll frog muscles with a variety of amplitude voltages. Once we recorded our data, we did the same thing afterwards with our treatment legs, but with the addition of 0.1 Ml of 50 millimoles calcium injected into each treatment leg. For both legs we closely observed the level of contractions for each amplitude voltage, while also making sure that our legs were well moist with the ringer solution. For our results we used a paired t_test for our p_value, along with a mean for the average difference between the frog legs without the calcium and the frog legs with calcium. 

Results:
After collecting our average forces of contractions in Figure 1, it was shown that our treatment group had a lower mean than our controll group. Our dependent variable was the force of the muscle contractions in volts, and our independent variable was the amplitude voltage that we used for each round of stimulation. We calculated a mean of -0.099 for overall difference between the averages in both groups and found a found a p_value of 0.001222. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was a significent difference in our data, but our hypothesis was not supported. In our results it was shown that the injection of calcium into the gastrocnemus muscles had a negative effect of the forces of contraction for our treatment group. As for the frog legs in our controll group, they displayed a very noticeable difference in force during their contractions. Our p_value proved that our treatment process definitely had an effect on our data, since our p_value was less than 0.05. This also means that our results were not simply due to chance and that they were a direct effect of our treatment. An idea for future experiments could be to manipulate the amount of calcium injected compared to the amount that we used. There is a pretty good chance that if we had used less than 0.1 Ml of Ca, our contractions would have been a little stronger compared to our controll group.
