Title: The effects of Red light on the weight and length root:shoot ratios in Buck Wheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum)

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if red light has an effect on the weight and length root:shoot ratios in buck wheat plants. Red light, as absorbed by the chloroplasts, effects photosynthesis in plants. The hypothesis is that the red light plants will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the plants under normal sunlight conditions. In order to determine this, we will test a control group in normal sunlight and a treatment group under red light conditions with the same soil and the same amount of water for two weeks. After measuring and recording the weights and lengths of the roots and shoots in 12 treatments and control group plants, the root:shoot ratios were calculated. The main observation is that the mean root:shoot ratios for both weight and length did not show much difference, and statistical tests determined that there was no statistical significance to support our hypothesis. As a result, we were able to conclude that the root:shoot ratio for the red light plants were not higher than the control group plants. 


Introduction:
Plants live in environments that force them to adapt in order to enhance their chance of survival. Within these environments are both biotic and abiotic factors that pose challenges for the plants. These factors include coexisting plant species, sunlight, and temperature; how the plants respond to these external influences depends on how well they are able to thrive [Johnson: 2018]. Specifically, plants have to deal with sunlight availability and varying lighting. The resources that plants gather have to be allocated within the three main areas of the plant: the leaves, shoots, and roots. In environments with an abundance of light, resources are allocated to the leaves, as they are the main site of photosynthesis [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, we will be testing the growth of buck wheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) plants in normal sunlit lighting versus the same type of plants that are only exposed to red light. The hypothesis is that the red light plants will have a higher root:shoot ratio than the plants under normal sunlight conditions. The plants that are only exposed to red light will not be able to absorb any other wavelengths, and, as a result, this will lead to the allocation of resources to its roots. 


Materials and Methods:
In order to perform this experiment, four containers had to be acquired: two for control and two for treatment conditions. Each container was filled with the same soil and holes had to be made in each container to plant the buck wheat seeds. Multiple seeds were placed into each hole made in the soil to enhance the likelihood of plant growth. Then, 200 mL of miracle grow solution was added to each of the four containers followed by enough water to make the soil wet in each container. After labeling the containers, the plants had to be moved to the greenhouse with the control group in normal sunlight and the treatment group under the red-light tent that had been constructed. For the next two weeks, the plants had to be watered equal amounts every day. After two weeks, we removed the plants from the containers and washed off the soil. Six plants from each of the two control and treatment group containers were selected for a total of 12 treatment plants and 12 control plants. The root and shoot lengths then had to be calculated. Using a ruler, the plants’ roots were measured from the very tip to the root:shoot junction. The length of the shoot was then measured from the root:shoot junction to the first shoot:leaf junction. This process was then repeated for each of the remaining plants and the lengths were recorded. In order to measure the weights of the roots and shoots of each plant, the roots were cut from the plants at the root:shoot junction and then weighed. The shoot with all of the leaves and branches were then weighed as part of the shoot calculation. This process was then repeated for the remaining plants and the weights were then recorded. From this data, the root:shoot ratios for both length and weight could be calculated. An unpaired two-tailed t-test then had to be used to test for statistical significance.


Results:
The mean root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were not significantly different from one another (weight: t-test = 0.714, df = 22, p = 0.483; length: t-test = 0.0467, df = 22, p = 0.963). This can be seen in Figure 1 as there is not much difference in the bar heights for the control and treatment groups, especially for length. As seen in Table 1, the plants that were exposed to sunlight had a tendency to grow longer than the red-light plants (shoots: t-stat = 5.05, df= 22, p = 4.64E-5; roots: t-stat = 2.31, df = 22, p = 0.0308). However, our mean ratios were very similar in regard to weight (mean control 0.383 +/- 0.282, mean treatment = 0.318 +/-  0.144) and length (mean control = 0.576 +/- 0.156, mean treatment = 0.579 +/- 0.192). 


Discussion:
The main observation was that our mean root:shoot ratios for both weight and length were not significantly different from one another, as you can see in Figure 1. From this, we can see that our hypothesis was not supported by our data. Therefore, this suggests that the root:shoot ratio for the red light plants was not greater than the ratios from the control group. Additionally, it is important to note that the control group did appear to grow better than the treatment groups as their lengths and weights were almost all higher as seen in Table 1. However, their root:shoot ratios are still very similar. Also, due to the hurricane, we had been unable to water for two days, this could potentially have caused us to have inaccurate data by the end of the two weeks because we were unable to be consistent with our methods. Regardless of the results, it is important to mention that the red-light tent appears to have helped those plants retain water, as the soil was always extremely moist every day before watering. This could be something to explore in the future to see if it makes a significant impact on growth. In further research, red-light has been found to assist in stem elongation among different plants [Brown, et. al: 1995]. This research suggests that the presence of red-light may result in a lower root shoot ratio because red-light increases shoot growth versus root growth. This may indicate that the resources will most likely be allocated to the leaves/stem.
