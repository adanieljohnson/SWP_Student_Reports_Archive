Title: The Effect of Caffeine on the Growth of Physarum Polycephalum

Abstract:
This report details the effects of exposing a level of caffeine to Physarum polycephalum, also known as slime mold. This experiment is significent to the daily lives of human beings as this organism functions in similar signaling transduction pathways as people. By testing and analyzing Physarum, information on signaling within people can be tested as well — allowing for more information to be obtained in regard to how they work and effects of caffeine on the signaling pathways in humans. Caffeine is a common drug consumed by members of society daily, making this experiment relatable to the general population. Our experiment included 6 water agar plates from which 3 were soaked in caffeine. The Physarum reacted with 5 Ml of 1X stock solution of caffeine. This report also details the results of our experiment that matched the research done by prior scientists — showing that there is an increase in the growth of the organisms after the addition of caffeine. Our results were found to not be statistically significent in the growth of Physarum with caffeine versus no caffeine present. This showed that caffeine did not lead to a change in growth of the organism between our controll and experimental trials.


Introduction:
Cell signaling is a crucial part of the communication process. Through signaling, many of the cell’s activities are completed and regulated. In biology, cell signaling can be tested and analyzed with various species. For instance, Physarum polycephalum, also known as slime mold, is often tested for signaling. This is because it is a multinucleate syncitium organism — meaning it consists of multiple nuclei [Mohberg: 1971]. This unique feature of Physarum allows for many cell level processes to be observed at once. Furthermore, physarum utilizes many of the same transduction pathways as humans [Mohberg: 1971]. So, by studying Physarum, one can indirectly gain more knowledge on cellular signaling pathways in humans as well. Also, Physarum is easy to grow and fairly easy to handle. Overall, there are multiple characteristics of Physarum that make it the ideal organism for our laboratory experiment.

The Physarum Polycephalum can be regulated by two signaling pathways — one of which is the cAMP pathway. The cAMP pathway is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors [Simonds: 1999]. In detail, the pathway operates by a signal reaching the G-protein complex, which is a membrane bound receptor. This is an unique receptor since it is a heterotrimer, meaning it contains three different subunits  [Simonds: 1999]. The complex is activated once the alpha subunit is cleaved and the complex migrates to the effector enzyme. In terms of one of the G-protein coupled pathways, the effector enzyme is adenylate cyclase. Once this is activated, it can generate a second messenger which initiates a downstream effect of activating and the organism responding to the initial stimuli. This major pathway uses cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or more commonly known as cAMP, as a second messenger. A major component of this pathway is the conversion of ATP into cAMP. This allows the cAMP to diffuse through the cell and binds to several other substrates, such protein kinase A [Simonds: 1999]. Additionally, the protein kinase A is responsible for phosphorylating other enzymes, which can either activate or inhibit them. The cAMP signaling pathway can be halted by the molecule being broken down by phosphodiesterase [Simonds: 1999]. 

In a study done by multiple researchers, the effects of the cAMP signaling pathway was analyzed in terms of diseases and its functioning, especially in relation to metabolism. It was found that by inhibiting the cAMP pathway, the protein kinase A was not activated [Yan: 2016]. This resulted in no phosphorylation of other enzymes. In the species, they observed an increase in growth which they correlated to the lack of phosphorylation which would not silence certain enzymes [Yan: 2016]. In an experiment done by Kukulies, Stockem, and Wohlfarth-Bottermann in 1983, the impact of caffeine on the growth of slime mold was tested. Their experiment was conducted by inducing 15 mM of caffeine onto the surface of the slime mold which causes surface blebbing over the course of 5-90 min periods. As a result, the growth of the slime mold in the presence of caffeine decreased [Kukulies: 1983]. The caffeine constricted the cell and caused the phosphodiesterase to be inhibited, thus producing an excess of cAMP and over stimulating the slime mold [Kukulies: 1983]. 

Physarum functions by crawling and looking around for food — which is oatmeal flakes. Physarum also grows in a dark environment. In terms of our laboratory experiment, we provided the physarum with oatmeal flakes but opted to use water agar plates to prevent any external factors from effecting our results. This is because we solely wanted to observe the impact of caffeine and give the physarum only its standard conditions of growth. We chose to test the impact of caffeine on the growth of the physarum after 48 hours. Caffeine is a drug that many humans intake daily, thus it was one we found to be most relatable to the general population. Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase — which stops the cAMP mediated pathway. So, 
the Physarum would continue to migrate at a greater length, as observed in the previously mentioned experiment. This inhibition of the phosphodiesterase would also cause the cAMP to not break down. It is then expected that there would be an excess of cAMP left over in the cell to be used over and over again to exasperate the signal, thus resulting in the physarum growing more in relation to no caffeine present. With this knowledge, we hypothesized that there would be a statistically significent difference in the growth of the physarum soaked in caffeine versus the physarum left in normal growing conditions.

Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted in two parts — part one was constructed to properly prepare the petri dishes in order to have an equal number of controll and experimental groups. This was done in order to perform the rest of the experiment — testing the growth of the physarum with caffeine present after 48 hours. To start, all necessary materials were gathered. This included 20X stock solution of caffeine, a spatula, pair of tweezers, black sharpie, and a total of 6 water agar plates. Water agar plates were utilized instead of PDA plates in order to eliminate any external factors that could influence our experiment.

The experiment commenced by diluting the 20X stock solution of caffeine into 1X for the purpose of our experiment. The bottom of all 6 plates were labeled with the names of all group members, the date, and the section of lab. On the top of all 6 plates, the black sharpie was used again to draw a single 1 cm square. Once the stock solution was properly diluted, 5 Ml of the solution was added to 3 of the 6 water agar plates, which served as our experimental group. The plates were soaked in the caffeine solution for a total of 10 minutes. During this time, the 1 cm square was cut out from the remaining 3 water agar plates, also known as our controll group. The square was abstracted from the petri dishes using a sterilized spatula. Prior to starting, the spatular was rinsed thoroughly with alcohol and waited with a kimwipe. After 10 minutes had passed, the excess caffeine solution was poured out of the petri dishes in the experimental group. A kimwipe was used after to blot the petri dishes and absorb any remaining excess solution. The previous step of cutting out a single 1 cm square from the petri dishes was repeated for the experimental group. As before, the spatula was sterilized and used to carefully obtain the square. The Physarum was cut next and a square of the organism was placed within the 1 cm squares cut from each of the petri dishes. It was important to not touch the petri dish or to leave the dish open for too long in order to prevent any external material from entering the dish and contaminating our results. So, these steps were done fairly fast.

Once this was complete, 5-6 flakes were randoMly distributed around the physarum in all of the water agar plates. All 6 of the plates were taped in order to avoid them opening when checking on their growth later. The plates were carefully placed in a dark bag, acting as a ‘dark environment’ for the physarum to grow. The bag was labeled with all of the group members names, the date, and lab section. Finally, the bag was placed in a  locker in which the physarum would stay for 48 hours and experiment would be occur. After 48 hours, all 6 water agar plates were checked to record the growth. A standard ruler was used to measure the growth of the physarum extending from the center of the square to the longest extension. All of the results were recorded in a table. Once all of the data was collected, a one tailed t_test was run on the 3 experimental petri dishes containing the caffeine in comparison to the controll group — ultimately giving one p_value. This was used to analyze our data and determine the outcome of our experiment.

Results:
The first experimental trial showed an expected increase in growth. The remaining experimental trials showed significently lower growths in comparison to the first experimental dish. The average growth for the experimental group was found to be 2.63 cm. In terms of our controll group, there was a significent increase in growth for the first plate. After that, the remaining petri dishes displayed decreases in growth. However, the average growth of the controll group was found to be 2.73 cm. For this laboratory experiment, a one tail t_test was run on our data. The p_value was determined to be 0.47. The p_value was greater than the set alpha of 0.05.

Generally, all of the trials should a decreasing trend in growth after the first petri dish in both the experimental and controll group. Since there was an excess of raw data, our results for each group were averaged in Figure 1 so the difference in growth of the physarum could be displayed more clearly.

Overall, due to our p_value being larger than our set alpha of 0.05, this meant that there was no statistical significance between the results of our experimental group and controll. Since our results showed a decrease in the growth of the physarum upon the addition of caffeine — opposite of our hypothesis was true. This observance of growth along with the lack of statistical significance, led to us rejecting our initial hypothesis.

Discussion:
As mentioned previously, our hypothesis was rejected. Although, based on the experiments we evaluates, our results are fairly accurate in terms of consistency — meaning that the Physarum showed little growth in both the experimental and controll groups.

The results of our experimental group was supported by research done prior by multiple scientists. A case study was conducted in 1984 by Bremner and Thomas that found results which coincide with ours and can provide an accurate explanation for our decrease in growth. In their experiment, it was found that the caffeine blocks the activation of adenylate cyclase before ever inhibiting the phosphodiesterase [Bremner: 1984]. With the adenylate cyclase inhibited, the ATP would not be able to be converted into cAMP and therefore resulting in low levels of cAMP available in the pathway rather than an excess in the cell. This ultimately caused the decrease in growth of the slime mold [Bremner: 1984].

In terms of our experiment, although we intended to see an increase in growth, we obtained almost similar results in both groups. We had anticipated that the cAMP would remain active and the excess would cause the physarum to increase its’ signaling and growth. However, after looking at prior research, our thinking has shifted and we now understand why we observed a decrease in growth. In the future, we would try to reconstruct the experiment more efficiently so there could be a statistical significance observed in our results. This could be done by reducing the amount of time necessary to place the physarum in the designated dish in order to decrease chances of contamination. We would also have more samples in both our experimental and controll groups in order to get a larger sample size. Our results could also be expanded upon by checking for growth every 24 hours for 7 days in order to see if there was further growth with additional time. This experiment is important to understand since caffeine is a crucial component in the daily lives of many humans.  Of course, its effect on humans is a little different in terms of growth, but it is important to understand how the phosphodiesterase and cAMP levels are impacted by the presence of caffeine.
