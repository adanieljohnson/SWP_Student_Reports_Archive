Title: Effect of Increased Nitrogen Supply on Plant Phenotype Evaluated Through Root to Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
We are testing the effects of increased nitrogen on ORGANISM phenotype.  Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth and we hypothesize that the plants treated with nitrogen will have more growth in the shoot and therefore lower root to shoot ratios.  We watered the treatment plants with a nitrogen solution and gave the controll plants tap water in order to compare the effect of increased nitrogen in a two sample t_test.  Our data showed that, overall, the treatment plants did have lower root to shoot ratios, however, only the length ratios were significent (p_value-0.000184).


Introduction:
In this lab we are testing and observing the effect that increased nitrogen has on ORGANISM phenotype (phenotypic plasticity- plants ability to change how they allocate resources based on environmental conditions).  Nitrogen is one of the most limiting nutrient, with multiple ways to acquire it as well as allocate it.  Nitrogen is a major component of chlorophyll, which is needed to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide and it is also a major component of amino acids, which are needed to build protein.  If increase allocation of resources to the leaves, that would increase the plants growth rate- if nutrients and light are available- due to the fact that they are the principal photosynthetic organ.  Allocate more resources to roots if the plant needs to be more anchored or if there is a lack of nutrients in the soil.  I hypothesize that ORGANISM treated with excess nitrogen will have smaller root to shoot ratios.


Materials and Method:
After having the ORGANISM grow (watering the treatment plants with nitrogen solution and controll plants with regular water) we took 12 plants from each group.  We washed them and cut the roots from the stems right below the bean.  Next, we weighed and measured the length of the stems and roots by themselves in order to calculate the root to shoot ratios.  Finally, we used the root to shoot ratios in a two sample t_test (comparing length ratios and weight ratios separately).


Results:
According to the graph, it is evident that the treatment groups had smaller average root to shoot ratios in both length and weight in comparison to the controll group.  The average ratios of length differed more than the average ratios of weight.  Weight: t_stat-0.972, d.f.-22, p-0.342. Length: t_stat-4.487, d.f.-22, p-0.000184.


Discussion:
According to our p_values, the length root:shoot was significent, supporting our hypothesis, however, the weight root:shoot ratio was not significent.  We predicted that the treatment group would have smaller root:shoot ratios and we were correct.  This is explained by the fact that with excess nitrogen the treatment plants have more resources to photosynthesize and build proteins for growth while the controll do not [Lab Manual: 2018].  Also, the root lengths of the treatment are shorter due to the fact that they do not need to allocate as many resources to the growth of roots since there is no shortage of nutrients in the soil.  Plants grown in environments with nitrogen, drive growth production through the controll of the leaf area index, and there is a tight correlation between nitrogen supply, leaf distribution and leaf photosynthesis [Hirel: 2007].  This correlation is represented in our data: treatment had more growth due to increased levels of nitrogen supply.  It is important to know the effect of certain nutrients on a plant’s phenotype in order to be more successful in cropping and other scenarios in which particular phenotypes are favored.
