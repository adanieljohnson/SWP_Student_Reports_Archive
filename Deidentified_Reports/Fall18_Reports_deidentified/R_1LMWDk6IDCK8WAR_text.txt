Title: Effect of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea leaves on reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a three-stage process in which plants capture and store energy. 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol has been shown to serve as an alternative electron acceptor to measure the rate of electron transport. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the type of green plant, specifically Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea leaves, on reduction reactions required for photosynthesis through measuring the reduction activity of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol. While it was hypothesized that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would have a higher rate of electron transport than Spinacia oleracea, measuring the absorbance values of each sample over a period of 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer revealed that the type of plant, particularly its leaf thickness, does not play a large role in reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. Statistical tests comparing the control and experimental groups generated a p-value greater than 0.05, indicating that the results were not statistically significant.

Introduction:
In order to occur, many cellular processes need a source of energy, which can be obtained from three primary sources: chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as oxidation-reduction potential, or an electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. Plants capture and store energy through photosynthesis, a three-stage process that takes place in chloroplasts and requires light, chlorophyll, Mn²⁺ ions, electron transport complexes, and a phospholipid bilayer. It consists of light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions involve photosystems that absorb light to harvest energy, specifically producing ATP and NADPH, while the light-independent reactions contain RUBSCO, an enzyme complex that then uses the ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions to form glucose. As a whole, photosynthesis can be summarized by the equation 6CO₂ + 12H₂O  C₂H₁₂O₆ + 6H₂O + 6O₂ [Johnson: 2018]. A recent study examined how factors, such as carbon dioxide concentration, can have a different effect on photosynthesis for various types of plants. This study concluded that Brassica oleracea var. sabellica and Spinacia oleracea had varying CO2 compensation points due to a difference in their composition. The Spinacia oleracea CO2 compensation point was lower than that of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, indicating that some environmental factors do play a role in the rate of photosynthesis [Erwin: 2017]. Specifically, our experiment aims to evaluate whether the type of green plant, particularly the thickness of a green plant’s leaves, affects reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. In this experiment, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica (kale) and Spinacia oleracea (spinach) will be used – due to their accessibility and affordability – to test the effect of plant leaf thickness on the rate of electron transfer in photosynthesis. 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) has been shown to serve as an alternative electron acceptor to measure the rate of electron transfer. As 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol accepts electrons and is reduced, it changes color from a blue compound to a colorless one [Johnson: 2018]. The goal of this experiment is to measure and analyze how the rate of electron transport varies between different types of green plants, which will be accomplished by measuring the transmittance of light and determining absorbance values for the samples. We predict that kale will have a higher rate of electron transport in photosynthesis than spinach because kale has a thicker leaf. The increased thickness of the leaf means it has more intercellular space that can be filled with additional mesophyll cells (specialized for photosynthesis), indicating that more chloroplasts are present. Therefore, we predict that the greater the number of chloroplasts available to absorb light, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. As a result, in relation to the electron transport chain, we hypothesize that there would be an increase in the rate of reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, suggesting that photosynthesis has been carried out more in kale than spinach and more in kale and spinach in light conditions versus dark conditions. Thus, there would be a significant percent change in absorbance values, especially for kale in comparison to spinach.  

Materials and Methods:
Chloroplasts were enriched using differential centrifugation, a method that isolates organelles from cells. Large central veins were removed from four medium-sized spinach leaves and four medium-sized kale leaves, which an instructor obtained from an outside source for the experiment. A mortar and pestle was used to grind the spinach leaves with 10 mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine pH 8.0 grinding buffer. Once the mixture reached a thick consistency, an additional 10 mL of 400mM sucrose in Tricine pH 8.0 grinding buffer was added and subsequently strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled, medium-sized beaker. 200 μl of the filtered spinach liquid was then transferred from the beaker into a microtube labeled “Sample of A – Spinach” and stored on ice. The remaining green liquid from “Sample of A – Spinach” was transferred to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A – Spinach,” and spun at 200 x G (1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for three minutes at four degrees Celsius. Then, the supernatant was poured out of the tube marked “A - Spinach” into the second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B – Spinach.” 200 μl of the liquid from the 50 mL tube marked “B – Spinach” was removed, placed in a microtube labeled “Sample of B – Spinach,” and put on ice. Following this step, the 50 mL tube containing chloroplast suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for ten minutes at four degrees Celsius. Once centrifuged, the contents were poured into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C – Spinach." Next, 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and suspended. 200 μl of this resuspended pellet was then transferred into a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet – Spinach.” Lastly, 200 μl was removed from the tube labeled “C - Spinach,” and placed into a microtube labeled “Sample of C - Spinach.” These steps were all repeated for kale respectively. Following the enrichment of chloroplasts, 17 samples were prepared in test tubes and measured using a spectrophotometer set at 600 nanometers. Tubes #1-2 were prepared with 8mL of water and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5), while tubes #3-17 were prepared with 6 mL of water, 2mL of 130mM 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol, and 2mL of reaction buffer (100mM phosphate at a pH of 6.5). To begin the assay, 100 μl of spinach chloroplasts was added to tube #1 and tubes #6-11, and 100 μl of kale chloroplasts to tube #2 and tubes #12-17. These mixtures were transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The spectrophotometer was blanked using tube #1 for spinach samples and tube #2 for kale samples. After measuring initial absorbance values, tubes #1-8 and #12-14 were placed in lamp light, while tubes #9-11 and #15-17 were placed in a dark cabinet. The absorbances of the tubes were re-recorded after 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes for both spinach and kale. For statistical analysis, a two-sample t-test was employed to compare the control group, spinach in light conditions, to the experimental group, kale in light conditions, analyzing whether the variance in plant type had an effect on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the absorbance of chloroplasts in the control group (blue) decreased 0.220 nm over a period of 30 minutes, whereas the absorbance of the experimental group (orange) was variable over time. Specifically, the absorbance of the experimental group initially increased 0.339 nm from zero to 10 minutes, subsequently decreased 0.254 nm from 10 to 20 minutes, and then slightly increased 0.039 nm from 20 to 30 minutes. The t-value is 1.171, the degrees of freedom is 4, and the p-value is 0.307 for spinach in light and kale in light at a time of 30 minutes. 

Discussion:
The chloroplasts and light-dependent reactions are important aspects of photosynthesis. Our prediction was that the variability of a type of plant, specifically the thickness of the plant’s leaves, would have an impact on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. We hypothesized that kale would have a higher rate of electron transport than spinach and that there would be a greater percent change in absorbance values for light conditions versus dark conditions.

As photosynthesis proceeds in light conditions, in comparison to dark conditions, more DCPIP is reduced, which means there would be a greater decrease in color and subsequent decline in absorbance values. On the other hand, in dark conditions, there is not a high rate of electron transfer because no light is present to excite the electrons. Our results support these findings, as they show a greater average percent change in absorbance values over a period of 30 minutes for light conditions in comparison to dark conditions at a time of thirty minutes for both spinach and kale. However, our results for the spinach and kale absorbance values do not support the main component of our hypothesis that kale would have a higher rate of electron transport than spinach. The graph trends show that in general, kale has a higher average absorbance value (0.075 nm) at thirty minutes in comparison to spinach (0.001 nm), which does not align with our hypothesis. As photosynthesis proceeds, absorbance values decrease, since 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol is reduced, changing color from blue to colorless. Thus, in accordance with our hypothesis, kale would have had lower absorbance values, indicating a greater rate of electron transport over time. According to our two-sample t-test, our results are statistically insignificant. Thus, we concluded that the type of plant, particularly its leaf thickness, does not play a large role in reduction reactions required for photosynthesis. The results of another study examining how infection affects leaf pigments and the subsequent effect on photosynthetic pigments in Phaseolus vulgaris plants revealed that the decrease in pigment of the leaves, as a consequence of infection, resulted in lower photosynthesis rates [Andrade: 2010]. Therefore, another experiment to conduct in the future would be to test the effect of the shade of green pigment in various plants on the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis.

In reflecting on our experiment, there is room for improvement. An alternative explanation is that the spectrophotometer malfunctioned and would not properly read the absorbance values. As a result, variability in absorbance values could have been due to the use of multiple spectrophotometers throughout the experiment. Moreover, in reflecting on our hypothesis and the results of our experiment, we believe a stronger one would have included the specificity of the size of the leaf, to ensure there were a similar amount of chloroplasts present. Looking towards the future, the next logical steps for this study would be to modify the procedure and repeat this experiment. Rather than immediately resorting to using a mortar and pestle to grind the leaves, we would also add a procedure step to chop up the leaves to ensure the liquid mixture has enough chloroplasts in it when strained through the cheesecloth. After chopping up the leaves into fine pieces, then we would add the pieces to the mortar and pestle to grind the leaves with the grinding buffer. In addition, we would weigh the kale and spinach leaves to confirm we have the same amount of each, instead of selecting four leaves of each green at random, since the kale leaves were much larger in size. 

Overall, our study revealed that while environmental factors, specifically light and dark conditions, affect the rate of electron transport, no accurate conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of the variability of a plant, particularly the thickness of the leaves, on the reduction reactions in photosynthesis. Our conclusions cause us to question whether the examination of other factors, such as the shade of green of a plant, the number of veins present in a plant, and the environment in which the plant is grown in, would have an effect on the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis.
