Title: he Inhibitory Effect of Azagaurd on the Commitment Pulse and Overall Maturation of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars.

Abstract:
Hormones are the chemical messengers of the body that control everything from growth, behavior, development, and fertility. If you are to understand any bodily process involved in physiology, it is important to understand the function of the hormones that are always working in the background. In this study, we look at the effect that the hormone ecdysterone, also known as 20E, has on the growth and maturation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, a common agricultural pest. We expected that when exposed to compounds that blocked 20E, the caterpillar would not be able to reach a point in which it will be able to mature into a pupa, thus causing stunted growth. Our data showed that when 20E was blocked in the caterpillars, they would shrink in both weight and length before eventually dying. When compared to their counterparts that were allowed to mature normally, it was clear that blocking 20E in the endocrine system halted the development of the caterpillars and will ultimately be fatal for the organism. This knowledge can be helpful in broadening our understanding of how to control pests such as the Manduca sexta.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is a herbivorous moth species that is known for it’s rapid growth in the larval stage, where it can grow up to 10 grams[Reinecke: 1980]. Hormones control this rapid growth, which are chemicals produced by the body to create specific effects on target cells throughout the body. Hormones are often responsible for the growth of an organism from adolescence to adulthood. Two of the hormones responsible for the maturation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar are ecdysterone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Ecydsterone is released by the prothoracic glands, which are located between the head and thorax. 20E regulates the time of the insects molting during its larval development, while [Johnson: 2018]. At the beginning of the Manduca sexta life cycle, levels of 20E are low while levels of JH are high. During the 5th instar of larval development, JH levels drop drastically and a small rise in 20E occurs. This hormonal change is known as the commitment pulse, and this change can only occur when caterpillar has reached an adequate size and level of nutrient storage to survive pupation [Johnson: 2018]. Because Manduca sexta is generally regarded as a pest, we wondered how we could utilize the effects of the hormone ecdysterone to stunt the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars. We hypothesize that if 20E is inhibited in the Manduca sexta caterpillars, then the commitment pulse will not occur, which will stunt it’s growth.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups, one of which was the control and the other of which was the experimental group. Each caterpillar was placed in a separate aerated compartment inside a container that held the other members of its group. The control caterpillars were fed 10 grams of solid caterpillar food that was mixed with 10 drops of deionized water. The experimental caterpillars were fed 10 grams of solid caterpillar food mixed with 10 drops of Azagaurd, which is an insect growth regulator that blocks processes that are regulated by 20E [Tunaz: 2004]. The caterpillars were fed every two days and were kept in an incubator at all times. Their weights and lengths were recorded every day for two weeks. The weight was measured with a standard lab balance and the lengths were measured from the head to their last leg with a centimeter ruler. We used one-tailed t-test to test to solve for statistical significance. 

Results:
Over the course of the study, the average weight of the control group increased steadily until it peaked at 7.6675 g on day 7 (Table 1). Following this peak was a steady decline in average weight until day 13, where the weights plateaued at approximately 4.83 g (Fig. 2). The average length of the control group increased until day 7, and peaked at 6.925 cm (Table 1). After the peak, the length decreased steadily until plateaued between 5.4 and 5.575 cm between days 14 and 15 (Fig. 1).  The control group had a slight increase in average weight from their initial weight of 0.5625 g to 0.9675 g on day 3 (Table 1). After day 3, their weight decreased until all of the organisms died on day 13 at a weight of 0.42 g (Fig. 2). The average length of the experimental group increased from the initial length of 3.125 cm to 3.475 cm, before dropping to 3.05 cm on day 6 (Table 1). From there, the length fluctuated between 2.75 and 2.85 cm until all of the organisms died on the 13th day at an average length of 2.75 cm (Fig. 1). We used one-tailed t-test to test to solve for statistical significance. Our t-value was 5.42386 for the weight and 6.38143 for the length, and the degrees of freedom were 22 for both. The one-tailed P value was 9.50×〖10〗^(-6) for weight and 1.01×〖10〗^(-6) for length.

Discussion:
The result of this experiment supports the alternate hypothesis that if 20E is inhibited in the Manduca sexta caterpillars, then the commitment pulse will not occur, which will stunt it’s growth. This supported by the observation that the caterpillars which were exposed to the 20E blocker, Azagaurd, did not grow larger or mature in any way throughout the course of the two weeks, while the untreated control group grew in size and pupated. The Azagaurd blocked the maturation processes controlled by 20E, the cells in the experimental group were never signaled that it was time for them to grow and mature [Johnson: 2018]. Because this signal was never received, the caterpillars remained the same size before the caterpillars stopped eating all together, began to lose weight, and eventually died. This blocking of 20E coupled by the lack of nutrients stored by the caterpillar caused the caterpillar to not go through a commitment pulse, even though two weeks had passed and the caterpillar should have been mature enough after this amount of time to pupate [Johnson: 2018]. Though it was made clear in this study that inhibiting 20E causes growth to be stunted in the Manduca sexta caterpillars, it is still unknown why blocking 20E causes a halt in feeding behavior all together. Additionally, further study can be done to see if the stunted growth that results from the blocking 20E are dependent on the amount of Azagaurd the caterpillars are exposed to, or if even small doses can completely prevent proper maturation of the organism. The information gained in this study and in future studies of 20E and Manduca sexta will not only work to aid the scientific community in better understanding the complex mechanisms of the endocrine system and how they interact with the growth and development of organisms, but will also help those who stake their living on agriculture prevent the infestation of Manduca sexta in their crops.
