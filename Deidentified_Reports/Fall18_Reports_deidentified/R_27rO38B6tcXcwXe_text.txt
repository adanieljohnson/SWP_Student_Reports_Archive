Title: The Effects of Atrazine on Spinach Chloroplasts at Different Light Intensities

Abstract:
Herbicides are an integral part of farming by keeping undesired organisms from developing around the desired fruit and or vegetable. Previous research spoke about the different effects of inhibitors in different plants. In our experiment, we added Atrazine, a known photosystem II inhibitor to our spinach chloroplast samples and observed their absorbances at different light intensities. We hypothesized that with the addition of the herbicide Atrazine, absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis will be lower at a higher light intensity (100%) than at lower light intensity (50%) or in dark. Samples under the condition of darkness: d.f.= 3, p_value = 2.611*10^-6 and t = 3.182. Samples under the condition of 50% light intensity: d.f.= 3, p_value = 3.138*10^-9 , and t = 3.182. Samples under the condition of 100% light intensity: d.f.= 3, p_value = 8.283*10^-5 , and t = 3.182.

Introduction:
All living cells require energy to function. Energy is often derived from three main sources such as the chemical energy stored in covalent bonds, energy stores as an oxidation-reduction potential, or through electrical or chemical gradients across a lipid bilayer. [Bowes et al: 1980]  Organisms such as plants, some protist, and bacteria absorb solar energy and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. The energy that absorbed by chloroplasts, which are only present in plants and are responsible for the processes of capturing sunlight and energy production.[Pfister: 1979] The photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts in three various steps. The first two-stages are called the light-dependent reaction, they absorb to photons of two different wavelengths to produces NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). From this process a proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis.[Hess:2000] This experiment will focus on the light-dependent reaction and more specifically look at the function photosystem II. Photosystem II, energy from the absorbed photons of light causes electrons to leave the chlorophyll and move to the plastiquinone. The oxidized chlorophyll indirectly stimulates hydrolysis of water to produce molecular oxygen, the excess of electrons then restores the ones lost from the chlorophyll. Due to water being broken down, H+ protons are then pumped across the thylakoid membrane. The reduction plastiquinone transfers its cytochrome b6f, which then transfers electrons to plastocyanin.[Brewer et al: 1979] Simultaneously, the cytochrome b6f complex pumps protons across thylakoid membrane, adding to the proton gradient that allows for the electron transport chain to function.[Brewer et al: 1979]. In this experiment, we will be observing the effect of Atrazine, a known photosystem II inhibitor, has on Hill reaction, which is the process of electron transfer in chloroplast, on spinach leaves.  According to research done by Dan Hess, herbicide types such as triazines (e.g., atrazine) and phenylureas (e.g., diuron) have their site of action in photosystemII (PS II) in the photosynthesis light reaction. Symptoms from herbicides that interfere with PS II slowly evolve over several days. [Hess:2000].  Due to NADP+ being difficult to measure, we used DCPIP( 2, 6-dichlorophenol indophenol ) as an alternative electron acceptor to measure the reduction of NADP+. From this we hypothesized that with the addition of the herbicide Atrazine, absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis will be lower at a higher light intensity (100%) than at lower light intensity (50%) or in dark

Materials and Method:
The main stem of 4 spinach leaves were removed. The rest of the leaf were placed into a mortar, with We labelled 19 large test tubes. Test tube #1 was our blank, only 8 Ml of water and 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5) . Test tubes #2-#4, contained 8Ml of water, no DCPIP, 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), 1 microliter chloroplast, and were to be placed in the dark. Test tube #5-#8 contained 6Ml of water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of Reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, pH 6.5), no atrazine, and placed under a lamp with 50% of the bulb covered. In Test tubes #9-#12, 5 Ml of water, 3 Ml of reaction of buffer, 1 Ml of Atrazine is added, 1 microliter of chloroplast, and is placed in dark. In test tubes #13-#15, chloroplast, 1 Ml of atrazine, 5Ml of water, 2 Ml of DCPIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 1 Ml of Atrazine, and tubes to place in 50% of light as the one before without the atrazine. Tubes #16-#18, had 5 Ml of water, 2Ml of DCPIP, and 2 Ml of reaction buffer, 1Ml of Atrazine, and placed in 100% of light. We mixed the chloroplast thoroughly immediately after putting it into the test tube. We then transferred a sample . We then prepared the spectrophotometer and placed the blank inside it. We put the absorbance of the spectrophotometer at 600 nm. We recorded the absorbances  after 10, 20 , and 30 minutes. We performed a two paired t_test.

Results:
In the samples under the condition of darkness, the degrees of freedom=3,p_value = 2.611*10^-6 (statistically significent due to being less than 0.05) and t = 3.182. Samples und the condition of 50% light intensity: the degrees of freedom=3, p_value=3.138*10^-9 (statistically significent due to being less than 0.05), and t=3.182. Samples under the condition of 100% intensity: the degrees of freedom=3, p_value== 8.283*10^-5, and t=3.182

Discussion:
Due to our results being significent we can say that atrazine is an effective inhibitor of photosystem II as claimed in previous research by Hess and Powles. We reject our null hypothesis due to absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis will being higher at a higher light intensity (100%) than at lower light intensity (50%) or in the dark. This agrees with the findings of Hess’s research that state light with the proper dosage of Atrazine does accelerate the inhibition of photosystem II. It is widely used by crop growers. Atrazine is known to  inhibit reoxidation of the reduced primary acceptor of photosystem II (PS II), Q, by secondary electron acceptors. [Bowes et al: 1980] This inhibition of the photosystem II on a large scale makes crop undergo the process of necrosis.[Hess: 1980] Although, Atrazine is found to be an efficient inhibitor, it does not mean that it inhibits photosystem II in all plants. Studies by Friesen and Powles in 2007, demonstrate that some autotrophs including Raphanus raphanistrum or more commonly known as Australian wild radish is resistant to the atrazine. This is due to a change to an evolved triazine resistance.[Powles:2007] These finding allow us to understand the importance of the different components of the process of photosysthesis from photosystem II, I , and etc. Future research could possibly observe why some plants can resist atrazine and other herbicides.	
Herbicide types such as triazines (e.g., atrazine) and phenylureas (e.g., diuron) have their site of action in photosystemII (PS II) in the photosynthesis light reaction. Symptoms from herbicides that interfere with PS II slowly evolve over several days. [Hess:2000] ALthough our experiment did not take a few days we can observe that atrazine did inhibit the functioning of photosystem II. But according to trends observed this could have been due to Atrazine no longer being an effective inhibitor as described in research done by Friesen and Powles that concluded that atrazine did not inhibit photosystem II in wild radishes.[Powles:2007]
