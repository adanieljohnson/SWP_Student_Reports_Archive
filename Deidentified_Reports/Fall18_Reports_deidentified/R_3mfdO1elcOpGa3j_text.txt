Title: Effects of Different Colored Light on Spinach, Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important functions to all of life, which is the metabolic process that is responsible for synthesizing energy and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. In this experiment, different colored lights of different wavelengths were used on the organism, Spinacia oleracea, also known as spinach, in order to analyze the effects of different wavelengths of light on the percent change in absorbance, which corresponds to how much photosynthesis is occurring. The chloroplasts within the plant work by absorbing light to excite electrons in a series of electron transport chains and photosystems in order to reduce carbon dioxide and oxidize water to produced oxygen and high-energy sugars. There was a total of three trials of chlorophyll with each group of light, which were red light, green light, and blue light. The light group that had the largest percent change in absorbance was red light, followed by blue light, and then green light. There was no statistical significance between the groups, except for red light and green light, thus warranting inconclusive data and need for more replicates and experiments. This experiment was utilized to determine what wavelength of light is best absorbed by spinach and thus, the most efficient photosynthesis in plants.

Introduction:
One of the most important functions to all of life is Photosynthesis, a metabolic process carried out by living organisms. Certain plants and bacteria use sunlight to synthesize energy (glucose) from carbon dioxide and water and thus generating oxygen as a product. In general, all organisms must be able to directly or indirectly extract energy from one or more external sources, either by photosynthesis or cellular respiration. The majority of this energy is stored in covalent bonds, energy stored as oxidation reduction potential, and an electrical or chemical gradient across a lipid bilayer. This energy can later be released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm and respiration (occurring in the mitochondria of both plants and animals) [Johnson: 2016]. Cellular respiration and photosynthesis work oppositely of each other where cellular respiration is responsible for converting oxygen, high-energy sugars, and water into carbon dioxide and energy. Photosynthesis is responsible for taking in carbon dioxide, water, and light in order to produce high-energy sugars and oxygen. Cellular respiration can be monitored in terms of its rate by the metabolic activity of a cell; the rate itself can become limited by oxygen availability when the partial pressure of oxygen severely decreases. When a cell can reduce metabolic activity and energy demand due to falling oxygen levels, this infers that there is an increased resistance to a depleted oxygen supply [Schumacker: 1993]. Thus, this allows for further areas of study within cellular respiration. Just like within cellular respiration having certain limiting factors and variables that affect the process itself, so too does photosynthesis, which was the focus of the experiment and which will be further discussed later. Both cellular respiration and photosynthesis are fairly similar in that they both involve multiple oxidation-reduction reactions, where electrons are transferred through an electron transport chain from one complex to the next. These complexes use the moving electrons to pump protons across a lipid bilayer in order to generate a proton gradient, which is then used to drive to an even larger complex to produce ATP. Photosynthesis, the main reaction of focus within this lab, also requires several other factors in order to function properly, such as light, green pigment chlorophyll, Mn2+ ions, electron transport complexes, and an intact phospholipid bilayer to create a proton gradient [Johnson: 2016]. More specifically, the factor we will be analyzing in this lab are the effects of different wavelengths of different lights on the electron transport chain (regular light vs. red light vs. blue light vs. green light). Chloroplasts within the plant are responsible for absorbing lights at different wavelengths, however chloroplasts do absorb certain lights at different wavelengths better than others. In a case study done by Liu Mengxi, it was found that plant growth and differentiation function best under red and blue spectrum light. The shoot tips of growing shoots of Oncidium were vertically incubated and grown under different colored lights. It was found that both red and blue light enhance induction and proliferation in the plant organism and the combination of the two lights resulted in higher energy efficiency. In general terms, during photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation exciting electrons to leave carrier molecules to start chemical reactions that cleaves water and creates a proton gradient to make ATP (completely consumed for glucose production) and glucose. The process occurs in three stages total, two of which are light-dependent reactions which are used to absorb photons of different wavelengths for reducing powers in the form of NADPH and creates the gradient to produce ATP and the other being light-independent reactions to make six carbon glucose. The light-dependent reactions are composed of Photosystem two and one, both of which deal with excited electrons. In this lab, our group focused on measuring electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts using 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), the alternative electron accepter. Electron transport chains in chloroplasts can pass electrons to other electron acceptors besides NADP+ (DCIP), which are easier to measure. DCIP is an aromatic compound which absorbs light at 600 nm. It is a dark blue but when reduced, it becomes more colorless and transparent [Johnson:2016]. Therefore, the color change can be measured due to decrease in light absorbance and which is why different kinds of wavelengths (colors of light) will be analyzed to determine their effects. With the DCIP assay, one will determine how different colored light affects reduction reactions needed for photosynthesis. Using “enriched” chloroplasts from spinach leaves, the model organism due to easy storage, small size, affordability, and plentiful source of chloroplasts, and the Hill reaction to measure the rate of reduction, one will determine the effects of different lights on the electron transport chain and determine how much photosynthesis is taking place. As predicted for the experiment, the samples with chloroplasts under the red and blue light should experience the greatest rate of photosynthesis (measured by percent change – greatest reactivity of DCIP), while the lowest rate of photosynthesis will be under green light. 

Materials and Methods:
We placed a mortar, pestle, a 150 mL beaker, and three centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. We then removed the large veins from 6 medium sized spinach leaves to remove debris as to not affect the chloroplasts and thus the veins were discarded. The remaining leaves were washed and then dried. When the mortar and pestle where cold, they were wiped dry and the spinach leaves were added. With 10 mL of grinding buffer, the leaves were grinded until there was only a green paste left. Ten more mL of grinding buffer were added and the leaves were grinded even more and then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. The solution was then transferred to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge marked “A” and spun at 200xG for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. The supernatant was then poured out of tube “A” and into a second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B.” This tube was then centrifuged at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We then combined this tube with 20 mL of grinding buffer, which in this case, is pellet-B and which contains the “enriched” chloroplasts (the greatest number of chloroplasts vs. least amount of debris). This final tube became our source of “enriched” chloroplasts for our experiment. We then labeled 16 large test tubes. The groups were no chloroplasts (3), chloroplasts in light (3), chloroplasts in red light (3), chloroplasts in blue light (3), chloroplasts in green light (3), and one test tube being the blank. The no chloroplast group and all the light groups then received 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of Reaction Buffer. The blank received 8 mL of water, no DCIP, and 2 mL of Reaction Buffer. Once this was all prepared, 100 microliters of the appropriate chloroplasts were added to the test tubes and mixed. The absorbances were then read, with the blank being read first to use as a “baseline” at 600 nm. Then all the tubes were incubated in their appropriate light source for 15 minutes and then read again for their absorbances in the spectrophotometer. This measured the percent change of the reactive DCIP and how much photosynthesis took place. The statistical test that we used was the two-sample T-test. 

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the percent change was that red light had the greatest percent change in absorbance, followed by the blue light, and then the green light. If considering the positive control, it had the second greatest percent change in absorbance behind the red light and the negative control had the smallest percent change in absorbance. The positive control was the chloroplasts in regular light and produced the desired and expected large percent change in absorbance because regular light is a combination of all spectrum of light and is responsible for photosynthesis. The negative control contained no chloroplasts and was expected to produce barely, if any, percent change in absorbance because of not being able to carry out photosynthesis, however there still was a fairly noticeable percent change in absorbance. We expected the red and blue light to produce the largest percent change because chloroplasts absorb their spectrum of light the most. This is seen in Figure 1., where red light has a percent change of 0.841 in absorbance and blue having a percent change of 0.682 in absorbance. However, green light also had a large percent change of 0.665 in absorbance, which was not expected because chlorophyll absorbs light at this spectrum the least. The negative control had a percent change of 0.259 in absorbance and 0.803 percent change in absorbance for the positive control. The standard deviation (equivalent to the error bars in Figure 1.) for green light is 0.084, 0.059 for red light, 0.117 for blue light, 0.032 for the negative control, and 0.004 for the positive control. The T-test we ran for positive Control vs. the negative control gave us a p-value of 0.00156. The mean of the positive control does hold statistical significance over that of the negative group for percent change because the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05. The T-test we ran for green light vs. negative control gave us a p-value of 0.00146. The mean of the green light does hold statistical significance over that of the negative group for percent change because the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05. The T-test we ran for green light vs. the red light gave us a p-value of 0.0393.   The T-test we ran for green light vs. blue light gave us a p-value of 0.8438. The mean of the green light does not hold statistical significance over that of the blue light group for percent change because the p-value is greater than 0.05. The T-test we ran for red light vs. blue light gave us a p-value of 0.1008. The mean of the red light does not hold statistical significance over that of the blue light group for percent change because the p-value is lower than 0.05. 

Discussion:
Based upon our data, we cannot come to the concrete conclusion that photosynthesis occurs at the greatest percent change in absorbance in red and blue light, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the null hypothesis is supported and cannot be rejected, warranting reason for further tests, replicants, and experiments. Given the percent change in absorbance that we calculated after the 15-minute incubation period, in terms of the different colored light, the red light had the greatest percent change in absorbance, followed by blue light, and then green light. The greatest percent change is representative of the most amount of photosynthesis taking place because the chloroplasts that absorb the most amount of light thus excite the greatest number of electrons reducing more DCIP and therefore causing the samples to become the most transparent and experiencing the greatest percent change in absorbance [Johnson: 2016]. The reason why we cannot be certain about our results is because of the p-values. The T-test we ran for green light vs. red light gave us a p-value of 0.0393. The T-test we ran for green light vs. blue light gave us a p-value of 0.8438. The T-test we ran for red light vs. blue light gave us a p-value of 0.1008. As a result, the mean of the green light does hold statistical significance over that of the red light group for percent change because the p-value is lower than 0.05. The mean of the green light does not hold statistical significance over that of the blue light group for percent change because the p-value is greater than 0.05. The mean of the red light does not hold statistical significance over that of the blue light group for percent change because the p-value is greater than 0.05. Therefore, there is a statistical difference between the green light and red light but between all other groups, there is no statistical difference, meaning that we cannot come to a clear conclusion as to what light photosynthesis functions best. Also, all three of these light groups had a fairly large standard deviation. The red light had a standard deviation of 0.0558, which is actually not that high, 0.0842 for green light, and 0.1166 for blue light. Therefore, this means that we would need to run more replicates in order to attain more accurate data and smaller standard deviation error bars, as seen in Figure 1. However, we can infer that photosynthesis functioned best under red light because that group, as seen in Figure 1., had the greatest percent change in absorbance out of all groups and had a smaller standard deviation value compared to that of the two other light groups. Also, when comparing the red light to the positive control (regular light), which had a very small standard deviation value of 0.00424, they had very similar percent change values in absorbance – red being 0.841 and the positive control being 0.803. The positive control result is what we would expect from in this experiment as regular light is a combination of all wavelengths thus maximizing the amount of photosynthesis that takes place. Also, based on the case study done by Liu Mengxi, plant growth and differentiation functions best under red and blue spectrum light [Mengxi: 2010]. However, plant growth and differentiation could function differently than photosynthesis in regard to different light, thus being an explanation for the data that was not statistically significant and which we collected between green, red, and blue light. Another explanation would be the contamination of the general regular light while the test tubes were placed under their own special light. The test tubes, for example, under the red, blue, and green light were also affected by the general regular light as there were no walls or blocks to keep the regular light from hitting the test tubes. This could have been a confounding variable. And in a study by Ichiro Terashima, it was found that green light actually drives leaf photosynthesis more efficiently than red light in strong white light [Terashima: 2009]. It was found that green light can actually penetrate the leaf further than red or blue light, in a strong white light, therefore increasing photosynthesis within the leaf compared to that of the red or blue light [Terashima: 2009]. This could explain why our data for the green light in terms of percent change in absorbance was very similar to our red and blue data, thus giving us statistically insignificant p-values.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. Groups containing chloroplasts, except for the negative control, that are placed under different colored light to measure their percent change in absorbance over a 15 minutes incubation period. The negative light control is no chloroplasts under regular light and the positive control is chloroplasts under regular light. For each group, three trials of absorbances were run for percent change and then averaged together. Due to being averaged together, there are standard deviation error bars. The bars in the graph that have their own individual symbols are statistically significant to other groups, but the exception is that a bar that has two symbols is not statistically significant to those groups. Therefore, blue light is not statistically significant to red light nor to green light and vice versa but green light is statistically significant to red light. *************************************************************************
