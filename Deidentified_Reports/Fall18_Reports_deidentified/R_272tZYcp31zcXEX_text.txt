Title: Effects of Lidocaine in the Neuromuscular System

Abstract:
Rania Pipiens, also known as the Northern leopard frog, is a species of frog native to parts of Canada and the United States. Rania Pipiens are found near fresh bodies of water and in the warmer seasons, move to grassy areas. These frogs have neuromuscular similarities to humans. We will use the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog which is located in the lower back part of the leg. In this test we will use 3 frog legs of and apply 0.1 Ml of lidocaine to each. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body. Each leg will be tested 4 times varying in voltage with 2 legs being 1 volt and the third being 1.5 volts. We ran a paired t_test to compare the observations of each frog leg. The objective of this study is to see if the sodium channel blocker, or lidocaine, affects the controll of the gastrocnemus muscle and its threshold. In our results, we discovered that the voltage level before the contraction was much higher than the voltage level of after the contraction with the Lidocaine. The paired t_test shows that there was a significent difference between the before and after results. The sodium channel blocker caused a concentration-dependent contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens. The threshold wasn't affected but it did cause loss of

Introduction:
Rania Pipiens, also known as the Northern leopard frog, is a species of frog native to parts of Canada and the United States. Rania Pipiens are found near fresh bodies of water and in the warmer seasons, move to grassy areas. Rania Pipiens share some of the same muscles as we do as humans. The Gastrocnemius muscle that is located in the back part of the lower leg. It runs from the knee to the heel of the leg. Just like all muscles, sodium and potassium help your nerve cells send signals, action potential, that signal for muscle contraction. In this study, we will inject the gastrocnemus muscle with 0.1 Ml of lidocaine to see if it effects the muscle contraction. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body and causes numbness or loss of feeling for patients. In General Pharmacology: The Vascular System, Wali talks about how lignocaine produces concentration-dependent contractures in the vertebrate skeletal and smooth muscle fibres. This means that the lidocaine decreases the controll of the contraction because of the nerve blocking caused by the lidocaine. We predict that the lidocaine injection will have an effect of the threshold and the muscle will lose controll.

Materials and Method:
We will use 3 frog legs of and apply 0.1 Ml of lidocaine to each. Lidocaine is an anesthetic that works by blocking nerve signals in your body. Each leg will be tested 4 times varying in voltage with 2 legs being 1 volt and the third being 1.5 volts. We ran a paired t_test to compare the observations of each frog leg.


Results:
In our results, we noticed that the voltage level before the contraction was much higher than the voltage level of after the contraction with the Lidocaine. We ran a paired t_test to see if there was a noticeable difference in means. The paired t_test shows that there was a significent difference between the before and after results. 

Discussion:
The sodium channel blocker, better known as lidocaine, caused a concentration-dependent contraction in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Rania Pipiens. The gastrocnemus muscle was directly affected by the sodium channel blocker because the muscle lost controll. Wali stated that the lidocaine "produces concentration-dependent contractures" which shows that the lidocaine caused a loss of controll in the muscle. The difference in voltage levels between the before and after shows that the sodium channel blocker caused loss of controll in the gastrocnemus muscle. In our hypothesis we stated that we thought the lidocaine would have an effect of the threshold and the muscle will lose controll. The threshold wasn't affected but it did cause loss of controll in the gastrocnemus muscle.
