Title: The Allocation Patterns of Pisum sativun when Grown within Herbivorous Conditions

Abstract:
For this experiment, Pisum sativun plants were put under herbivorous conditions, and their allocation patterns were studied.  Pisum sativun plants are also known as field peas, and they are commonly grown throughout Northern temperature regions. The hypothesis being tested is: will the plants being exposed to herbivorous conditions attempt to grow larger roots so that they can compensate for the loss of resources due to shoot loss? Every plant is exposed to some sort of predator.  This experiment consists of simulating plant predation upon the Pisum sativun plants.  Under these conditions, the growth of the roots and shoots were analyzed.  The data that was collected in relation to the root:shoot mass was insignificent, but the data describing the root:shoot length was significent.  However, the experimental group’s roots did not grow to be any larger than the controll group’s roots, so the hypothesis was rejected.  

Introduction:
Evolution has made it so that plants will adapt in order to survive in the environmental conditions that  are present around them.  If Pisum sativun can successfully adapt to its environment, it will be able to sustain its life, and live long enough to produce offspring.  However, if it fails to adapt, it will simply die, due to the hazardous environmental conditions.  Allocation is a crucial process used to adapt.  Allocation is the way in which an organism distributes its resources to best suit its environment.  For example, if a plant needs to produce more energy via photosynthesis, the plant will need to allocate more resources towards making leaves [Johnson 15-19].  
  The plant species that is being tested is entitled Pisum sativun.  This species of plant is also known as field peas, and they are commonly grown throughout Northern temperature regions.  In this experiment, we are attempting to simulate hostile environmental conditions.  The experimental plant group will be under herbivorous conditions, and the plants must adapt to these conditions in order to survive.  Herbivory is hazardous to the Pisum sativun plants because  it reduces the plant’s primary structures for photosynthesis, the leaves.  To create this herbivorous environment, we will simulate the plant being eaten by insects.  Therefore, the hypothesis is that the experimental plant group will attempt to grow larger roots so that they can compensate for the loss of resources due to shoot loss.


Materials and Method:
The experiment was designed so that there were two groups: the controll group and the experimental group.  The experimental group was exposed to the herbivorous conditions.  To simulate herbivorous conditions, every three days, ½ of each leaf was cut off, and this occurred for two weeks.  The controll group was not exposed to these hostile conditions, but each group was given the resources that they needed in order to carry-out regular plant functions: water, sunlight and soil.  After each group of plants had been given two weeks to grow, 12 plants were taken from the controll group and 12  plants were taken from the experimental group.  To separate the roots from the shoots, each plant was washed off and cut right above the gametes.  Each root and shoot was measured in centimeters and weighed in grams .  With these measurements, we calculated the root to shoot ratios of both plant groups.  The data was then collected, recorded, and analyzed in the form of a two-tailed t_test.  

Results:
The data of the experimental group and the controll group are similar, in relation to mass (t-value= 1.13, d.f.=22, p=0.14).  The weights of the experimental and controll groups only differ by a factor of about 0.1g (Figure 1).  The lengths of the experimental group and controll group has proven to have a significent difference (t-value= 2.24, d.f.= 22, p=0.02).     

Discussion:
While the t_test proved that there was a significent difference between the length of the controll group’s roots and the experimental group’s roots, the roots of the controll group were, on average, longer than the roots of the experimental group’s roots.  This data does not support the hypothesis because, the hypotheses expected for the roots of the experimental group to grow longer, due to the herbivory.  However, the roots of the experimental plants were significently shorter than the roots of the controll plants (Figure 1).  This indicates that Pisum sativun plants do not respond to having their leaves eaten  by herbivores by growing larger roots.  Therefore, the hypothesis was rejected, and the plants may have some other biological process that allows them to adapt to herbivores eating their leaves.  For example, it is possible that the plants are allocating more resources towards making more leaves rather than growing their roots.  This would help to explain why the experimental group plants have shorter roots than the controll group plants.  
This experiment observed the allocation of Pisum sativun resources in reaction to herbivory, and it treated herbivory as if it was only a negative environmental factor in relation to the plant.  However, according to a research study entitled “The effect of insect herbivory on the growth and fitness of introduced Verbascum thapsus L.”  It is actually possible for herbivory to have positive effects on plant growth.  Therefore, this same experimental process could be carried out, but the hypotheses could centralize around the positive effects of herbivory and not the negative effects [Wilbur, Alba, Norton, Hufbauer].
