Title: Effects of Juvenile Hormone on weight in Manduca Caterpillars

Abstract:
The juvenile hormone is an essential part of development for many insects throughout ecosystems. This includes Manduca sexta especially, since the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt the Manduca will form through their metamorphosis process.  In our experiment we wanted to determine if there was a significent difference in weight between Manduca sextas that were fed a regular diet and those who were fed a normal diet with the addition of a mimic juvenile hormone. Considering that the juvenile hormone plays an essential role in the pupation process of Manducas, we hypothesized that the group fed the mimic juvenile hormone would have a significent difference in weight compared to the group that was only fed a regular diet without the hormone mimic. We set up an experiment using 8 Manducas divided evenly into 2 groups. We observed the two groups for a total of 12 days, feeding them regularly each day. In the end, we found that our results did not support our hypothesis. Our treatment of the mimic hormone did have an effect on the weight of our experimental Manducas, but however, since our p_value was more than 0.05, our results of the mean weight difference was simply due to chance. 

Introduction:
Manduca sextas, also known as tobacco hornworms belong to the family of Order Lepidoptera, which include all butterflies, moths and skippers [AD Johnson: 2018]. While under constant conditions in a laboratory, the life cycle of Manducas can range from 39 to 48 days. The timing of this cycle can be longer or shorter in outdoor conditions, depending on the quality of diet and the average daily temperature. Within this time frame the caterpillars will change into 5 different instar larvae, until they finally pupate. Once pupation occurs, the Manduca has 19-23 days left in their life cycle to grow into a full-grown adult moth. This cycle of metamorphosis would not be possible without two very important hormones working together, Ecdysterone (20E) and the Juvenile Hormone (JH). These two hormones help regulate the timing and type of molt the instar larvae will have. Ecdysterone being in controll of timing, and the JH in controll of the type of molt [AD Johnson: 2018]. According to an article found in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Frederik and Williams conclude that the secretion process of ecdysterone is the same for all insects. The two comment, “we know that, in most and perhaps all insects, the brain controlls the secretion of ecdysone by the action of its tropic hormone on the prothoracic glands” [Frederik and Williams: 1974]. This means that the brain is the main controll system of hormonal activity in Manducas, which allow them to properly grow and pupate during their life cycles. For this lab we tested the effects of an additional JH mimic being added to the diet of Manducas, and how this change will affect their overall change in weight during their life cycle. We chose this experiment because it will be interesting to see how Manducas respond to additional JH being added to their normal diet, and by measuring their weight would give us a clear sense of the changes as they were happening compared to our controll group. In our study, we hypothesize that the experimental group, given the additional JH mimic will show a significent increase in weight in comparison to our controll group who were fed a regular diet. 

Materials and Method:
First, we started by placing 4 Manducas in a plastic container divided into 4 compartments for our controll group. We then mixed 10 grams of food for each caterpillar without the JH mimic, with only four drops of water added. For our treatment group, we did the same by placing 4 Manducas into a container with 4 compartments, with the same type of food. But unlike the controll, we added 4 drops of JH mimic instead of 4 drops of water. 10 grams of food were fed daily to each caterpillar in our treatment group. We monitored and fed both groups for a span of 12 days, weighing each of them in grams daily, and monitoring their changes in color. Daily photos were taken so that we could monitor the changes in color for each caterpillar during metamorphosis and pupation. For our results we collected a mean, standard deviation, and p_value as normal for both groups. A bar graph was used to visually interpret the differences in weight between the first and last day of the study for both groups. We used a two-sample t_test, with a two-tailed p_value to compare the mean weight difference in each group. 

Results:
After collecting our mean of weight differences in Figure 1, it was shown that our treatment group had a higher mean of difference in weight from the beginning of the experiment up until the last day. Our dependent variable was the weight of the Manduca (in grams) and the independent variable being the JH mimic hormone. We calculated a mean of 0.915 for our controll group and a mean of 1.975 for our treatment group. Also, for our controll we found a standard deviation of 2.312, and 4.519 for the experimental group. Our two-sample t_test generated a p_value of 0.690779 for the mean of weight difference. 

Discussion:
According to our results there was a difference in weight between the Manducas fed a normal diet and those who were fed the JH mimic hormone. But it was not due to our treatment process. Our results showed a p_value of 0.690779 for mean weight difference, which is significently higher than .05. This means that the data collected from both groups were not caused by our treatments but was simply due to chance. To compare our results to a similar study, it was noted in the Journal of Experimental Biology that Manudca sexta were found to have a lower average in weight before the release of PTTH. Frederik and Williams state, “It follows, therefore, that the weight of these larvae 24 h before PTTH release represents the lowest weight at which these larvae can become committed to release PTTH [Frederik and Williams: 1974].” Just like in our study, Frederik and Williams observed a group of tobacco hornworms who had not yet released their PTTH hormones, as a result these caterpillars were measured as having a lower weight than the hornworms in the study that had already released their PTTH hormone. Despite our treatment not being considered significent, a change in the amount of JH mimic given could a be a good start for future experiments. It is possible that we did not incorporate enough JH hormone in our treatment group, meaning that if a future experiment was done with more JH mimic, the p_value could suggest that the treatment is significent to the increase in weight for Manducas. Our hypothesis was not supported in this study.
