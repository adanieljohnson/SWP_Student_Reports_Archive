Title: The Negative Growth Effects of Precor on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
The Manduca sexta was used for testing the effects of Precor, a drug that enhances Juvenile Hormone (JH). JH is the main hormone responsible for the pupation phase in the Manduca sexta. This experiment is relevant since the findings can be helpful to farmers who are trying to avert the Manduca sexta, due to the fact that they are a pest as larva. We hypothesized that if you add JH to the Manduca sextas’ food, then it will grow past the pupation point, never hit the commitment pulse, and be larger than the control group. We separated 8 caterpillars into groups of 2: a control and experimental group. Our major finding was that there was no significant weight difference between the group that received the hormone and the one that didn’t, however there was a huge difference in their appearance. After 2 weeks, two of the caterpillars in the control group pupated while the ones in the experimental group still showed no signs of pupation. This indicates that the JH hormone prevented their pupation because it was never able to decrease during larva stages. However, we cannot accept our hypothesis, because the Manduca sexta that received the JH hormone were not significantly bigger. Future experiments should be ran for 2 full weeks or more, since this is when our major results occurred.  

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta was a model organism for this experiment due to its easily comprehensible larva stages and hormone control. The Manduca sexta caterpillar has 5 larva instars during its growth to adulthood. During the 5th larva instar, it begins to pupate, but this only occurs once it has enough energy and nutrients to do so. The signals that determine the correct timing of pupation are hormone levels. The two main hormones that play a role in Manduca sexta development are the Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysone (20E). 20E is required before every molt within development, while the JH hormone is required during all larva stages except the 5th larva stage. During this stage, JH drops significantly, and this is a strong signal that the caterpillar has stored enough nutrients and energy for pupation to begin. This stage is also referred to as the commitment pulse, since the Manduca sexta is coming to the pupation stage. With this being said, body size is ultimately controlled by 20E and the timing of the onset of JH decay, which leads to pupation. [Davidowitz: 2004] What would happen is the JH hormone never decreased and stayed at high levels during the 5th larva instar? With this in mind, we hypothesized that if you add JH to the Manduca sextas’ food, then it will grow past the pupation point, never hit the commitment pulse, and be larger than the control group. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we gathered 8 Manduca sexta that were roughly 2 weeks old. We separated them into two groups (4 in each group) and labeled one group the control and the other the experimental group, or more specifically the hormone receiving group. We placed 4 caterpillars in a 4-cell plastic container (each in a separate cell) and repeated this process for the experimental group. For the control group, we added 10g of Manduca sexta food along with 5 drops of water to each cell for each caterpillar. We made sure the food was mixed up so the water would be consistent throughout. For the experimental group, we added 10g of Manduca sexta food along with 5 drops of Precor (the JH enhancing drug) to each cell for each caterpillar. Like the control group, we also made sure the food was mixed so that the Precor would be consistent throughout. We examined them for a week and took their weight measurements daily. We changed their food as needed, which was every 2-3 days. We took the means of the two groups’ difference in weight, and then we used the two-sample T-Test that was two-tailed to measure the significance of the average weight difference. 

Results:
The bar graph is based on the difference of weight each day between each caterpillar and visually exhibits the weight difference of the two groups of Manduca sexta. We also completed the two-sample T-Test which was two-tailed, and our P-value was 0.95. Nearing the end of week 1, we could see some of the caterpillars from the control group beginning to pupate, while the ones in the experimental group remained the same. We only recorded for 1 week but left the caterpillars in their containers with fresh food for an extra week. When we took another look at the caterpillars at the end the 2nd week, we were surprised as to what we found. There was 1 caterpillar in both the experimental and control group that seemed to be dead. Both of the caterpillars had no movement after a few days of the start of the experiment and were not eating much if at all. The interesting occurrence was when the small, feeble caterpillar in the control group grew significantly at the end of the 2nd week, while the tiny caterpillar in the experimental group remained motionless and what we assumed as lifeless. The other caterpillars in the experimental group were large with a bright green color. Two caterpillars in the control group had turned a brownish color while the other two had already pupated and had begun metamorphism. 

Discussion:
The p-value indicates that our data is not significantly different. It is demonstrated through the bar graph that the experimental group grew at a slightly faster rate than the control group. With this result, we fail to reject our null hypothesis. The experimental group and the control group had no significant weight difference, however their appearance was significantly different. At the end of the 2nd week, the Manduca Sexta remained a green color within the experimental group, which is the opposite sign for pupation. The Manduca sexta in the control group were a dark, brownish color, which is a sign that pupation is underway. Some of them had also began to pupate and metamorphose. We cannot accept our hypothesis since it focused on the difference in weight and size of the Manduca sextas. In future experiments, the focus should be on pupation vs no metamorphose. This would result in more accurate results and conclusions regarding how the high levels of the JH hormone affected the Manduca sextas. The timing of pupation is the most important result within this experiment, since it is controlled by the decline of JH. The absence of JH initiates metamorphosis. [Riddiford: 2003] If we are comparing levels of JH to metamorphosis, then pupation should have been our main focus in order to receive the best results. Further questions I have for the next experiment would be the amount of JH given to the experimental group. Is it possible to give the caterpillars too much hormone and result in death? This future experiment would be a significant discovery for farmers, considering they would want to prevent these pests.
