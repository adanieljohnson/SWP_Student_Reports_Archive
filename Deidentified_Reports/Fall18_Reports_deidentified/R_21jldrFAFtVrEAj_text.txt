Title: Effects of A23187 and Neomycin on the second messenger, phospholipase C, in the IP3-mediated signal transduction pathway in slime mold, Physarum Polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarym Polycephalum, slime mold, is a multinucleate syncytium that uses signal transduction pathways in order to respond to their external and internal environment.  When thinking about the signal transduction pathway, specifically the, IP3-mediated pathway, we hypothesized that Physarum will grow towards the phospholipase C activator, A23187, and away from the phospholipase C inhibitor, Neomycin, during the chemotaxis assay.  The hypothesis predicted was tested through a chemotaxis assay through which P. Polycephalum was exposed to A23187 and Neomycin.  This was done by preparing test solution plates and then scoring the plates by measuring distance and direction of migration.  Our results compare the average rate of migration of Physarum when exposed to A23187 and Neomycin.  We found that there was not a statistical significance when exposed to the activator nor the inhibitor.  However, we believe procedural error could have contributed to the inconclusive results.  Being able to study activators and inhibitors are important when considering antibiotics and their effects in the presence of different bacteria or viruses.  



Introduction:
All organisms use signal transduction pathways in order to respond to their external and internal environment [Johnson: 2018].  Physarum Polycephalum, slime mold, is a multinucleate syncytium that spends the majority of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage.  Since Physarum is a multinucleate syncytium, all of the nuclei contained within the plasma membrane undergo mitosis at the same time, which means that each plasmodium behaves as a single giant cell [Johnson: 2018].  Physarum is often found in areas of darkness that is also high in humidity, like within damp decomposing leaves and ground debris.  When in a dark and high humidity environment, Physarum moves around looking for food through the use of actin microfilaments.  But, when food becomes unavailable or the humidity drops, the plasmodium forms a suspended stage known as a sclerotium.  During this hibernation state, the sclerotia are able to stay viable and the plasmodium will reappear in the presence of food.  Besides food being a stressor, light and heat, are additional stressors that can cause differing responses in the organism [Johnson: 2018].  
	P. Polycephalum, is different from multicellular organisms because every response in this organism is controllled and coordinated through intracellular signal transduction pathways.  According to the study Mechanism of signal propagation in Physarum polycephalum, the communication mechanism in P. Polycephalum, demonstrates a simple feedback between a signaling molecule and propagating contraction front in order to explain the slime mold's behavior [Alim, Andrew, Pringle, Brenner: 2017].  Usually, an external or internal stimulus activates a receptor or other protein, which causes the release of a second messenger.  The second messenger then triggers the response pathway by binding to an effector, which causes the cell to change its behavior and respond to the initial stimulus.  There are many different types of signal transduction pathways, in Physarum, there are two major G-protein coupled receptor pathways, the cAMP-mediated path and the IP3-mediated path.  Additionally, there are ion channel-coupled signaling pathways in Physarum [Johnson: 2018].  Our experiment focused on the IP3-mediated pathway, which uses inositol triphosphate as the second messenger.  In this signal transduction pathway, a G-protein activates the effector enzyme, phospholipase C.  This effector enzyme works by cleaving a membrane phospholipid in order to produce diacylglycerol and IP3, both of which are second messengers.  These second messengers then activate or inhibit other enzymes and their activity [Johnson: 2018].  
	We know that when in the plasmodium stage, slime mold has many different types of behaviors like, cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis, chemotaxis, gravitaxis, and structural reorganization.  When looking at the chemotaxis behavior of Physarum, it undergoes positive and negative chemotaxis as it is able to sense molecules in its environment [Johnson: 2018].  The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the significance of phospholipase C and IP3 in the signaling transduction pathway of Physarum.  We investigated the significance through the addition of A23187 and Neomycin.  A23187 is an activator of phospholipase C and Neomycin is an inhibitor of phospholipase C.  Physarum Polycephalum was used in this experiment because we are able to explore and observe a variety of cell-level processes without the use of a microscope.  Physarum is also a good model organism as it uses many of the same signal transduction pathways as humans, but is much easier to grow, handle, and observe.
	According to, The Response of Physarum polycephalum to Extracellular 〖Ca〗^(2+), A23187 has been useful in illuminating the uptake of 〖Ca〗^(2+) in cellular metabolism [Holmes, Stewart: 1979].  When thinking about the cellular response Physarum had in the presence of this chemical, it was hypothesized that Physarum will grow towards the phospholipase C activator, A23187, and away from the phospholipase C inhibitor, Neomycin, during the chemotaxis assay.  Our lab group hypothesized this because we know if phospholipase C is activated then it will produce second messenger molecules that will stimulate or inhibit activity through different signal transduction pathways.  Hence, the A23187, should activate the enzyme phospholipase C, which will produce second messengers like 〖IP〗_3.  As 〖IP〗_3 is a major signal transduction pathway in many cells, the binding of this molecule should allow for a 〖Ca〗^(2+) channel opening which will lead to stimulation or inhibition of activity.  The opposite result would be seen then in the presence of Neomycin, an inhibitor of the enzyme phospholipase C.  


Materials and Method:
In order to better understand the way that cells sense molecules in their environment, we looked at the way that Physarum responded to a phospholipase C activator and inhibitor.   In order to begin the chemotaxis assay, six 100 mm petri plates with 2% agar in water were taken, these are the assay plates.  On the back of the petri plates, patterns of squares were drawn and labeled as shown in Figure 1.  On three of the plates, phospholipase C activator, A23187, was assigned in the space labeled "+ ____", as shown in Figure 1.  On the remaining three plates, phospholipase C inhibitor, Neomycin, was assigned.  Once all of the plates were labeled correctly, we were able to start preparing the petri plates for the assay.  In order to prepare for the assay, a flat metal spatula needed to be sterilized with 95% ethanol.  Once sterilized, three 1 cm x 1 cm squares were cut in the agar of each of the six water agar plates.  The block of agar on the left side (+ test solution) and middle block (physarum culture) were removed, but the block on the right side (blank) was kept in place.  
Once the assay plates were labeled correctly, the test solution plates were to be prepared.  Two 100 mm petri plates with 2% agar in water were taken, these are the test solution plates.  A 20X stock of the phospholipase C activator, A23187, was diluted to 1X.  The dilution occurred by using 0.5 Ml of the 20X stock and then adding 9.5 Ml of water in order to dilute the stock solution to 1X.  Once diluted, the solution was poured onto the water-agar plate and was allowed to soak for approximately 10 minutes.  After soaking, the excess solution was poured off and a kimwipe was used to blot off the remaining liquid.  Once prepared, the spatula was re-sterilized and three 1 cm x 1 cm square slabs were cut from the phospholipase C activator, A23187, test solution plate.  After the square slabs were cut, sterile forceps were used, and one slab was placed into each of the three corresponding assay plates over the correctly labeled square, as in Figure 1.  The same process was completed for the test solution plate containing the phospholipase C inhibitor, Neomycin.
After the assay and test solution plates were prepared, the stock Physarum plates were taken.  The re-sterilized spatula was used to cut six 1 cm x 1 cm square slabs from the Physarum culture from the stock plate.  Using sterile forceps, these six square slabs were transferred to the corresponding assay plates on the middle block.  
Once the assay plates were prepared with all of the corresponding square slabs, the lids of each plate were taped down in order to hold it in place.  The plates were also wrapped completely in foil and placed into a black bag.  The black bag was kept in a drawer for about 18-24 hours.  
After 18-24 hours had passed, the assay plates were ready to be scored.  A millimeter ruler was taken to measure the distance the Physarum migrated from the initial blocks in the center of the plates towards the test substance.  The distance migrated was measured from the edge that migrated farthest back to the nearest edge of the originating block.  The direction of migration was also indicated.  Positive direction of migration was indicated if the culture grew towards the test solution block and negative direction of migration was indicated in the culture grew towards the blank block.   



Results:
When looking at Figure 2, one can see that on average the Physarum that was in the presence of phospholipase C activator, A23187, migrated about -0.054 mm/hour, but the three assay plates did not share a common direction of migration.  Additionally, one can see that the Physarum that was in the presence of phospholipase C inhibitor, Neomycin, did not have any rate or direction of migration.  Even though the results of this experiment appeared to be inconclusive with the lack of rate of migration and inconsistency in direction of migration, a one-sided t_test was performed to better understand the statistical significance.  When a one-sided t_test was conducted for the phospholipase C activator, we found that the mean value for the A23187 condition's influence on Physarum movement was not statistically significently different (t=-0.534, d.f.=3, p_value=0.6304).  We were unable to conduct a t_test on the phospholipase C inhibitor because there was no rate of migration for all three assay plates.  
	Since the results of this experiment were inconclusive, Figure 3 displays the results we expected to see for Physarum when in the presence of A23187 and Neomycin.  The results we expected to see for Physarum movement in the presence of A23187 was movement in the direction towards the test solution block, about 0.1 mm/hr.  For Physarum movement in the presence of Neomycin, we expected to see movement in the direction of the blank block about -0.087 mm/hr.    



Discussion:
The results from the one-sided t_test that was conducted lead us to conclude our results from our experiment were inconclusive.  As observed in this experiment, the Physarum in the presence of the activator showed no correlation of movement in any direction, as some plates showed no rate of migration, another plate showed migration towards the blank block, and one towards the test solution block.  This inconsistency in direction of migration or lack-thereof was unexpected.  The Physarum in the presence of the inhibitor showed no rate of migration among any of the assay plates, which was also unexpected.  Therefore, as observed in this experiment, we are unable to conclude any correlation between Phospholipase C activators and inhibitors on Physarum movement.  
However, procedural error could have had an effect on the results of this experiment.  One procedural error that could have affected our results was that water agar plates were used instead of PDA plates.  This lack of food could have caused the plasmodium to go into the suspended stage, sclerotium, which could have contributed to the inconclusive results.  However, some of the assay plates had a piece of oatmeal where the Physarum culture block was, which means that the Physarum did not need to move around to look for food because it was already present on the culture.  This could have also contributed to inconclusive results.  An additional error could have been that the room in which the experiment was performed was cooler than the incubator in which the Physarum stock plates were kept.  The aluminum foil that covered the assay plates and the black bag where the plates were stored, could have led to a much darker environment than which the Physarum stock were kept.  Both of these changes in temperature and light intensity could have been stressors that led to differing responses in the Physarum organism.  
	Our expectations for this experiment were slightly supported by conclusions from the study, The Response of Physarum polycephalum to Extracellular 〖Ca〗^(2+), as they found that A23187 was useful in illuminating the uptake of 〖Ca〗^(2+) in cellular metabolism [Ross, Stewart 1978].  This finding supports our expectations for this experiment, as we expected the activator to help stimulate the activity and movement of Physarum.  Additionally, the study, Growth of Dicyostelium discoideum in the presence of antibiotics, found that neomycin minimized contamination [Love, Chassy, Krichevsky, 1972].  This finding helps to support our expectations for this experiment in that the minimization of contamination found in this study means that in the presence of neomycin the Dictyostelium discoideum did not grow as much.  This is what we expected of the inhibitor in our experiment also, in that it would inhibit the activity and movement of Physarum.  
	Since our results were inconclusive, the experiment should be performed again in order to see if we are able to accept or deny our initial hypothesis under differing conditions.  These findings are important when considering antibiotics and their effects in the presence of different bacteria or viruses.  We can think about how better understanding activators and inhibitors, like A23187 or Neomycin, would possibly help to inhibit the growth of viruses.  It is important to continue to study the effects of these activators and inhibitors to better understand their effect of migration and growth of different organisms.
