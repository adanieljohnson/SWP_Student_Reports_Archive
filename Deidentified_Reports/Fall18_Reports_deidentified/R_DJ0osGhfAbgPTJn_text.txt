Title: Chloroplast Activity shows no difference in C3 and C4 Plants nor in Light or Dark Conditions

Abstract:
Plants produce the majority of usable energy on earth through the use of specific organic materials along with energy from sunlight to produce six carbon glucose molecules in a process known as photosynthesis. The process of photosynthesis is carried out differently in different types of plants, as C4 plants have an extra step in their photosynthetic process that allows them to be more efficient than C3 plants. In this experiment, the types of plants that were tested were a C3 plant, Spinacia oleracea, and a C4 plant, Chrysanthemum idicum. To test the photosynthetic rates of these plants, four trials were run: C3 plant in light, C4 plant in light, C3 plant in dark, and C4 plant in dark. The photosynthetic rates were measured using spectrophotometry, DCIP, and a two way ANOVA test was used to analyze the results. Ultimately, no significent difference was discovered between any of the trials, suggesting that light and type of plant have no effect on photosynthetic rate. One major implication of this is that it is currently unknown which plants may be better suited to survive in the ever warming global climate.

Introduction:
In order to survive, all living organisms require energy to live and carry out all of the biological processes that are required to sustain life. The way in which different organisms obtain this energy depends on what type of organism they are. Plants as well as some protists and certain bacteria carry out photosynthesis in order to capture and store energy from the sun. The process of photosynthesis can be simplified to the equation 6 carbon dioxide molecules plus 12 water molecules plus light yields one glucose molecule, 6 oxygen molecules, and 6 water molecules [Johnson: 2016]. More specifically, chlorophyll molecules within the cells of plants absorb the solar energy which results in high energy electrons triggering a series of chemical reactions that ultimately results in the production of glucose. This glucose can then be broken down and used to create ATP, the energy currency of the cell, via cellular respiration. Photosynthesis can be broken down into two different stages, light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light dependent reactions generate a proton gradient through a series of redox reactions, resulting in ATP synthesis. The light-independent reactions take the ATP and the enzyme complex RUBISCO and use the reducing power of NADPH to produce glucose molecules.
	Within the plant family, there are multiple types of plants, including C3 and C4 plants. C3 plants are the most common type of plant and they execute photosynthesis in accordance to the general mechanism above. C4 plants, on the other hand, have an extra step in the photosynthetic pathway before the light independent reactions that results in less carbons being used and lost throughout the entire process [Wang: 2012]. They pump carbon from mesophyll cells to bundle sheath cells, all the while fixing carbon molecules to maintain CO2 levels many times higher than normal. This is important because unlike C3 plants, such as trees and wheats, C4 plants, like cacti and corn, often live in hotter, drier, and overall more difficult habitats. By being more efficient with the limited resources that they have, the C4 plants are able to conserve carbon and survive in more difficult situations.
	For this lab, the differences in photosynthetic activity between the chloroplasts of C3 and C4 plants was tested. The C3 plant was Spinacia oleracea, also known as spinach, and the C4 plant was Chrysanthemum idicum, better known as chrysanthemum. Spectrophotometry was used to determine the percent change in absorbance. To test the photosynthetic ability of the chloroplasts of these two plants, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP) was used as an electron acceptor to simulate photosynthesis. Prior to being reduced, DCIP is a dark blue color, but as photosynthesis proceeds, the DCIP becomes a clear color [Ernster: 1967]. The difference in the absorbance before and after photosynthesis can then be related to photosynthetic rate. We hypothesized that because sunlight is required in order for photosynthesis to proceed, the chloroplasts in the light would have a greater percent change in absorbance than in the dark [Sorek: 2012]. In addition, we hypothesized that the Chrysanthemum idicum chloroplasts would have a greater percent change in absorbance than the Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts because C4 plants are more efficient than C3 plants at photosynthesizing.

Materials and Method:
First, four Spinacia oleracea leaves and about a dozen Chrysanthemum idicum leaves were collected. The Spinacia oleracea leaves were washed, deveined, and crushed in a cold mortar and pestle along with 10 Ml of grinding buffer. The Chrysanthemum idicum leaves were also crushed in a cold mortar and pestle with 10 Ml of grinding buffer. The leaves were ground into a thick paste and then 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added to both pastes. The Spinacia oleracea mixture was strained through cheesecloth into a beaker, and the same was done with the Chrysanthemum idicum mixture into a separate beaker. The mixtures were then poured into two separate centrifuge tubes. The tubes were then placed in the centrifuge and were spun for three minutes at 4 degrees celsius and 200xG. After centrifuging the tubes, the supernatants of both mixtures were poured into new centrifuge tubes and the pellets were discarded. The new tubes were then placed in the centrifuge and spun for ten minutes at 4 degrees celsius and 1000xG. After, the supernatants were then discarded and 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellets and mixed with a micropipet. 
	Next, 14 test tubes were obtained and divided up into two sets and labeled 1-7. The test tubes labeled 1 were controll tubes and had 8 Ml of water added. All 14 tubes then had 2 Ml of reaction buffer added. Every tube except for the controll received 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP. 6 tubes for the first set had 100 microliters of Spinacia oleracea chloroplast mixture added to them and 6 test tubes for the second set had 100 microliters of Chysanthemum idicum chloroplast mixture added. The absorbances of all 14 tubes were measured with a spectrophotometer set to read at 600 nm. This values served as the time zero value. Test tubes 2-4 for both sets were placed by a window to be the light group and tubes 5-7 for both sets were placed in a drawer to be the dark group. After 30 minutes, the absorbances of all of the tubes was measured again, and the percent change was calculated. The results were then analyzed using a two-way anova test with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
A two way ANOVA test was used in order to analyze the data collected from this experiment. The results of the ANOVA test were insignificent for the light v. dark test (d.f.=1, p=0.587) and for the C3 v. C4 test (d.f.=5, p=0.613) with an alpha value of 0.05 and p values greater than 0.05. One general trend seen in figure 1 is that the C3 plants experienced a greater negative percent change in absorbance ( tubes became more clear) compared to C4 plants. The other general trend shown by the data is that the chloroplasts of both C3 and C4 plants had a more negative percent change in absorbance when in dark conditions than in light conditions.

Discussion:
According to the data collected, it was found that there was no significent difference with regard to photosynthetic rate between light and dark environments. Similarly, it was found that there was no significent difference between the photosynthetic rates of the C3 plant, Spinacia oleracea, and the C4 plant, Chrysanthemum idicum. This means that there was not enough evidence provided to prove that any of the conditions (light v. dark, C3 v. C4) had a non-random effect on the photosynthetic rates that was collected. As a result, the data rejects the hypotheses as there was no correlation between the different types of light exposure or type of photosynthetic routes used by the chloroplasts.
	
Although the data did not reflect it, photosynthetic rates should be greater in light than in dark conditions. This is due to light being a necessary component of the photosynthetic process in order to create the ATP needed to run the light-independent reactions. Without light, the light-independent reactions would still occur, thus some photosynthesis occurs, though the rate would be much slower due to much lower input from the light-dependent reactions. Although no significent difference between C3 and C4 plants in photosynthetic rate was found, prior studies have been able to prove that C4 plants are more efficient than C3 plants in terms of photosynthesis [Wang: 2012]. In this study, they found that C4 plants had a greater biomass and CO2 fixation as well as concentration, which proved that the C4 plants photosynthesized more efficiently than the C3 plants. 

The obtained results are neither significent, nor accurate according to previous experiments and understandings about photosynthetic rates. One potential error in this lab was that the trial was not allowed to run for very long, nor were many trials used. Although all of these factors could not be controllled in an ideal manner would, such as letting the chloroplasts photosynthesize for a much greater period of time. Biologically, this would be beneficial for the chloroplasts because the photosynthetic process would be allowed to begin and reach a more constant rate of photosynthesis. In this experiment, the chloroplasts had to go through the light dependent reaction prior to the light independent reaction. If the photosynthesis was allowed to occur for longer, the light dependent reaction would be able to occur and produce enough organic materials to reach a constant rate of the light independent reaction. In the future, this lab should be done for a longer period of time and with more trials so that more accurate results regarding photosynthetic rates can be obtained. Another potential source of error was that although roughly the same amount of leaves from the Spinacia oleracea as the Chrysanthemum idicum were attempted to be used, there may have not been an equal amount. The chrysanthemum in general has much tougher leaves than spinach, and as such, were much more difficult to grind and extract their chloroplasts. Chrysanthemums tend to live in much more difficult environment than spinach, as they thrive in the autumn with the colder weather compared to the spinach. This accounts for the tougher leaf structure of the chrysanthemum. Because they were tougher to grind up, fewer leaves were used for the chrysanthemum, thus fewer chloroplasts. This would affect the photosynthetic rates as the more chloroplasts that the tubes have, the more photosynthesis will be able to be carried out. In the future, more time should be spent making sure that the amount of leaves used is very similar so that it can be more certain that the tubes all have roughly the same amount of chloroplasts.
	
Further research with C3 and C4 plants could be conducted with regards to the changing climate on earth. Due to climate change and global warming, it is understood that temperatures are rising at a rapid rate and that carbon dioxide levels are increasing as well. One study found that higher temperatures result in C4 plants having a greater photosynthetic rate [Sage: 2007]. The significance of this study is that C4 plants may be more fit to survive in the hotter environments being caused by climate change than C3 plants. This is seen in nature, as many plants that live in difficult environments with extreme temperature, such as a dessert, are exclusively C4 plants. Because they are able to store more CO2 than C3 plants, they are able to photosynthesize in difficult conditions with limited nutrients and organic materials. Another study found that increased carbon dioxide levels result in greater photosynthetic rate in C3 plants, but not in C4 species [Pajajaran: 2005]. This can be attributed to higher CO2 levels allowing the C3 plants to obtain more CO2 and overtake the C4 plants in photosynthetic rate because the C4 plants no longer have the advantage that they typically have with their enhanced CO2 storage ability. Because carbon dioxide levels are rising, C3 plants are no longer at a CO2 deficit compared to the storage of CO2 in C4 plants.As such, these results run contrary to the temperature theory in that C3 plants may in fact be more fit than C4 plants to survive and thrive in the changing environments being created by climate change. 
	
Ultimately, this experiment was not successful in proving that photosynthesis occurs at a greater rate in light than in dark conditions, and in C4 plants than in C3 plants. The results run contrary to the knowledge and prior research studied up until this point. In the future, this type of experiment can be used to bring about a better understanding of how plants and photosynthetic rates may be affected by a climate change and the effects of global warming.
