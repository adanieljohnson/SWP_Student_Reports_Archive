Title: No difference shown in aggression level in response to tank size in Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Agonistic behavior is a significant group in animal behaviors. Analyzing intraspecific agonistic behavior would result in a better understanding of the communication mechanism within species. The objective of this study was to discover the effect of tank size on aggressive behavior of fish. Betta Splendens were used as the model organism in the study. The hypothesis was that the subjects in big tank would have a lower aggression level than those in small tank. The aggressive level was indicated by the number of behaviors displayed and ranking of aggressiveness of each behavior. The study found that there was no statistically significant difference between the small tank and the big tank, suggesting that tank size tend not to influence the aggression behavior in fish. I inferred that there might be some flaws in the design of the study. Another explanation was that audience effect might act as a not controlled variable and cause the result to be not significant. Further study would be carried out amending the flaws in method design and analyzing more primary literature to find possible explanations. 

Introduction:
Animals exhibit a wide range of behaviors on daily basis, such as mating, defending territories, breeding offspring, and migration. Investigating animal behavior will help to develop understanding on the physiological purpose of behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection are analyzed. Agonistic behavior is the behavior of interest of this study. Agonistic behavior includes threats, displays, actual aggression, retreats, placation, conciliation [Barrows, 2001]. Those behaviors are valuable to study because of the usual communication involved which regulates the social interactions of the animals. I am inspecting the intraspecific agonistic behavior of the Betta splendens in this study. Betta splendens, also known as Siamese fighting fish, is a highly territorial fish. Males possess high level of aggression and will attack each other if they are placed in the same tank [“Guidelines Released”, 2016]. They are chosen to be the subject of the study also because of their colorful and easily observed display during aggression. They have two types of intraspecific movements, broadside movements and facing movements [Simpson: 1968]. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. Typical behaviors include: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing (increasing order of aggressiveness) [Johnson: 2016]. Facing movements, also in increasing order of aggressiveness, are pectoral fins erect, spread of opercula and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane” [Johnson: 2016]. Since they are known as territorial animals, I assumed that they would be more aggressive when other individuals appeared in their territory. The hypothesis was that when two male betta splendens were put in a small tank, they would exhibit more aggressive behavior than when they are put in a big tank. 

Materials and Methods:
First, two male Betta splendens were put in one small tank. The timer was started when the two fish saw each other. The different behaviors each fish shown were counted and categorized in the level of aggression in 60 seconds. Then the two fish were moved to a bigger tank and released from the farthest sides. Their behaviors were also recorded starting when they saw each other for 60 seconds. One-tail paired-t test was used in the study to examine whether the level of aggression of Betta Splendens was related to tank size. Paired t-test was used because the same individual fish was used in both small tank and big tank. For convenience of carrying out statistical test, the behaviors were ranked according to the level of aggression from 1 to 3 in both broadside movements and facing movements. For example, if the fish showed pelvic fin flickering, observer would write down “1” under broadside movements. Then the mean aggressive level of each type of movement was calculated. Last, the overall level of aggression in relation to tank size was calculated taking the average of the two means. 

Results:
It was observed that the fish in small tank tended to be more aggressive and displayed their behaviors for longer time. However, none of the fish actually had contact with each other even though the observers didn’t attempt to separate them. According to the data, the aggression level of large tank was 4.75 ± 2.5 and that of small tank was 6 ± 1.4 (Fig.1). The number was ordinal instead of cardinal and only showed the relative rank of aggression without a unit. A significant difference in the means of our different treatment was not found (t-stat=1.67, df=3, P=0.19). 

Discussion:
Overall, there was no significant difference between the aggression level in the small tank and big tank. My hypothesis that the big tank would show a lower aggression level than the small tank was rejected. The space did not appear to influence the aggression level of the fish. I suggest that there might be several reasons contributing to this result. First, the timing method may cause inaccuracy to the result. Because the timer was started when the fish saw each other, it may diminish the effect of lower aggression level. Since I assumed that the lower aggression level was caused by the lower chance of them running into each other, the time control method would eliminate this lower possibility in the result. Second, I might need to record their behavior for a longer time period. In observation, the timer was stopped when the frequency of aggressive behavior started to decline. The low aggression level might appear as the large tank causing the behavior to diminish faster than the small tank. Third, more subjects might be needed for the study since individual difference is relatively large in regards of animal behavior. Other related study has shown that correlation was founded between space allowance and agonistic behavior [Kondo: 1989]. Kondo’s study illustrated that the number of agonistic encounters in a group is positively related to the mean distance to the nearest neighbor in the group. However, there was also primary literature proposing the possible cause of the data not being significant. Cruz suggested in his paper in 2015 that audience effect would induce the fish to resolve the agonistic interaction in a shorter time. For future study, the study time period would be elongated to observe behavior change. More primary literature would be analyzed focusing on the method of evaluating agonistic behavior.
