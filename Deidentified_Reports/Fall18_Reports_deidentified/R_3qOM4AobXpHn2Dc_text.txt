Title: Agonistic Behaviors Patterns and Species Recognition in Male Betta splendins

Abstract:
Betta fish respond to other males in their environment with varying levels of agnostic behavior. In this experiment, Betta splendins were observed for their level of aggression towards other males as well as visually realistic fake betta fish when separated by a clear divider. It was expected that the fish would display more aggressive behaviors when exposed to a real fish than when exposed to a fake fish, but the data showed that the difference in aggression between a betta/ real betta and between a betta/ fake betta was not statistically significent. This finding suggests that aggressive behaviors in Betta splendins escalates in response to aggressive behaviors displayed by the opposing male. 


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and it seeks to understand how behaviors are shaped by evolution and selection. [Johnson: 2018]. Certain behaviors can be characterized as agnostic, social, etc. The test subject of this lab, male Betta splendins, are a common aquarium fish known to display extremely aggressive intraspecific behaviors [Braddock: 1955]. This experiment seeks to study intraspecific behavior patterns associated with both aggression and species recognition. Fish perform a variety of broadside and facing movements in the presence of other members of the species. The threatened fish can ignore the behavior, match it, flee, or escalate the behavior. These all have different costs to reproductive fitness. [Johnson:2018]. This experiment will observe agnostic behaviors of male Betta splendins in the presence of another male as well as in the presence of a realistic looking fake fish. The fish will be separated by a transparent partition. The behavior will be quantified by a ranking of aggression that assigns a score based on behavior and frequency of behaviors. Our hypothesis states that the male exposed to another male will exhibit more aggression than a male exposed to a fake fish. 

Materials and Method:
Two male fish were placed in a tank divided by a clear partition. The test subject fish was observed for five minutes. Each behavior was recorded over the duration of the period. The fishâ€™s aggression score was calculated by giving it one point for each display of pelvic fin flickering or erect pectoral fins, two points for each display of tail beating or opercula spreading, and three points for each display of tail flashing or red mane display. The test fish was then given five minutes of rest. The test fish was exposed to a fake Betta splendins with a clear partition between them for five minutes and given a score based on the same scale of behaviors. This was repeated for the three remaining test fish. A two-tailed t_test was used for statistical analysis. 


Results:
The difference in aggression between a betta/ real betta and between a betta/ fake betta was not statistically significent. (t= 1.6, d.f.= 6, p= 0.16). 



Discussion:
The hypothesis was not supported by the data. While a betta interacting with a real fish did have a higher average aggression rating than a betta interacting with a fake fish, the difference in aggression was not statistically significent. This could be because test fish #4 acted differently than test fish 1-3, displaying higher levels of aggression towards the fake fish than the real fish. Betta fish are often very aggressive towards other male bettas, displaying a number of agnostic behaviors that the other fish can respond to by ignoring, fleeing, matching, or escalating the behavior [Johnson:2018]. It is possible the fake fish prompted less aggression because it was unable to respond to the real fish with its own aggressions. The intensity of the attack prompted by visual cues of aggression is directly proportional to the persistence of the opponent [Bronstein: 1981]. The fake fish is unable to create aggressive visual cues or be persistent in aggression towards the test fish, so it prompted less response. Despite this, the test fish exhibited some agnostic behaviors, which could have been prompted by visual cues of coloring, which is a distinctive red or blue in bettas. It would be interesting to re-do the experiment without a barrier separating the fish to see if being up close made the betta more or less responsive to the fake fish.
