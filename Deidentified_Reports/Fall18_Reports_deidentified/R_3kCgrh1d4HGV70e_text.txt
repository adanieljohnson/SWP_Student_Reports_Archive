Title: Effect of Atrazine, a Photosynthesis II Inhibitor, and Light Intensity on Photosynthesis Hill Reaction in Enriched Chloroplasts

Abstract:
The herbicide Atrazine is a Photosynthesis inhibitor that has have harmful effects on the environment due to its effect on cell growth and photosynthesis. In this study, we found that the addition of Atrazine in enriched chloroplasts lead to reduction of photosynthesis and oxidative strain in photosynthetic redox reactions. We quantified the photosynthetic reduction activity with the Hill Reaction by using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance. The percent change in absorbance decreased when the chloroplasts were treated with Atrazine; thus, the photosynthetic light reaction rate (Hill Reaction) decreased. We further explored the effect of the reaction rate with differing light intensities. We found that the average absorbances under the spectrophotometer decreased with decreased light intensity; therefore, decreasing the light intensity decreases the rate of photosynthesis for both the controll group and treatment group. Our results show that Atrazine does inhibit the photosynthesis rate by attacking the electron transport chain, PSII, reducing the redox reaction required for photosynthesis and ATP synthesis. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is an important metabolic process for plants, some protists, and bacteria to capture and store energy from light. It involves many redox reactions in which electrons that carry energy are transferred down an electron transport chain. This energy develops a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane which then drives ATP synthesis. Electron transfer reactions can be measured by measuring the ATP production; however, ATP production is difficult to measure so alternative electron acceptors are easier to measure. The Hill Reaction is the process of electron transfer in the presence of chloroplasts and light. In this experiment, the addition of Atrazine, a photosynthesis II inhibitor, to enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation was studied to determine its effect on the Hill Reaction. An assay for the electron acceptor DCIP will be used to determine if the herbicide Atrazine, a Photosynthesis II Inhibitor, effected the redox reaction. In a previous study, it was shown that the addition of Atrazine on Algae reduced the rate of photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and cell numbers [PluMley, Davis: 1980]. In another study examining differing light intensities with the addition of Atrazine, it was shown that the exposure to more light with Atrazine caused the photosynthesis rate to be more tolerant towards the inhibitor [Olsson, Fraysse, Bornman: 2000]. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is with the addition of the Atrazine, absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis will be lower at a higher light intensity (100%) than at lower light intensity (50%) or in dark. The dependent variable will be the absorbance of DCPIP in photosynthesis. The independent variable will be the differing light intensity on the enriched Chloroplasts. The controll groups will be the chloroplast with no added Atrazine while the treatment groups will be the chloroplasts with added Atrazine. We will then compare the controll groups and treatment in the dark, 50% light, and 100% light. 

Materials and Method:
Materials:
Water - 150 Ml
Chloroplasts  - 6 Ml
130mM DCIP - 50 Ml
100mM Phosphate buffer pH 6.5- 50 Ml
Atrazine (herbicide) - 15 Ml
Grinding buffer- 15 Ml

Method:
1.  Label 19 large test tubes as below, and place them in a tube rack.
2.  Prepare 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes. only make 1 replicate of the blank. Make 6 different mixtures.
3.  Add 100 μl of the chloroplasts to Tubes #1-18.
4.  Mix each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts.
5.  Transfer to spectrophotometer cuvettes.
6.  Immediately blank the spectrophotometer with Tube 0. Immediately measure the absorbance of all samples (Time Zero data points).
7.  Place samples 1-3 and 10-12, into complete darkness. Place samples 4-6 and 13-15 under a lamp with the light source half covered, and samples 7-9 and 16-18 under an unobscured light source.
8.  After 10 minutes, blank spectrophotometer with Sample 0. Read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After recording, put the 3 dark samples back in a drawer after each measurement.
9.  After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total), blank the spectrophotometer. Then measure the absorbances a second time for all.  
10.  After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank spectrophotometer, measure absorbances one more time for all.
11. Record results. 

Results:
To analyze the effect of Atrazine on photosynthesis, we quantified the photosynthetic reduction activity with the Hill Reaction by using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance. We found that the addition of Atrazine in enriched chloroplasts lead to reduction of photosynthesis and oxidative strain in photosynthetic redox reactions. We did three t_tests, treating the samples without Atrazine as controll groups. The samples with atrazine were our treatment groups. We found that Atrazine decreases the rate of photosynthesis when compared to the controll group. Therefore, the percent change in absorbance decreased with time in the treatment group meaning the photosynthetic light reaction (Hill Reaction) decreased. We further explored the effect of the reaction rate with differing light intensities. We looked at both the controll and treatment groups in the dark, 50% light, and 100% light. The Average absorbance of sample 1-3 was compared to average absorbance of sample 10-12. Both groups were under dark condition. The average absorbances under the spectrophotometer decreased with decreased light intensity; therefore, decreasing the light intensity decreases the rate of photosynthesis for both the controll group and treatment group. 

Discussion:
Many studies have shown that Atrazine inhibits the rate of photosynthesis such as the study with Phaeodactylum tricornutum plant that was treated with Atrazine. The Atrazine entering the chloroplasts attacked the electron transport chain, especially PSII since it is a photosynthesis II inhibitor, causing oxidative stress which effected the expression of photosynthesis in the plant [Bai, Sun, Xie, Song, Zhu, Su, Qian, Fu: 2015]. We found also that the exposure to more light with Atrazine caused the photosynthesis rate to be more tolerant towards the inhibitor similar to another study [Olsson, Fraysse, Bornman: 2000]. In another study, the effect of atrazine on Photosystem II in aquatic organisms was shown to be toxic. The Bioassay helped determine the target sites in the electron transport chain PSII for PSII inhibitors. The results showed the imbalanced oxidation in the redox reactions leading to the decreasing rate of photosynthesis [Laviale, Morin: 2016]. In conclusion, our study showed how Atrazine, a Photosynthates II inhibitor, disturbs the electron transport chain. The energy in PSII decreased due to Atrazine inhibiting electrons from leaving chlorophyll to move to plastiquinone; thus, there was a decrease in developing a proton gradient and ATP synthesis needed for photosynthesis.
