Title: A Study of Photosynthesis: How pH manipulation of the chloroplast environment did not have a significent effect on the photosynthetic rates of spinach (Spinacia oleracea)

Abstract:
In this experiment, we focused on the effect of acidic conditions on the photosynthetic activity of spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea), intending to find a connection to real-world environmental impacts, like the Acid Rain phenomenon and air pollution. We hypothesized that an increase in acidity would cause a decrease in absorption after centrifuge treatment. We measured this by grinding spinach leaves with a grinding buffer solution and spinning the ground solutions in a centrifuge in 3 increments of 10 minutes, re-suspending the leftover pellets with varying levels of acidic solutions (pH 3, 5, and 7). After spinning, we collected the three separate pH samples and spread them out to 9 test tubes, with 1 blank tube, and treated the samples with DCIP and reaction buffer, measuring the absorbance for each tube after time increments of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. We calculated percent changes for these, and were then able to run an anova test that categorized all of our results as insignificent, with an overall p_value of 0.616. Our absorbance decreased overall for the pH 5 and 7 solutions, and increased in the pH 3 solutions. We therefore failed to reject our null hypothesis.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis, an autotrophic property that is crucial for each individual biome, relies on a variety of processes and reagents in order to function successfully. It is characterized by processes such as glycolysis to produce ATP and reduced carbon, as well as electrochemical gradients that utilize high-energy electrons to drive cellular reactions. Many of the reagents for this process, including sunlight, water, and soil, are procured from the environment that the autotroph utilizes as its habitat. Because the process is so specific, it is important that the environmental conditions follow this specificity, and factors such as temperature and pH can alter these ecosystems greatly. The air, as well as the soil, can have an impact on photosynthetic activity, such as prolonged exposure to carbon dioxide having a negative effect on the chlorophyll concentration and overall rate of photosynthesis [Delucia: 1985]. Because the electron transport chain relies heavily on conformational changes in the individual proteins to create a concentration gradient, denaturing of these proteins, or an alteration of the pH of the water from the soil involved in this process, has been known to produce an effect in the composition of the plant body. Acidification, specifically in parts of the plant like the stroma, has been recorded as a photosynthetic inhibitor [Wu: 1992]. Therefore, in our experiment, we decided to focus on pH, specifically low pH, in order to determine the impact of an acidic environment on the photosynthetic production of a commonly-cultivated autotroph, spinach (Spinacia oleracea). We selected this variable because of its real-world implication in Acid Rain and air pollution, as ozone treatments have been noted to cause significent decreases in photosynthesis [Reich: 1986]. To measure this, we used absorbance as our method of measuring photosynthetic rate, as a decrease in absorbance demonstrates an increase in photosynthetic activity, and the DCIP chemical used reacts to form a deep blue color which is diminished as the chloroplast function. We hypothesized that a decrease in pH would cause a decrease in photosynthetic activity, determined by percent change in absorbance rates. 

Materials and Method:
We prepared spinach leaves by removing the leaves from their stems and adding 20 Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) and grinding in a mortar and pestle in 2 rounds of 10 Ml. Then, we transferred this into a 50 Ml centrifuge tube through a three-layered cheese cloth and spun for 10 minutes at 200 x G and 4 degrees Celsius. We poured out the supernatant into a separate centrifuge tube. Then, we spun this for 10 minutes at the same settings and then poured out that supernatant into another centrifuge tube, leaving the pellet alone. We suspended the pellet with normal grinding buffer and then separated it into 3 tubes equally. We added 5 Ml of pH 3 buffer to one centrifuge tube, 5 Ml of pH 5 buffer to another centrifuge tube, and 5 Ml more of grinding buffer to the last (controll) centrifuge tube. We allowed these to sit for 10 minutes. Then, we spun these for 10 minutes at the same settings, and re-suspended each pellet with 5 Ml grinding buffer after pouring out the supernatant. We transferred 100 microliters from each of the three centrifuge tubes and separated them into three sections of 3 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube empty of chloroplasts to serve as the blank (10 tubes in all). We added 6Ml of water to all tubes except for the blank, and added 8 Ml of water to that. The, we added 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP to all tubes except the blank. We added 2Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) to all tubes. We allowed each tube to sit for 10 minutes and measured absorbance using a spectrometer blanked at 600nm. We repeated the absorbance measures twice, after times 20 minutes and 30 minutes. Finally, we conducted a one-way anova statistical test using the percent change data from absorbance from times 10-30 minutes [Johnson: 2018].

Results:
Looking at our results, one can see that our average percent changes of absorbance from time 10 minutes to 30 minutes were -53.83% for the pH 3 tubes, 14.80% for the pH 5 tubes, and 20.43 for the pH 7 (neutral) tubes. The calculated standard deviations were 169.56 for the pH 3 tubes, 7.64 for the pH 5 tubes, and 21.08 for the pH 7 (neutral) tubes (Figure 1). The standard deviation for pH 3 was extremely high with a large percent change in tube 1 of the pH 3 samples. The highly negative value denotes a large increase in absorbance, while the positive percent changes denote a decrease in absorbance. The notably large standard deviation, and its large corresponding error bar (Figure 2), characterizes tube 1 as an outlier, and its elimination would decrease the standard deviation and change the standard deviation to the positive direction. The anova test characterized all of our comparisons as statistically insignificent, with an overall p_value of 0.616, which is highly insignificent. We observed a darker blue color in the tubes with higher absorbance, and a more clear, light color in the tubes with lower absorbance. 

Discussion:
Based on our data, we are unable to reject our null hypothesis on the basis that our results did not provide statistically significent differences in percent change of absorption between 10 and 30 minutes. As previously discussed, our standard deviation was notably high in the pH 3 samples, and the average percent changes in absorbance from 10-30 minutes was considerably lower than the other pH tubes, characterizing a large increase in absorbance between the two times. However, as the two other tubes at this time all demonstrated increases in absorbance, similar to the pH 5 measurements, it is likely that this result could be characterized as an outlier. We originally hypothesized that our pH 3 and pH 5 (more acidic) solutions would produce higher rates of absorbance, as we inferred that the chloroplast would be inhibited and therefore would not cause a discoloration due to the reduction of the DCIP dye. However, aside from the outlier value, we noticed decreases in absorbance on average, and the pH 5 tubes on average only demonstrated a slightly lower decrease in absorbance rates when compared to the neutral controll tubes (Figure 2). To improve these results, we could have taken a measurement at time 0 and compared that to time 30 minutes. Additionally, different autotrophs could have different reactions to different environments, so spinach (Spinacia oleracea) might not have been the best measure of pH differences. Waiting longer for the reaction to take place—for instance, comparing the results after more than 1 hour—might have also produced more conclusive results. The outcome of our experiment did not allow us to make a distinction between pH, but the role of this factor in autotrophic processes are highly investigated. For example, certain processes rely heavily not only on the pH, but also on significent changes in the pH, such as the proton gradient in the Electron Transport Chain of photosynthesis. As acidic environments are characterized by proton donors, pH environments affect the activity of the proton gradients in the same way that the electrochemical gradient affects it [Graber: 1976]. In a different way, if one investigates the role of acid rain in wildlife degradation, it has been determined that acid rain simulations in some cases has not had a significent effect on autotrophs such as the red oak tree and the sugar maple tree, though it potentially would have been more effective to determine long-term effects instead of effects over a short period of time [Reich: 1986]. Even though spinach and trees have structurally different compositions, they share highly similar energy production processes, so this potentially could connect to our short-term experiment as well. It has also been noted that the sulphate concentration in acidic rain can be highly damaging to leaf surfaces [Cape: 1992], so this potentially would have been a more effective experiment measuring the photosynthetic rates after leaf damage, instead of treating the chloroplast with acidic conditions after the grinding and buffering.
