Title: Effects of Methoprene (IGR) on Manduca Sexta Between the 4th and 5th Instar of Development

Abstract:
A regulatory compound known as an IGR has been found to mimic the effect of Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta caterpillars.  The weights and appearances of Manduca Sexta varied when receiving different concentrations of Methoprene (IGR) compared to those not receiving any at all in a previous experiment.  Based off of this, the group hypothesized that giving an intermediate dosage of Methoprene to Manduca Sexta every other day would cause the caterpillars to grow comparably smaller in weight to the controll group, and it would also prevent pupation.  This was carried out by assigning 4 Manduca Sexta to each group and alternating Methoprene with regular food in the treatment group.  The group discovered that the treatment group was comparably heavier than the controll group.  This is demonstrated by the Two-Sampled, One-Tailed T-Test which yielded a larger mean net change in mass for the treatment group.  The P value was 0.02 (lower than 0.05), meaning that the data was significent and demonstrated that our results were probably not by chance.  The alternative hypothesis was not supported with our data when considering weight, however, it was partially supported through observing a lack of molting in the treatment group.  Overall, repetition is necessary for more data analysis.

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta caterpillars enter a juvenile stage when they are larvae in order to develop traits necessary for adulthood.  As they leave their juvenile state, an event occurs between the 4th and 5th instar of development of Manduca Sexta known as the commitment pulse.  When this pulse is triggered, the organism is determined to pupate and become an adult.  The juvenile stage occurs due to the presence of a hormone known as Juvenile Hormone.  While researching Manduca Caterpillars, a group of scientists analyzed the effects of compounds that alter growth regulatory processes known as IGR's, similar to the naturally occurring Juvenile Hormone.  When an intermediate level (5%) of an IGR known as Methoprene in the form of Floss Flower was given daily to a treatment group, the caterpillars remained a similar weight to the controll diet group, yet they did not show signs of molting, and therefore pupation, while the controll group did [Johnson: 2018].  Our own group’s experiment will involve the introduction of that same IGR, known as Methoprene, in Manduca Sexta.  However, the group will administer the Methoprene to the treatment group at an intermediate level (5 drops) every other day and compare its effect on weight and pupation to Manduca with a normal diet.  This is designed to test whether or not giving the caterpillars Methoprene less frequently will affect their size.  If Methoprene is administered every other day to the treatment group of Manduca Sexta over a two-week period, the group hypothesizes that the Manduca Sexta will be comparably smaller than the controll group and they will not pupate.  The Manduca Sexta is the preferred choice for use of an organism in this experiment due to the intention to further explore and elaborate on the findings of the preceding experiment.

Materials and Method:
First, the group acquired 8 Manduca Sexta caterpillars.  All 8 of the Manduca Sexta were suspected to be in between their 4th and 5th instar of development as larvae.  The group randoMly selected half of the caterpillars for the controll group and half for treatment.  Both groups were placed in plastic containers with quadrants that were all uniform in size.  Air holes were poked on the lids and sides of these bins to ensure a controllled environment.  10 grams of the recommended Manduca Sexta diet was placed into every caterpillar's quadrant.  For the treatment group, 5 drops of 1: 1250 Methoprene was mixed into each of their 10g servings.  Every 24 hours, the group removed and replaced the 10g serving of food for every caterpillar, weighed the organism, and recorded observations via photographs.  Methoprene food was given to the controll group every other day, therefore testing our hypothesis.  All caterpillars were stored in an incubator while they were not being examined.  After two weeks, the experiment was terminated, and the group determined whether or not the caterpillar had pupated along with an analyzing the weights in grams of the Manduca Sexta.  The average daily weights for each group were graphed and a one-tailed, two-sample T-test with the net changes in mass for each caterpillar was performed on the data.  Our significance cutoff was a P value of 0.05.

Results:
Figure 1 indicates that the average caterpillar weight for the controll group increased until around day 9 of the experiment when it began to fluctuate and then decrease.  On the other hand, the average weight of the treatment group saw a gradual increase the entire time.  The highest average weight of the treatment caterpillars exceeded the highest average weight of the controll group by 1.725 grams.  Two-sample, One-Tailed T-Test results yielded a mean of the treatment data that was higher than the mean of the controll data.  The P-value was 0.020, degrees of freedom were 6, and the T-value was 2.610.  The population standard deviation for the treatment group was 0.909 and the population standard deviation for the controll group was 2.319.  It is important to note that the data from days 10-12 was not recorded and factored into results due to Hurricane Florence.  In terms of categorical variables, treatment group Manduca Sexta began to demonstrate a white/green tint over time as shown from Figure 2 to Figure 3.  Control group Manduca Sexta gradually turned brown and one caterpillar appeared to be covered in a molt as shown from Figure 4 to Figure 5.

Discussion:
While the previous case study on Manduca Sexta showed that an intermediate amount of IGR kept the treatment group at the same size as the controll, there were other concentrations of Methoprene in other groups that allowed for growth that exceeded the controll group [Johnson: 2018].  It is possible that a certain amount of Methoprene allows the larvae Manduca Sexta to grow in size in its developmental state and this amount could be incidentally similar to the dose we chose to give the treatment group.  Additionally, it is a reasonable assumption that the overall browning of the controll group in our experiment indicates that molting and pupation are imminent given the similar color of the single controll caterpillar that underwent pupation.  It is also fair to assume that given the white and light green coloring of every treatment caterpillar, they were not on track to pupation.  This claim is based on the results of the preceding experiment which demonstrated that Methoprene at certain levels turned a treatment group these colors and eventually led to premature death [Johnson: 2018].  Given the group's results, it is fair to say that the hypothesis was only partially supported.  While the group hypothesized that the treatment Manduca Sexta would be comparably smaller to the controll group, they grew to weigh more for the most part.  The group’s T-test values show that the mean net change in mass was greater for the treatment group than the controll group and that the data is significent and most likely not due to chance. Therefore, it is safe to say that Methoprene has an effect on size, but the immediate results from this experiment do not suggest an alignment with our alternative hypothesis.  They reflect the opposite.  A larger collection of data would be ideal for further consensus on its effect on size.  On the other hand, the hypothesis is partially supported due to the appearance of browning and one pupation occurrence in the controll group and the near opposite in the treatment group.  The group hypothesized that treatment group Manduca Sexta would be smaller, but it was also hypothesized that the caterpillars would not pupate.  In terms of possible error, It is feasible that consistent doses of Methoprene were not always given or that the instruction for Methoprene to be given every other day was not followed.  If this occurred, it could have had an effect on the results.  The next logical step in this experiment would involve more repetition for more data points.  This would allow a broader statistical analysis of what this amount of Methoprene and this particular schedule of delivery have on Manduca Sexta.  On a broader scale, IGR's and hormones can have a different effect on many different cells in many different organisms.  The way Manduca Sexta caterpillars react to receiving Methoprene that mimics Juvenile Hormone may be completely different from other insects and other organisms.  Hormones and other regulatory compounds are very complex areas of study that this experiment only touched upon in an isolated and highly-specific setting.
