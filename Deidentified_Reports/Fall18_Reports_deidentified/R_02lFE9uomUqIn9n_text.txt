Title: Fluridone's effect on Photosynthesis 

Abstract:
A major problem in america is the excessive use of herbicides on plants. The issue with using herbicides is the fact that herbicides are used to kill unwanted plants, but if they come in contact with plant which are wanted they could potentially slow the rate of photosynthesis in these plants so much that they are unable to survive. The object of this experiment is to test the pigmentation bleaching attributes of fluridone on photosynthesis rates using the chloroplast from spinach leaves. To do this we diluted 10 test tubes, five of which were control, and five of which were experimental and contained fluridone. We then placed them in light for ten minute increments three time and recorded the absorptions of each one after each increment in order to find the percent change of absorption over time. We found that the addition of fluridone did in fact slow the rate of photosynthesis. Each of our values decreased at a steady and significant rate with a P-value of 0.00138 after conducting a two sample T-test. The data reveal that pigmentation is necessary for photosynthesis to be carried out effectively.  

Introduction:
Photosynthesis takes place in an organelle called the chloroplast. The light-capturing photosystems of chloroplasts and bacteria are proteins that are plugged through internal, energy-transducing membranes, thylakoids. Each photosystem is a complete structural and functional unit that contains two essential components. [Allen,2002] The photosystems, II and I play a key role in photosynthesis. The two photosystems have a common organization and are functionally organized in two main moieties: a core complex, containing the reaction center where the photochemical reactions occur, and a peripheral antenna system that increases the light harvesting capability, but that is also involved in regulation of the photosynthetic process [Caffarri, 2014] The primary component is the reaction center, which allows an energized chlorophyll molecule to lose an electron to an acceptor molecule, thus initiating and powering electron transport. These pigment molecules absorb light, and keep the reaction center supplied with excitation energy. [Allen,2002] Photosynthesis is a precise process that of which requires particular conditions in order to conduct properly. The prior research that led to this question dealt with the absorption rates of photosynthesis in spinach leaves when exposed to light in different concentrations when an herbicide was added. Similarly we chose to use a different herbicide, fluridone. Which commercially is used as a slow-acting systemic herbicide used to control hydrilla, Eurasian watermilfoil and other underwater plants. It may be applied as a pellet or as a liquid. Like other systemic herbicides, it moves from submersed foliage to roots or immersed foliage. [Balyszak, 2016] In this experiment we will be using fluridone herbicide which is primarily used to bleach plant pigment.  Carotenoids and chlorophylls are essential constituents of photosynthetic membranes. The lack of carotenoids results in a block in membrane formation and the concurrent bleaching of the organism. [Popova, 1998] Light is so important to the photosynthetic process because light in photosynthesis has been ascribed either to a photolysis of carbon dioxide or to a photolysis of water and a resultant rearrangement of constituent atoms into molecules of oxygen and glucose [Arnon, 1971] Therefore when light absorption is disrupted by herbicides problems could arise.  One problem that could arise from pigmentation bleaching in plants is that the chloroplast, the main site of photosynthesis, would be unable to absorb light without its green pigmentation. Light, which is then used in the electron transport chain would no longer be able to react in order to create a proton concentration gradient. This would then in turn would disable the plant from creating NAD+, ATP and glucose efficiently. Based on this information, we hypothesize that the addition of Fluridone herbicide will decrease the activity of photosynthesis due to the bleaching of the plant pigment, because it will inhibit light absorption.


Materials and Methods:
To begin we packed a mortar and pestle with spinach leaves after letting the mortar and pestle cool on ice. We added 10 ml of grinding buffer to the pestle and grinded it for a few minutes. We then added 10 more ml of grinding pestle and grinded for another couple of minutes. We poured these contents into a beaker, after draining them through cheesecloth. Then we proceeded to put them in the centrifuge for ten minutes.  After the contents were centrifuged, we prepared the following test tubes and numbered them 1-11 (elevel was the blank) We started with 100 nanoliters of chloroplast in all the test tubes except for in the blank. We then added the chloroplast and mixed the test tubes. We then immediately transferred the curettes to the spectrophotometer and blanked it. We then took the absorbances of all of the test tubes at 600nm. Then we placed all of the test tubes under equal exposure of light for ten minutes. We then took the absorbances again. We did this same order of exposing them to light in ten minutes increments and then taking their absorbances two more times. We then took the differences in the trials percent change using this equation % change= [(Absorbance at Time ‘N’ – Absorbance at Time Zero)/Absorbance at Time Zero] x 100 and ran a paired T-test to determine significance.


Results:
Our results show that the experimental groups percent change over time were larger than the control group.The absorbances of the experimental group treated with 1 ml of fluridone had large absorbances to begin with and after three trials of light had decreasing absorbance rates which indicates the slowing of the photosynthetic process. These results are apparent in figure one where the average absorbance after ten minutes of light exposure was 2.26nm and then decreased by the 30 minute mark to 2.03nm which is a five percent decrease overall which can be seen in figure two. After running a two sample T-test our results were a P-value of 0.00138 which we can consider significant since it is smaller than 0.05. With these results we can reject the null hypothesis and accept our alternative hypothesis that we hypothesize that the addition of Fluridone herbicide will decrease the activity of photosynthesis due to the bleaching of the plant pigment, because it will inhibit light absorption.

Discussion:
It was thought that fluridone would interfere with the absorbance rates of light in the photosynthetic process and cause the plant to slow its photosynthesis. This is due to the fact that when chloroplast loses its pigmentation it is no longer able to absorb light as efficiently which in turn slows the rate of photosynthesis. This is evident because of the trends seen in figure one and figure two where the absorbances and percent change steadily decreased over time that the chloroplast were in light in all of the trials especially for those treated with fluridone.  Our findings were consistent with the findings of Yoshioka who found that to analyze the effect of ABA on the salinity-related signal transduction for regulation of gene expressions, ABA biosynthesis was inhibited with fluridone [Yoshioka et al. 1998]. Though her results were not the same the similarity lies in the inhibition of ABA which is a component which would effect and slow the rate of photosynthesis much like our experiment demonstrated. Furthermore, fluridone is used in many aquatic settings which could be hurting and affecting the rest of the environment. Specifically fluridone is used to control certain weeds such as, Aquatic weeds, barnyardgrass, Bermudagrass, blackgrass, cocklebur, crabgrass, foxtails, jimsonweed, Johnsongrass, ragweed, velvetleaf and many others. [Balyszak, 2016] Though our experiment effectively demonstrated that fluridone, through pigmentation bleaching, slows the rate of photosynthesis significantly, there are some factors that could be improved upon. For example, fluridone is primarily used on aquatic plant, and plant susceptibility to fluridone is associated with its uptake rate and rate of translocation, therefore, by using spinach leaves which is not an aquatic plant, the uptake may not have been as effective by its chloroplasts. This contributes to our overall understanding of photosynthesis because it reveals how important carotenoids are in plants for pigmentation.  Carotenoids also serve as precursors for two plant hormones and a diverse set of apocarotenoids they are colorants. [Nisar, 2014] It also shows the significance of plant pigmentation in the chloroplast when absorbing light.
