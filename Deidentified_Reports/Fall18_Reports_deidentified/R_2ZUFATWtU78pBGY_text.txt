Title: Limiting resources and their effects on Plants: How Light Affects Energy Allocation in Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
This experiment’s main goals were to outline the effects of sunlight on phenotypic plasticity and relative root to shoot ratios. Placed in poor conditions, plants must allocate resources to survive: whether that be through growth or maintaining current conditions. We hypothesized that Pisum Sativum placed in completely dark conditions would have larger root to shoot ratios than those placed in a normal light condition. This is because they would have to allocate resources to growth to find available sunlight, and would have larger roots than shoots. We found that with regard to weight, our root to shoot ratios were not statistically significent, and our alternative hypothesis was rejected. In regard to length, our root to shoot ratio were statistically significent and our alternative hypothesis was rejected (P=0.00). So, while weight root to shoot ratio is not affected by amount of sunlight, length root to shoot ratio is.


Introduction:
In order to take full advantage of all resources available, plants alter the distribution of their available nutrients-a process called phenotypic plasticity [Johnson: 2018]. Phenotypic plasticity allows growth patterns overtime to accommodate environmental conditions. In this experiment, we tested how light as a limiting resource affected energy allocation and phenotypic plasticity by measuring root to shoot ratios in the Pisum Sativum, or common field pea. The P. Sativum is a great model organism for this study because of its ability to take in nutrients fast. [Andrews: 1999]. By calculating biomass and relative root to shoot ratios we can determine the way in which the P. Sativum allocates energy in different light conditions. Our independent variable is the amount of light, either light or dark, and our dependent variable is the root to shoot ratio growth because of the specific condition. My group predicts that the P. Sativum in the light condition will have a smaller root to shoot ratio then that of the dark group because it does not need to allocate resources as readily to find sunlight. The dark group will have longer shoot in order to find sunlight, and have small roots to compensate for the energy provided for shoot growth. 


Materials and Method:
Initially four flower pot trays were put in an appropriate amount of soil-leaving about an inch on the pot free of soil. Each of the four pots was designated and labeled: two pots for the light and dark group. Holes were then poked three rows down and four across. Taking twelve P. Satium, we then filled each hole with a seed. About 100Ml of miracle grow was poured into each pot to spur growth, and followed by 100Ml of water. The holes were covered with soil and two pots were set in the dark condition and two in the light condition. Retuning every day for the next two weeks, each of the four pots were watered with 100Ml of water. At the end of the two weeks, up to twelve P. Sativum were removed from each condition, washed and dried. Separating their roots from their shoots, the plants were cut right above the visible bean. Using a ruler and a scale, we determined the length in centimeters and weight in grams of both the root and shoots to determine average root to shoot ratio for length and weight in each condition. In order to interpret the results of the root to shoot ratio of the two conditions, we ran a two-sample t_test. 


Results:
Shows the root to shoot ratio in regard to length and weight under the two conditions of light and dark.  The mean root to shoot ratio for weight in the light condition was 1.38 +/- 1.35 and our mean root to shoot ratio for length in the light condition was 0.511 +/- .136. The mean root to shoot ratio for length in the dark condition was 0.723 +/- .167 and the mean root to shoot ratio for length was 0.176 +/- .085. We found our root to shoot ratio for weight to be statistically not significent (t value=1.68, d.f.=16, pvalue:0.112). The root to shoot ratio for length was statistically significent (t value=6.45, d.f.=16, Pvalue:0.00). The trend displayed in our figure shows the light environment had a higher root to shoot ratio in weight and length than the dark condition.


Discussion:
We found that the mean weight in the light group was not statistically significently different from that of the dark condition. This means that our alternative hypothesis was rejected in regard to the weight root to shoot ratio. We believe this is due to the fact that there was outlier P. Sativum that contained a fused bean which contributed to the excess weight: making our average weight in the light condition off. Our alternative hypothesis supported our average length root to shoot ratio. This means our root to shoot ratio for length was statistically and significently different within the light and dark condition. A previous study found similarly that when certain macronutrients or sunlight were restricted, the root to shoot ratio increased in P. Sativum [Andrews: 1999]. They explained their results by citing energy allocation as the reason for an increase in root to shoot ratio. The group that was not exposed to nutrients or sunlight allocated their energy to growth in order to find the nutrients they lacked. This possible hypothesis or reasoning would further support our similar findings. More studies could be conducted in the future on the restriction of light on P. Sativum in order to learn more about phenotypic plasticity, or the best light conditions in which to grow certain types of plants in order to promote favored growth.
