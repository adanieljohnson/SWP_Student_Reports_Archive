Title: Injection of Lanthanum chloride would decrease the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of Anura

Abstract:
In order to understand how lanthanum chloride effects muscle, we utilized frog as our experimental subject to test our hypothesis. Calcium, being one of the most important elements in muscle contraction, would be block by the induction of lanthanum chloride, leading to decrease in muscle contraction. Based on these information, it was hypothesized that the injection of lanthanum chloride, the calcium channel blocker, would reduce the magnitude of muscle contraction in frog muscle. There were 3 frog legs used in the experiment. Each leg was measured before the injection with direct stimulation in the muscle. After injecting 2ml of lanthanum chloride into frog muscle, the same tests were conducted again on the subject. The average amplitude of the muscle contraction show significantly difference before and after the injection, meaning that lanthanum chloride did serve its effect and decrease the magnitude of the frog muscle contraction. Nevertheless, these were not enough to prove that lanthanum chloride serves as a calcium channel blocker. Comparing to former study, it was found that lanthanum chloride only decrease the calcium uptake, but not combine with the calcium to reduce its concentration. This suggests that our finding supported our hypothesis that lanthanum chloride block

Introduction:
Lanthanum chloride, also known as calcium blocker, has the effect to block the calcium channel inside an organism. Calcium is one of the most important elements in the process of muscle contraction. According to the research done by S.Ebashi and M.Endo, The calcium ion is the final activator of the contraction in human body. [Ebashi and Endo, 1968] In order to test its effect, we utilized frog as experiment subject of the injection of lanthanum chloride. The gastrocnemius muscle of the frog is similar to the gastrocnemius muscle of human. In frog, this muscle is controlled by the sciatic nerve. This nerve stimulates the gastrocnemius muscle for it to contract. If we inject lanthanum chloride into the gastrocnemius muscle, we would expect the smaller or no contraction for the gastrocnemius muscle. In other words, it was hypothesized that calcium channel blocker would undermine the contraction for muscle of Anura.

Materials and Methods:
For testing lanthanum chloride, the frog leg must be set up in a way that we can stimulate it while monitoring its contraction on a digital level. In this experiment, there were 3 frog legs cut and skinned. Each frog leg was prepared as the sciatic nerve exposed from the muscle. The gastrocnemius muscle was also separated from the bone alone for us to stimulate. Frog leg was placed inside a clay and the gastrocnemius muscle was tied up with a string on a right stand. The movement of the string represented the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle if the string was in tension. The right stand was connected to the computer, so the movement of the string could be monitored through an application called Labscribe.  The computer was also connected to a stimulator that could stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle through two metal needles. On the computer, we could control the amplitude that we applied on the muscle and monitor the amplitude of the muscle contraction. Once the system was set up, 3 frog legs could be tested for the level of muscle contraction without injecting the lanthanum chloride. Different amplitudes were set as the stimulus for us to see the corresponding amplitude of the muscle contraction (from 0.01V to 5V). After we recorded the data, we injected 2ml of lanthanum chloride into each frog leg and the same test was ran again on 3 frog legs. Then, we compared the data before the injection and after the injection. Paired t-test was used in this experiment to see if there was statistical significance between the two sets of data.

Results:
The average data of the 3 frog legs was calculated and compared. The data shows that the average amplitude on each level of stimulus after the injection is smaller than the average amplitude before the injection. However, the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle started earlier after the injection of lanthanum chloride. If we look at the data of each leg, each leg shows different reaction to the injection of lanthanum chloride. The muscle contraction of leg 1 started earlier and was smaller in every level of stimulation after the injection. For leg 2, it showed a larger reaction to lanthanum chloride and decreased even more. On the contrary, leg 3 showed only a minor decrease in muscle contraction. Overall, lanthanum chloride still decreased the amplitude of the muscle contraction.  The mean value of amplitude of muscle contraction of the control group is significantly different than the mean value of the treatment group (t-stat= 3.336827, df=10, p-value= 0.007531). 

Discussion:
The p-value of the paired t-test for average amplitude is 0.007531, which is smaller than 0.05. This states that the average amplitude is significantly different between the control group and the treatment group. It was hypothesized that calcium channel blocker could minimize the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. Combing these information, the results of experiment did support our hypothesis that lanthanum chloride could weaken the muscle contraction once injected. Even though the contraction of the muscle after the injection stared earlier, it still showed more decrease in magnitude as shown in figure 1. In figure 2, it was shown that the all the threshold values of the muscle contraction were decreased after the injection of lanthanum chloride. However, this does not suggest that lanthanum chloride serves its function as calcium channel blocker. It might just combine with the calcium ion and decrease calcium concentration in the frog muscle. Comparing to formal study, it was discovered that the calcium channel blocker could decrease the uptake of calcium ion in frog muscle. [Weiss: 1970] Although lanthanum chloride would decrease the uptake of calcium, it did not change the total concentration of the calcium and other ions inside the muscle. [Weiss: 1970] This further proves our findings that lanthanum chloride has an effect on decreasing the magnitude of muscle contraction. It serves as a channel blocker instead of a removal of the calcium ions.
