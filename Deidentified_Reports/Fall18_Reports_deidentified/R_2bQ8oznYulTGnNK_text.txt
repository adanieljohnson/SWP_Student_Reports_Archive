Title: Calcium Injection in the Gastrocnemius Muscle of the Rana pipiens Causes Chemically-Induced Tetany 

Abstract:
The gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens displays the functions of the neuromuscular junction in a complex organism. When caffeine is present in this system, it triggers calcium potentiation. It was hypothesized that injection of 0.1 mL caffeine into the muscle would cause chemically-induced tetany upon stimulation, until fatigue. In order to test this hypothesis, three frog legs were observed upon stimulation before and after injection of caffeine into the gastrocnemius muscle. The frog legs thus served as their own control groups, as well as the experimental groups. The average of the voltage recorded for the three legs, in the stimulation trial prior to caffeine injection, was 0.718±0.5239. The average of the voltage in the stimulation trial following the caffeine injection was 1.459±0.3151. The paired T-test used for each frog leg resulted in values of (trial 1) p-value = 1.5 x 10-11, (trial 2) p-value = 1.74 x 10-9, (trial 3) p-value = 8.68 x 10-10. Thus, the results of the experiment supported the hypothesis and were found to be of significance. 
 

Introduction:
The nervous system is a physiological system found in complex organisms, that operates by electrochemical functions. It is a communication system that allows an organism to sense, perceive, and respond to its internal and external environments [JOHNSON: 2018]. It is important that we develop an understanding of the nervous system and its functions, because of its vitality in an organism’s survival. Movement of complex organisms is controlled through stimulation of the skeletal muscle by the nervous system, via motor neurons. The synapse formed between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell is known as the neuromuscular junction. The Rana pipiens is a species of frog that is used in research to understand the functions of the neuromuscular junction. This neuromuscular unit operates on chemical signaling, where one cell transfers its action potential to the postsynaptic cell through the use of neurotransmitters. An unbalance of these neurotransmitters can inhibit a nerve cell from contracting. Caffeine is a calcium potentiator. Thus, when caffeine is present in the neuromuscular junction, it causes an increase in the release of calcium, which triggers the continuous release of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft. Caffeine also inhibited the rate of Ca uptake, which may in part account for the prolongation of the active state caused by caffeine [Weber: 1968]. The postsynaptic muscle cell therefore remains depolarized and continues to contract in a state of tetany until it fatigues. When 0.1 mL of caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens, the muscle will experience an increase in the voltage of the contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
The model organism in this experiment was the Rana pipiens. Three separate legs taken from this organism were used to model the functions of the neuromuscular units in the gastrocnemius muscle. The skin was removed from all three legs, and the thigh tissue was pulled away until the sciatic nerve was made accessible. The end of the gastrocnemius muscle distal to the knee joint was then separated with the tendon still attached. A piece of string was attached to the separated end of the tendon and muscle and used to suspend the gastrocnemius muscle at a 90-degree angle from the rest of the leg. The leg of the frog was then secured with pins, while attempting to refrain from puncturing the muscle tissue. Electrodes will be used to apply direct stimulation through the sciatic nerve during observation. Throughout the experiment, the subject frog leg was kept moist with frog Ringer’s solution. Each leg served as its own control during observation, prior to caffeine injection. The LabScribe iWorx data anaylsis software was used in order to apply stimulation and to record the stimulation effects. For each frog leg, the Amplitude was set to 1, the W(ms) to 5, the F(Hz) to 1, and the HP to 0. The gastrocnemius muscle was stimulated once via the sciatic nerve, and the effects were observed and recorded. The gastrocnemius muscle was then injected with 0.1 mL of caffeine, and stimulated again immediately following injection. A paired T-test was used to compare this data, because there were multiple data recordings taken from the same test subject in each trial. 
 


Results:
The three subject frog legs experienced normal action potential sequences in their control trials, but upon caffeine injection the stimulation caused an observed state of chemically-induced tetany to occur in the gastrocnemius muscle, yielding results that were supportive of the hypothesis and determined to be significant. The average of the voltage recorded for the three legs, in the stimulation trial prior to caffeine injection, was 0.718±0.5239 (control) as shown in Figure 2. The average of the voltage in the stimulation trial following the caffeine injection was 1.459±0.3151 (experimental), also shown in Figure 2. The data recorded for each frog leg was compared using a paired T-test. For the first frog leg, this resulted in a p-value = 1.5 x 10-11, T-stat = 795.5, and a Df = 4. The data for the second frog leg resulted in a p-value = 1.74 x 10-9, T-stat = 203.77, and Df = 4. The data for the third frog leg resulted in a p-value = 8.68 x 10-10, T-stat = 288.31, and Df = 4. An overall increase in the voltage was recorded in each frog leg after the injection of caffeine. 


Discussion:
The comparison of data between the control and experimental trials of the three subject frog legs in a paired T-test resulted in p-values that indicated that the results were significant. This was expected, because caffeine has shown its effect on the potentiation of calcium in various research settings. Previous research has confirmed that the presence of caffeine at up to moderate concentrations in the neuromuscular unit causes a substantial increase in the maximal release of calcium upon depolarization [Delay:1986]. Caffeine also inhibited the rate of calcium uptake, which may in part account for the prolongation of the active state caused by caffeine [Weber:1968]. Calcium triggers the release of acetylcholine, which makes it a vital part of the function of depolarizing the post synaptic cell. This explains the effects observed on the subject frog legs, which were supportive of the hypothesis. The presence of caffeine in the experimental phase led to the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell, causing unceasing contractions until fatigue of the cell occurred. This research is vital, as it provides information about the variable effects that different chemicals can have on the neuromuscular junction in complex organisms. Learning about and identifying these effects will allow for a better understanding of disabilities that occur from the abnormal presence of chemicals in the neuromuscular junction. If the scientific community better understands the processes that occur in situations that spur disability, the opportunity to better produce solutions, for these disabilities, arises. In order to further test and confirm the effects that caffeine causes upon the functions of the neuromuscular junction, a larger experiment should be conducted using variable amounts of caffeine. In our research, we used a single standard amount of caffeine for injection. There could be variable effects when increasing or decreasing the amount of caffeine present in the neuromuscular junction, thus research on variable amounts would be necessary.
