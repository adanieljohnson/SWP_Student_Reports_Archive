Title: The effect of tank size on aggressive display behavior in Beta splendins. 

Abstract:
This study aims to demonstrate interspecific behaviors in Betta splendins. It is well documented that in both natural and laboratory settings male B. splendins, when they encounter another of their kind they use aggressive facing displays that sometimes results in fighting as a way of maintaining territory. The purpose of this study is to observe the behavior of male fish in differing tank sizes to observe the change in aggressive displays. It was hypothesized that B. splendins aggressive displays will increase when they are in a smaller environment. Three facing and three broadside behaviors were ranked based on their level of aggression and then counted and multiplied by a factor related to the level of aggression for two pairs of males when they were placed in a small tank and a large tank. The frequencies of aggressive displays were then analyzed using a paired one-tailed t_test which reported there was a significent difference in the amount of aggression the fish displayed in the small tank compared to the large tank (t_stat = 2.877, d.f. = 3, P = 0.032). This difference can be attributed to the tendency of males to be protective over territory.

Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior with the goal to better understand the physiological purpose for behaviors as well as their evolutionary impact on an organism’s fitness. The behavior of interest for this study is the aggressive tendencies in Betta splendins, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish, as observations of this organism in natural and lab settings noted their strong drive to fight [Bronstein: 1981]. This organism was chosen for this study because the fish are easy to maintain and their behavioral patterns are well documented by previous studies which allow for clear data collection and analysis of behavior. Both male and female B. splendins demonstrate intraspecific aggression, meaning that their aggressive behaviors are targeted towards other fish of the same species. Previous studies looked at the reaction of B. splendins when in the presence of fish of the same species as well as fish of different species  [Johnson: 1973]. Both the quality and intensity of aggressive display behavior varied with the presence of species of stimulus fish; results indicated that B. splendins are selective in their aggressive displays and are not aggressive to the appearance of any fish in their proximity. Catfish placed in the presence of B. splendins were typically left undisturbed once they were perceived as unthreatening while other B. splendins were attacked within the first 10 seconds [Johnson: 1973]. The aggressive displays of B. splendins include facing and broadside behaviors. Broadside behaviors include pelvic fin flickering and flashing and beating their tails. Facing behavior includes the extension of gill covers and remain extended in a mane like fashion for the duration of an encounter. The aggressive behaviors escalate with the duration of the fight along with the increased aggression in the opponent and typically end in biting on another [Simpson: 1968]. In natural habitats, the aggressive behaviors of male B. splendins often involve competition over territory, specifically the space surrounding nest sites. Past studies have found correlations between aggression level and the organism’s physical state as well as the spatiotemporal layout of its environment [Bronstein: 1981]. Lab studies replicated these natural observations and found that reduced tank size increased interspecific aggression [Johnson: 1973]. This present study seeks to demonstrate the same pattern of behavior of B. splendins increasing their aggressive displays in smaller environments. It was hypothesized that when two male fish are placed in a smaller tank they will display more aggressive behaviors than when they are placed in a larger tank.

Materials and Method:
The organisms for this lab were obtained through the biology department. Before the experiment was run the fish were isolated in separate compartments of a tank with dividers that blocked them from seeing the other fish. Sink water with tap water conditioner was used to ensure the water was safe for the fish and did not affect their performance. Four B. splendins males were used for the study. The four fish were placed into pairs and only interacted with the fish in their pair. The pairs were comprised of males that differed in color. One pair contained a red male and a blue male of approximately the same size and the other pair contained a red male and a multicolored male also of relative size. The two fish were first placed into a 20cm x 16.5cm x 15cm tank with an opaque divider in the middle separating the two fish. The divider was removed and the males were given five minutes to interact. Three broadside and three facing display behaviors were recorded. The number of time each behavior occurred was counted and then multiplied by a factor that considered the level of aggression. For broadside behaviors, pelvic fin flickering was multiplied by a factor of one, the tail beating was multiplied by a factor of two, and tail flashing was multiplied by a factor of three. For facing behaviors, facing with pectoral fins was multiplied by a factor of one, the spreading of the operculum was multiplied by a factor of 2 and red mane was multiplied by a factor of three. After the five minutes, the fish were again isolated and given five minutes to rest. After the rest period, the fish were placed in a 51cm x 31cm x 25.27 cm tank and given five minutes to interact. The same procedure for measuring aggressive displays was applied. This entire procedure was then repeated with the second B. splendins pair. A paired one-tailed t_test was then used to analyze the behavior of the males in the small tank compared to the large tank.

Results:
In each trial, it was observed that one male was always more aggressive than the other. Each interaction was initiated by one male who took a dominant role for the entirety of the interaction and for the duration of the interaction the less dominant male seemed to mimic the behavior of the dominant male. Towards the end of the interactions, the least aggressive males reverted to fleeing the aggressive displays of the dominant male rather than mimicking the displays. While one male was noted to be more aggressive than the other, overall, the smaller tank size increased aggressive behavior (Figure 1). When B. splendins males were placed in the smaller tank they were significently more aggressive in their displays than when they were placed in the large tank (t_stat = 2.877, d.f. = 3, P = 0.032).

Discussion:
The hypothesis of this study was supported; B. splendins males were more aggressive towards a male opponent in a smaller tank and less aggressive towards the same male opponent in a larger tank. A significent difference was found the frequency of aggressive displays, taking into account the level of aggression indicated by each specific behavior. B. splendins exhibit a multitude of behaviors, each differing in their degree of aggression. Therefore, it was important to adjust our frequency recordings to reflect not only the number of display behaviors but also the degree of aggression of the display behaviors to accurately measure the overall aggression level. If the degree of aggression for each behavior was not accounted for, the results of this study would be inaccurate. For instance, the fish in the small tank may exhibit low frequencies of very high aggression behaviors and in the large tank, they may exhibit high frequencies of very low-level aggression behaviors. If only the amount of behaviors was recorded it would appear that the fish were more aggressive in the larger environment even though their displays were the least aggressive. Multiplying the total occurrences of their behavior by the degree of aggression, therefore, takes into account the frequencies and level of aggression to achieve a value for overall aggression to better understand their pattern of behavior. The increase in the aggression of males put together in the smaller tank can be attributed to their wanting of territory. Natural observations of B. splendins found that males compete for territory and are protective over territory that can be used for their bubble nests [Bronstein: 1981]. This natural tendency of the organism most likely evolved with the domesticated species of B. splendins explaining why the fish in smaller tanks, where there is less territory to be gained are more aggressive in their behaviors. Future studies should be conducted using this theory of territory as the reason for the aggressive behavior. Rather than test behavior in open environments, like large and small tanks, two males with bubble nests should be exposed to one another to determine if the presence of a bubble nest in their territory influences their level of aggression in a positive way. This study would provide more information on whether or not it's the general idea of territory that causes aggression or the presence of a bubble nest. A primary goal for organisms is to reproduce and so it would be expected that aggressive behavior is tied into this organism’s drive to achieve successful reproduction.
