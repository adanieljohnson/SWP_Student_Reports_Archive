Title: Elodea’s Rate of Photosynthesis Possible Dependence of Temperature

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to alter water temperature to see the impact on the rate of photosynthesis in the aquatic plant Elodea. Photosynthesis depends on moving electrons from water to NADPH through coupled redox reactions to create proton gradient to power ATP synthesis for carbon fixation. With the process of photosynthesis heavily dependent on multiple reactions to perform this crucial biochemical reaction, the experiment examines the limitations on the rate of photosynthesis with water temperature. Therefore, the hypothesis for this experiment is if the Elodea plant is placed in temperatures of 34° Celsius or a range between 10-15° Celsius, then the rate of photosynthesis would decrease in comparison to room temperature of 22° Celsius because the temperatures would be outside the perceived optimal range of water temperature for Elodea plant. This hypothesis is tested by measuring the amount of reduced DCIP in prepared samples of chloroplasts, water, and reaction buffer over time by using absorbances. The results of this experiment concluded that the temperature of water was not statistically significent to the rate of photosynthesis; however, it prompts further studies to observe the impact of Elodea chloroplast with long term exposure to various water temperatures

Introduction:
In recent years, the population of the aquatic plants Elodea have increased in fresh waterways in Europe, New Zealand, Japan, and subarctic ecosystems. This raises concern in the scientific community because Elodea are not native to any of these waterways but are an invasive species. Specifically, it has been determined that two species of the Elodea, camademsis Michaux and nuttallii, have negatively impacted the nonnative aquatic ecosystems due to globalization of humans that increases the number of transportation pathways for the invasive species of Elodea [Carey: 2016]. One consequence of these invasive macrophytes is limiting the available amount of dissolved oxygen in waterways results in a reduction of the diversity of fish species in waterway. Another consequence is that the density of the Elodea can produce a reduction of light and water clarity, creating conditions not suitable for some aquatic species [Schutlz: 2011]. However, the consequences do not steam towards ecological problems, but can create harm to the economy by the dense beds of Elodea blocking sections of hydroelectric power plants and reducing the ability to perform recreational activities in the affected waterways [Zehnsdorf: 2015]. 

To avoid the damages from these consequences, researchers have been trying to find effective management method to controll Elodea population in the nonnative waterways, and to understand the optimal conditions of the Elodea. This leads to the main purpose of the experiment by observing how environmental factors impact the rate of photosynthesis in Elodea. Photosynthesis is the process in plants which allows plants to covert the sun light radiation into usable energy for cellular processes. The conversion of energy uses chloroplasts, an organelle that absorbs the sun’s light to excite electrons, which allows water to be cleaved to create coupled redox reactions to reduce and oxidize electron carriers in the Photosynthetic Electron Transport. This ultimately produces a proton gradient to power ATP synthesis to lead to carbon fixation [Johnson: 2018]. Therefore, the central research question of the experiment is to see if varying the environmental factor of water temperature impacts the rate of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of Elodea. In addition, the hypothesis for this experiment is that if Elodea plant is placed in 34° Celsius or a range between 10-15° Celsius, then the rate of photosynthesis would decrease in comparison to room temperature of 22° Celsius because the temperatures would be outside the optimal range of temperature for Elodea.


Materials and Method:
The experiment was designed to measure the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts in Elodea by measuring the absorbances of reduced DCIP, an electron acceptor like NADP+, in various temperatures. First, chloroplasts were extracted from the leaves of the sample plant Elodea for samples. The leaves were crushed in a cooled mortar and pestle until the leaves turned into a paste. Then 20 Ml of grinding buffer, composed of 400 mM of sucrose in Tricine buffer at a pH 8.0, into the paste, and once thoroughly mixed it was strained through layered cheesecloth. Next, the solution was transferred into a centrifuge tube, and placed in a centrifuge under 200 x the force of gravity for 3 minutes at 4° Celsius. Once the centrifuge process was complete, the supernatant liquid was transferred into a new centrifuge tube leaving behind the solid debris. This new sample was then centrifuge again at 1000 x force of gravity for 10 minutes at 4˚ Celsius. Once the process was complete, the pellet was transferred into a new centrifuge test tube with 20 Ml of grinding buffer of 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at a pH 8.0[Johnson: 2018].

With the chloroplasts obtained, the samples for the experiments could be prepared. Each experimental group had three replicates to find the average percent change of absorbance over time. The experimental groups were placed in environments in various temperatures, including 34° Celsius, 22° Celsius, and a range of 10-15˚, by creating water baths for each temperature except for 22° Celsius since the laboratory was set at this temperature. In addition, all the samples were placed under equally intensity of florescent light. Then, the spectrometer was set up at 600 nM and a blank was created with 8 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer of 100 mM phosphate and pH 6.5, and 100 µl of chloroplast. To prepare the test samples, each one contained 6 Ml of water, 2Ml of 130 mM DCIP, 2 Ml of reaction buffer of 100mM phosphate and pH 6.5, and lastly add 100 µl when the assay of the DCIP was ready to begin. Each sample was mixed thoroughly, and quickly taken an initial absorbance reading before placing samples in the controllled environment. The samples would sit in there for 10 minutes, and absorbances were recorded again before being place back in the environment. This processed occurred when 20 minutes and 30 minutes passed. The average percent change between each time interval was calculated. The statistical test used to see if there is statistically significance between the rate of photosynthesis with the temperature of water with the use of a one-way anova test with an alpha value of 0.05 [Johnson: 2018].


Results:
The results of the experiment produced observable trends in Figure 1. First, at a temperature of 22˚ Celsius, there an initial increase of absorbances before decrease by the end of the experiment. The second trend found in 34° Celsius and a range of 10-15° Celsius was decrease in absorbances before increasing over long period of time. To determine there was a correlation between water temperature and the rate of photosynthesis, a one-way anova statistical test is used with an 0.05 alpha value. Based on the data, it is calculated that the p_value of the data is 0.89. This indicates that water temperature is not statistically significent to the percent change of absorbances of DCIP. 

Discussion:
Based on results of the experiment, the hypothesis of the experiment was not supported since the varying temperatures of water are not statistically significent to the rate of photosynthesis. Therefore, the data could not be used to conclude an optimal rate of photosynthesis for the Elodea plant. However, information that is received from the results of the experiment through Figure 1 can provide observable trends as a guide to further improve the experiment. The first noticeable trend is how water temperature at 34˚ C was the only temperature that yielded a positive average percent change in absorbances during the first 10-minute interval of the experiment. However, the progression of time in the experiment reveals that there was a decrease of average percent change during the remainder of the experiment. This suggests that the Elodea plant had the potential for increased growth in hot water temperatures but only for short periods of time. This observation is supported by a previous study conducted that examined the heat tolerance of the Elodea nuttallii. The study reported that the Elodea nuttallii had an optimal rate of growth in conditions tested at 35° C and 39˚ C for relatively short periods of time. However, for long periods of time, the optimal temperature would be at lower temperatures (Ma:2009). Another noticeable trend is the temperature conditions at both 22° C and 10-15° C there was optimal growth as the experiment progressed. This suggests that there is a possibility for a large range of temperatures that increases rate of photosynthesis in the Elodea.

Plants have different ranges of optimal growth based on the enzymes found in the photosynthetic pathway. A research study on the photosynthetic metabolism of cucumber plants concluded that there with extreme temperatures, there was a reduction of enzymatic activity with carbon dioxide assimilation in light independent reactions of photosynthesis [Hao: 2013]. For the Elodea, a study revealed that the optimal temperature for the Elodea canadensis is between 10 and 22° Celsius when viewing the impact of climate warming with plant growth [Silveira: 2017].

While the experiment did not provide conclusive date, it provided opportunities to improve the experiment in the future.  The experiment did not investigate the effects on the rate of photosynthesis of chloroplasts with long-term exposure to various temperatures. This change of the experiment would provide further research to find optimal temperature for the rate of photosynthesis for the Elodea. These results would provide the ability to see higher risks for Elodea to become an invasive species based on the waterways temperature and put into place method of management to reduce the negative impacts of these invasive species. This includes method such as the reduction of excess nutrients in the waterways, an herbicide application, or introducing more herbivorous fish in the environment [Carey: 2016].
