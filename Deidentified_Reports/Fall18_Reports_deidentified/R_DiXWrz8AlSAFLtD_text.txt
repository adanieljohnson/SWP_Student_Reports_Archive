Title: The Twitch Threshold Effect of an Acetylcholine Blocker on Lithobatis sphenocephalus legs.

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if an acetylcholine blocker, 2% solution of sevin, affected the twitch threshold of Lithobatis sphenocephalus legs. The hypothesis being tested was if frog legs are injected with an acetylcholine blocker then they will have a larger twitch threshold. This is because an acetylcholine blocker will prevent sodium channels from opening at the normal rate. This would prevent the action potentials from occurring at the typical threshold and in turn increase it. This experiment was conducted with three frog legs that acted as both their controll and treatment group. It was determined after the experiment by using a paired t test that the difference between the controll and treatment twitch thresholds was not significent because the p value was .101. This meant that the hypothesis could not be supported even though general trends established in the results suggested that the difference in twitch thresholds from the controll to treatment group were larger on average at .4V. This is important to note when understanding the affect that acetylcholine truly has on the muscle contraction process. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, an acetylcholine blocker, 2% solution of sevin, was used to determine the effect on the twitch threshold of a Lithobatis sphenocephalus leg. A Lithobatis sphenocephalus is a southern leopard frog that can range up to 3 ½ inches which makes their gastrocnemus muscle easier to dissect; they are also more tolerant to handling and temperature changes than normal mammalian muscles making them great test subjects [Silverthorn: 2009]. To better understand how this experiment will work, it is important to look at what the neuromuscular system is and how it is organized. The neuromuscular system allows nerves and muscles to respond to internal and external environments [Johnson: 2018]. This system can respond to a stimulus in milliseconds and is one of the main sources for how a body can move [Johnson: 2018]. Skeletal muscles consist of myofibers which are fused aggregates of cells that are bound together to form functional groups [Johnson: 2018]. These muscles are supplied with nerves by motor neurons which allows the axons of these neurons to extend to points known as neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. At these junctions, nerve impulses cause the release of acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is essential for opening sodium channels; when these channels are open, it generates an action potential [Johnson: 2018]. This action potential stimulates the release of calcium which activates the shortening of the muscle allowing it to contract [Weber: 1973]. Twitch threshold is the minimum amount of stimulus that triggers a contraction to occur [Silverthorn: 2009].  So, would the injection of an acetylcholine blocker affect the twitch threshold of a frog leg? We hypothesize that if an acetylcholine blocker is administered to a frog leg then the twitch threshold will increase. 

Materials and Method:
We first started this experiment by selecting three frog legs from the Lithobatis sphenocephalus species; each leg acted as both their controll and treatment group. Next, we prepared the frog legs by pulling off their skin and moistening them with Ringer’s solution. After that, we used a dissecting probe to separate the inner thigh muscles of each leg by starting at the upper end and extending to the knee.  Then we started with frog leg one by suspending the gastrocnemus muscle at a ninety-degree angle, pinning the rest of the leg down, and sticking the muscle with the probes administering voltage. To determine the twitch threshold of frog leg one as the controll group, we applied different amounts of voltage until we established the smallest possible voltage that stimulated a twitch. Next, we injected frog leg one with .1 Ml of the acetylcholine blocker in several areas of the gastrocnemus muscle and waited five minutes. We then determined the threshold using the same technique as previously stated and repeated the experiment for frog legs two and three. During these trials, we recorded each of the twitch thresholds and used a pair t test to determine significance. 

Results:
A general trend that is presented in figure 1 is that the twitch threshold increased as the acetylcholine blocker was administered. Frog leg one had the largest difference in threshold twitch at .45V. This was then followed by frog leg two at .18V and then three at .17V. The controll group had an average twitch threshold of .29. The treatment group had an average twitch threshold of .56.  The twitch thresholds were then used to calculate a paired t test. The mean of the group with the acetylcholine blocker was insignificently greater than its mean without the blocker (t_stat = 2.908, d.f. = 2, P = 0.101).

Discussion:
In this experiment, it was determined through observation and collected data that the presence of .1 Ml of acetylcholine blocker in the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg was not significent enough to impact the twitch threshold. Through the paired t test, it was calculated that the controll group was not statistically different than that of the treatment group because the p value was greater than .05. Although the group with the acetylcholine blocker had a higher average in difference of twitch threshold as seen in Figure 1, it wasn’t significently more than that of the controll group. This means that the hypothesis that was generated is rejected because the frog legs with an acetylcholine blocker did not increase the twitch threshold significently. It makes sense on the molecular level that the twitch threshold increased because acetylcholine was blocked, and the sodium currents were not as high, which required a larger stimulus to generate the action potential for calcium to emerge. However, the .1 Ml of acetylcholine blocker was not enough to make a significent increase in twitch threshold because the sodium current was not stalled as much as it should have been.  This leads into the next step for this study which is looking at different amounts of acetylcholine blocker in the gastrocnemus muscle of the Lithobatis sphenocephalus to determine if there can be a significent difference. This would be done by having several legs for each treatment group with different volumes of acetylcholine blocker but would otherwise follow the same procedure as this experiment. By adding different volumes of the acetylcholine blocker, this would give us better information. This is because it would give us more accurate results about how much acetylcholine blocker is necessary to maybe block off the entire twitch and where there might be a significent increase in twitch. This information is important to know for understanding how muscles produce movements through molecular changes. By understanding the role of acetylcholine in muscle contraction, it heightens the importance of making sure receptor sites aren’t blocked. If these sights are blocked, that changes the sodium current which ultimately changes the entire reaction of muscle contraction. This is an integral part in understanding diseases such as Autosomal recessive generalized myotonia and autosomal dominant myotonia congenita. These diseases have both been associated with muscle stiffness due to the change in sodium current [Koch: 1992]. Even though these diseases are due to a mutation and not an acetylcholine blocker, it does demonstrate the importance of sodium currents which are produced normally through the presence of acetylcholine. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that .1 Ml of acetylcholine blocker administered in a frog leg does not significently increase the twitch threshold.
