Title: The effect of resource competition on the aggressiveness of Betta splendins

Abstract:
The effect of the presence of food on the agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins was tested. The fish react violently to one another but a prior study shows that the fish would rather eat then go in for a fight [Hogan: 1974]. Thus, this question is rasied: when in competition for food will Betta splendins increase their agnostic behavior? After allowing two sets of two male betas to interact in the presence of no stimuli, a female, and a limited quantity of food and allotting points for each aggressive behavior exhibited, it was shown that there was no significent difference in aggression levels between any of the stimulus groups. Because the experiment had so few trials it wouldn’t be correct to draw any conclusions from the results of this experiment. 


Introduction:
Betta splendins is a species of fish native to southeast Asia that is famous for it’s extremely aggressive behavior. The agnostic behavior triggered by seeing another male can easily be triggered by many other stimuli, including blobs of color and the male’s own reflection in the mirror [Thompson: 1966]. Though the response can be elicited by many things, the presence of another live male elicits the most aggressive response in Bettas [Craft: 2003]. They are known to have many different behavioral actions and patterns that indicate how aggressive they are at that moment, allowing researchers to determine levels of aggression in the fish. These behaviors include everything from tail flicking to flaring their gill covers to form a “mane” to attacking the stimulus. Though always ready to fight at the sight of another male, when given the choice between eating and fighting, the majority of Betta males will choose to eat rather than fight [Hogan: 1974]. This raises the question: when in competition for food will Betta splendins increase their agnostic behavior? This experiment tests whether the aggressive behavior is amplified or diminished in the presence of a limited quantity of food. The hypothesis is that the competition for food will increase the level of agnostic behavior in the fish.


Materials and Method:
To test the hypothesis, we attempted to quantify the aggressive behaviors of Bettas in a point system. For less aggressive actions, one point was awarded. More aggressive actions were given two points, and the most aggressive actions allotted three points. Flickering of the pelvic fin and erecting pectoral fins earned a point, tail beating and spreading gill covers earned two points, and tail flashing, protruding the brachiostegal membrane, and engaging in combat all earned three points. We placed the fish into a tank with two dividers, making three sections. The trials were five minutes each, the first being an observation of two males without any of stimuli present, the second was an observation of two males in the presence of a female, and the third trial was two males in the presence of six flakes of food. This set of three trials was then repeated with a second set of fish.


Results:
There was not a significent difference between the three groups. P = 0.333. No individual group was significently different from the others. Figure 1 shows the comparisons of the three trial groups for the agnostic behavior ratings for two male Bettas in a controll, in the presence of a female, and in the presence of food. Table 1 displays the same data but in table format, giving the exact numbers for the values displayed in figure 1. 


Discussion:
This data did not support the hypothesis that the presence of food would cause an increase in aggressive behaviors displayed by the fish. There are multiple problems in this experiment that prevent the data from being viable to draw inferences about the overall behavior of Betta splendins. First, there are not enough trials to build an amount of data that could allow us to draw inferences from it. Second, the rating system is subjective and may have been flawed, as adding points for each display meant that fish that started and stopped the behavior yielded more points and therefore were considered more aggressive than fish that showed continuous expression of the agnostic behavior over a long period of time. This could be remedied in future experiments by assigning each fish an overall aggressiveness rating rather that adding points for each individual display. Finally, using the same fish for each of the three groups likely skewed data as the fish may have different responses upon seeing each other multiple times. This could be remedied by either using new fish for each observation or waiting much longer in between trials. Though the data has no way of showing this, the fish did seem to be distracted by food while it was available and went to eat before fighting. This is in alignment with findings in previous studies [Hogan: 1974].
