Title: The Effects of Light and Dark on The Root:Shoot Ratio of Buckwheat

Abstract:
Being able to understand what conditions can maximize the productivity of any given plant is important not only for commercial use, but also for having a greater understanding of a plant’s interaction with its environment. The plant buckwheat, Fagopyrum Esculentum, was grown in two different settings, one in the light and one in dark, in order to determine how it affected the plant’s growth. More specifically, to see whether the plants grown in the dark will have a lower root:shoot ratio due to a lack of necessary energy from sunlight. When analyzing the data collected from the buckwheat plants in both settings, it was shown that the two factors of light and dark did not have a significant impact on how large or small the root:shoot ratio was. This goes to show that the root:shoot ratio cannot be altered by the amount of light the plant is exposed to and therefore is better determined by the type of soil the plant is in and how much nutrients it receives from this soil.

Introduction:
Buckwheat (Fagopyrum Esculentum), is a fairly common plant [Oliver: 2005] that is used widely as a cover crop for large fields. It is a plant that does well in low-fertility soils as well as acidic soils [USDA: 2018]. The efficiency of a plant like this can be analyzed through something known as a root:shoot ratio. The purpose of measuring this ratio between the root and shoot is to show how well a plant can grow in a given environment, as well as giving an idea of what type of environment in which the plant is growing. It has been observed that plants whose soil may contain less nutrients will have longer root systems in order to seek out more sources of sustenance, while more tropical plants may not need such length in order to reach their source of nutrients [Higgins 1933].  The two factors of light and dark were chosen due to their simplicity, but also to see if this ratio is really affected by the presence of a light source, or whether it is completely due to environmental factors like the nutrients in the soil. To be more specific, it is already known that the root:shoot ratio is determined by the amount of nutrients that are in the soil [Buddies: 2018], but this experiment delves into whether there are more factors that must be accounted for in the determination of the root:shoot ratio. All of this coming together, I hypothesize that the plant grown in the dark will have a lower root:shoot ratio than the plant grown in the light due to the fact that the lower amount of light decreases overall growth of the plant. 

Materials and Methods:
The lab was started by filling eight separate plastic pots with vermiculite, and labeling each pot as light or dark, more specifically four light and four dark. Next these pots were placed into a larger tray where each was pre-watered and sprayed with miracle grow before any seeds were planted. Once this was completed, around fifteen seeds were set aside for each one of the eight pots and subsequently planted. The large number of seeds for each pot was necessary to assure that there would be enough test samples to analyze once the growing was complete. These eight pots were then placed into the greenhouse, four in light and four under a black curtain to act as constant darkness. For two weeks the plants were watched and watered every day as they grew. Once the growing was done, the twenty plants were harvested. Three plants from each pot were used to measure the weight of the root and shoot as well as the length of the root and shoot. Each of the two factors data was compiled and analyzed with the average root:shoot ratio. To better analyze the data, a two-sample t-test was used to determine the significance of the numbers and ratios that were found.

Results:
The buckwheat seeds that were grown in both factors experienced substantial growth, both presenting some different physical factors like color and number of leaves. The root:shoot ratio of the light plants in terms of weight was averaged to be 0.1 ± 0.03, while the root:shoot ratio of the dark plants in terms of weight had an average of 0.175 ± 0.021. When it came to the root:shoot ratio according to the length of the roots and shoots, the light plant averaged 0.871± 0.213 and the dark plants had an average ratio of 0.682 ± 0.0962. The data reliant on weight shows that plants grown in the dark have a higher root:shoot ratio as shown in Figure 1a, but they do not have as large of a length root:shoot ratio as the plants grown in the sunlight, as seen in Figure 1 b. The average root:shoot ratio in terms of weight was shown not to be statistically significant when the dark plants were compared to the light plants (T stat = 2.684, df = 18, p =.065). When comparing the root:shoot ratio as determined by the average length in the light or dark plants, this comparison between the two was also proven to be not statistically significant (T stat = 1.735, df = 18, p = .0998). 

Discussion:
Based on the results, the original hypothesis was not supported by the experiment. The differences in the average weights and lengths of both the light and dark plants were not significant (P=.065/.0998). This shows that the two factors that were chosen, light and dark, did not actually have much of an effect on the growth of the plant. I had originally predicted that the plants grown in the light would grow larger and have longer roots due to the fact that more photosynthesis would be able to occur in sunlight [Ingestad: 2006]. This also leads me to understand that the most important factors in determining the root:shoot ratio and/or the length of the roots in a plant is based solely upon the amount of nutrients within the soil [Mašková: 2018]. There was a possibility of error, as there is in any experiment, and more specifically in the days that the plants were watered. There was a hurricane the first weekend the plants were to be watered and consequently were not watered that weekend, but seeing as the plants still had significant growth at the end of the two week period I can determine that this error did not affect the experiment much as a whole. Another smaller error that could have been made may be accounted for as human error while making measurements; however, these measurement errors would have been miniscule, and because of these small factors I do not interpret that this had a large impact on the results. Being able to understand the root:shoot data of such a common plant that is frequently used in agriculture can have many positive impacts, especially since buckwheat can grow in less than exceptional environments. Such a knowledge can help those that use the buckwheat be more efficient in its planting and by using the root:shoot ratio can see that it does not necessarily need to be in the most fertile environment in order to thrive. In order to improve any similar experiment in the future, it will be important to make sure the plants are being watered daily at the same time each day. Then, when it comes time to harvest it will be beneficial to use more samples from each separate pot to receive more accurate results.
