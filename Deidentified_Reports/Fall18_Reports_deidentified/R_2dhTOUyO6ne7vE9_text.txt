Title: The Effect of Additional Precor on the Growth and Development of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Chemical signals called hormones regulate many processes in the bodies of various organisms. 
In other words, the growth and development of an organism is controllled by the release of specific hormones. In insects, the main hormones that regulate development are Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. If there is an imbalance in these hormones, the process of growth and development is disrupted. We examined how Manduca sexta caterpillars were affected by an excess amount of a Juvenile Hormone analogue Precor. After completing the experiment, we found that the caterpillars that were given the Precor had a larger change in weight than the caterpillars that were given the normal food. These results did support our hypothesis that the larger change in weight would be in the experimental caterpillars. Overall, our results show that the additional juvenile hormone is correlated with larger caterpillar larvae. 


Introduction:
There are chemical signals in the body, in various organisms, that regulate growth and development. More specifically, these signals, or hormones, can be found in organisms such as humans, insects and mammals. In insects, there are a few main hormones responsible for their growth and development. These include Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone, both of which are necessary for life and every day functions. Ecdysterone is a hormone that regulates the timing of molting during insect development. Similarly, Juvenile Hormone or JH regulates the type of molting during development and governs metamorphosis (Wyatt & Davey, 1996). Both of these hormones work on various functions in adult insets as well. However, there needs to be a balance of these two for normal lifecycle processes and survival. This experiment observes the effects of additional JH in the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. One group of caterpillars receives a normal diet and the other receives additional JH to test the effects on the caterpillars over a two-week period. I hypothesize that the caterpillars treated with excess Juvenile Hormone will have a larger average change in weight than the caterpillars that aren’t given additional hormones. 

Materials and Method:
8 larval Manduca Sexta caterpillars were randoMly separated into 2 groups, the controll and the experimental. These controll and experimental groups each consisted of 4 similar sized caterpillars that were placed into tuber wares in individual sections after being weighed (in grams). The initial weights were recorded, and an initial observation was taken. Each caterpillar in the controll group was fed 10 grams the GLM or Great Lakes Manduca diet with 3 drops of water. The experimental group was fed the GLM diet mixed with 3 drops of Precor that acts as juvenile hormone. All caterpillars were then placed in an incubator to be kept at constant conditions. Every other day for 14 days, each caterpillar was weighed and observed for changes in color, size, activity, etc. These observations and weights were recorded. A two-sample t_test was performed with an alpha value of 0.05 to compare the average weights of both groups. 

Results:
Caterpillars in both groups responded to the GLM food and the other conditions in the experiment. The caterpillars in the controll group responded and grew with a mean change in weight x= 5.17g and a standard deviation sd=0.9306. This mean was lower than the mean change in weight of the experimental group but also the standard deviation was lower in the controll than the experimental. The caterpillars in the experimental group responded with a mean weight change x=8.1g and a standard deviation sd=2.797. Based on the results from both groups, there was a difference in weight change, but the change was not statistically significent (t=1.907, d.f.=5, p&gt;0.05). 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that the experimental group would greater average change in weight is supported according to the data (Fig. 1). The data shows that average weight change in the controll group is at least two grams lower than the average weight change in the group that was given Precor. However, the standard deviation of the controll group was also lower than the standard deviation in the experimental group and could have been caused by the death of one of the experimental caterpillars. The dead caterpillar’s data had to be left out of the experiment because it would have skewed the data too much. This might be one reason why the experimental data has more variance in standard deviation than the controll group. Another reason for the results could be that the Precor was causing the caterpillars to keep growing in size but preventing them from developing and maturing. The controll caterpillars grew somewhat and then seemed to slow growth as if they were preparing to go into the pupal and the adult phases. In a similar experiment, embryos of an insect were brought into contact with a JH analogue that’s supposed to be very effective at preventing metamorphosis (Riddiford & Williams, 1967). After the exposure to this hormone, the embryos stopped post-embryonic development and these findings suggest that the JH affects embryonic development just as it affects metamorphosis. These findings are similar to those of the experiment we completed and both findings suggest that JH has an impact on the growth development of more than one kind of insect.
