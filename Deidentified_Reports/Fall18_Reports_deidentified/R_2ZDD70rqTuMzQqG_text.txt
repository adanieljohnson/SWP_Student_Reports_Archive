Title: Activation and Inhibition of Protein Kinase A Does not Affect Physarum polycephalum  Surface Area Growth

Abstract:
The way in which organisms respond to both internal and external stimuli is controllled by signal transduction pathways. These pathways involve a cascade of responses which result in a cellular response to the primary signal. A slime mold known by the scientific name Physarum polycephalum is well documented to be affected by signal transduction pathways in a variety of ways. The goal of this experiment was to test the effect of a specific signal transduction pathway called the cAMP-mediated path. One specific enzyme activated in the cAMP pathway is protein kinase A. To test the effects of protein kinase A on the growth of physarum, nine total trials were run with three separate treatments. Three PDA plates were treated with distilled water, three PDA plates were treated with dibutyryl-cAMP, and three PDA plates were treated with curcumin. No significance was found in average surface area growth under any treatment.

Introduction:
Signal transduction pathways helps to respond to environmental changes by transmitting signals from both external and internal environments to the cells that are able to controll chemical release and change organism behavior. This response to stimuli is crucial for survival of organisms, as if organism cannot adapt to their environments they will not survive. The general way in which all signal transduction pathways work is that a stimulus will bind to a receptor which will activate this receptor. This receptor will then change its conformation, allowing for the release of one or more second messengers, which will then result in a response stimulus in the cell [Johnson: 2016].
Physarum Polycephalum is an organism that is often used for studies on signal transduction pathway experimentation. Physarum polycephalum is known by the common name slime mold. Slime molds are multinucleated organisms which are a model organism for testing signal transduction pathways thanks to their quick growth, cheap cost, and ability to move away from light(phototaxis), towards food or away from chemicals(chemotaxis), and orient themselves in specific directions related to gravity(gravitaxis) [Johnson: 2016]. Physarum polycephalum are able to move by extending themselves using actin microfilaments. To grow Physarum polycephalum intake sugars from many different things, in this case the potato in the PDA plates. 
One major signal transduction pathway is the cAMP-mediated pathway. The cAMP-mediated pathway is a type of G-protein coupled pathway in which a G-protein activates an effector enzyme which in turn converts ATP into cAMP. The cAMP pathway is known to play a role in motility of cells by facilitating and regulating actin-based movement [Howe: 2004]. cAMP is an enzyme that activates different proteins in the cells of organisms, including a variety of protein kinases [Keuhn: 1971]. In physarum polycephalum, it is believed that protein kinase A may be one of these kinases that the cAMP pathway activates. 
Protein kinase A, PKA, is an enzyme that is activated by the cAMP-mediated pathway. PKA then in turn will phosphorylate many other enzymes in the pathway, which will activate these enzymes. In Physarum polycephalum, when PKA is activated, this signals for more growth in the organism, and when PKA is inhibited it will stunt growth in the organism [Johnson: 2016].
 In physarum, dibutyryl-cAMP will activate the protein kinase A in the cAMP-mediated pathway. This in theory would then activate growth in the organism, and lead to more growth. In physarum, curcumin works as an inhibitor, and will block protein kinase A in the cAMP-mediated pathway. This in theory would then lead to less growth.
In this experiment we tested the effects of curcumin as an inhibitor and d-cAMP as an activator in growth of physarum. The dibutyryl-cAMP(d-cAMP) would work as an activator and the curcumin would work as an inhibitor, and for this reason the plates treated with the dibutyryl-cAMP would show more average growth than the plates treated with the curcumin.

Materials and Method:
This experiment began by obtaining nine potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. Concentrated samples of both dibutyryl-cAMP and curcumin were acquired. 20 Ml of distilled water were placed in two separate beakers. The 1 Ml sample of curcumin was added to one beaker, and the 1Ml sample of dibutyryl-cAMP was added to the other beaker in order to make 10 mM concentrations of each solution. Each of the nine PDA plates were flipped over and had a 1x1cm square drawn in sharpie in the center of the plate. Three of the PDA plates were labeled curcumin, three PDA plates were labeled d-cAMP, and three PDA plates were labeled controll. 5 Ml of the dilute curcumin solution were added to each of the curcumin plates, 5 Ml of the dilute dibutyryl-cAMP solution were added to each of the dibutyryl-cAMP plates, and 5 Ml of distilled water were added to each of the controll plates. Each liquid was allowed to absorb into the plates for 10 minutes, before they were poured off. Next, the agar above the 1x1cm sharpie square was removed from each plate with a metal spatula, sanitizing with ethanol between each plate. Nine 1x1cm pieces of a culture plate with Physarum polycephalum growth, were cut with the metal spatula, and the spatula was then sanitized. One piece of agar from the culture plate was then added to each of the nine PDA plates in the area which the 1x1cm square was removed. Care was taken to sanitize the spatula so as not to cross contaminate plates. Each of the nine plates were then taped shut and placed in a opaque black bag. The bag was then placed in an incubator for 48 hours. Each plate was then removed, and imageJ software was used to find the total surface area of growth of the Physarum polycephalum in each plate. Data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA test. An alpha value of 0.05 was established for this experiment.

Results:
The average area of growth in units2 for the curcumin treated physarum plates was 0.0477±0.0095, while the average area of growth in units2 for the dibutyryl-cAMP treated physarum plates was 0.0457±0.0226, and the average area of growth in units2 for the controll treated plates was 0.0497±0.0228 (Figure 1).
	When interpreting the results of this experiments a one-way ANOVA test was used. An alpha value of 0.05 was established. The results of this ANOVA proved to be insignificent (d.f.=2, p=.969).

Discussion:
Our experimental results concluded that the protein kinase A activator, dibutyryl-cAMP,  and the protein kinase A inhibitor, curcumin, treatments did not have a significent impact on Physarum polycephalum growth. These results meant that in each of the treatments performed, Physarum’s average growth was not affected, and that our hypothesis was rejected. These insignificent results point to numerous different possible problems in the experiment, which will now be explored.
While our results were not what we had expected them to be, it is possible that experimental errors may have contributed to these insignificent results. The growth culture of the Physarum polycephalum used for this experiment had not grown to the extent needed before it was used in these experiments. This meant that the samples of physarum in our experimental plates may not have been able to grow well enough to show any significent results.
To be sure that experimental or human errors did not play a role in our insignificent results, future studies could be run. A more in depth study could look at multiple different concentrations of both curcumin and d-cAMP and time in which the mixtures were allowed to soak into the PDA plates to see if errors in our results could have stemmed from too low of concentrations of the treatments in the agar. Additionally, measurements of growth could be taken each few hours over a multiple day period to see if there is anyway that growth may be inhibited or activated only for a brief period before growth can even out, or that it takes longer for the effects of treatments to be seen.
Past experiments on physarum have found that migration rates of physarum on nutrients that permitted rapid growth were slower than rates of migration for physarum on only water agar plates. However, it was found that the weight of the physarum on the nutrient rich plates was greater than the weight of the physarum on the water agar plates [Knowles: 1978]. While area of growth was looked at in our experiment instead of migration weights, the idea that vertical growth could be different for the different treatments is one that brings up the question; could our treatments have influenced vertical growth without influencing horizontal growth? This question is one that could be tested in future experiments.
Past studies have also found that cAMP regulates glycogen metabolism by activating cAMP-dependent protein kinases [Insel: 1975]. However, the exact number or types of protein kinases regulated have not been identified and could vary depending on the organism. For this reason, it is possible that protein kinase A may not in fact affect growth of physarum at all, and that a different protein kinase could be in charge of growth in physarum.
	Inhibition and activation of protein kinase A can be explored for future broader uses. For instance, a study has been done looking at curcumin’s potential to inhibit growth in cancer cells. It has been found that curcumin decreases the proliferative potential and induces the apoptosis potential of androgens in prostate cancer cells [Dorai: 2001]. This means that it is possible that curcumin’s inhibitory properties on protein kinase A could apply to other organisms other than physarum when it comes to growth, and could even be used to slow the spread of cancer. Alternatively, the activation of protein kinase A by d-cAMP can be used for things such as accelerating cell growth in wounds. A study found that a similar compound to d-cAMP, N-6,2′-O-dibutyryl adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic phosphate (DBcAMP), has been found to accelerate the healing of wounds, specifically in diabetic mice [Asai: 2006]. For these reasons, activation and inhibition of protein kinase A could have huge impacts in the medical world specifically.
	Overall, this experiment did not prove to be successful in displaying the results that we expected to see. We found no significance in any of the treatments run. However, this could have been due to experimental error, the way in which growth was measured, or a misunderstanding of the importance of protein kinase A. Future studies could be used in order to assess why the results of our experiments were not what we expected. Additionally, future experiments and exploration of protein kinase A activation and inhibition could lead to beneficial results for the medical community.
