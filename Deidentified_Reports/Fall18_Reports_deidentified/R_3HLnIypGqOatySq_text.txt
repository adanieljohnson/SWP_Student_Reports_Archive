Title: The effects of Ecdysterone blockers on Manduca sexta growth and pupation 

Abstract:
Hormones are an integral part of growth in organisms, and in Manduca sexta two hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, are the most important hormones in growth. In this experiment, we were testing the effects of a 20E blocker on the species Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that caterpillars with a 20E blocker would not pupate and would weigh more than the controll group. We conducted a two-sample t test on the groups and produced a p_value of 0.09. Although we failed to reject the null hypothesis, we can conduct other experiments to test the relationship between 20E, JH and appetite. 

Introduction:
Hormones change and effect biological processes in living organisms; including reproduction, temperature regulation and growth. In the species Manduca sexta, more commonly known as tobacco hornworm, growth is seen in six stages, 5 larvae stages and a pupa stage, where the larvae transitions into an adult. The larvae stages are characterized by segmented, soft-bodied organisms who eat leaves, whereas pupa are characterized by reduced movement and are enclosed in a protective cocoon. The final transition occurs when the pupa molts its cocoon and emerges as an adult. These six stages are regulated together by the nervous and endocrine systems. Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that is secreted from the back of the head and controlls the timing of the pupa molting. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormone (JH) work together to controll the growth and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta; near the end of the last larvae stage of the Manduca, JH decreases drastically and a small rise in 20E, called the commitment pulse, signal to the Manduca to start the beginning stages of pupation [Johnson AD: 2018]. 
	In an experiment done by Lynn Riddiford, they were looking at the effect of 20E induced metamorphous when the commitment pulse has been initiated. They then initiated a fake commitment pulse in Manduca, in their 4th larvae instead of the 5th, and saw the larvae transition from a larva into a pupa, instead of into the 5th larvae stage. This experiment also discovered that there are multiple types of ecdysterone that play different roles in the body of the caterpillar; that even when a higher concentration of JH is present in the caterpillar, when 20E that is used for initiating pupation is introduced in the organism, pre-mature pupation occurs in the 4th larvae stage [Riddiford: 1977]. This experiment is an important finding, because it emphasizes the role that 20E has on the pupation rates. However, this experiment does not show what the effects would be if 20E was blocked during the organism’s development. In our experiment, we will we determining what effects a 20E blocker will have on the caterpillar’s growth and pupation rates. We hypothesize that if Manduca sexta are given ecdysterone blocker, they will not pupate and will weigh more than caterpillars that are not given ecdysterone blocker; we hypothesize that there will be a significent difference in weight between the two groups.


Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were chosen, at similar points in their lifecycle, and separated into 2 groups; the controll group (caterpillars 1-4) and the treatment group (caterpillars 5-6). Individual containers for each caterpillar were prepared with air holes poked into the sides. The caterpillars were weighed and placed in the containers and each container was labeled with the respective caterpillar number. Each group is fed 10g of food and 6 drops of ecdysterone blocker is added to each of the treatment group’s food. The caterpillars are weighed every day for two weeks and fed when they run out of food; if one group still has food when all the others is gone, that caterpillar is not fed until it is time to clean out the containers. Containers are cleaned when the food is looking watery and slimy. 
After data collection is complete, we took the averages of the caterpillar’s weight over the span of the 2 weeks, the results of the controll group and treatment groups were compared using a 2-sample-t_test. 


Results:
Figure 1 depicts the initial and final weight to show the difference in weight after treatment started, and average weight over the 2-week period for each caterpillar. Figure one reveals that the caterpillars in the treatment groups lost weight between the initial and final day, the controll group had an increase in weight between the initial and final days. Figure 2 is a graph of the averages of each caterpillar over the 2-week period. The weight of each caterpillar was averaged then the standard deviation was taken for the controll and treatment groups; 0.67 and 0.65 respectively. A 2-sample t_test was conducted on the average weights of the caterpillars and the p_value = 0.0904, and with an α-level of 0.05

Discussion:
Based on our statistical test results, we failed to reject the null hypothesis; which was that caterpillars with a 20E blocker would have a significent difference in weight compared to caterpillars without 20E blocker. One way that we could explain these results is through our lack of understanding the relationship between 20E and JH hormones. Because of mechanisms like commitment pulses, we assumed that 20E and JH hormone were inexplicably tied together; that if 20E never showed up then we would continue to see an increase in JH hormone. However, based on our experiment, there does not seem to this type of relationship between the two hormones; 20E and JH do work together to help the caterpillars mature just not like we believed. We were not able to measure JH hormone levels during our experiment, but that would be a beneficial way to better determine the relationship between 20E and JH. We can see from our results that this is not the case, however. We are not sure what exactly occurs between JH and 20E from this experiment, but one way that we could determine how JH and 20E work together is to create treatment groups that have varying levels of JH and 20E, while also measuring the rates of JH in the controll and treatment groups. 
In the Riddiford experiment, when 20E was introduced early in the larva’s life cycles, early metamorphosis occurred in these caterpillars [Riddiford, 1977]. We hypothesized that 20E blocker would stop metamorphosis in caterpillars, which it did. All the caterpillars in our experiment that were given a 20E blocker did not pupate into adult moths. Unfortunately, 2 of our treatment group caterpillars died in the last week of the experiment. This could be because those two caterpillars were not eating. We noticed a lack of appetite in the treatment group the last two weeks of the experiment, however we do not have enough data to know what could have occurred. The 20E blocker could have played a role in appetite, but it also could have been JH or and unknown side-effect of the lack of 20E in the body. Understanding the relationship between 20E blocker and appetite would be an interesting find and could also help the understanding of growth and pupation in caterpillars. If there was a way to measure and regulate 20E levels, we could determine if there is a threshold relationship between 20E and appetite. 
Overall, this experiment raised more questions than answered, but was still interesting and the experiments that we can glean from this could be more informative in the understanding of caterpillar life cycle and pupation.
