Title: The addition of extra Ecdysterone to the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars inhibits their growth

Abstract:
In this lab, we wanted to see if added hormones to the food of insects impacts their growth and development.  More specifically, we used the insect Manduca sexta as our test species and the hormone Ecdysterone.  Like most insects, Manduca sexta controlls growth, development, behaviors, and other physiological processes using both hormone-based and neuron-based signaling.  Ecdysterone regulates timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects.  It has been known that 20E Ecdysone causes acceleration of metamorphic timing and reduced body size.  In the Manduca Sexta species, the concentrations of both hormones JH and 20E, the ratio between the hormones, and the developmental stage that the insect is in, can determine what the effects of the hormones will be.  Our hypothesis of this study was that the caterpillars in the controll group (not exposed to high levels of Edcysterone) will grow faster than the caterpillars in the experimental group.  In testing our hypothesis, we placed caterpillars in containers with normal food and other caterpillars in containers that had normal food mixed with added drops of Ecdysterone and observed them for two weeks.  Our results allowed us to conclude that the caterpillars in the controll group grew faster. 


Introduction:
During this lab, we wanted to see if the growth of insects could be impacted by the addition of hormones, more specifically, we wanted to see if the hormone Ecdysterone impacted their growth.  In this lab, we used the insect Manduca sexta as our test species.  This species is an insect in the order Lepidoptera.  The Manduca Sexta insect undergoes the Holometabolous life cycle, which includes four stages.  Those stages include: egg/ embryo, Larvae, Pupa, and Adult.  Like most insects, caterpillars controll growth, development, behaviors and other physiological processes using both hormone-based and neuron-based signaling.  In this lab, we used the hormone Ecdysterone (20E).  This hormone is regulated by Prothoracicotropic Hormone (PTTC) and is secreted naturally by groups of cells in the prothoracic glands [Johnson:2018].  Ecdysterone regulates timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects.  It has been known that 20E Ecdysone causes acceleration of metamorphic timing and reduced body size [Nakagwa: 2016].
	The hypothesis of this study was that the caterpillars in the controll group (not exposed to high levels of Edcysterone) will grow faster than the caterpillars in the experimental group.  


Materials and Method:
We started off this experiment by gathering our supplies, which included: two 4-cell plastic containers, 2 lids, “hole” tool, insect food, a scale, a transfer pipet, ecdysterone (the reagent), and 8 caterpillars.  After collecting the materials, we punctured holes in our containers to allow air flow.  After doing so, we measured 10 g of food for each Manduca Sexta caterpillar.  We then stirred and clumped the food and placed 10 g in the corner of each caterpillar cell (8 cells).  Then, with a transfer pipet, we added 5 drops of di water to the food in each compartment of the controll group (4 cells).  Then, with another transfer pipet, we added 5 drops of 20E (ecdysterone) to the food in each compartment of the experimental group (4 cells).  Finally, we placed one caterpillar in each compartment and closed the lids.  Each day for 2 weeks, we weighed the caterpillars, gave them new food with either water or 20E hormone (depending on whether they were in the controll or experimental group), and observed their exterior body changes.  We used the two-tailed t_test in this experiment.


Results:
As shown in table 1, the average weight change in the caterpillars in the controll group was 9.66g and for the experimental group with 5% of hormone was .45g.  Table 1 also shows that there is a two-tailed p_value of .00000073.  The controll group had a standard deviation of .866 and the experimental group had a standard deviation of .0465.  According to figures 1 and 2, all of the experimental group caterpillars died by day 11.  


Discussion:
According to our results, the mean change in weight of the controll group caterpillars was significently higher than the experimental group exposed to 5% of ecdysterone.  With that being said, the two-tailed p_value of .00000073 is significent with it being less than 0.05.  With all of this being said, our hypothesis, the caterpillars in the controll group (not exposed to high levels of Edcysterone) will grow faster than the experimental group, was supported.  An explanation for the results that we got could be that Ecdysterone causes acceleration of metamorphic timing and reduced body size [Ono: 2014].  Another explanation for why we got the results we did could be because caterpillars need both JH and 20E.  If either is eliminated entirely, the animal dies [Johnson:2018].  In the Manduca Sexta species, the concentrations of both hormones JH and 20E, the ratio between the hormones, and the developmental stage that the insect is in, can determine what the effects of the hormones will be.  In this case, the uneven ratio of hormones 20E and JH resulted in death.  JH and 20E both work together to manage growth, development, and molting of the insect.  Manduca sexta caterpillars are known to produce both 20E and JH hormones naturally.  Traditionally, this species has 5 larval instars.  The experiment was conducted while the caterpillars were in their 4th larva.  Traditionally, in this phase, the caterpillars have fairly high levels of JH hormone and low levels of 20E hormone.  The addition of more 20E hormone to the caterpillars most likely unbalanced the concentration ratio of the two hormones and resulted in death [Johnson:2018].   Another possible reason for as to why the caterpillars in the experimental group died could have been due to human error.  Some of the errors on our side might include: not enough food (food was dried out) or hormone was not mixed in with the food enough (which could have prevented them from eating).  Like most organisms, when an insect is unable to eat their food, they die.
