Title: The Effect of Martin’s IGR on the Weight of the Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Manduca sexta, tobacco hornworm, is a type of pest that affects tobacco crops, as an adult. The hornworm relies on certain hormones such as its Juvenile Hormone (JH) to transform into different larval stages, leading to its adulthood. To prevent it from becoming a pest, inhibitory growth regulators (IGRs) are used to inhibit the secretion of JHs. They imitate the functionality of JH but prevent numerous amounts to release. Martin’s IGR is a type of inhibitory growth regulator that contains a chemical called methoprene, which is an insecticide against mosquitos and other insects. Six drops of Martin’s IGR were applied in 10 grams of food for four caterpillars, to determine whether the caterpillars’ weights would decrease. The other four caterpillars were given six drops of water. Each of the caterpillar’s weights were measured and recorded for two weeks. Data was ignored after day 10, since the experimental group began to pupate. Based on the statistical test, the p_value was 0.003, with a d.f. of 6 and t-value of 4.012. Methoprene was not efficient against the Manduca sexta, due to its functionality and concentration. 

Introduction:
The tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, is a type of pest that usually feasts on crops such as tobacco, tomato, pepper, eggplant, and variety of others. These crops are usually economically beneficial to farmers but are unfortunately devastated by the tobacco hornworm, as an adult pest (Byron & Gillet-Kaufman, 2017). The Manduca sexta primarily undergoes certain life stages, in order to become an adult pest. The worm begins as an egg, where it hatches after one to three days. The caterpillar proceeds into its larval stages, consuming food and increasing in weight and size. Towards the culmination of its larval stages, the tobacco hornworm pupates, and the pupal cell becomes reddish-brown, developing new body parts. After the pupation, the Manduca sexta transforms into an adult (Byron & Gillet-Kaufman, 2017). The hormones that allow for the moth to enter different larval stages are termed juvenile hormones (JH). JH controlls the type of molting for the tobacco hornworm (Staal, 1975). Molting is the process by which the Manduca sexta changes different stages. With little to no amounts of JH, the moth develops into an adult. There are certain substances called inhibitory growth regulators (IGRs) that can controll the amount of JH secreted in the stages.
	IGRs function to inhibit juvenile hormones, which prevents an insect from molting into a different larval stage. Apart from JH, IGRs can affect the secretion of ecdysone, which determines the timing of the molting (Staal, 1975). Both JH and ecdysone are crucial for the survival of the tobacco hornworm. If either hormone is inhibited or less than normal, the moth will most likely remain the in the same larval stage or die. IGRs are used as natural forms of insecticides to prevent the spread of pests like the tobacco hornworm. A consumer product that acts as an IGR is Martin’s IGR. Martin’s IGR contains a chemical called Methoprene, which is type of IGR that used to combat against mosquitos, beetles, and other insects. Methoprene operates as a growth regulator like the juvenile hormone, but it disturbs the insect’s lifecycle and hinders its maturity or reproduction. 
	To determine whether Martin’s IGR is efficient against the Manduca sexta, it is hypothesized that if six drops were to be implanted in the food of the tobacco hornworm, the weight of the tobacco hornworm would decline. 


Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were split into two groups: experimental and controll. The experimental group was given a container with four compartments, while the controll group was also given a container with four compartments. Each compartment had two holes poked out, to allow the tobacco hornworms to breathe. For the experiment group, each compartment was labeled E1-E4. The controll group had each compartment labeled C1-C4. Apart from two holes, each compartment was given 10 g of food. Before putting the caterpillars in their respective spots, all of their weights were measured by an electronic balance and recorded. After the caterpillars were placed in their compartments, a lid was placed over the two containers and placed in the refrigerator. The refrigerator mimicked a 12-hour day with light exposure and remained at a constant temperature of 25oC. For two weeks, each of the caterpillars’ masses were measured and recorded. The experimental groups received six drops of the Martin’s IGR in their food while the controll group received six drops of water, within the two weeks. If the food decreased, 10 g was measured and put in the compartment. 
	For safety purposes, gloves were worn during the measurements of the caterpillars and when putting the IGR drops in the food. 
	A 2-sample t_test was conducted to analyze the weights of the experimental and controll groups.


Results:
The average change in weight for the experimental group was 7.408 (Fig 1). For the controll group, the average was determined to be 2.008 (Fig 1). The standard deviation for the experimental group was 2.122 (Fig 1) while the standard deviation for the controll group was 1.655 (Fig 1). The highest average change in weight was experimental group #4 with 9.42, while the lowest average change in weight was controll group #2 with 0.19. The larvae for the experimental group started to pupate after Day 10, therefore all data till Day 14 was ignored. From the 2-sample t_test with an alpha of 0.05, the t-value was 4.012, the p_value was 0.003, and the degrees of freedom (d.f.) was equivalent to 6. 

Discussion:
The results were proven to be statistically significent, since the p_value (0.003) was lower than the alpha level of 0.05. Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected, but the results did not prove that the research hypothesis was supported. Clearly, the methoprene in the Martin’s IGR was not efficient in preventing the tobacco hornworm from changing larval stages. Methoprene has been proven to be effective after 10 g/l (Ghekiere et. al., 2006). Usually, the methoprene has limited efficacy against limited species (Wijayaratne & Whyard, 2018). Typically, after several months, the methoprene becomes inefficient towards hindering the larval stage, since it has lost its functionality because the compounds within the methoprene degrade, due to poor storage and processing conditions (Wijayaratne & Whyard, 2018). Another factor is the methoprene does not affect the secretion of ecdysone, as compared to its effect on JH. Ecdysone still proceeds to secrete, but not at a faster rate than JH (Ghekiere et. al., 2006). Additional research could be repeated with having more drops of methoprene and more caterpillars, to ensure better results. With better results, the experiment would help to find broader ways in combating the prevalence of the tobacco hornworm.
