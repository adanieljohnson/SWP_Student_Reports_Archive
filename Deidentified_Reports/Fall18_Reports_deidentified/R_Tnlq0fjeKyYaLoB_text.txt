Title: The effect of carbonated water on the rate of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is dependent on multiple systems to function properly, one of them being water. The purpose of this experiment was to observe the effects of carbonated water on the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesized that the rate of photosynthesize would increase with carbonated water. The results indicated that there was no significant difference between the rate of photosynthesis with normal water and the rate of photosynthesis with carbonated water. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that carbonated water increases the rate of photosynthesis from this experiment. This newly found knowledge will be helpful for future agricultural and environmental studies to help further push the question of how to increase crop yields and growth rates. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the foundation of the life cycle that all organisms rely on and live off of. Photosynthesis is broken down into two major parts, photosystem I and photosystem II. The main ingredients that are necessary to make photosynthesis work are chloroplasts, glucose, carbon dioxide, light, chlorophyll, and some electron transport complexes. Photosynthesis absorbs solar energy from the sun, then transfers and converts the energy with electron transfer from water to NADP+, producing ATP and a series of enzymatic reactions that assimilate carbon dioxide and synthesize carbohydrate [Tanaka, M. and Makino, A,: 2009]. In this experiment, we will examine how carbonated water affects the rate of photosynthesis through the use of the Hill reaction. The Hill reaction plays a role in photosynthesis with carbon dioxide and its process of transferring electrons [Good, N.E.: 1963]. 
	The proposed question is how will this carbonated water affect the rate of photosynthesis in spinach plants. We hypothesize that the rate of photosynthesis will increase in the presence of carbonated water. Our findings will help the agricultural community have a better understanding of how to increase crop production and maximize healthy crop yields. 


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted using the Spinacia oleracea, a centrifuge, and a spectrometer 20 machine. The first step was pulling the veins out of four to five spinach leaves. Then, placing the leaves and 10 mL of grinding buffer into the pestle to be ground up. Once a paste was starting to form in the mortar, another 10 mL of grinding buffer was added and ground. The paste was then filtered through three to four layers of cheesecloth placed over a beaker. The liquid was then transferred into a centrifuge tube labeled "spin 1A." A balance tube was also placed in the centrifuge with approximately the same amount of water as liquid in the other tube. The liquids were spun at 2000 G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then, the liquid, not the gunk at the bottom, was removed from the centrifuge and poured into another centrifuge tube labeled "B." This was then placed back in the centrifuge with a balance tube filled with water of the approximate volume of the liquid. This was spun at 1000 G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Once complete, the top liquid was poured into another tube labeled "C" and 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to "B" and stirred. Then 20 microliters of "B" with the grinding solution was placed in a tube labeled "B pellet." All tubes were then placed on ice.
	Part two of the experiment consisted of labeling 10 test tubes with number one being the blank, two through four being 100% water, five through 7 being 50% water and 50% carbonated water, and eight through ten being 100% carbonated water. The blank test tube was filled with eight mL of DI water, no 130 mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and no carbonated water. The three tubes of 100% water received six mL of DI water, two mL of 130 mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and no carbonated water. The three test tubes of 50:50 water and carbonated water got three mL of DI water, two mL of 130mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and three mL of carbonated water. The last three tubes of 100% carbonated water got no DI water, two mL 130mM DCIP, two mL of reaction buffer, and six mL of carbonated water. Then 100 microliters of chloroplast were added to every tube, and solutions were transferred into cuvettes. The spec 20 machine was set to a wavelength of 600 nm and the absorbances were recorded, starting by blanking the blank cuvette. Then the cuvettes were placed in sunlight for 10 minutes before recording the absorbances again. Then, the cuvettes were placed in the sunlight for another 10 minutes and the absorbances were recorded. Finally, the cuvettes were placed in the sunlight for a final 10 minutes and the absorbances were recorded. An ANOVA test was then run for each 10 minute interval, comparing the percent change of the rate of photosynthesis [Johnson, AD: 2016]. 


Results:
An ANOVA test was conducted for percent change of absorbance at the time stamps of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. At all three time intervals the data were not significant, making it inconclusive if carbonated water increased the rate of photosynthesis. At the 10 minute interval the p value was p=0.503, at the 20-minute interval the p value was p=0.313, and at the 30-minute interval the p value was p=0.974. Figure 1.1 shows the percent change of the rate of photosynthesis over the time span of 30 minutes.

Discussion:
We hypothesized that carbonated water would increase the rate of photosynthesis as time went on during the experiment. However, our results were insignificant, making it inconclusive if carbonated water really does increase the rate of photosynthesis. The graph below (Figure 1.1) has a trend of the percent change absorbance decreasing as time went on and then increasing in the last ten minutes. One observation noted during the experiment was that it was a cloudy day, meaning the samples did not receive much sunlight and inconsistent amounts of sunlight as the sun came in and out of the clouds. Also, upon adding the DCIP to the carbonated water sample, the sample turned a lilac color instead of a blue color, meaning that the carbonated water changed the pH to a more acidic environment. This probably contributed to the results not being significantly different. Other experiments similar to this one have been conducted and have had significant results. These data from other experiments suggest that CO2 is an active species involved in stimulating the Hill reaction [Sarojini, G. and Govindjee: 1981]. 
That being the case, other experiments have been conducted to see the effects of carbonated water on photosynthesis and came up with conclusive results. These experiments looked at how aquatic life is affected by investigating the concentrations of carbon dioxide and oxygen and how they fluctuate depending on the relative importance of photosynthesis and respiration; these studies also looked at how carbon dioxide and oxygen are strongly influenced by physical processes, such as gas exchange with the atmosphere and mixing [Wissel, B. et al: 2008]. They concluded that carbonated water increases photosynthesis and as a result algae blooms arise. Others have concluded that carbon dioxide levels do not affect photosynthesis as much as bicarbonate levels, making bicarbonate the more effective factor for increasing photosynthesis [Batra, P. and Jagendorf, A.:1965]. This lab is important because it has agricultural and marine impacts that will help communities create more effective ways of regulating crops and deadly algae blooms that can kill thousands of fish. This experiment also lays the foundation for future experiments in seeing how DCIP alters the pH of the solution in photosynthesis.
