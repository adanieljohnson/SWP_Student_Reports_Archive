Title: The Behavioral Response of Betta splendins to Dark Isolation

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to determine whether Betta splendins displays increased agnostic behavior when isolated in a dark environment before encountering another individual of its own species. It was hypothesized that if Betta fish are kept in a dark environment 4 ½ hours prior to encountering another male, they will exhibit more aggressive behavior than if they had been kept in light conditions before the experiment. This was accomplished by isolating two pairs of fish in the dark before allowing them to encounter one another. These were compared with Bettas who were in normal light conditions. The number of aggressive events and “red mane” display time were recorded. The results indicate that dark isolation does not increase the aggressive display of male Betta fish when comparing the number of aggressive events (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.501, p = 0.317) and the time that the “red mane” was displayed (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.520, p = 0.310). It was concluded that aggressive behavior is not increased by dark isolation in male Betta splendins. However, fish might have been somewhat habituated which would have decreased the display of aggressive behavior in all replicates.

Introduction:
Betta splendins or the Siamese fighting fish is a common aquarium fish originating from southeast Asia [Johnson: 2018]. Betta fish are known to display aggressive behavior when threatened, particularly in the presence of another male via an intraspecific interaction [Johnson: 2018]. These behaviors are well-documented and include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, tail flashing, pectoral fin erecting, spreading gill covers and finally, displaying the red mane [Johnson: 2018]. The interest of this experiment is in determining whether no light conditions increase the aggressive behavior in male Bettas.  The present study is unique, because no study was found to demonstrate the effect of light on Betta splendins behavior. It has been proposed that Betta fish display agnostic intensity proportional to the persistence of the opponent and inversely proportional to the distance between the two fish [Bronstein: 1981]. This means that the fish would display more aggression if the other fish is doing so, and it would display less aggression if they were further apart. This indicated that a glass barrier should be used to keep them close together and capable of seeing the other fish. Another study indicates that male Betta fish react similarly towards familiar and stranger males [Alyan: 2010]. This means that all fish used in this study should be representative since prior trials with these fish would have little to no effect on the result. Since fish are separated prior to observation, the effect of social isolation must also be considered. One study indicates that social isolation depresses the readiness of Betta fish to display aggressive behavior but once they are primed for the behaviors they show an increased display [Halperin: 1992]. This indicates that isolation is important before an encounter because the results might otherwise be confounded by the fact that some are less ready for aggression than others. It was hypothesized that if Betta fish are kept in a dark environment 4 ½ hours prior to encountering another male, they will exhibit increased aggressive behavior. The number of aggressive behaviors displayed and the length of time that the red mane was displayed was compared using a one-tailed two sample t_test.

Materials and Method:
Eight Betta fish were obtained and placed in tanks divided by an opaque wall and transparent glass. The opaque wall prevented them from interacting or becoming familiar before experimentation because if these interactions had occurred during the idle period of the experiment, the fish might have exhibited different behaviors during observations than if they had not expelled energy beforehand. It was determined that fish given the same treatment should be paired because this prevents the possibility that the treatment of one fish does not confound the aggressive behavior displayed by the other since Bettas are known to display agnostic intensity in proportion to one another. This was accomplished by having pairs of Betta fish separated in tanks by a removable opaque wall. It was important that the fish could not see one another. Two of the pairs were placed in no light conditions 4 ½ hours before the observations were made. Immediately after Betta fish were returned to light conditions, the wall was removed and aggressive behaviors between the two Bettas separated by glass were observed. The number of aggressive behaviors displayed and the length of time that the red mane was displaced were recorded for each fish, totaling to 8 measurements for each value. Every aggressive behavior, including the “red mane,” was counted as one aggressive instance. The timer for the “red mane” display began as soon as the “red mane” was demonstrated and was turned off when it was retreated. If the display was shown again the timer was continued until the observation period ended. Observations of each pair were 5 minutes in length. One-tailed two-sample t_tests were performed between the average values of events and time for both the controll group and the no light treatment group. 

Results:
The average number of aggressive behaviors displayed by fish in the light was 17.25 ± 18.71 and for the dark treatment was 11.5 ± 13.3. The average time “red mane” was displayed for fish in light was 101.75 ± 97.34 s and for fish in the dark was 68.25 ± 84.26 s. As depicted in figure one, the light group tended to show a higher average number of aggressive instances than the dark treatment group did. In figure 2, it is shown that the light group tended to display the “red mane” for a longer time on average than the Bettas who were in the dark prior to confrontation. Statistical tests parallel the trends in the data. No significent increase in aggressive behavior instances from the Bettas left in the dark before confrontation was found (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.501, p = 0.317) and there was no significent increase in “red mane” display for fish kept in the dark leading up to confrontation (d.f. = 6, t_stat = 0.520, p = 0.310). Overall, the results indicate that Betta fish do not exhibit increased aggression when isolated in the dark prior to intraspecific species interactions.

Discussion:
The hypothesis is rejected because statistical tests indicated that there was no significent increase in aggressive behavior in Bettas who were isolated in the dark prior to confrontation. As depicted in figures 1 and 2, the light controll group displayed more aggressive behavior on average. However, the first light group tested included Betta fish that were much more aggressive than the other replicates. Perhaps this was due to their bright fighting colors phenotype. One study indicates that brighter colors of Bettas invoke a more aggressive response in other Bettas [Bando: 1991]. Both fishes tested had bright red colors, so this may have contributed to their increased aggression. Yet, even with the exclusion of the more aggressive of these two fish, statistical tests still indicate that the dark treatment group did not display increased aggressiveness. It is possible, that some error is attributable to variation in counting ability between experimenters. Additionally, this experiment could be improved if the fish were kept in dark conditions for a longer duration. Future experiments might receive more precise results if fish are kept in the dark for 24-48 hours rather than 4 ½ hours. Another potential error in this experiment could be that the fish were tested multiple times before this experiment took place. A previous study indicates that aggressive behavioral response is decreased once a fish has been encountered for the first time and that the highest level of aggressive behavior is never reached again once they have already encountered one another [Clayton: 1967]. It is possible that the fish used in this experiment were somewhat accustomed to one another. If they were habituated, all groups would display lower levels of aggressive behavior. Another study indicated that daily exposures to an aggression eliciting stimulus is necessary to obtain habituation in Betta splendins [Peeke: 1970]. This demonstrates that the fish tested were probably not entirely habituated. However, they might have been more habituated to one another than two wild fish would have been since they were exposed to aggression eliciting stimuli a few times a week. As a result, this experiment could be improved if wild caught Bettas were used instead of domesticated Bettas who might already be somewhat accustomed to one another.
