Title: The Effect of an Ecdysterone Blocker on the Stunted Development of Manduca sexta.

Abstract:
Manduca sexta that have an ecdysterone blocker added to their diet will not pupate and will most likely die, in comparison to those of a normal diet who live healthy and pupate.  To find this out we created two groups and added the ecdysterone blocker to one group’s food and watched their growth over the course of two weeks.  We saw not only did the experimental group not pupate, but there was a significant difference in the average change in weight for the control and experimental groups, with control being significantly higher.  

Introduction:
Hormones are used by organisms to perform various bodily functions, such as thermoregulation, body maintenance, and growth and development.  Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm exist as a moth in their final developmental phase, or adult phase.  However, they exist as a caterpillar during their larva phases, of which they have five instars, or phases; they also exist as a pupa, the stage between the last larva instar and the adult moth phase.  These larva and pupa stages are the developmental phases of the Manduca sexta.  There are two hormones that work in conjunction to regulate the growth and development during the instar and pupa phase: Ecdysterone, E20, and Juvenile Hormone, JH.  Past research into ecdysterone has shown that ecdysterone affects the timing of pupation in the final instar of the Manduca sexta [Nijhout: 1976].  With a synthetic IGR, an insect growth regulator, that will work to block E20 from affecting the caterpillar, we hypothesize that there will be fewer caterpillars to pupate, from the final instar to a pupa, in the presence of the E20 blocker.  Our purpose was to see how blocking one of the two major hormones would affect the development and growth of the caterpillars, if at all.  

Materials and Methods:
First, we need to take our eight caterpillars and separate them into two groups, one a control and one the experimental group.  After separating the groups, we need to weigh each individual caterpillar and place them into our marked containers.  The food we provided for the control consisted of a normal Manduca sexta diet, mixed with some water, while the experimental group’s food consisted of a normal diet, but with 10 drops our E20 blocker per 10 grams of food.  We then would measure the growth of both groups almost every day, noting differences in the color to see if any caterpillars had pupated, for two weeks.  We would provide fresh food when necessary for the caterpillars, mixing to the same ratio as before.  After the two weeks, we would note how many of both groups had pupated, and we would perform a one tailed two sample t-test on the caterpillars from the starting weight to their max weight, where after they would either pupate or die.  

Results:
Our results showed that we had an average change in weight of 5.025 ± 1.54, in grams, for the control group with and average change in weight of 1.413 ± 0.27, in grams, for the experimental group.  The trend we see is that the control group had a much larger change in weight, growing over three times as much as the experimental group.  We also should note that all four of the control caterpillars pupated while three of the four experimental caterpillars died, with the lone survivor looking similar to a caterpillar in the 5th instar.  Our one tailed two sample t-test showed there was a significant difference between the two groups (t-stat= 4.61, df= 5, P= 0.002).

Discussion:
Our results support our hypothesis, that the blocking of E20 in the caterpillars would lead to fewer caterpillars who pupated in that group, compared to the control group.  All four of our control caterpillars were healthy and pupated before the end of our two weeks of observation, this would indicate that E20 plays an important role in the growth and development of the Manduca sexta, which is in line with previous research, which determined that E20 was a key hormone in the development and decision to pupate in the caterpillars [Nijhout: 1976].  We can see that the caterpillars need the influx of E20 to even have a chance of survival in the long term.  While we didn’t measure for length, from the data we did collect, and the observations made, it would be logical to conclude that the control group would have a larger change in length compared to the experimental group.  Biologically, all the results we have fall in line with what would have been expected, from the level of blocking a hormone will produce some affect that most likely will be averse to the health of the organism, to the level that E20 specifically affects the pupation rate of the Manduca sexta.  If we were to perform the experiment again, it would be good to increase the number of individuals in both groups, so we could get more data; also, it would be good to change the amount of the hormone blocker added to the food, so we could see the minimum amount of hormone blocker that will have an adverse effect on the caterpillars.  Our only source of error would be something we couldn’t control, but the experiment took place during a hurricane, which prevented us from feeding the caterpillars.  We suspect one of our caterpillars died during the storm, and if we could have fed the caterpillar it might not have died.
