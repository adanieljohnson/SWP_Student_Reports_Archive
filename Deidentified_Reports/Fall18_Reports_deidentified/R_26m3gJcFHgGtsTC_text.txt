Title: The effect of 2% of sevin of frog leg contractions

Abstract:
Rana Temporaria frogs predominantly rely on the contraction of their gastrocnemius muscle for movement. When there is a change in the calcium level or an action potential does not occur, the gastrocnemius muscle does not contract in the amount required for the intended movement. In this lab, 2% of Sevin was injected into the gastrocnemius of the frog leg. It was hypothesized that the addition of 2% of Sevin in the gastrocnemius would cause an increase in the twitch frequency and would ultimately lead to tetany at a lower amplitude. However, data did not show a significant difference between the control and experimental frog legs. The experimental frog legs failed to reach tetany at a lower amplitude than the control frog legs. The hypothesis was not supported by the results of the experiment. 

Introduction:
Muscles contract when neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, are released into the neurotransmitter junction and bind to the postsynaptic muscle fiber. An action potential is created by the binding, causing the action potential to spread through the muscle. Then the muscle myosin binds to actin which leads to the actual contraction of the muscle. Calcium also influences the contractions of the muscle. When calcium is released into the cytoplasm, it binds with troponin, allowing the myosin binding site to be exposed and ultimately allows the myosin to bind with the actin [Endo:1968]. Calcium is then taken up by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing relaxation of the muscle [Endo:1968]. In the lab, the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle and the sciatic nerve of a frog under the injection of 2% of Sevin was examined. 2% of Sevin is a chemical insecticide naphthyl methylcarbamate. It is typically used to kill pests due to its powerful effect on their nervous systems and causing their death. Based off previously conducted experiments, it is believed that 2% of Sevin interferes with the venous fluid which helps conduct action potentials created by the stimulation of the motor fibers involuntary muscles [Dale:1936]. The biological question investigated was whether 2% of Sevin would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower stimulus amplitude. To answer this question, the effects of stimulus frequency on twitch amplitude was investigated. It is hypothesized that when 2% of Sevin solution is injected into frog legs, the muscle will twitch more frequently and reach tetany at a lower amplitude.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs of similar size were chosen for the experiment. After their limbs were severed, they were kept moist with Ringer’s solution to aid in maintaining their muscle’s contractile ability postmortem. Before running the tests on the legs, they first had to be dissected and connected to specific instruments. To look at the muscle twitch, the components of the leg had to be isolated. To begin, the skin was peeled back from each leg to expose the inner thigh muscles. These muscles were gently separated by running a pair of scissors in between the muscles. After, the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated from the connective tissue by cutting through the tendon distal towards the Achilles tendon. Doing so revealed a thin sciatic nerve that was gently placed out of reach from metal objects. A 30 cm long piece of threat was used to tie a knot around the end of the gastrocnemius muscle so that it could be suspended by the arm of the force transducer. Pins were carefully placed to secure the leg to the dissecting tray to control its contractions. Lastly, the electrode was placed underneath the sciatic nerve so that appropriate stimulation can be applied from the amplifier. This data then appears on a computer in the form of a myogram, which measures the twitches in the muscle cell during specific parameters of stimulation. 
	Once the setup of the frog leg is complete, a control will be run on the frog leg in which the muscle will be stimulated by action potentials generated in the nerve attached to the muscle (the sciatic nerve). Using the computer a software, the nerve will be stimulated for short periods at stimulus frequencies (2,4,5,10,15,20, and 25 Hz). For every new stimulation frequency, the number of pulses will be set to zero, the pulse amplitude will remain constant at 1.0 A, and the pulse width is 5 ms. The recorded for the stimulus to be applied to the frog leg and note observations. Determine the distance between peaks of the twitches in ms until the distance is 0 ms, or the frog leg has reached tetany. Repeated for two other control frog legs. After, this procedure will be repeated for each of the three frog legs, but before recording data, their gastrocnemius muscle will be injected with 0.1 mL of 2% of sevin solution using a needle. These are the experimental frog legs. A paired t-test will be performed on the averages of the control and experimental data to determine if injecting the frog legs provides statistically significant data.



Results:
There are some visible trends to take note of from the raw data. The control frog legs, for the most part, had the same normal results/ observations with each increase in frequency. Temporal summation was beginning to be observed and then tetany was eventually reached. The experimental frogs' legs had similar results as the control for the first few increases in frequencies (from 2-10 Hz) while at higher frequencies, the frogs were still unable to reach tetany. At 25 Hz stimulation, which consistently brought control frog legs to tetany, experimental frog legs had an average distance between twitches of 40 ms. A paired t-test was conducted on the data collected to determine the statistical significance of injecting the frog legs with 2% solution of sevin. The average distance between twitches in ms with a 0.1 mL of 2% of sevin injection was not statistically different from the control group (t-stat=0.995, df=6, P=0.357512).

Discussion:
It was hypothesized that a 0.1 mL injection of 2% of sevin solution into a frog leg would cause the muscle to twitch more frequently, or decrease the time between twitches, and reach tetany at a lower stimulus. Based on the results recorded the alternate hypothesis must be rejected. Since the results show that the times between twitches in ms at different frequencies were not statistically different between the control and experimental frog legs, it cannot be concluded that 2% of sevin solution causes the leg to reach tetany sooner. In fact, it was observed that the experimental frog legs did not even reach tetany by a frequency of 25 Hz, despite the control legs being able to. This could have been attributed to the fatigue the frog was feeling after the first bunch of control tests. If this experiment were to be performed again, it would be interesting to see if waiting for the injection of 2% of sevin solution to take effect as well as provide a longer rest period would alter the results of the experiment.
