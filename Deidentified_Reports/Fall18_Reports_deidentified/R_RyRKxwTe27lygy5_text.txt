Title: The Negative Effects of Azagaurd on the Growth Development of the Manduca sexta Caterpillar

Abstract:
Hormones are vital for organs and glands to communicate throughout an organism’s body. In the Manduca sexta caterpillar hormones called ecdysterones are used to regulate the timing of molting. In this experiment, we studied the Manduca sexta growth cycle when ecdysterones were blocked. We fed four caterpillars food containing azagaurd, an ecdysterone inhibiter, and fed four other caterpillars normal caterpillar food. Our expectation was that none of the caterpillars that had ecdysterones blocked would be able to molt fully. Our data showed that the blocking of ecdysterones has a significent effect on the Manduca sexta growth cycle. One of our experimental caterpillars died within a week of consuming the azagaurd containing food and the other three caterpillars were unable to grow to the size of the controll group. 

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is an insect that has a holometabolous life cycle which means undergoes many growth phases until it becomes an adult. The stages include egg, larvae, pupa and adult. In order for the Manduca sexta to move to the next growth stage, it must undergo molting. During molting, the insect’s epidermal skin cells will secrete a new outside layer. Two hormones are important in order for the insect to molt: juvenile hormones and ecdysterones (E20). Ecdysterones are important because they regulate the timing of molting during the insect’s development. Juvenile hormones regulate the type of molt. The commitment pulse occurs before the insect molts into a pupa. It is when there is a rise in ecdysterones and a small rise in juvenile hormones. Before the insect molts into a pupa, it will eat a lot of food to have enough nutrients in preparation to become a moth. Right before the insect molts however, it will lose some of its water weight which will result in weights loss. Studies have been done on the effects of messing with normal ecdysterone levels. One study involves infusing the American lobster, Homarus americanus, with ecdysterones. The results found that altering ecdysterone levels will disrupt the normal sequence of molting [Flint: 2011]. Azagaurd is a chemical used to block ecdysterones. So, what would happen if we fed the Menduca sexta caterpillars a small amount of azagaurd? Would they molt into a pupa at all? Would they take longer to molt? This experiment measures the growth of Manduca sexta caterpillars over time after they have been treated with azagaurd which blocks ecdysterones. If we feed the Manduca sexta caterpillars five drops of azagaurd per ten grams of food, then they will not molt fully. 

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, we used eight caterpillars of roughly the same size and weight. The caterpillars are already either the 4th larval instar or the 5th larval instar. Four of which were placed into a controll container with separate bins for each caterpillar. The other four were our experimental group and were placed into a separate container. We measured the mass in grams of each caterpillars and labeled them one through four on each bin. Each caterpillar was given ten grams of food to start. We added five drops of water per ten grams of food for the controll group and mixed the mixture together. For the experimental group, we added 5 drops of Azagaurd per ten grams of food and mixed the mixture together. The caterpillars needed to stay in a warm environment to stay alive, so we placed the bins in an incubator. In order to know if the caterpillars were growing, we measured and recorded their weight every day for two weeks. Because of a weather complication, we were unable to measure the caterpillar’s weight for three days towards the end of the experiment. We also took pictures of the caterpillars to see their shape and color change. A two-tailed t_test was used to find if the mean of the controll group and mean of experimental group were significently different. 

Results:
While observing the caterpillars, they physically changed a lot over the course of two weeks. They began as bright blue healthy-looking caterpillars. Both groups overall grew over the first five days. Starting around the tenth of September, the controll caterpillars began to change from a bright blue to a faded blue. The experimental group’s color also faded but not as quickly as the controll group. By the thirteenth of September, the controll group had lost a lot of its blue color and the experimental group still had some blue color. One of the experimental caterpillars died on the eleventh of September. By the seventeenth of September, all of the controll caterpillars had fully formed into a pupa. The experimental group had one caterpillar that had partly molted, and the rest of the caterpillars were very sluggish. Not much changed by the nineteenth of September. 
The controll group caterpillars over all were able to gain a significent amount of weight compared to the experimental group. The largest mass recorded in the controll group 8.33 grams while the highest mass in the experimental group was 5.5 grams. We ran two-tailed t_test and found the mean of the controll group statistically significently different than that of the experimental group (t_stat = 2.58, d.f. = 22,  P = 0.017). 


Discussion:
My hypothesis that if Manduca sexta caterpillars were treated with azagaurd was supported. None of the caterpillars in the experimental group were able to fully molt. This is likely due to the fact that ecdysterones are vital to regulate the timing of molting during the insect’s development. There was a large jump in the controll group’s mass while the experimental group did not gain much weight (fig. 1). Because ecdysterones was blocked, the larvae did not consume a lot of food in preparation for molting. They did not have enough nutrients to fully transform into a pupa. One of the caterpillars in the experimental group was able to partly molt and this could be because it was already large enough and far along enough in its growth cycle to not be as affected by the blocking of ecdysterones. Another study of ecdysterones on Balanus Amphitrite found similar results. This study found that a molt-inhibiting hormone reduced the ecdysterone-stimulated activity in Balanus Amphitrite [Freeman 1979]. Hormones are vital for growth and development of all living organisms and altering hormone levels will have detrimental effects on an organism’s life.
