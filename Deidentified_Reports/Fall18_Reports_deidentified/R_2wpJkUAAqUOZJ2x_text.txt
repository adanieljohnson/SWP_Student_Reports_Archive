Title: The Non-Effect of Potassium on the Threshold of an Action Potential in Rana pipiens. 

Abstract:
Nerves are used to quickly communicate between different parts of the body of an organism, and to illicit a reaction faster than hormones.  Potassium is one of many ions that affects the electrochemical gradient, the resting ratio of positive and negative ions inside and outside a neuron.   Potassium and sodium create a resting membrane potential before and action potential.  We hypothesized that adding potassium to the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens, or frog, leg would increase the threshold for an action potential.  To find this out we took three frog legs and found the control threshold and then added 0.1 mL potassium to each of the legs and then found the new threshold for an action potential.  The results we saw indicated that there is no significant difference in the threshold size in the control and with frog legs with potassium added.  

Introduction:
Nerves are cells in the body of an organism that are used for the transport of information and to illicit a reaction.  Nerves function rapidly to transport this information and get a response as quickly as possible, transporting information faster than hormones, another communication system used by organisms.  Muscles are one of the many parts of the body controlled by nerves.  Rana pipiens, or commonly known as a frog, are used to study nerve control of muscle functions due to the pronounced gastrocnemius muscle, the large muscle in frog legs, and sciatic nerve, the main nerve that controls frog legs.  An action potential can be achieved by stimulating both the gastrocnemius and the sciatic nerve externally and can be read using a myogram.  Potassium is one chemical used in the process of an action potential, specifically in reversing the depolarization in the membrane after an action potential.  After sodium channels are opened and closed, potassium channels open to reverse the depolarization caused by the sodium.  Other research has shown that muscle activity is associated with an increase in potassium ions outside the cells in muscles [Shushakov: 2007]. Artificially, raising the level of potassium outside the cell, would alter the ratio of potassium inside the nerve to outside the cell, causing less potassium to leave the cell, keeping the nerve from reversing the depolarization.  We hypothesize that injecting potassium into the gastrocnemius muscle will increase the action potential threshold, when stimulating the sciatic nerve.  

Materials and Methods:
First, we took our three frog legs, each was a control for itself, and removed the skin from the legs.  Then we took the legs and cut one end of the gastrocnemius muscle off the leg and made sure the muscle was not connected to the rest of the leg with any connective tissue.  We then located the sciatic nerve and bound the muscle around the sciatic nerve down to expose the nerve.  Next, we tied the cut end of the gastrocnemius to a force transducer, which measured the size of the action potentials in a myogram.  From there, we applied an electrical signal to the sciatic nerve and noted if we saw an action potential; if an action potential was seen we lowered the amplitude applied until we found the minimum amplitude needed to produce an action potential and raised the amplitude if necessary.  After finding the control, we then injected each frog leg with 0.1 mL of 20 micromolar potassium and found the threshold of each leg with the potassium added.  We then performed a paired t-test to see if the difference is significant.  

Results:
Our results showed that we had an average of 0.066, with a standard deviation of ± 0.026, for the control threshold of the frog legs.  We had an average of 0.079, with a standard deviation of ± 0.043, for the threshold of the frog legs with potassium added.  The averages with standard deviation for both groups is shown in figure 1.  The trend we see is that the experimental group average was higher than the control group, but had a larger standard deviation, meaning the values had a larger range than the control group.  While we see this trend, our data showed there was no significant difference between the control and experimental group (t-stat= 1.04, df= 2, P= 0.407). 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis, that is adding potassium to the gastrocnemius muscle will increase the threshold for an action potential.  Two of our three frog legs did in fact have a higher threshold than their control threshold, but we had one that had a lower threshold when potassium was added shown in figure 2.  This would indicate that potassium does not have an effect on the threshold for an action potential.  Our results contradict previous research, which indicated that nerves were less excitable, less likely to produce an action potential, in the presence of higher potassium levels [Boërio: 2014].  Biologically, our results do not follow the precedent set by previous research, in that increasing potassium in the muscle would lead to decreased excitability, or higher threshold.  This could be due to the amount of potassium, or the concentration, we injected into the muscle, where the amount we injected was not enough to have an effect on the threshold.  However, it should be noted that previous research was testing at levels lower than ours, 4.11 mmol/l, and still found that potassium did have an effect on threshold [Boërio: 2014].  It would be needed to run the same experiment with a larger amount, or higher concentration, of potassium to determine if potassium truly has no effect on the threshold in frog legs, or at a lower amount to test potassium at the levels of previous research.  Our only source of error would be if we accidently allowed some of the potassium to touch the legs during the control testing of the legs.  This would be possible as we prepped each leg and laid them on the testing surface for the control tests with no barrier over them while we did the potassium test in the leg.  It is unlikely as we injected potassium instead of coating the leg, but some potassium could have dripped out of the leg and was not wiped up after the test.  Our test is important as our results could change the understanding of how potassium affects the threshold of an action potential.  However, since our results differ from the previous research into the topic, our experiment should be repeated and improved to test whether our results are accurate; since there is evidence that our results are not accurate, we cannot hold our first test as accurate and fact.
