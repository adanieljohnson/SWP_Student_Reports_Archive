Title: The Adverse Effect of Excessive Juvenile Hormone on Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Understanding endocrinology is crucial to examining the development of insects. The rapid rise of different pest populations require extensive knowledge about how different hormones can affect their growth. In this experiment, we will gauge the effects of increased juvenile hormone upon the development of Manduca sexta. It was hypothesized that as the amount of juvenile hormone in the caterpillars’ systems increased, the weight of the caterpillar would change. The difference in weight gain between the control and experimental growth supported the hypothesis, as the weight of the experimental group was nearly double that of the control group. The average mass of the control group was 7.6475 g and the average mass of the experimental group was 13.9033 grams. This shows that juvenile hormone causes weight gain but also prevents the Manduca from fully developing.

Introduction:
Much like mammals, insects rely on the endocrine system to produce hormones that control their maturation. This experiment measures the effects of hormone manipulation on the insect molting process; molting occurs when insects secrete a new outer covering and shed the old one [Johnson: 2018]. Molting indicates the progression of the insect’s lifecycle. Juvenile hormone and ecdysterone are the two primary hormones responsible for insect metamorphosis [Johnson: 2018]; juvenile hormone controls the type of molt that an insect undergoes, such as the molt from second instar larva to third instar larva [Riddiford: 2003]. Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm, was the subject of this experiment. The accessibility and ability to control the hormone levels of this insect made them the clear choice for this experiment. Treating the caterpillars with increased juvenile hormone, the weight of the insects was measured every day for two weeks. Our hypothesis states that if the level of juvenile hormone is increased, then the weight of the caterpillars will change. 

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca caterpillars were split into a control group and experimental group with four caterpillars in each. Each caterpillar was placed into an enclosed section of the container to easily identify each test subject. The Manduca were kept in an incubator under the same environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity. The caterpillars were weighed before the modified and control feedings began in order to ensure accurate analysis. The control group was fed a normal Manduca diet, but the experimental group was fed the same diet with five drops of juvenile hormone added after to each feeding. The food had to be combined with water in both groups to make a mash that was easy for the caterpillars to eat. The caterpillars were observed for physical changes and weighed every day for two weeks using an electronic balance. A two-tailed two sample t-test was used to determine the difference in the average weights of the Manduca that weren’t given additional juvenile hormone in comparison to the caterpillars that were given additional juvenile hormone. 

Results:
The average mass of the control caterpillars was 7.6475 grams and the average mass of the experimental group was 13.9033 grams (Figure 1). The standard deviation for mass in the control Manduca was 2.7293 and the standard deviation for mass in the experimental Manduca was 1.3759 (Figure 1). A two-tailed two sample t-test was utilized to analyze the results of our juvenile hormone manipulation experiment. The mean of the experimental group was significantly different than the control group according to our data (t-value= 3.5184, degrees of freedom = 6, two-tailed p-value = 0.012543). When observing the physical changes of the caterpillars, it was evident that the experimental group was growing much quicker than the control group. The control and experimental groups had divergent paths of growth shortly after the beginning of the experiment. The experimental group remained green and growing while the control group stopped gaining weight and began to turn brown and pupate; the experimental group was also much more resistance to being touched. Both groups developed special characteristics, such as the red horn seen on the rear portion of the Manduca larvae’s body. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the Manduca sexta’s weight would change if juvenile hormone was increased, was accepted. A significant amount of weight was gained by the experimental group in comparison to the control group during our two-week study. The juvenile hormone encourages growth of the larva from one larval stage to the next and halts metamorphosis [Safranek: 1980]. The continued increase of the juvenile hormone caused the larvae to rapidly gain weight and advance to the next larval instar stage without the prospect of pupation or metamorphosis; the juvenile hormone levels must decrease for pupation to occur [Johnson: 2018]. Since juvenile hormone causes the larval instars to progress, if the levels of hormone are maintained the insect will remain in a larval state until the juvenile hormone subsides. Other studies have shown that the increase of juvenile hormone prevents metamorphosis and therefore causes weight gain among the Manduca [Safranek: 1980]. In order to ensure the validity of the results, the experiment could be repeated, but it might be beneficial to measure the length of the caterpillars instead of just weighing them to ensure that the juvenile hormone increases growth in the form of length and weight gain. Applying the results of this hormone manipulation experiment to other insect species, this conclusion could lead to a more thorough way of eliminating pests and examining diverse endocrine functions.
