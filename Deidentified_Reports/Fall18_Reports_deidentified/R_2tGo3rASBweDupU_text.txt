Title: Nerve and Muscle Activity In Frog Legs When Treated With Tubocurarine

Abstract:
The purpose of our investigations will isolate the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve from a frog leg, and demonstrate some basic properties of neuromuscular control. In our experiment, we  injected the  Frog Leg with Tubocurarine (a chemical that functions like nicotine which stops acetylcholine from binding). To test these affects we injected out frog leg with Tubocurarine to test what would happen to the twitches and varying thresholds when acetylcholine is not present.  We hypothesized that if Tubocurarine was injected directly into the Gastrocnemius, then the relaxation phase will be longer. The trials where the leg muscles did not have Tubocurarnie injected in them had shorter relaxation periods compared to when the Tubocurarine was injected into the leg muscles and the voltage was applied. The paired t-test, containing our means from each of our leg trials (without Tubocurarine injection and with Tubocurarine injection for each of the three legs, supported our hypothesis by having a significant p-value, displaying the fact that the trials containing the Tubocurarine injection had longer relaxation periods.We found that our Relaxation Phase (in milliseconds) was much longer than the legs that were only injected with Frog Ringer's. We hypothesize if frog legs are treated

Introduction:
Nerves and muscles allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. Here, the neuromuscular system is different in that it can respond within milliseconds, rather than responding in second to days as hormone  based systems do. Skeletal muscle of both vertebrates and invertebrates consists of thousand of myofibers, which are cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells. The individual myofibers are bound together by connective tissue to form functional groups, which are the skeletal muscles proper. Skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons, which have cell bodies located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscles then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions.  Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction causes release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. Two scientists write, “preliminary description of experiments which indicated that something having the properties of acetylcholine(ACh.)is liberated,when impulses in motor nerve fibres excite contraction of a voluntary, striated muscle. Several earlier observer shad recorded observations of this kind,but their significance had not been clear” (Feldberg).  ACh binds which receptor on the membrane of the muscle fiber, opening sodium channels that generate an action potential in the muscle fiber. The action potential spreads throughout the length of the fiber, stimulation the release of Calcium ions from internal storage sites (the sarcoplasmic reticulum). A myogram is a visual recording of the different stages within a single muscle twitch, and is collected by connecting the muscle to a force transducer. The transducer works by changing mechanical energy (muscle movement) into an electrical signal. This signal is fed through an amplifier to the computer. All the equipment is already connected properly for you, so you can focus on understanding the biological concepts being demonstrated.
A typical myogram will have three distinct phases: a latent period, the contraction phase, and the relaxation phase. The latent period is a very short time lapse between the time of stimulation and the start of contraction. In most muscles of the body, it lasts less than 10 msec. In the contraction phase the muscle shortens due to the chemical changes that occur within the fibers. After the contraction phase has reached its maximum, the muscle returns to its former relaxed state during the relaxation phase. The length of both the contraction and relaxation phases differs between various muscles in the body. The release of Calcium ions activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, causing it to shorten (Biological Principles Lab Manual). 


Materials and Methods:
We received three frog legs of similar size and prepared them by removing the skin and exposing the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle. We attached the first leg to the force transducer and applied one one  volt pulse of force at an amplitude of one 3 times. We then injected the leg with 0.1 mL of Tubocurarine and repeated the data collection process for the first frog leg. We then repeated the experiment with the remaining frog legs  with the second and third frog legs and made sure to carefully clean our experimental pan between trials to make sure our legs did not get contaminated. We then ran a paired t-test (alpha=0.05) to analyze the difference in mean values between the control trials and the experimental trials.

Results:
The general trend in our data is that the systolic BP increased significantly after the exam. Here the paired T-Test shows that the standard deviation is 2. The duration of the relaxation periods from when our frog legs were injected with Tubocurarine was consistently longer compared to our control trials when we did not inject the frog legs with anything (Figure 1). Our results from our paired t-test were (t-value: 10.25, df=2, P(paired)= 0.009384).

Discussion:
Our hypothesis was supported because we observed longer period of the relaxation phase after the frog leg has been injected with tubocurarine. These results were consistent for all 3 frog legs. This is mainly due to the fact that turbocarine stops the binding of ACh since it is an antagonist. In a different study by Dr. Dreyer, he concluded, “The action of tubocurarine on voltage‐clamped frog muscle end‐plates has been re‐examined by means (a) equilibrium dose‐ratio measurements, (b) current fluctuation measurements and (c) voltage‐jump relaxation measurements”. His findings are similar to our finding because he also concluded that he  The other is much slower (1‐‐3 sec), and, in relaxation experiments it is in the opposite direction to the fast relaxation, were fast relaxation was untreated with tubocurarine” (Colquhoun)
