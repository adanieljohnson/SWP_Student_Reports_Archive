Title: The Effect of Acid Rain and Tap Water on Root to Shoot Ratio of Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an essential component of supporting life function in plants, with environmental influences such as pollution becoming influential on plant growth and health.  Our experiment analyzed resource allocation in the form of root to shoot ratio of the Pisum Sativum plant. Twenty plants were allocated to both acid rain and tap water conditions, sectioned into 5 plants in each of 4 pots. Under consistent exposure to natural light, the plants grew for 2 weeks and were measured for root to shoot ratio for weight and length. A 2-sample 1-tailed t-test was used to analyze and compare the calculated mean ratios between the treatment groups.  It was hypothesized that plants treated with acid rain would have a higher mean root to shoot ratio for length and weight compared to the control group of plants treated with tap water. The collected data supported the hypothesis, yielding a significantly higher calculated mean root to shoot ratio for both weight and length for acid rain plants compared to the tap water plants. The effect of acid rain and lower pH impacted the resource allocation of the pea plant, creating a higher root to shoot ratio to allow for efficient resource absorption.  

Introduction:
Ecosystems are composed of both biotic and abiotic factors, which interact with each other in various ways. Biotic factors include living things such as plants, animals, or environmental stimuli that come from other living organisms [Johnson:2018]. Abiotic factors include non-living components of an ecosystem such as sunlight, nutrients, and pH. In order to work around the issue of limitation and environmental factors that could affect growth and function, trade-offs and resource allocation strategies are used by plants to efficiently obtain nutrients/resources from their given environments. These resource allocation strategies center around crucial resources for function, growth, reproduction, and development [Johnson:2018]. One of the methods plants use to allocate their resources is the root to shoot ratio. One of the abiotic factors that can have a heavy impact on root to shoot ratio and general resource allocation strategies include pH of the environment. In a study examining the effects of acidity on root length, shoot length, and pore strength of roots, plants were exposed to varying levels of acid and data was collected. [Haling: 2010]. It was found that acid led to the decreased length of shoots and an increased length of roots, needed to help the plant obtain nutrients from its surroundings. In a popular case study studying the effect of ozone and acid rain on white pine seedlings, it was found that seeds treated with the ozone and acid rain had higher root to shoot ratios [Reich:1987]. These results support the previous case study as well. In our experiment, the root to shoot ratio for weight and length of two sections of the field pea plant, Pisum Sativum, were compared to analyze how the presence of different environmental conditions impact resource allocation. It was hypothesized that field pea plants treated with acid rain will have a higher average root to shoot ratio for both weight and length than the field pea plants treated with tap water. 



Materials and Methods:
Field pea seeds were collected and soaked in water for thirty minutes. For each of the 2 conditions, 4 black pots were filled with vermiculate, fifty milliliters of Miracle-Gro, and a pretreatment of either tap water or acid rain with a pH of 3.5. Next, ten seeds were placed in each of the 4 black pots and set in the greenhouse with consistent exposure to natural light. Every day for 2 weeks the plants were watered with their respective treatment. At the end of the experiment, 5 plants were removed from each black pot per respective section (twenty plants total) and roots were cut from shoots at the root-shoot junction and weighed and measured for length separately. The root to shoot ratio for weight and length for each plant was calculated. The data was analyzed using a 2-sample 1-tailed t-test to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio for the tap water for weight was 1.02 ± 0.186 g (Figure 1), and the mean root to shoot ratio for the acid rain for weight was 1.59 ± 0.292 g (Figure 2). Utilizing these results, we calculated a t-statistic value of 6.867, with a one-tailed p-value of about 6.69E-8 and 34 degrees of freedom. The mean root to shoot ratio for the tap water for length was 0.61 ± 0.068 cm, and the mean root to shoot ratio for the acid rain for length was 0.93 ± 0.153 cm. Using this data, we calculated a t-statistic value of 8.141, with a one-tailed p-value of 1.52E-9, and 34 degrees of freedom. Thus, there was a statistically significant difference in the calculated means of the treatment groups, and the root to shoot ratios for weight and length were higher for the plants treated with acid rain. The appearance of the plants differed slightly on the last day of observation; the tap water plants had seemingly stronger shoot systems that stood taller and less extensive root systems compared to the acid rain plants, which seemed to have a weaker, thinner shoot system and a thicker, more extensive root system. The plants of the two treatment groups resembled each other in terms of color and intensity of color throughout the entire plant body. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the experiment was supported because the data, seen in Figures 1 and 2 as well as the results of the statistical test, yielded a significantly higher mean root to shoot ratio for length and weight for the plants treated with acid rain compared to the control group treated with tap water. These results supported the experiments previously discussed, as the acid rain did have an effect on how the pea plants allocated their resources in order to best obtain the nutrients from the soil, by producing a higher root to shoot ratio [Reich:1987].  These results occurred because the presence of acid rain impacted the sprouting and growth of the seeds, causing the plants to allocate energy to growing a more extensive root system to obtain nutrients and a necessary amount of water from the soil in the most efficient way possible to support necessary life functions. A recent study investigating the effect of pH in soil revealed that a decreased pH leading to an acidic environment was linked to osmotic stress of plants in that environment [Kang: 2011], thus further supporting the hypothesis of the experiment and the subsequent results and data collected. Conversely, the tap water plants did not require a higher root to shoot ratio because there was not a factor inhibiting the ability to get nutrients from the soil. The use of the Pisum Sativum plant was an important component of this experiment as the plant is a dicotyledon, or a flowering plant with two embryonic leaves, that is more susceptible to effects of acidity than plants such as monocotyledons, which are flowering plants with one embryonic leaf [Lal: 2016]. This allowed for the effects and results of acid conditions to truly be displayed by the plants in this experiment. Investigating how plants react in terms of resource allocation and specifically toward the effect of acidity is essential as environmental changes become more prevalent and impact plant life worldwide. Furthering this experiment could include the addition of different abiotic factors such as an influx of nitrogen to further understand how plants react to certain environmental changes and to what extent they are impacted.
