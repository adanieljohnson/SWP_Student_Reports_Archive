Title: The Ecdysterone Inhibitor AzaGaurd kept the Manduca Sexta from going through the Commitment Pulse 

Abstract:
The three main hormones that controll the developmental stages of an insect include prothoracicotropic (PTTH) or brain hormone, ecdysterone, and the juvenile hormone. The hormone that was focused on in this experiment was ecdysterone in the Manduca sexta. This hormone regulates the timing of molting and increases significently during different times from 4th larval instar to adult. AzaGaurd was used as an ecdysterone inhibitor to determine if the low levels of ecdysterone would keep the Manduca from going through the commitment pulse, meaning they would not grow. There was a two-sample t_test run on both the weight and length data and results were (weight) t_stat = 5.42386, d.f.= 22, P=9.50E-06 and (length) t_stat= 6.381437, d.f.= 22, P= 1.01E-01. The results are statistically significent due to the low p_value and shows the importance of ecdysterone in the development of the Manduca from a larva to developing adult. 

Introduction:
There are main hormones in insects that controll the development of molting, formation of the pupa, and the emergence of the insect as an adult. The three main hormones include the prothoracicotropic (PTTH) or brain hormone, ecdysterone, and the juvenile hormone. These three hormones affect the Manduca in their journey to become a moth. Ecdysterone, which is regulated by PTTH, regulates timing of molting during the insect development, while the juvenile hormone regulates the type of molt during development. The juvenile hormone and ecdysone work together in different ratios to get the Manduca to full maturity. PTTH and ecdysone significently rise, exposing the heart accompanied by signs of pupation [Nijhout: 1975]. These levels also rise again slightly at the commitment pulse, which indicates the Manduca has stored enough nutrients and is large enough to become a moth. There are ways of inhibiting different hormones in insects by using certain chemicals in their food. AzaGaurd, for instance, inhibits the effects of ecdysone in Manduca. Inhibiting the ecdysterone hormone, will keep the Manduca from going through the commitment pulse, making them a much smaller size.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca caterpillars were obtained and placed into two different groups (4 in each). They were all originally weighed and measured for their length. Both groups received 10 grams of caterpillar food. In the controll group, 10 drops of water were added to the food and in the experimental group, 10 drops of AzaGaurd was added to the food. The caterpillars were monitored and measured and weighed daily and recorded. The food was changed as needed (whenever it got low or went dry) and the correct amount of water or AzaGaurd was added to the food. This process continued for a total of 14 days. There was a two-sample t_test run on the data to determine the results of the experiment. 

Results:
The tables show there is a significent difference in the average weight and length between the controll and experimental groups. 
At the end of the experiment the controll group was observed as a brown color, while the experimental group was dead by day 15.

Weight: t_stat = 5.42386, d.f.= 22, P=9.50E-06 
Length: t_stat= 6.381437, d.f.= 22, P= 1.01E-01



Discussion:
The results of the t_test show the results of this experiment were significent and the null hypothesis was rejected because the p_value was below 0.05. the average length and weight of the controll group was significently higher than the weight and length of the experimental group (Figure 1 and Figure 2). In the experiment there were three days where the Manduca from both the experimental and controll group could not be measured due to unforeseen weather conditions (Table 1 and Table 2). The outcome of this experiment supported the alternate hypothesis because of two different reasons. As stated before, ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting and without this hormone, the Manduca could not continue on its path towards becoming a developed adult.  In a study on the effect of ecdysterone in Galleria mellonella, it was discovered that wing disks did not continue to synthesize DNA unless ecdysone was present when they were cultured [Oberlander: 1968]. Ecdysterone is very important in the development in all insects and with their lack of presence, the insect will not grow correctly, just as in the case in this experiment. Another reason the experimental group continued to lose weight is because they did not eat their food similarly to the controll group. The controll group had to get their food changed 3 times in a span of 15 days because they ran out, while the experimental group only ever got their food changed because it got dry. The caterpillars were not getting the nutrients they needed, which means even if the ecdysterone levers were not blocked by AzaGaurd, they would not have enough nutrients to go through the commitment pulse. Another experiment that could be run to see the effects of AzaGaurd on the Manduca more clearly, would be to find a different way to get the inhibitor in the Manduca to see if they would eat their food and continue to grow along with the experimental group.
