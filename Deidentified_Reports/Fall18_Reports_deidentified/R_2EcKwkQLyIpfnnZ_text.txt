Title: The effect of sex on the reaction time of Betta splendins when presented with food

Abstract:
Many animal species display aggressive behaviors towards members of their own species. Male Betta splendins experience agnostic behaviors in order to obtain a mating partner. This study investigates the role of sex and the presence of food in the time it takes for Siamese fighting fish to notice the presence of another fighting fish and eventually experience agnostic behavior. Because male Betta fish are selected on by females in the mating process, we hypothesize that male Betta splendins will take less time to notice the presence of another male Betta splenden than it will take females to notice another female. Because environmental factors often play a role in animal behavior, we also hypothesize that if food is present in the tank, the fish will take longer to notice one another due to the distraction of the food in their environment. We put four Betta fish in a tank with glass separating them, and added food to each tank. We recorded the time it took each fish to notice the other with and without food present. Males took less time to notice each other, and both species took less time to notice each other in the presence of food. One hypothesis was supported, males took less time to notice each other, and the data was statistically significent (p=0.000017). 

Introduction:
Many animal interactions revolve around obtaining a mating partner and eventually protecting their offspring. These interactions include various forms of intraspecific aggressive behavior that are often triggered by various ques from the surrounding environment, often the presence of a predator. However, environmental cues are not all it takes for an animal to experience aggressive behavior. It is a combination of activities in the nervous system of the organism and their various hormone levels [Huntingford: 1999]. These intraspecific, aggressive behaviors allow animals to obtain mating partners, scare off predators, and protect their young. However, agnostic behaviors require a lot of energy expenditure leading to negative physiological affects if they are experienced too often. Male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendins, are an example of an organism that experiences these aggressive behaviors. They often show extreme aggression towards each other in an ongoing fight for dominance. Male Betta splendins are territorial and experience specific intra-sexual competition when in the presence or other male Betta fish [Matos: 2002]. Natural selection on their behaviors has evolved to select for large, aggressive males who can effectively compete to mate with females and provide parental care in the form of protection over Betta splenden eggs.  These behaviors are considered agnostic behaviors that send signals within the species and can be used by other fighting fish to predict the interactions that will follow [Matos: 2002]. Females do not display these agnostic behaviors but rather serve as catalysts for these behaviors in male to male interactions. In fact, females observe these behaviors by “eavesdropping” and use these observations to select a male mate, a form of sexual selection that has furthered natural selection on the strongest, most aggressive males [Herb: 2003].  Male Betta splendins experience a range of aggressive behaviors that reveal that a male has noticed the presence of another male and is exhibiting territorial behaviors [Herb: 2003]. 
The experiment described below tests the effect of the presence of food on the time it takes for two female Betta splendins to notice each other and two male Betta splendins to notice each other.  It also looks at the differences between the reaction times of females and males. Comparing the time it takes for female fish to notice each other as opposed to how long it takes male fish reveals the role females play in the mating process versus the role of males. This information could be useful to Betta splenden breeders who want to breed the fish most effectively, since they are one of the most popular aquarium fish. Based on the above research, male Betta fish are much more territorial and aggressive than female fish and are most concerned with the presence of another male fish, over any other environmental factors. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if two male Betta splendins can see each other and two female Betta splendins can see each other, both with and without food present, then the female Betta splendins will take longer to notice one another than the male fish, with and without food present. It is also hypothesized that, in the presence of food, both male and female Betta splendins will take longer to notice each other due to the environmental distraction. 


Materials and Method:
To carry out the experiment, two female Betta fish were placed in a tank and two male Betta fish were placed in a tank. A sheet of glass separated the females from each other and a sheet of glass separated the males from each other.  The behavior of each fish while observing each other for five minutes was recorded. The amount of time it took for the males to notice each other was recorded and the amount of time it took the females to notice each other was recorded. 
It was evident that males noticed each other when they began displaying aggressive behaviors such as tail beating, fin spreading, biting, and gill displays. It was evident that females noticed each other when they swam to the glass, stayed in one spot, and faced the female on the other side of the glass. After five minutes passed, the glass was covered and the fish were given five minutes of rest. Then, the glass was uncovered and the fish were each fed a few pieces of food. Behavioral observations were recorded and the amount of time it took the fish to notice each other was noted. The glass was covered after five minutes and the fish were once again given five minutes of rest. The above steps were all repeated twice to allow for three controll trials and three trials with food present. A mean reaction time was recorded for the female to female controll trial, male to male controll trial, female to female with food present trial, and male to male with food present trial. All four trials were compared by running an ANOVA statistical test and Turkey-Kramer test. The Turkey-Kramer post hoc test reveals whether the data is significently different between the various groups – males without food, males with food, females without food, and females with food.  


Results:
Overall, the data shows that females have a higher average reaction time when placed in the presence of each other than males placed in the presence of each other. Females have a greater reaction time with and without food present. The data also shows that the presence of food decreases average time it takes for the to notice each other for both females and males. 
The average time it took males to notice each other in the absence of food is 49.67 +/- 9.29s. The average time it took males to notice each other in the presence of food is 15 +/- 5s. The average time it took females to notice each other in the absence of food is 215.67 +/- 35.02s. The average time it took two females to notice each other in the presence of food is 61 +/- 25.16s. 
After performing an ANOVA statistical test using the reaction times recorded from each trial, it was concluded that the data is statistically significent (p=0.000017). After completing a Turkey-Kramer test, it was found that the difference between the reaction times of the males with no food and the females with no food, the males with food and the females with no food, and the females with no food and the females with food is statistically significent. 



Discussion:
In conclusion, one of the hypothesis was supported by this study (p=0.000017). On average, it took longer for the female Betta splendins to notice the presence of the other female Betta fish than it took for male Betta splendins to recognize the presence of the other male. However, the second hypothesis was not supported by the data collected. The presence of food decreased the reaction time of both male and female Betta splendins. This reveals that male Betta fish are in fact more concerned with the presence of another fish than female Betta fish. It also reveals that the fish are most concerned with each other, over any environmental distractions, including food [Matos: 2002]. Betta splendins do not typically experience aggressive behaviors due to the presence of food. Aggressive behaviors are solely expressed when a male threatens their ability to breed or their young are in danger. The male concern with the presence of another fish affects their ability to breed with females and reproduce. Ultimately, this affects their overall fitness which explains why males are more alert and aware of their surroundings than females [MacLaren: 2018]. It makes sense that the difference between the reaction times of the females with no food and the females with food is statistically significent and the difference between reaction times of the males with no food and the males with food is not statistically significent because females will be more easily distracted by environmental factors. Female Betta fish do not compete because they do not need to worry about obtaining a mate. Females select on males and can therefore receive a mating partner at almost any point in time [MacLaren: 2018]. Female fish are swimming to the top of the tank when food is present and, therefore, more quickly noticing each other. The fact that they see each other does not mean that they experience aggressive behaviors. Females have no need to express aggressions because their reproductive outcome is not affected by the presence of another female [MacLaren: 2018]. 
According to a study on male to male displays in Siamese fighting fish, the aggressive behavior of male Betta fish is indicative of a large trend in species today.  Organisms react with each other by taking on signaling behaviors that affect intra-sexual communication [Matos: 2002]. This ultimately explains how natural selection selects on certain behaviors and how sexual selection is a powerful behavioral determinant. Because Betta splenden are a common aquarium fish, this experiment can be used to aid breeders in the future by giving them insights into Betta fish intraspecific behaviors related to mating.
