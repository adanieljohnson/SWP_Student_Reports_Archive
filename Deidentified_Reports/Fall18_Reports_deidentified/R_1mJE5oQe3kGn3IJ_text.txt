Title: The Effect of Household Vinegar on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
Household vinegar might provide an effective means for photosynthetic activity. The effects on photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves of no inhibitors, vinegar, and an inhibitor, DCMU, were compared by measuring the absorbance at 600nm every ten minutes for thirty minutes. It is hypothesized that household vinegar will decrease photosynthetic activity, but not as much as DCMU. At the conclusion of the experiment, the DCMU showed the least photosynthetic activity and the no inhibitor group showed the most photosynthetic activity. Photosynthesis still occurred when treated with household vinegar, but photosynthetic activity was halted a little bit since the no inhibitor group had a percent change in absorbance that was higher by eight percent. The one-tailed t-test values were 0.00012, 0.03602, and 0.00407, which proved that the data had a statistical significance. Based on this, the null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted.


Introduction:
Plants, some protists, and bacteria use photosynthesis as a way to capture and to store energy. In this particular process, energy comes from the sun in the form of light. This energy from the sun then excites an electron. The excited electron moves through a transport chain and generates a proton gradient and the formation of NADPH, which both power ATP synthesis. [Whittingham: 1964] ATP is used as energy for work in a system. There are two parts to photosynthesis: light-dependent reaction, which is mentioned above, and a light-independent reaction. [Whittingham: 1964] The following experiment takes place in light-dependent reaction. It is interesting to determine what factors have effects on photosynthesis and how photosynthetic activity can be controlled. It is already accepted that various environmental factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants such as air pressure, humidity, and light intensity. [Bitterlich: 2018] In this experiment, we focus on the effect of household vinegar (5% acetic acid) compared to a known photosynthetic inhibitor, DCMU. [Kelsey: 2016] Photosynthetic inhibitors are so good at inhibiting photosynthesis since they block electron flow in Photosystem II. Photosynthetic inhibitors, such as DCMU, block electron flow by binding to the D1 protein. [Hess: 2000] DCIP is also used in the experiment as a color indicator to know that photosynthesis occurs. [Horwitz: 2000] The independent variable is the vinegar, and the dependent variable is percent change in absorbance. It is hypothesized that the vinegar has an effect on photosynthesis as its mechanism of weed killing and may be just as effective as DCMU. In an experiment performed by Evans and Bellinder, they found that the use of vinegar decreased onion yields. [Evans and Bellinder: 2009] However, it is hypothesized that the vinegar will not be as effective as DCMU.


Materials and Methods:
A mortar and pestle, a medium beaker, and three 50mL centrifugation tubes were cooled in ice. Veins were removed from four spinach leaves. The leaves were grinded using the mortar and pestle in 10mL of grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0). Once a paste, 10mL more of grinding buffer were added. The resulting paste was strained using cheesecloth. The paste was spun in a centrifuge for ten minutes at 200G and 1200rpm, and the supernatant was transferred. The paste was then centrifuged again for five minutes at 200G and 1200rpm. Ten test tubes were prepared. The first test tube was the blank. It contained 8mL of distilled water and 2mL of reaction buffer. Test tubes 2-4 (control) had 6mL distilled water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, and 2mL reaction buffer. Test tubes 5-7 (vinegar) contained 5mL distilled water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer, and 1mL vinegar. Finally, test tubes 8-10 (DCMU) had 5mL distilled water, 2mL 130mM DCIP, 2mL reaction buffer, and 1mL DCMU. 100microliters of chloroplasts were added to each test tube from the second supernatant. The absorbance was then taken for each test tube at 600nm every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. The percent changes in absorbance were calculated, and a one-tailed t-test was used to analyze the data further.


Results:
From the results, several conclusions have been drawn. The control group (no inhibitor) showed a steady decline in absorbance. The vinegar group instantly turned light pink when it was added. This could be due to the possibility that the vinegar reacted with the DCIP since DCIP is acid sensitive. This could also explain the low absorbance. The DCMU showed a steady similar absorbance over the 30 minute time period. This makes sense since DCMU is a known photosynthetic inhibitor. The lower the absorbance, the more photosynthesis occurred. The control group showed the most photosynthetic activity and the DCMU group showed the most photosynthetic activity. As shown in figure 1, the control group demonstrated the most photosynthetic activity and the highest percent change in absorbance at 25.795%. The DCMU group showed the least photosynthetic activity and the lowest percent change at -1.192%. The N value of the experiment is three test tubes for each group. If this experiment was conducted with twenty test tubes for each group, there would be even further insight on the effect of household vinegar on photosynthesis. Because the N value was only three, there is a possibility of inaccuracy due to a small sample size. More test tubes for each group would lead to more accurate results. But, the results are expected to be similar. The one-tailed t-test values were 0.00012, 0.03603, and 0.00407. These p-values are used to reject the null hypothesis of the experiment, and mention that the data is statistically significant. Furthermore, the alternative hypothesis is accepted.


Discussion:
The results of the experiment provide insight on the effect of household vinegar on photosynthesis. Even though there was a statistical significance, it may not be plausible since the vinegar may have reacted with the DCIP. In a past experiment, vinegar has been used for weed control. [Evans and Bellinder: 2009] After this experiment, vinegar has been proven to be useful in controlling and in regulating photosynthesis. In an experiment performed by Chen J of Tongji University, he performed an experiment to see if vinegar affects photosynthesis and the growth of lettuce. He found that vinegar affected the rate of photosynthesis, but the lettuce eventually grew the same amount as the control group. This provides more insight into how vinegar may not only decrease photosynthesis, but also it may affect the rate as well. [Chen: 2016].  In the future, a more thorough plan will be introduced; in addition, less errors will be made. Before conducting the experiment, a note was not made about the possibility of the vinegar and DCIP reacting. Also, the first time the experiment was performed, grinding buffer was used instead of reaction buffer. In the second time through the experiment, this change was made. Overall, the work in the lab was successful. There was a clear difference in percent change in absorbance among all three groups. Household vinegar proved to decrease photosynthesis slightly. The null hypothesis was rejected and the alternative hypothesis was accepted.

Figure 1. This graph represents the percent change in absorbance at 600nm for each group in the experiment. Based on the data, the control group had the highest percent change, and the DCMU group had the lowest percent change. Standard error bars were also determined. They appear to show no overlap.*************************************************************************
