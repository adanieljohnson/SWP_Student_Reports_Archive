Title: Prolonged Juvenile State due to IGR in Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
Development in Eukaryotic Organisms is purely hormone driven. The release and inhibition of hormones determines the difference between a juvenile and an adult. In this experiment, the organism studied was the Tobacco Hornworm, also known as the Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta is a caterpillar that relies on the release of a hormone, called Juvenile Hormone(JH) in order to develop from the first instar all the way through pupation. In our experiment we were able to separate eight caterpillars into two groups of four: one Control and one Experimental. Over the span of eight days we were able to observe the larva, which spanned from 0.9g to 4.3g in initial weight, and their record reaction to being fed with food that either contained diluted water or an Insect Growth Regulator. The controll group was fed with ten grams of food infused with six drops of diluted water. The experimental group was fed ten grams of food infused with the IGR called Martin’s IGR, which has a dilution of 1: 1250. The two-tailed T-Test did not yield statistical significance due to a p_value lower than 0.05, the p_value of the two-tailed T-test for weight was 0.00652.   


Introduction:
The Manduca sexta is caterpillar that is the focus of this experiment. During this experiment, we were able to identify the Manduca Sexta’s dependence on hormones during development. Manduca sexta caterpillars rely on both Ecdysterone which affects timing of each molt and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which affects the type of molt into which the caterpillar will develop. The Manduca sexta’s dependence on the secretion of both Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone makes it the perfect model organism because their growth, our dependent variable, is directly affected by their ability to secrete these hormones. Our experiment focused on the JH as we used a Insect Growth Regulator called Martin’s IGR. Consumption of Martin’s IGR by the insects is expected to either inhibit or increase the secretion of JH. We observed both an experimental group, which recieved food infused with Martin’s IGR, and a controll group, which received food infused with diluted water, and tried to determine which effect the IGR would have on the Manduca sexta larvae. This biological question becomes important because the effect of the IGR on the JH impacts when and if the Manduca sexta will leave the larval stage and pupate which is an important question especially when considering insecticides.   we hypothesized that when the caterpillars were exposed to Martin’s IGR that they would continue to grow without pupating until they reached death as their body could no longer support the juvenile stage. K.H Hoffman and M.W. Lorenz wrote an article about the advances in using Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs) as insecticides, mentioning that they contain “JH analogs, like natural JH, that can restore… [balance to the] processes that are dependent on the presence of JH, such as the maintenance of Juvenile status” [Hoffman: 1998]. This review mentions a similar concept that was supported by our hypothesis being refuted. The Hoffman Review article discusses how the JH analogs are being used in insecticides and they are prolonging the high levels of JH, which is characteristic of the juvenile larval stage. The high levels of JH forces the pest to maintain its juvenile state until their bodies become so large they can no longer support the juvenile stage and this results in death. However, we hypothesized that the IGR would inhibit JH production and the Manduca sexta larva would have a decreased rate of growth.   


Materials and Method:
The Manduca sexta Caterpillars were stored together in containers and four of similar size were selected and placed in isolated quarters, stored in an incubator at 25 degrees celsius with a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle.  Our experiment was completed by having two groups: one controll group and one experimental group, both composed of four Manduca sexta Caterpillars per group. Each group was fed 10g of food. The Experimental group was fed 10g of food containing 6 drops of Martins IGR, which had a dilution of 1: 1250.  The controll group was fed 10g of food containing 6 drops of diluted water. The larva were only fed again with 10g of food with diluted water or Martin’s IGR, respectively, when they ran out of food. Every day for eight days, each group was weighed, observations were recorded and then they were placed back in the incubator. The statistical tests used was a two sample t_test in order to compare the experimental and the controll groups. The weight of each group was used in order to compare the two groups and to track their development.

Results:
Throughout this experiment, the general trend in weight of the Experimental group was steadily increasing. The general trend in weight change in the Control group was also steadily increasing until around Day 5 when their weights decreased. As shown in Figure 1, throughout the entire span of the experiment, the experimental group had an average of 7.375 +/-1.95 grams. Also shown in Figure 1, throughout the entire span of the experiment, the controll group had an average change in weight of 2.21 +/- 1.62g.  Overall, many of the larva remained a blue and green color except for on Day 2 of Observation when Control group Subject #3 had a faded blue color.  Between days 4 and 7 we started to notice that the Experimental group started to become very swollen. We also observed that by the end of the experiment, the experimental group weighed more than the controll group. The experimental group larva were, on average, 5.165g  larger than the Control group by the end of the experiment. By the eighth day recording their weights, the controll group had one subject that had pupated. The mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group as the p_value was less than 0.05 (t_stat = 4.077, d.f. = 6, P = 0.00652).

Discussion:
Based on the data displayed in Figure 1, the trends of the experimental group and the controll group can be explained through biological statements and our hypothesis can be refuted. The observations and data suggested that the Experimental group, which was fed with Martin’s IGR, were much larger than the Control group and they became more swollen towards the end of the experiment. The experimental group also remained in the juvenile larval stage while the Control group commitment pulsed and pupated on day eight. This can be explained by the fact that the experimental groups exposure to Martin’s IGR had to increase and prolong the secretion of JH in the test subjects as they remained in the larval stage, while the controll group pupated. The fact that the controll group pupated while the Experimental group remained in the larval stage, confirms that the Martin’s IGR prolonged the secretion of JH. On the contrary, our hypothesis was refuted because we predicted that the exposure and consumption of Martin’s IGR would inhibit the secretion of JH hormone and the Manduca sexta larva would pupate faster than the controll group. While our hypothesis was refuted, the review of IGR’s being used in insecticides by Hoffman, support our evidence as Hoffman described how JH analogs are being used in insecticides and how the JH analogs have the same functions as typical Juvenile Hormone [Hoffman 1998]. When exposed to these JH analogs, the insects experience prolonged and constant levels of JH which forces them to remain in the Juvenile stage as the elevated and prolonged JH hormone levels prevent them from commitment pulsing for pupation. Similarly, Martin’s IGR clearly has the ability to increase and prolong the secretion of JH hormone in insects which will prevent the insects from maturing past the larval stage. This result is important in the world because the effect of the IGR has the ability to completely stop the insects from commitment pulsing, thus stopping them from maturing into adults, which can reproduce.
