Title: Frog Legs Injected with Calcium Inhibitor Display No Significant Change in Sciatic Response to Stimuli

Abstract:
Calcium plays an important role in neuromuscular response, so we decided to test the effect of calcium inhibitor on the sciatic response of frog legs. We hypothesized that the inhibitor would cause a change in sciatic response. We tested three frog legs, and each one acted as its own control. We tested each leg at 0, 0.25, 0.75. and 1.0 volts, and then repeated this same test after injecting the leg with calcium inhibitor and waiting eight minutes for its effect to set in. All other settings on the force transducer were kept constant. The results were analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test. We specifically focused on the data that came from stimulus at 0.75 volts. There was not a statistically significant difference between groups. Overall, studies on muscular function, such as this one, can benefit the medical field, especially in regard to understanding how the body works and solving related health issues.

Introduction:
The neuromuscular system allows organisms to sense and respond to stimuli in their environment [Johnson: 2018]. The test subject is the gastrocnemius muscle and sciatic nerve of a frog leg. This is a good model, because it is already dead, it is inexpensive, and having access to the muscle and the nerve allows us to test both muscular and neural response. Myograms graphically represent muscular contractions in three phases: latent, contraction, and relaxation [Johnson: 2018]. Force transducers connected to muscles help translate muscle movement into an electric signal in order to collect this data [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium initiates contraction by activating the enzyme myosin light chain kinase, which catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to myosin. [Adelstein: 1979]. Phosphorylated myosin interacts with actin to cause muscle contraction [Adelstein: 1979]. Due to this, if calcium is inhibited, we predict that the neural response will change. Experiments like this one are important, because muscular function essentially operates the same way in most organisms, so the findings can be applied to other animals. Seeing how normal muscles function can also help doctors recognize when something is not right, and hopefully lead them to find a cure or solution.

Materials and Methods:
To begin, we prepared a frog leg by peeling off the outer layer of skin and isolating the sciatic nerve. We tied a string around it, and then attached it to the force transducer. After connecting the force transducer to the leg and opening the software on a laptop, we put the settings at 1 pulse, 5 milliseconds, and one Hz. We tested the response of the sciatic nerve to direct stimulus at 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 volts. Next, we injected the leg with 0.2 milliliters of calcium receptor inhibitor. We waited for eight minutes while the calcium inhibitor set in. We slacked the leg down a bit to get the same tone as before. After that, we tested the response of the sciatic nerve to direct stimulus at 0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 volts. We then repeated the previous steps with the other two frog legs. Last, we used a two-tailed paired t-test to analyze the results.

Results:
After injecting the inhibitor, the first two legs got much larger and more bloated. However, after we injected the third leg with the inhibitor, it did not look as bloated as the other two. For the first two legs, sciatic response was lower after injection of the calcium inhibitor. For the third leg, sciatic response was higher after injection of the calcium inhibitor. When making our graph, we chose to compare how each leg responded to direct stimulus of the sciatic nerve at 0.75 volts both before and after calcium inhibition. As shown in Figure 1, there was not a statistically significant difference between the groups. Our two-tailed paired p-value was 0.359.

Discussion:
The sciatic response did not change after the addition of calcium inhibitor, meaning the results were not significant, and our hypothesis was not supported. It is possible that the inhibitor was not absorbed properly into the third leg, because it did not look as bloated as the other two after injection, and it is the third leg that responded differently. We may not have waited long enough for the inhibitor to set in, or the needle may have gone straight through the leg and out to the other side, meaning the inhibitor did not get absorbed, which would have skewed the results. A similar study found that the amount of calcium needed to initiate contraction is somewhere between one third of a micrometer and one and a half micrometers [Portzehl: 1964]. Therefore, if the calcium inhibitor did not work properly or if we did not wait for a sufficient amount of time, enough calcium may have remained to cause contraction. Also, muscle movement is a complex process, so if we did not set up each leg in the exact same position, muscle shortening and lengthening could have been altered. If we were to repeat the same experiment again, we should be more patient and precise to minimize and hopefully eliminate errors. To add, it would also be interesting to test how injecting sodium or potassium ions into the leg impacts sciatic nerve and muscular response. Experiments like this one are important, because the findings can be applied to a variety of organisms, and they may help doctors find solutions to neuromuscular problems.

For the experimental portion, each leg was injected with 0.2 milliliters of calcium receptor inhibitor. The blue line represents the control group, and the orange line represents the experimental group. Each data point is the response of the leg to direct stimulus of the sciatic nerve at 0.75 volts. *************************************************************************
