Title: The Effects of Insect Growth Regulator on Weight of Manduca sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
Manduca sexta caterpillars are excellent model organisms for the study of endocrine function. Studying Manduca sexta has taught us much of what we know about endocrine function in many different species, including humans. We examined the effects of insect growth regulator on Manduca sexta caterpillars by adding IGR to food samples. Caterpillars who received experimental food infused with IGR were expected to gain more weight than those who received controll food prepared with water. After fourteen days of monitoring, there was statistically significent evidence to suggest a difference between caterpillars who were given controll food and those who were given experimental food. These findings suggest that exposing Manduca sexta to IGR in their larval stages inhibits normal growth and development by preventing maturation to adulthood, an important step in non-toxic pest controll.


Introduction:
Manduca sexta, referred to as the tobacco hornworm, has been extensively studied as a model organism. A member of the Order Lepidoptera, Manduca sexta is closely related to other moths, butterflies, and skippers. The species has a short lifespan of approximately 40 days, which makes it easily reared and monitored in a lab setting. Numerous studies have investigated the species, often with a focus on hormone regulation. Hormones controll growth and development in Manduca sexta, providing an excellent example of endocrine function in insects. Juvenile hormone (JH) is secreted by two glands in the corpus allata [Johnson: 2018]. JH is responsible for controllling type of molt in insect development, while ecdysterone controlls timing of molt [Johnson: 2018]. The two hormones must work together to controll insect development. Manduca sexta undergoes five instars, or stages of growth. At the end of the fifth instar, the larva becomes a pupa, from which it pupates into an adult moth. Many natural and synthetic compounds are capable of altering this cycle of growth and development in insects [Garriga: 2011]. 

The experiment described here altered JH levels of Manduca Sexta by introducing an insect growth regulator (IGR). As opposed to traditional pesticides, IGRs do not have to be toxic [Johnson: 2018]. Instead, IGRs alter development of insects by inhibiting normal growth functions associated with JH and ecdysterone. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether adding a synthetic IGR to insect food will result in a failure to achieve adulthood.  Food (with or without IGR) was the independent variable that we manipulated to determine any effect of the dependent variable of weight. Consuming IGR should cause caterpillars to eat more in preparation for a molt. We hypothesize that if weight gain is related to exposure to IGR, then the caterpillars exposed to IGR will weigh more than those not exposed to IGR.


Materials and Method:
Two groups of Manduca sexta were formed, each consisting of four caterpillars. An electronic balance was used to measure 10 grams of food for each caterpillar. Food was prepared for the controll group using 5 drops of water from a disposable pipette. Each specimen in the experimental group received 10 mg of food prepared with 5 drops of an IGR. Food was mixed thoroughly with a clean spoon to ensure the hormone was properly distributed throughout the serving. The caterpillars were stored in plastic containers, separate from each other, and were incubated for two weeks. Caterpillars were weighed each day, and observations were made about their appearance. The plastic cubicles were cleaned regularly to remove waste and ensure caterpillars were given ample room to mature. New food was prepared as necessary, when it became dry. Observations were maintained in an online spreadsheet. A one-tailed two sample t_test was used to determine any statistical difference in weights of caterpillars as a result of being exposed to an IGR.  

Results:
The mean weight gain of Manduca sexta in the controll group over a period of 14 days was 6.3975 grams (Fig. 1). The mean weight gain of those in the experimental group was 13.7775 grams (Fig. 1). The standard deviation of weight gain in controll caterpillars was 4.2663 (Fig.1). The standard deviation of weight gain in experimental caterpillars was 1.27078 (Fig. 1). A one-tailed two sample t_test was used to analyze results. A one-tailed p_value of 0.0080 was obtained. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that caterpillars who consumed an insect growth regulator would gain more weight than those who did not consume an IGR, was supported. The mean weight gain of the experimental group was statistically significently different from the mean weight gain of the controll group, pointing to a connection between IGR exposure and caterpillar weight.  Previous studies have also explored a delay in pupation and weight gain as a result of insect exposure to an IGR [Nasr: 2010]. Thought the particular study cited here involved research done on Spodoptera littoralis, the same concepts of larval stages and IGR effect on development were discussed as those we applied to Manduca sexta.  It is important to note that caterpillar #3 in the controll group died early on in the experiment, so its change in weight was recorded as zero for the entirety of the two week experiment. 

The meaning behind our results is important in understanding insect growth and development. Exposure to an IGR interrupted normal development stages of Manduca sexta larva. Instead of transitioning from a 5th instar larva to a pupa, the experimental caterpillars remained in the larva stage. The IGR led to weight gain in the experimental caterpillars by mimicking JH, so that the larva continued to feed in preparation for a molt that would never come. On the final day of the study, the three controll caterpillars had begun pupation becoming dark brown in color, while the experimental caterpillars remained bright blue. Thus, we concluded that ingestion of IGR led to a lack of pupation in experimental caterpillars. 

This research can be used in the future to change the way we use pesticides. Many current pesticides method involve spraying harmful chemicals on crops. The toxicity of pesticides has been linked to harmful effects when ingested, including respiratory complications and cancer. Future research using concepts similar to those outlined in this experiment could change the way we protect crops and people. Hormonal pesticides can be used to prevent insects from molting into adult pests, which will reduce a need for toxic pesticides to be sprayed on crops. This reduction of pesticides could lead to numerous health benefits.
