Title: The Effects of Nitrogen on the Root:Shoot Ratio of Field Peas

Abstract:
	Nitrogen is used by plants to regulate photosynthesis as nitrogen is a key component in plant proteins, including DNA and RNA. Excess nitrogen can cause flimsy cells walls in plants that will lead to them being large but not very strong. This experiment compared plants being treated with excess nitrogen against a controll group and then the root:shoot ratios of these plants were measured to determine whether or not excess nitrogen affected the plants in a negative way. While only the lengths of the plants were affected significently, excess nitrogen does influence how the plants grew because those treated with nitrogen had a lower root:shoot ratio than those that were not. 

Introduction:
All plants use nitrogen to grow. Nitrogen is a key component of chlorophyll which is used in photosynthesis to keep the plant alive and growing. Nitrogen is also the basic element of both animal and plant proteins, making up large portions of both DNA and RNA, as well as being used during periods of rapid growth in the organism. Plants can absorb nitrogen through their roots by taking in nitrate molecules and ammonium ions from the soil and the water in the soil, either from rainfall or an underground water source. The field pea (Pisum sativun) is one of the oldest domesticated crops in the world, having been cultivated for at least 7000 years. They are grown as food for both humans and livestock, as well as being green manure for pastures. They are easy to grow like their relative the garden pea, or just peas as they are usually known. They have a simple shallow root system but it is well branched for increased nutrient intake. Depending on the particular needs of an organism, in this case the field pea, it can allocate energy and resources to fulfill those particular needs. Extra nitrogen in the soil can cause plants to grow rapidly, but not strong. Their cell walls will be weaker even though they are bigger. Field pea plants when exposed to nitrogen heavy water/soil will have lower root:shoot ratios than those with regular levels of nitrogen because the nitrogen is negatively affecting the growth rate of the plants.

Materials and Method:
Field pea plants were planted in six growing pots with around 15 seeds per pot. Three pots are controll and three pots are experimental. For 14 days, each controll pot was watered with untreated water and each experimental pot was watered with water enhanced with high levels of nitrogen. After 14 days, four plants from each pot, for a total of twenty four plants (12 controll, 12 experimental), were selected to be measured. They were cut between the root and the shoot and were measured for both length and weight. 

Results:
The length root:shoot ratios were statistically significent after running a two tailed T-test (t_stat= 0.000184, d.f.=22, P=4.486789). The weight root:shoot ratios were not statistically significent after running the two tailed T-test (t_stat= 0.34176, d.f.=22, P=0.971797). The roots in the experimental group were generally shorter than those in the controll while the shoots were around the same length.

Discussion:
After being treated for two weeks, minus three days accounting for Hurricane Florence and her effects, the root:shoot ratios of the experimental group were smaller than those of the controll group, although not by as much as expected. If the plants had been treated for a full fourteen day period with no interruptions, the root:shoot ratios would be even more noticeably different. The plants treated with nitrogen were less robust in their coloration and texture than those in the controll group. This is accounted for because excess nitrogen effects the cell walls structure of the plants causing them to be flimsy instead of strong like a regular plant. The roots of the plants are also compromised, as too much nitrogen in the soil will divert energy allocation to shoot growth and causes the plants to have a weak root system. [Liu 2014] This experiment serves as a small sample size of what happens to plants with too much nitrogen in the soil. In a natural environment, this excess of nitrogen is usually caused by humans as we are putting in too much nitrogenated fertilizer into the ecosystem for the plants to absorb. This can have an adverse affect on crops around the world, and if we keep up the pace at which we are adding nitrogen to the environment (15 teragrams a year), almost two billion people in developing countries could wind up starving because of the lack of a strong crop yield. [Fields 2004] Our hypothesis, in this instance, was supported as the root:shoot ratios of nitrogen enriched plants were lower than those of plants with normal nitrogen intakes.
