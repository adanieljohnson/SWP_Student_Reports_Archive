Title: Impact of Adding High-Sodium Ringer’s Solution to the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The objective of this experiment is to test the outcome of adding high-sodium Ringer’s Solution to the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens species, to see if it would affect the rate of muscle contraction. By testing this experiment, the outcome could show possible ways to increase rates of muscular contraction in muscles of multiple animals. Our group hypothesized that adding ringer’s solution the muscle would increase the amplitude rate of muscle contractions, as sodium helps produce action potentials in the muscle. This was accomplished by using 3 frog legs and testing them before and after adding sodium. They were tested by measuring the amplitude of the contractions with a stimulation that steadily increased after multiple trials. The results did not support our initial hypothesis, with instead the overall amplitude of the legs after adding sodium being lower or higher than the control, providing no cohesive pattern. However, it was discovered that at the highest level of stimulation (5 volts), the legs with sodium had a consistently lower amplitude rate than the control. The importance behind these results show that added sodium could potentially decrease amplitude because of strengthened periods of depolarization in the muscle fibers. 

Introduction:
Muscular functions are critical components to the survival of all animals. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, skeletal muscles are bound together with tissue to form functioning groups throughout an animal. Specifically, muscles are impacted by neuromuscular junctions, which is where the nervous and muscular systems work together to properly create movement and contractions. These contractions are caused by action potentials, the result of a very specific process. The mechanism begins when a nerve impulse arrives at the neuromuscular junction, which triggers the release of acetylcholine (ACh) [Johnson: 2016]. ACh then binds with receptors on the membrane of muscle fibers, which opens sodium channels that produce the action potential in the muscle fibers. The action potential moves throughout the fibers and causes the release of calcium, eventually triggering the contraction [Squire: 2016]. 
To study the process of contraction, the Rana pipiens species is used, a common frog known for being utilized in laboratory studies. Using their gastrocnemius muscle to study amplitude of contractions, it is reasonable to test the outcomes of adding sodium to muscle and seeing the results. By measuring amplitude at multiple voltage levels and noting the threshold, it is possible to see if adding sodium will have an effect on the rate of muscle contractions. If the gastrocnemius muscle in Rana pipiens are injected with high-sodium ringer’s solution, we hypothesize that the amplitude rate of the muscular contractions will increase due to the strengthening and increased number of action potentials.


Materials and Methods:
To carry out the experiment, the first step was to gather the necessary materials required to complete the lab. This involved collecting 3 different frog legs in a dissecting pan, and prepping them to stimulate the gastrocnemius muscle, which involves the removal of the skin from the first leg. After the skin was removed, the next step was to prep it for pulse stimulation by connecting part of it to a force transducer with string and holding the other parts of the leg on the pan with pins. The electric probe is now inserted into the muscle, and trials of amplitude are started. The trials were recorded by a downloadable software that shows amplitude levels. This process was recorded by trials starting with 0 to 5 V (volts). The leg was first tested without the ringer’s solution as a control, and then injected with the solution by needle, with the trial process being repeated. However, before beginning the trials with the injection, an allowance of one minute was given for the solution to fully be absorbed in the muscle. This entire process was repeated for the second and third frog legs, to collect multiple sources of data. The data throughout the process was recorded in each partner’s lab notebook. Along with measuring amplitude, the threshold was also recorded for analytical purposes. To see if the data is statistically significant, after the lab the data was placed into a paired t-test to analyze the results. 

Results:
After completing the trials of the three frog legs, the data consistent enough through all trials to develop an interpretation and result was the last round for each leg, which was the highest level of stimulation. The average amplitude level of the control group was 1.52633 millivolts (mV), and the experimental was 1.415667 (figure 1). After running a paired t-test, the data was shown to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 0.0108. The t-value is 4.498, and the degrees of freedom is 4.  

Discussion:
After collecting data and reviewing the results, multiple different patterns were found, as the data from each individual frog varied from one another. Overall, the data did not support our original hypothesis, as the amplitude did not steadily increase with the addition of sodium in the muscle. This was most likely due to the fact that sodium could have instead further depolarized the cells instead of strengthening the action potentials that would occur [Ebashi: 1969]. However, it was discovered that at maximum voltage levels, the leg after added sodium had consistently lower amplitude levels compared to the control readings. This pattern shows that the opposite effect of what we expected occurred. Adding sodium eventually caused lower amounts of amplitude with the highest levels of stimulation, which additionally supports the idea that further depolarization occurred instead of strengthened action potentials. Lower levels of voltage did not support any substantial patterns, nor did the threshold levels of each frog leg. Our data was proven to be statistically significant with a p-value of 0.0108, supporting the idea that added sodium decreases amplitude levels at high stimulation. 
Similar research on muscle contractions in humans has also been conducted, determining the method to get the highest rate of amplitude, like in our experiment. While not adding extra conditions like added sodium, the study found that the faster the voluntary speed, the higher amplitude and contraction rates. This relates to our study because it found that the highest amplitude simply comes from a “control” muscle, without any added substance [Freund: 1978]. Overall, the purpose of this experiment was to see the overall function and importance of muscle contraction in animals, and to see the effects of adding sodium to the process. By completing the experiment with frogs, it is possible to compare the results to other animals and infer similar outcomes would occur. It is also important to study muscle contraction to see how it directly affects to overall movement.
