Title: Effects of Calcium on the Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
In this experiment, frog legs were injected with .1Ml of calcium to see its effects on muscle contraction. We believed if the amount of calcium present increased, then the force of the muscle contraction would increase. This experiment was performed by having three frog legs, each serving as its own controll and experimental test. Each leg was tested without calcium first, and then injected with .1Ml of calcium. Our data showed significance, but our hypothesis was rejected. Further studies should be done to test the effects of calcium on the force of muscle contractions. 

Introduction:
Muscles are important for helping animals move. One important muscle that helps animals to walk and jump among many things is the gastrocnemus, or the calf muscle. In controll of these movements is a complex series of events that take place in a certain order. Axons of motor neurons extend into a muscle, from a nerve, then branch out to innervate several individual myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions [Johnson: 2018]. Neurons carry signals from a specific location to a specific location, and here that location is the muscle. Nerve impulses release acetylcholine, which binds to its receptors and causes sodium channels to open [Johnson: 2018]. After sodium channels open and the signal continues down the axon, calcium is released causing the muscle to contract [Johnson: 2018]. The main ions involved in this action potential are sodium and calcium, with calcium having an impact on the contraction of the muscle. The frog legs were used as the model organism in this experiment because they are cheap and also easy to perform experiments on due to their small size and can teach scientists about the muscular system and how it reacts to stimuli. This experiment changes the amount of ions available to the frog leg. If the amount of calcium present increases, then the force of muscle contraction will increase. 

Materials and Method:
This experiment was performed by obtaining three frog legs. Each frog leg was skinned to expose the gastrocnemus muscle. Once this was done, the thigh muscles were separated to expose the sciatic nerve, which was all sprayed with ringer solution to keep the leg from drying out. The gastrocnemus would be partly cut off from the leg so that it could hang from a hook to be connected to a stimulator. The sciatic nerve was placed across the stimulator and exposed to amps of electricity from 0.1 to 0.5 amps and then 1 through 5 amps to see the force of contraction. After this, the leg was injected with .1 Ml of calcium, and exposed to the same amps of electricity. The other two legs had the same process done to them after the first one was completed. Results of the strength of contractions were recorded for each frog leg. A paired t_test was performed to compare the mean change in force of contraction between the three frog legs before and after injected with calcium. 

Results:
The mean average change in force of contraction between all three frog legs was -0.099 volts (Figure 1). The standard deviation for the controll frog legs was 0.0578 and experimental frog legs standard deviation was 0.0621 (Figure 1). The p_value for this experiment was 0.001222 which is less than 0.05, meaning the results did not occur by chance. The frog legs that had not been injected with calcium yet showed a much greater response to the amplitudes being applied to them, and this could be seen by watching the experiment take place. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that if the amount of calcium increases, then the force of the muscle contraction will increase was not supported by the data. However, the p_value for this paired t_test was significent, meaning the results did not occur by chance. These results are a little surprising as calcium triggers contraction by reaction with regulatory proteins that in the absence of calcium prevent interaction of actin and myosin [Szent-Györgyi: 1975]. The results that were recorded do not make sense because calcium is one of the ions that is in controll of the binding of two proteins actin and myosin, which together help muscles to contract. Without calcium, these proteins will not interact, and a muscle will not contract. Due to this, because calcium was injected into the gastrocnemus, the muscles should have had a greater force of contraction than without the calcium injected. Even though the p_value showed significance, what is known about calcium is enough to cause speculation and that the experiment should be done again in a better way. Even though the hypothesis did not support our thinking, many things could have led to this. One reason could be that the frog legs did not have proper rest between application of amplitudes or that they became worn down as the experiment went on. Another reason could be that the calcium was not allowed enough time to cross the cell membranes, and thus was not able to allow a stronger contraction to happen. This experiment is important because it can help further the knowledge of the skeletal muscle system and how calcium plays a role in this system so that scientists understand this system to create drugs or solutions for when something goes wrong.
