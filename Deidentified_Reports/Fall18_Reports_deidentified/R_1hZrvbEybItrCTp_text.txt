Title: Effects of 2% Sevin Solution on the Muscular Twitch Threshold of a Southern Leopard Frog Gastrocnemius Muscle

Abstract:
In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle of the Southern Leopard Frog was degloved, suspended, and stimulated directly in order to determine the muscle twitch threshold, the minimum voltage required to trigger muscular contraction, of the leg normally and then after an acetylcholine blocker was administered. Acetylcholine is the driving force in muscle contraction therefore the group predicted that if the blocker was administered, the twitch threshold would be much higher than it was without the blocker. The group prepared the leg, tested the threshold of the muscle before a blocker was administered then used a syringe to place approximately 0.1Ml of a 2% sevin solution to the muscle. The new threshold was measured and recorded. This was repeated with three separate legs. The thresholds did increase but after running a one-tailed paired t_test, it was found that the change was not significent enough to support the hypothesis. This could be due to a variety of errors encountered during the actual experiment. In a broader sense, researchers are using direct stimulation of muscles to study muscular excitability and tailor treatments to those suffering from paralysis. 

Introduction:
The gastrocnemus muscle, also known as the calf muscle, and the sciatic nerve, the main nerve that controlls contraction in the gastrocnemus, in the leg allow the animal to receive, send, and react to stimuli, causing the leg to move [Burke: 1973]. In this case, the stimuli would cause the frog (Southern Leopard Frog, Lithobatis sphenocephalus) to jump. Because there is both a muscle and a nerve being stimulated, two different communications are used. Muscles are made of myofibers, multi-cellular, cylindrical cells that are bound together by connective tissue [Burke: 1973]. Because they are bound together, muscle cells work together when contracting in an all-or-none reaction to a stimulus [Burke: 1973]. In order to cause a reaction in the gastrocnemus, direct stimulation must be used. 
When stimulating the sciatic nerve, stimulation of the motor neuron is used. Motor neurons communicate via the spinal cord and send signals to the muscles using neuro-muscular junctions [Seltzer, 1990]. At these junctions, acetylcholine (ACh) is released, binding to its receptors and causing a chain reaction that generates an action potential and fires it, leading to muscle movement [Seltzer, 1990]. The amount of ACh produced within the muscle determines the “twitch threshold” of an individual’s muscle [Silverthorn, 2013]. This threshold is the smallest amount of stimulation required to make the muscle contract, as monitored by myographs. If an ACh blocker is administered, the amount of simulation needed to cause a twitch and establish the twitch threshold increases [Silverthorn, 2013].
The hypothesis for this experiment is, “If we administer 1Ml of ACh blocker (2% sevin solution) into the gastrocnemus of a frog and stimulate it directly, then the twitch threshold will be higher”. 


Materials and Method:
Following the instructions online, prepare the frog leg by degloving it and suspending the gastrocnemus muscle. In order to use direct stimulation, the probe must be inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle but not all the way through. Once the leg is prepared and the probe is hooked up to the computer program, you can begin testing. Starting with 0V, increase the amount of voltage used to stimulate the muscle in .1V intervals to find the lowest voltage needed to trigger a muscular contractions (twitch threshold). Record the threshold then prepare a syringe with 0.1 Ml of the 2% sevin solution. Carefully administer the solution, making sure to insert the syringe in different places within the muscle to ensure an even distribution. Repeat the threshold testing, starting with 0V and increasing voltage by 0.1V until the lowest voltage needed to trigger a muscle contraction is found. Repeat this process with three frog legs total. The statistical test used is a paired t_test.

Results:
Every leg tested had a different threshold before and after the treatment was administered, as seen in figure 1. Because each leg was both a controll and a treatment, a one-tailed paired t_test was run. From this, a p_value of 0.100 was calculated. This signifies that while there was an increase in the thresholds, it was not significent enough to be attributed to the sevin solution alone. 

Discussion:
The administration of the ACh blocker (2% sevin solution) clearly altered the twitch threshold in the frog legs, as seen in Figure 1. Yet, the threshold increase is not significent and the alternative hypothesis is not supported. This is not to say that sevin did not increase the threshold, just that it did not have the largest influence and that the experiment may not have been run completely correctly. Therefore, we must look for other causes of an elevated twitch threshold. This can be attributed to many things but the most probable cause is muscular fatigue. With continuous testing, the muscle uses up the ATP stored within it and cannot make more because the animal is dead. Because the ATP is being burned by semi-continuous twitch threshold testing, the results would be skewed. 
When looking closely at Figure 1, leg 2 and 3 have similar increases in the twitch threshold and leg 1 has a much higher threshold after the blocker was administered. This discrepancy could signify many things. It could be due to the fact that each frog leg is unique and would have their own individual thresholds, therefore react differently to the blocker. Because leg 2 and 3 have similar increases, this could also mean that when the experiment was performed on leg 1, something could have gone wrong. The most likely thing that could have caused this was the fact that the group elected to add a bit more sevin to leg 1 when we noticed that, while administering it, some solution leaked out of the muscle. 
Using the data from this experiment, you could easily run it again and modify a few things in order to minimize the fatigue in the muscle itself and get significent data. Every frog leg is unique and has a different twitch threshold but by studying the controll and treatment thresholds, a starting point for the threshold testing can be determined which would greatly decrease the chance of fatiguing the muscle too early in the experiment. Furthermore, you could administer more of the sevin solution, blocking more of the ATP within the muscle and forcing the muscle to need a larger stimulus to contract. 
With this being said, scientists have run various experiments that use direct muscle stimulation. While they don’t test muscle twitch threshold directly, the direct stimulation method was used by Dr. Mark Rich and his colleagues to study the muscular excitability of quadriplegics [Rich: 1998]. Here, they compared excitability of muscles with direct and nerve stimulation. Through this study, the researches found that by using direct stimulation, they could measure the excitability of quadriplegic muscles and use that to tailor new treatments to them [Rich: 1998]. Their findings also supported the idea that direct muscle stimulation could help patients who are comatose or critically ill patients [Rich: 1998].  Dr. Rich and his colleagues’ finding have helped doctors and therapists since then find new and more effective treatments for patients like those they studied.

Each leg was its own controll and treatment group, with the thresholds measured through direct stimulation of the muscle in 0.1V increments until the threshold was determined.*************************************************************************
