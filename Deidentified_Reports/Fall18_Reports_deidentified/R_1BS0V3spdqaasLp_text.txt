Title: Aggressive Response in Betta Splendins to External Stimuli

Abstract:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection. In this lab, the aggressiveness of Betta splendins in response to the stimuli of a plastic betta was observed. This plastic betta displayed aggressive behaviors of It was hypothesized that blue fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in response to a stimuli than the other. Six Betta splendins were procured, three red ones and three blue ones. A tank filled with water was separated into three sections: on one side there was a red betta, in the middle was a red and blue plastic betta to serve as a stimuli, and on the third section there was a blue betta. Each broadside and facing movement was assigned a score from 1-3 based on level of aggression, pelvic fin flicking and erect pectoral fins were = 1, tail beating and spreading of opercula were = 2, and tail thrashing and display of branchiostegal membrane were = 3. It was found that differences in aggression between blue and red betta were not significently different (t_stat = 0.983, d.f. = 24, p_value = 0.168), therefore our hypothesis was not supported.


Introduction:
Ethology is the study of animal behavior and seeks to understand the physiological purpose for behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, Betta splendins was the organism observed. Bettas express colorful displays in the presence of other members of their species, called intraspecific behaviors, and are separated into two main types of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements include pelvic fin flicking, tail beating, and tail thrashing, in level of increasing aggressiveness. Erect pectoral fins, spreading of opercula, and protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane comprise facing movements, in order of increasing aggressiveness. In response to these movements, observing bettas may ignore them, flee, behave in a way to show submission, or escalate by showing another movement, whereupon the first betta must decide to perform one of the aforementioned behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, we tested two colors of betta, red and blue, to see if there were a difference in response to a stimulus. Betta fish come in a variety of colors and the presence of melanophores allows the enhancement and purity of color shown during aggressive interactions [Amiri: 2012]. We hypothesized that blue colored fish would exhibit more aggressive behavior in response to a stimulus than the other.


Materials and Method:
Six Betta splendins were procured, three red ones and three blue ones. A tank filled with water was separated into three sections: on one side there was a red betta, in the middle was a red and blue plastic betta to serve as a stimuli, and on the third section there was a blue betta. Each broadside and facing movement was assigned a score from 1-3 based on level of aggression, pelvic fin flicking and erect pectoral fins were = 1, tail beating and spreading of opercula were = 2, and tail thrashing and display of branchiostegal membrane were = 3. Each individual fish was tested during a 5 minute period for displays of aggression two times, with 5 minutes of rest in between each trial. A total of 12 trials were run, two for each fish. During the resting period for one color fish, the test was run for the different color fish on the opposite side of the tank. During each test, the level of aggression and the number of times this behavior was displayed was recorded. After all tests were run, the trial for each fish that evoked the highest level of aggressiveness was counted, leaving 6 trials to be analyzed using Microsoft excel. Data was analyzed using an unpaired, two-sample t_test.


Results:
After we performed the unpaired, two-sample t_test, it was found that the value was found to be not significent (t_stat = 0.983, d.f. = 24, p_value = 0.168). From Figure 1 it can be seen that the red betta group had a wider range of aggression values than the blue betta. This suggests that the red betta fish is more aggressive than the blue betta. We observed that our fishes, both red and blue, spent more time swimming around the tank with no aggressive behavior shown.


Discussion:
The results show that the values obtained for differences in aggression between blue and red colored betta were not significent. Our findings were similar to those of a study which observed that bettas, regardless of color, showed no quantitative differences in aggressive reaction to stimuli [Bronstein: 1985]. However, because the value of the t_test was not statistically significent, it is not possible to say that our statistical hypothesis was supported. Therefore, our biological hypothesis was not supported.
