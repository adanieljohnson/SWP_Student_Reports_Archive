Title: Effect of Sunlight on Biomass Allocation Patterns in Mung Bean Plants (Vigna radiata)

Abstract:
Plants learn to adapt to both abiotic and biotic factors in order to survive in their environment. Abiotic and biotic factors can affect energy capture, fitness, and many other aspects of plant life [BioCore Resource Guide, 2018]. In a 2000 study on the effect of nutrient availability on biomass allocation patterns, it was found that natural selection has favored planned allocation strategies, rather than abrupt plastic responses to new environmental conditions [Müller, et al., 2000]. This study will examine sunlight as an abiotic factor influencing allocation patterns in mung beans. Mung beans (Vigna radiata) are plants in the legume family that are commonly used in scientific studies as they are cheap and germinate quickly. The root-to-shoot ratio describes the proportion of the weight or length of a plants roots compared to its shoots. A plant with a higher roots proportion is more fit for obtaining nutrients from the soil, while a plant with a higher shoots proportion can obtain more energy from sunlight [BioCore Resource Guide, 2018].It is hypothesized that plants in shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in sunlight will have a higher proportion of shoots. 

Introduction:
Plants learn to adapt to these factors in order to survive in their environment. Abiotic and biotic factors can affect energy capture, fitness, and many other aspects of plant life [BioCore Resource Guide, 2018]. One example of an abiotic factor is the amount of sunlight a plant is exposed to. Plants have intra- and inter-specific interactions that aim to obtain the necessary amounts of sunlight in order to survive [BioCore Resource Guide, 2018]. In a 2000 study on the effect of nutrient availability on biomass allocation patterns, it was found that natural selection has favored planned allocation strategies, rather than abrupt plastic responses to new environmental conditions [Müller, et al., 2000]. This study will examine the resource allocation patterns of Mung Bean plants when an abiotic factor, sunlight, is introduced. 

Mung beans (Vigna radiata) are plants in the legume family that are commonly used in scientific studies as they are cheap and germinate quickly. The root-to-shoot ratio describes the proportion of the weight or length of a plants roots compared to its shoots. A plant with a higher roots proportion is more fit for obtaining nutrients from the soil, while a plant with a higher shoots proportion can obtain more energy from sunlight [BioCore Resource Guide, 2018]. This study will examine sunlight as an abiotic factor influencing allocation patterns in mung beans. It is hypothesized that plants in shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in sunlight will have a higher proportion of shoots. 


Materials and Methods:
Plants were grown over a period of two weeks in the Wake Forest Greenhouse. Mung bean seeds were soaked in a beaker of water for twenty-four hours prior to being planted. After soaking, the seeds were placed in black planters filled with vermiculite. Each planter was given 50 mL water and 50 mL Miracle Grow. Soil was placed on top of the seeds to cover them and each planter was labeled with the treatment type (sun or shade), group name, date, and TA name.

Two planters were placed in the shade (underneath a screen) and two were placed in sunlight. Plants were given 100 mL water in each planter daily throughout the two-week growth period. After the growth period, plants were harvested by placing the planters in a 1-inch tub of water to soak off the vermiculite and isolate the plants. Plants were then separated and placed onto individual paper towels labeled 1-12 and with “sun” or “shade.” Twelve plants were used to obtain data for each of the two treatment groups (a total of twenty-four plants were used). 

Next, the roots were separated from the shoots using a pair of scissors. Roots and shoots for each plant were weighed separately on a scale and the lengths were recorded in centimeters. Averages and standard deviation values were calculated and a two-sample t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results were then plotted on a bar graph. 


Results:
The results show that plants in the sun have a larger average root: shoot ratio for weight (See Figure 1) than the plants in the shade (t-stat=3.028, df=22, P=0.003). For length, it was also found that the plants in the sun had the higher root: shoot ratio (See Figure 2) compared to the plants in the shade (t-stat=3.609, df=22, P=0.0008). Weights for plants in the sun and shade show that on average, plants in the sun had higher weight values for their shoots. The same pattern was also observed for plants in the shade. Lengths for plants in the sun are generally larger for the roots than the shoots. For plants in the shade, lengths were larger for the shoots than the roots (See Table 1). 

Discussion:
Results show that plants in the sun had a slightly larger average root weight and a slightly smaller average shoot weight than the plants in the shade (See Table 1). Plants in the sun had longer roots than shoots, while plants in the shade had longer shoots than roots. This does not support the hypothesis that plants in the shade will have a higher proportion of roots and plants in the sun will have a higher proportion of shoots. The results fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

While the hypothesis was not supported, the plants in the sun may have had the more roots because they did not need to grow toward the sun since they were already in direct sunlight. The plants in the shade had less sunlight, so they likely grew more shoots in order to reach the sunlight and obtain more energy.
