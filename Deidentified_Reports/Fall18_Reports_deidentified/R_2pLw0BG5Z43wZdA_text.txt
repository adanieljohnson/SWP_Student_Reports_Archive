Title: Effects of Lidocaine on the Sciatic Nerve and Gastrocnemius Muscle In Frogs

Abstract:
In this lab the Na+ channel blocker Lidocaine was injected into Frog Legs to determine the effects of Lidocaine on the sciatic motor neuron as well as the gastrocnemus muscle. If Na+ channels are blocked in a motor neuron no action potential can be fired down the neuron and no signal is sent to the muscle to contract. 3 Frog Legs were evaluated in this lab. The sciatic nerve was electrically stimulated at .3, .5, and 2V before and after the leg was treated with Lidocaine. The data was observed to not be statistically significent and the null hypothesis was not supported(P-Value of.1297 with 2 degrees of freedom). Even though the null hypothesis was not supported the strength of muscle contraction decreased on every leg after treatment with Lidocaine, which was predicted in the experiment. 


Introduction:
Frog legs in this lab are being used as model organisms to determine the effect of the Sodium Channel Blocker Lidocaine and the strength of muscle contraction compared to the same leg treated with no Lidocaine.[Johnson:2018] The reason Lidocaine can effect muscle contractions is because Na+ channels in an axon are necessary for an action potential(AP) to be created in a motor neuron. If no action potential is created then no signal can be sent to the muscle to contract. Lidocaine does not affect the resting potential of the neuron, because this is established with an Na/K pump, but does effect the ability to reach a threshold in a neuron. [Kanai: 1998] in order for an AP to occur the threshold must be reached after a certain amount of Na+ channels open. Our hypothesis is that the muscle contraction strength will decrease in Volts,  because Lidocaine will affect some of the Na+ channels and the AP will not be as strong or the threshold for an AP will not be achieved at all. If no AP is achieved then Acetylcholine is not release into the synaptic cleft and no Calcium is sent out of the endoplasmic reticulum and into the muscle, therefore it cannot contract.[Johnson:2018]


Materials and Method:
3 Frog Legs were evaluated in this experiment after being skinned, and the gastrocnemus muscle was isolated as well as the sciatic nerve. Each leg was tested with .3V, .5V, and 2V through Nerve Stimulation before and after being treated with Lidocaine. Both controll and experimental legs were intermittently treated with Frog Ringer so the muscle is still able to contract. The leg was treated with Lidocaine with a syringe and is dropped on the sciatic nerve and 25 millimolar Lidocaine is injected directly into the gastrocnemus muscle at different places. The muscle was then reacted to check for a response[Johnson:2018]. The data before and after the injection of lidocaine was analyzed with a paired T-test for the data collected at 2V.







Results:
The predicted effect of Lidocaine on muscle contraction occurred with an obvious decrease in Response in Volts. The muscle was also observed to puff up after being treated with Lidocaine but this has no effect on the data because the tension is consistent. Each leg was different but the largest leg which is labeled as frog 3 was shown to have a far more powerful contraction than the smaller legs. This may be a result of more muscles in the third leg. After the paired T-Test was performed a p_value of .1298 was calculated which is not statistically significent.


Discussion:
In this experiment data from different  legs cannot be compared because each leg is different and the data is treated separately. The reason that Frog 2 was observed to have a smaller change than the other Frogs was as a results of more than just the isolated gastrocnemus muscle contracting which counteracts the observed contraction of the gastrocnemus. This countering of the muscles results in a smaller observed contraction and why Frog 2 data appears to be skewed. The data was found to be insignificent so the null hypothesis is not supported. But lidocaine still does appear to have an effect on the contraction of muscles as well as an effect on the motor neurons based on Fig. 1 which shows a large change in response after treatment.
