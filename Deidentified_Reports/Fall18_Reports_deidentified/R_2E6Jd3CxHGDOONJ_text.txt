Title: Influence of Lighting on Intraspecific behavior patterns of Betta splendins

Abstract:
Intraspecific behavior is an important topic in ethology. With changing environmental stimuli, the individual may exhibit different behaviors. This experiment evaluates the influence of light condition on the intraspecific behavior of male Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins Regan). It was hypothesized that the male Betta splendins kept in the dark environment for 24 hours would exhibit more aggressive behavior compared to the controllled group. The one-tailed two-sample t_test was adapted to test the significent difference between the two groups. The data showed no significent difference in the mean of the time duration of aggressive behavior and the number of aggressive behavior. It is possible that the lighting level does not affect the aggressiveness of Betta splendins. 

Introduction:
According to the Population principle ”Population, when unchecked, increases at a geometrical ratio, Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio.” The resource from the environment is limited, therefore, individual facing competition from members of same species [Elwell:2013]. The competition behaviors vary among different species, yet that behavior is part of social interactions, particularly those associated with aggression, sexual activities. In intraspecific competition, individuals of the same species compete against each other for food, mates, and shelter. Betta splendins is chosen because their colorful displays are more recognizable than other species. Different environmental stimuli such as color, presence of female betta, water temperature will cause different level of aggressiveness behavior of bettas. This experiment evaluates the influence of light condition on the intraspecific behavior of Betta splendins. Light intensity is one of several abiotic variables that affect fish aggressive behavior by interfere with the hormone melatonin level[EKSTRÖM: 1997]. Male Bettas may fight to claim territory or to protect their eggs or offspring from rival males. The Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two main type of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. In increasing order of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements, in increasing aggressiveness, are pectoral fins erecting, the spread of opercula and protrude the branchiostegal membranes. This experiment aims to test the level of aggressiveness of Betta fish under normal light and darkness. It was hypothesized that the male Betta splendins kept in the dark environment for 24 hours would exhibit more aggressive behavior compare to the bettas kept in light condition.


Materials and Method:
According to the Population principle ”Population, when unchecked, increases at a geometrical ratio, Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio.” The resource from the environment is limited, therefore, individual facing competition from members of same species [Elwell:2013]. The competition behaviors vary among different species, yet that behavior is part of social interactions, particularly those associated with aggression, sexual activities. In intraspecific competition, individuals of the same species compete against each other for food, mates, and shelter. Betta splendins is chosen because their colorful displays are more recognizable than other species. Different environmental stimuli such as color, presence of female betta, water temperature will cause different level of aggressiveness behavior of bettas. This experiment evaluates the influence of light condition on the intraspecific behavior of Betta splendins. Light intensity is one of several abiotic variables that affect fish aggressive behavior by interfere with the hormone melatonin level[EKSTRÖM: 1997]. Male Bettas may fight to claim territory or to protect their eggs or offspring from rival males. The Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two main type of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. In increasing order of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements, in increasing aggressiveness, are pectoral fins erecting, the spread of opercula and protrude the branchiostegal membranes. This experiment aims to test the level of aggressiveness of Betta fish under normal light and darkness. It was hypothesized that the male Betta splendins kept in the dark environment for 24 hours would exhibit more aggressive behavior compare to the bettas kept in light condition.


Results:
The average number of aggressive behavior displayed between Betta splendins in light was 17.3±18.7(Fig.1).. The average number of aggressive behavior between Betta splendins in the dark was 11.5±13.3(Fig.2). The average length of time Red mane was displayed was 101.8±97.3s while in the dark was 68.3±84.3s. The mean of the number of aggressive behavior experimental group was not statistically significent to compare to the controllled group (t_stat =0.501, d.f.= 6, P = 0.317). The mean of the time duration of aggressive behavior experimental group was also not statistically significent compared to the controllled group (t_stat =0.520, d.f.= 6, P = 0.311).

Discussion:
Agonistic behavior performed when a male Siamese fighting fish B. splendins, sees another male Betta, it may become aggressive or submissive. In fact, even the sight of its own reflection in a mirror will stimulate those behaviours, which are thought to help the dominant organism keep greater access to food, space, or mates [Clotfelter: 2003]. High light intensity could reduce the melatonin level in betta, therefore destabilize the social hierarchy and lead to an increasing amount of aggressive behavior [EKSTRÖM: 1997]. The past experiment suggests that the Bettas kept in continues light environment will be more aggressive since Betta fish can’t rest in continues light condition. Therefore more likely become stressed and exhibit aggressive behavior[Bronstein: 1983]. The result of this study has demonstrated that the Betta fish kept in the dark environment for 24 hours will not exhibit more aggressive behavior. The hypothesis was rejected and there are no relations between the dark condition and Betta’s aggressive behavior. There is substantial systematic and random error present in the experiment. First, the experimental group of Bettas only kept 4 hours in complete darkness instead of 24 hours. It is possible that a longer period is needed for Betta fish to change its behavior. Also, the number of aggressive behavior counted in the experiment does not distinguish the degree of aggressiveness. In the experiment, controllled group bettas displayed pelvic fin flickering more frequent than tail flash. In the further study, different aggressive behaviors should be quantified in different values. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the data group is incredibly high. More trails are needed to make the data more precise. Lastly, we didn’t distinguish the size and the color of Betta fish we used in the experiment. Past study has shown that betta fish tend to exhibit more aggressive behavior toward others with similar size and color[Bronstein: 1983]. In the further study, the size and color of Betta fish should maintain the same.
