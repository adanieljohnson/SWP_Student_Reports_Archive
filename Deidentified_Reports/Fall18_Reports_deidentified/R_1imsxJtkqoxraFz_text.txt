Title: Temperature Has No Significant Effect on the Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinach, Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process that plants undergo using light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen to later create ATP that provides the plant with energy. Photosynthesis occurs in the chloroplasts of the cell, which we extracted and analyzed to test the effects of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesized that the photosynthetic rate will be higher in warmer conditions (36C) and lower in colder conditions (-2C). We used chloroplasts from the leaves of spinach, Spinacia oleracea, which we obtained through differential centrifugation, and used a spectrophotometer to asses the changing absorbances as photosynthesis occurred in the chloroplasts over a 30 minute interval to test our hypothesis. The absorbances of our four groups, warm-experimental at 36C, cold- experimental at -2C, room temperature-controll at 23C, and no chloroplasts-negative controll at 23C, resulted in a p_value of 0.51497. This value showed no statistical difference between the groups and proved our results to be insignificent. We concluded that temperature has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
All organisms have cellular processes to generate and use energy for functions that help them maintain homeostasis. Photosynthesis is one of the most important of these processes, as plants provides fuel and food for animals as well as oxygen to breathe. Photosynthesis is the cellular process that plants use to capture solar energy to later create highly useful ATP that powers cell functions. Photosynthesis occurs in a three-stage process: the light-dependent reactions, which uses photons to generate NADPH and drives ATP synthesis, and the light-independent reactions which uses NADPH, ATP, and carbon molecules to create glucose as well as oxygen as a by-product [Johnson: 2018]. Clorophyl is the green pigment of chloroplasts in plants used to absorb light and generate a proton gradient in the electron transport chain of cells that is vital to photosynthesis [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, we tested to see the effects of temperature on the rate of photosynthesis of our spinach plant subject, Spinacia oleracea. Spinach leaves were used because they are a common plant used for many as a food supply, which makes their photosynthetic activity worthy of a laboratory study. We can measure a difference in electron transfer in chloroplasts by creating a Hill Reaction in varying test tubes. DCIP was used as the electron acceptor in the hill reaction. Initially, the oxidized DCIP is a dark blue liquid. As photosynthesis occurs and the reaction in the test tube progresses, the DCIP turns increasingly colorless [Johnson: 2018].
Because of this, we were able to measure the absorbance of the light (via wavelength) through a spectrophotometer to track the chloroplasts’ activity and give us an idea of the overall rate of photosynthesis within a specified chloroplast. As the DCIP becomes clearer, the absorbance in the spectrophotometer decreases via an inverse relationship. We measured the absorbance of DCPIP as it changes to DCIP H2. As chloroplast activity occurs, DCIP is turned into DCIP H2 which causes a decrease in absorbance because of the electron transport chain attaching hydrogen to the DCIP [Rabinowitch: 1951].
A lower absorbance can be attributed to a higher rate of photosynthesis, which was key to our analysis in this experiment. We tested chloroplasts under a heat lamp in three different conditions: room temperature (23C), warmer temperature (36C, using a heat bath), and colder temperature (-2C, in an ice bath). We also tested a controll group with no chloroplasts at 23C as a basis for comparison. A similar test was done with lettuce leaves in which temperature was the independent variable to experiment with photosynthesis [Kana: 1977]. The binding of protein enzymes to correct molecules is a key factor of photsynthesis, and various studies showed that temperature played  a role in hindering these enzymes [Kana: 1977]. At lower temperatures, these enzymes can be slowed and blocked which can lead to a lower photosynthetic rate. Based on general knowledge of photosynthesis and results from previous experiments on the effects of temperature, we hypothesized that the photosynthetic rate will be highest in warmer conditions (36C) due to the ability of more hydrogens given off to synthesize DCPIP H2, a determinant of photosynthetic rate. [Rabinowitch: 1951]. Thus, we predict that the absorbances for the warmer sample group with have the lowest average absorbances. The absorbances in colder conditions will be higher, which will show chloroplasts with a lower photosynthetic rate and less synthesis of DCIP H2. The independent variable is experimental temperature, while the dependent variable is rate of photosynthesis. 


Materials and Method:
We measured the rate of photosynthesis indirectly by measuring the absorbances of the various solutions in a spectrophotometer at 600 nm. To begin our experiment, we removed and discarded the central vein from 5 large spinach leaves that were given to us by our TA. These leaves served as the source of chloroplast that we were analyzing. We rinsed and dried these leaves with tap water and added them to a mortar and pestle that had been cooled on ice so that we could crush them. We added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM surcrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) and fringed the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of visible leaves. We then added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer to the slurry and continued to grind with the pestle to obtain a product that was as crushed and liquified as possible. We strained this green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled 150 Ml beaker. We then enriched our now condensed chloroplast sample by differential centrifugation by first adding our slurry into a chilled centrifugal tube. This tube underwent a round of centrifugation at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes. Keeping the debris at the bottom, the supernatant was poured into another centrifuge tube and underwent a round of centrifugation at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes. Mixing 20 Ml of grinding buffer with the pellet at the bottom, and carefully suspending it with a micropipette, gave us the enriched chloroplast solution we used for the next steps in our experiment. We discarded the pellet and kept the rest of the solution for experimental use.
We used 3 replicants for each of our conditions and experimented with a total of 13 test tubes that can be summarized as such: 1 blank tube (#1), 3 controll tubes (#5-7) at 23C (room temperature), 3 experimental tubes (#11-13) at -2C (colder conditions), 3 experimental tubes (#8-10) at 36C (warmer conditions), and 3 negative controll tubes (#2-4) with no chloroplasts at 23C. Each test tube was filled with 6 Ml of water except for the blank tube (tube #1), which was filled with 8Ml of water. To the assay, we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts we prepared earlier to the blank tube (#1), and to Tubes #5-13. Tubes #2-13 had 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer( 100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5), and 2 Ml of 130 mM DCPIP. We were now able to quantify photosynthetic reduction activity by placing each tube into their assigned condition, placing a heat lamp over all conditions, and reading their absorbances on a spectrophotometer.
Once the chloroplasts were added to each tube, we immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600 nm using tube #1 and recorded the absorbances of tubes #2-13. Each tube was then placed in their assigned conditions and a timer was set. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer again with tube #1 and recorded the absorbances for tubes #2-13. This step was repeated again after 20 minutes and 30 minutes to give us 4 total times of data points for all 12 samples. We ran an ANOVA test to compare the differences between the mean values of our 3 groups with an alpha value of 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom.


Results:
In this experiment, we compared the absorbances of 4 different sample groups at 4 different times (0, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes). 3 replicants for each group were performed, and the average absorbances of the replicants were displayed (Figure 1). As shown, the trend for all 4 of these sample groups is similar as a downward slope (Figure 1). Group #1 had absorbances that remained consistently above the other 3 groups but still exhibited a similar downward slope. Group 3 exhibited a noticeable spike from -.026 to 0.049 between the 10 and 20 minute intervals (Figure 1). The specific differences in each group’s average absorbances relative to their respected times in the experiment were also graphed for comparison (Figure 2). All groups had consistently higher absorbances at time 0, and group 1 had higher absorbances at 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes when compared to the other 3 groups (Figure 2). Groups 2-4 had similarly low absorbances at 10, 20 and 30 minutes (Figure 2). The ANOVA test that was performed (alpha value of 0.05) showed that the absorbances in our results were statistically insignificent and did not show any statistical difference. (f-ratio value=0.80486, d.f.=3, p_value=0.514973).



Discussion:
We hypothesized that the chloroplasts in the warmer conditions (36C) will have the highest photosynthetic rate and that the colder conditions (-2C) will have a clear and significently lower photosynthetic rate in comparison. After analysis of our absorbances it is clear that our hypothesis was not supported by the data obtained from our experiment. In the introduction, it was established that absorbances and photosynthetic rate are inversely related, meaning a relatively low absorption correlated to a relatively high photosynthetic rate and vice vera. The data shows that all of the groups followed a trend that was far from significently different, as shown by our high p_value. After 30 minutes, the 3 groups containing chloroplasts ended with photosynthetic rates with a range of 0.0053, a very small and insignificent difference.
We can infer from this data that temperature did not have the desired affect on the rate of photosynthesis that we had predicted. In an experiment done previously, it had been concluded that the difference in temperature restricted and slowed the electron transport chain in chloroplasts [Reynaud: 2003]. Our results, however, did not receive the same results and the synthesis of hydrogen for DCIP H2 was not affected. In another similar experiment testing temperature conditions that very cold and very hot, it was concluded that temperature had a marked effect on photosynthesis and the cold temperature had lower rates [Marsh: 1986]. In a biological context, our results could indicate that spinach leaves are not easily affected by a change in temperature or that the temperature must be very cold or very hot for noticeable difference in rates. Despite results from previous experiments and knowledge of photosynthesis, our hypothesis was rejected due to insignificent data throughout the entire experiment.
To improve this experiment in the future, we must be particularly careful with the spectrophotometer to ensure accurate readings and results. During our experiment we noticed that the differing cold and warm temperatures would cause the tubes to fog, which caused the readings to rise randoMly due to the hindering of light reading in the tube. We did our best to account for this error, but it still serves to believe that this was something that would have affected our data. Particularly, it can be one explanation as to the outlier spike shown in group 2 between 10 and 20 minutes.
This study was important because of how dynamic and versatile the spinach leaf is for the diet of humans and animals. This experiment could be extended by testing chloroplasts from other staple vegetables of the human diet such as lettuce and tomato plants [Rabinowitch: 1951]. Photosynthesis is one of the most important biological processes on earth, and any study of its affects and/or how to influence its rate can have beneficial information for the scientific world.
