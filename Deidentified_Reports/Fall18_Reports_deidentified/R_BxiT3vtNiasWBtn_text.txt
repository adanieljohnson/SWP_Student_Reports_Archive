Title: Phenotypic Plasticity of Pisum sativun in Response to Herbivory as Observed Through Root:Shoot Ratio

Abstract:
Organisms respond to certain environmental conditions by changing the distribution of energy among certain systems and processes through what is known as resource allocation. Plants often demonstrate variation in resource allocation through phenotypic plasticity, or the ability to change physical characteristics in order to adapt to biotic and abiotic factors in the environment. In this experiment, Pisum sativun (field peas) were used to demonstrate the effect of herbivory on resource allocation in plants. A controll group of plants were grown in the greenhouse under controllled conditions, and the treatment group grew under exposure to herbivory, which was symbolized by the removal of leaves by the experimenter. It was hypothesized that the root:shoot ratio for the length and width of the treatment group would be greater than that of the controll group. The root:shoot ratios of the plants were calculated and values compared using statistical analysis. The results of a two sample T-test showed that exposure to herbivory did not have a significent effect on resource allocation in field pea plants, therefore rejecting the hypothesis.


Introduction:
Fitness is a principle element to the theory of evolution. A species fitness to its environment is directly related to its ability to maximize environmental resources in order to survive and successfully reproduce. Scientists refer to the distribution of energy to processes within an organism which increases its fitness to an environment as resource allocation. Though resource allocation is genetically determined, species and individuals have the ability to modify their allocation pattern in order to adapt to abiotic and biotic conditions unique to their environment [Johnson: 2018]. This property is known as phenotypic plasticity, and can be easily observed in plants. Scientists often perform experiments to observe how plants adjust resource allocation based on the availability of resources above ground, at the shoot, and below ground, at the root. Thus, scientists commonly measure the influence of environmental factors on resource allocation by calculating the root:shoot ratio of biomass in plants growing under various conditions. In an experiment conducted by the Department of Biology at Bradley University on two plant species growing in high and low nutrient soils, researchers found that “high-nutrient-grown plants of both species grew faster and had a lower root: shoot ratio than low-nutrient-grown plants” [Gedroc: 1996]. Similarly, in this experiment, Pisum sativun (field pea) plants were used to observe the effect of herbivory on resource allocation. The removal of plant leaves by experimenters was used to simulate herbivory in this experiment. Calculation of the root:shoot ratio of plants growing in the presence of herbivory compared to in the absence of herbivory provided information on the variation of resource allocation among the two groups. It was hypothesized that field pea plants growing in the presence of herbivory would have a higher root:shoot ratio than plants growing in the absence of herbivory.


Materials and Method:
Six plant cartons were prepared with soil and Miracle Grow nutrients. Twelve holes were poked in the soil of each of the cartons, providing space for two field pea seeds to be placed, after which the soil was redistributed to cover the seeds. Each carton was watered until saturation. Three cartons were labeled as controll and three as treatment. All cartons with seeds were placed in the greenhouse. Every day, the plants were watered with 50 Ml water. Every three days, starting on the third day, ½ of all of the leaves on the plants in the treatment group were removed by the experimenter to simulate herbivory. After two weeks, the plants were returned to the laboratory for analysis. 12 controll plants and 12 treatment plants were selected, removed from the pots, roots washed and dried, and placed on labelled paper towels. The root of each plant was separated from the shoot by cutting just above the seed shell. The root and shoot length and weight were measured in cm and grams, respectively. From these values, the root:shoot ratio was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample T-test.

Results:
The data collected from this experiment shows that the root:shoot ratio for length of field pea plants in the treatment group was greater than that of the controll group, and the root:shoot ratio for mass of plants in the treatment group was less than that of the controll group. Figure 1 illustrates this data including error bars that show standard deviation of the results. There was a significent difference between the root:shoot ratio for length in the treatment and controll group (t_stat=2.24, d.f.=22, p=0.018). There was not a significent difference between the root:shoot ratio for mass in the treatment and the controll group (t_stat=1.13, d.f.=22, p=0.1360). 

Discussion:
The results of this experiment lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that plants growing in the presence of herbivory would have a higher root:shoot ratio for length and mass than plants growing in the absence of herbivory. The data shows that the root:shoot ratio for length of the plants that were exposed to herbivory was significently lower than that of the plants not exposed to herbivory. This result indicates that the plants whose leaf surface area decreased as a result of the presence of herbivory in the environment did not adjust their resource allocation as was predicted in the hypothesis. It was predicted that the plants would allocate more energy towards root growth in order to adapt to the environmental condition preventing them from obtaining energy from the leaves. A possible explanation for this result is that the plants exposed to herbivory did not increase energy allocation to the roots because the nutrients acquired from soil at the roots is not equivalent to the sunlight energy supplied to the plant through the leaves during photosynthesis. The plants did not allocate more energy to the roots because the resources normally acquired at the leaves cannot be acquired at the roots. Instead, the plant allocated more energy to the leaves and shoot in an effort to increase the capacity of sunlight absorption despite the effect of herbivory. Another explanation for this result was theorized by Fernando Valladares through his research results on the ecological limits to plant plasticity, stating, “We illustrate how herbivory may limit plant phenotypic plasticity because damaged plants can only rarely attain the optimal phenotype in the challenging environment” [Valladares: 2007]. This ecological limitation would hinder phenotypic plasticity, which could be a possible explanation for the non-significent results of this experiment.
