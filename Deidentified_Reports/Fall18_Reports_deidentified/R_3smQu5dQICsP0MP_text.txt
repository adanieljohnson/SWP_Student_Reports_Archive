Title: The Effect of Juvenile Hormone on the Development and Growth of Larva Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Hormones serve a big role in insect development like signaling the rest of the body to activate a function or have an organizational effect like undergoing metamorphosis. Altering hormone production in insects have big impacts that will be discussed later. The purpose of this experiment is to test the effects of G-regulator, a Juvenile Hormone mimic, on Manduca Sexta caterpillars. In this experiment, G-regulator was added every other day to the larvae’s standard diets to test the effect it on their weight over a fifteen-day period in comparison to a controll group. The caterpillars were fed and weighed each day to obtain suitable results. Overall, our experiment was unsuccessful because it did not reflect the hypothesis which stated that mixing 5 drops of G-regulator into 10g of the caterpillars diet every other day would have a positive effect on the caterpillar’s weight and that the hormone would inhibit the treatment group from pupating. At the end of the fifteen-day period, a two-sample two-tailed T-test was used to graph the growth in Figure 1 and the net growth from initial weight to max weight was calculated to determine average growth. The treatment group had gained an average of 8.39g ± 2.56 which is lower than the average the controll group had gained (10.22g ± 1.701).

Introduction:
ABSTRACT(continued): 
It was concluded that the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group. The controll group grew more than the treatment group which negates the hypothesis and thus, allowing us to reject it (t_stat = 1.19, d.f. = 6, P = 0.28). The experimental group did not pupate as hypothesizes so that part was accepted, which is explained by the effect of hormone mimic inhibiting them from undergoing metamorphosis or reaching the commitment pulse.
INTRODUCTION: 
The Manduca Sexta moth, also known as the sphinx moth or tobacco hornworm, is an organism that goes through four completely different life phases. The Manduca Sexta begins its life as an egg before growing into a worm-like larva. In its last larval stage, it pupates to forms a cocoon to grow and develop wings before it emerges as an adult with winds and reproductive organs. Certain hormones signal the body to either activate a function or have an organizational effect like changing the arrangement of the body to enter the next phase in their life cycle. These hormones work together specifically to controll growth, molting, and metamorphosis of Manduca Larva into their adult stage [Johnson: 2018].  They are known as Ecdysterone and Juvenile Hormone. The Ecdysterone hormones are molting hormones, with periodic surges causing the events involved in molting, whereas Juvenile Hormone hormones are status-quo hormones that maintain the insect in its current form as the insect is responding to the molting surge of Ecdysterone . They are relatively high in insects during their larva stage but when Juvenile Hormone finally disappears during the last larval instar the commitment pulse is signaled, meaning the insect begins to undergo metamorphosis pupating to become an adult [Truman: 2002]. Manduca Sexta are the ideal model organism to run hormone test on because they are pests in nature, there has been lots of experiments conducted on them in the past with which we can compare, they have a relatively fast life span for which we can see the effects of hormone quickly, and they are cheap and easy to access. Our experiment gave us insight to compare weight, growth, and relative time of pupating compared to untreated larva under normal conditions. Only by examining the effects of hormone regulation and the effect on the insect will the scientific community know how to apply it in real life cases. For example, using hormone in place of insecticide would mean farmers and gardeners would use a non-toxic compound instead of hazardous material that could affect the rest of the ecosystem.  Our experiment deals with altering how long Juvenile Hormones is present in Manduca Sexta larva relative to normal hormone production and increasing the amount of juvenile hormone in the diet of larva. Our experiment was carried out specifically by adding five drops of G-regulator, a Juvenile Hormone mimic, every other day to the diet of four larva. This experiment was conducted to test whether the hormone in higher than normal amounts would affect the timing of pupation and commitment stage and to test if the juvenile hormone will make the larva grow heavier in weight than the controll group which is being fed the same diet without G-regulator. It was hypothesized that feeding the experimental group five drops of Juvenile Hormone mimic every other day would cause them to grow bigger in size than the controll group that was not exposed to the hormone mimic. Along with growing bigger in size the experimental larva was predicted to not pupate because due to the presence of Juvenile Hormone inhibiting the ability to reach the commitment pulse in order to pupate.


Materials and Method:
First, the eight Manduca Sexta caterpillars were gathered and separated into two groups: a controll group and an experimental group. They were placed into two plastic containers with lids that both had four sections with perforations to let air in, so the larva or caterpillars could be visible and clearly labeled 1 through 4 for each group. The first day of the experiment each caterpillar was weighed and photographed. The treatment group received five drops of G-regulator, Juvenile Hormone mimic, in their 10 grams of food. The controll group was just given 10 grams of normal food without the hormone mimic. Every day after that the treatment group was fed hormone mimic every odd day and normal food every even day in a 15-day period. They were all weighed, fed, and their containers were cleared of any waste daily. They were placed in an incubator that mimicked the ideal temperatures for natural caterpillar environment. Data for days 10-12 also could not be collected due to hurricane Florence. On day 13 the experimental group was not fed hormone food like initially intended, but just ate regular food without hormone because the procedure could not be carried out also due to hurricane Florence. A two sample two-tailed T-test was used to compare the data between the controll group and the experimental group. 

Results:
For most of the experiment the controll group weighed more than the experimental group. For the first three days, the difference in weight between the experimental and controll group barely varied. For days 4 to 13, the controll group weighed more than the experimental as can be seen in Figure 1. Day 14 and 15, show a big increase in the weight of the treatment group. This is the first time the treatment group weighs more than the controll. Also, starting at day 13 the average weight of the controll group started to slowly decrease continuously until day 15.  At the beginning of the experiment, both of the groups looked identical. By the end, the treatment group had become more inflated and their color had gotten shades lighter than the controll group. Also, the controll group had caterpillars turning a yellow color and one of them had turned fully brown and had stopped moving. The caterpillar that pupated had started turning yellow two days before it pupated. At the end of the fifteen-day period, a two-sample two-tailed T-test was used to graph the growth in Figure 1 and the net growth from initial weight to max weight was calculated to determine average growth. Overall, the mean net growth of the controll group was 10.22g ± 1.701 and the mean net growth of the treatment group was 8.39g ± 2.56 (t_stat = 1.19, d.f. = 6, P = 0.28).

Discussion:
The trends of the data can be explained by biological phenomenon. The caterpillars used in the experiment were all in their second or third instar at the beginning of the experiment. According to their life cycle, this meant that within around 15-13 days the larva would reach the commitment pulse turning into pupa. The commitment pulse happens when the insect has had enough food to eat to survive metamorphosis. It is triggered by the rapid decline of Juvenile Hormone production and an increase in Ecdysterone. [Truman: 2002]. Leading up to the commitment pulse the larva or caterpillars’ job is to eat as much as they can to be nutritionally sustained when they cannot eat as pupa. These trends can be seen on the graph with the gradual increase of weight of the caterpillars every day. The reason then for the decline of the controll group and not the experimental group around days 13 through 15 is due to the fact that one of the caterpillars in the controll group had pupated. This caterpillar’s weight started going down because it was expelling liquid from its body brought on by an effect of going through metamorphosis. The other caterpillars in the controll group were turning yellow meaning they would begin to pupate in less than three days because that was the trend seen with the first caterpillar. JH is a key player in the evolution of metamorphosis because it can act on organisms to suppress morphogenesis and cause premature differentiation [Truman: 2002]. This is why only the controll group was pupating and not the experimental group. The caterpillars in the experimental group were growing heavier in size during days 13-15 because they were still being fed juvenile hormone preventing them from reaching the commitment pulse. Overall, the mean of the controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the experimental group.  This could have been due to the experimental group not getting fed Juvenile Hormone on day 13. Although the data for days 13-15 shows a significent difference between the two groups it is not very well supported around days 4-8 because the controll group dominated in weight for most of the experiment. This could have been caused by the natural regulation of hormones signaling the caterpillars to eat more since the body knew it was getting ready to reach commitment pulse. Error also could have occurred from not having data for days 10-12. This could have led to a change in mean and thus skewed the statistical data.  For future experimentation, a longer time to record data would be very beneficial to the findings of the effect of Juvenile Hormone on this species. All the larva in the controll group in this experiment did not pupate but at the end they were turning yellow meaning they were about to which lets us know the trend for their decline in weight would have continued and the statistical data would have been more significent. Our hypothesis was only partly correct. The juvenile hormone inhibited the pupation of the treatment group which we had predicted and is thus accepted. On the other hand, the treatment group did not have a bigger net growth average as hypothesized and is thus rejected.  but the results show the opposite. The part of the hypothesis that mentioned that the experimental group wouldn’t pupate still stands and is accepted.
