Title: The Effect of Acid Rain and Tap Water on Root to Shoot Ratio of Pisum Sativum

Abstract:
Resource allocation is an essential component of supporting life function in plant life, especially with global environmental influences becoming increasingly influential on plant growth and health in various climates. In the study performed in class, resource allocation of 
roots and shoots  in the form of root to shoot ratio of the Pisum Sativum plant was analyzed under tap water conditions and acid rain conditions. It was hypothesized that the acid rain plants would have a higher root to shoot ratio than plants treated with tap water. The collected data supported the hypothesis, with a statistically significently higher root to shoot ratio seen in both weight and length for the plants treated with acid rain. The impact of acid rain and thus a lower pH impacts the growth and resource allocation of the pea plant, shifting a heavier focus from shoot growth to a more extensive root system.  


Introduction:
Ecosystems are composed of both biotic and abiotic factors, which interact with each other in various ways. Biotic factors include living things such as plants and animals, or environmental stimuli that come from other living organisms [Johnson:2018]. Abiotic factors include non-living components of an ecosystem such as sunlight, nutrients, and pH. In order to work around the issue of limitation and potential environmental factors that could affect growth and function, trade-offs and resource allocation strategies are used in conjunction to most efficiently obtain nutrients/resources from their given environments. These resource allocation strategies center around crucial resources for function, growth, reproduction, and development. One of the various method plants use to allocate their resources is through the use of the root to shoot ratio. Plants in environments such as desert climates will have a higher R:S because a more extensive root system will be required to derive water for the plant, but less shoots will be needed due to availability of sunlight. One of the abiotic factors that can have a heavy impact on root to shoot ratio and general resource allocation strategies include pH of the environment. In a study examining the effects of acidity on root length, shoot length, and pore strength of roots, plants were exposed to levels of acid and data was collected. [Haling, Simpson, Richardson, Culvenor, Lambers: 2010]. It was found that acid led to the decreased length of shoots and an increased length of roots, needed to help the plant obtain nutrients from its surroundings. In a popular case study studying the effect of ozone and acid rain on white pine seedlings, it was found that seeds treated with the ozone and acid rain had higher root to shoot ratios [Reich, Schoettle, Stroo, Troiano, Amundson: 1987]. These results support the previous case study as well. In the study performed in class, the root to shoot ratio of two sections of the field pea plant, Pisum Sativum, was compared to analyze how the presence of different environmental conditions impact resource allocation. Plants treated with acid rain will have a higher root to shoot ratio than those treated with tap water. 

Materials and Method:
Field pea seeds were collected and soaked in water for thirty minutes. For each of the two conditions, four black pots were filled with vermiculate, fifty milliliters of Miracle-Gro, and a pretreatment of either tap water or acid rain with a pH of 3.5. Next, ten seeds were placed in each of the four black pots and set in the greenhouse with consistent exposure to natural light. Every day for two weeks the plants were watered with their respective treatment. At the end of the experiment, five plants were removed from each section and roots were cut from shoots at the root-shoot junction and weighed and measured for length separately. The root to shoot ratio for weight and length for each plant was calculated. The mean root to shoot ratio for weight and length for each treatment group was calculated and plotted on two graphs with respective standard deviations. The data was analyzed using a 2-sample two-tailed t_test to determine statistical significance. 

Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio for the tap water for weight was 1.02 ± 0.186 g (Figure 1), and the mean root to shoot ratio for the acid rain for weight was 1.59 ± 0.292 g (Figure 2). A significent p_value of 6.59 x 10-8 was calculated for the difference in the average root to shoot ratio for weight between the two groups, with a t-value of 6.867 and 34 degrees of freedom. The mean root to shoot ratio for the tap water for length was 0.61 ± 0.068 cm, and the mean root to shoot ratio for the acid rain for length was 0.93 ± 0.153 cm. A statistically significent p_value of 1.52 x 10-9 was calculated for the difference in the average root to shoot ratio for length between the two groups, with a t-value of 8.181 and 34 degrees of freedom. The appearance of the plants differed slightly on the last day of observation; the tap water plants had seemingly stronger shoot systems that stood taller and less extensive root systems compared to the acid rain plants, which seemed to have a weaker, thinner shoot system and a thicker, more extensive root system. The plants of the two treatment groups resembled each other in terms of color and intensity of color throughout the entire plant body. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis of the experiment was supported because the plants treated with acid rain had a higher root to shoot ratio in both length and weight compared to the plants treated with tap water. The collected data as seen in Figure 1 and Figure 2 as well as the statistically significent p_values calculated for both length and weight support the beginning predictions. The use of the Pisum Sativum plant was an important component of this experiment as the plant is a dicot, or a flowering plant with two seed leaves, that is more susceptible to effects of acidity than plants such as monocots [Lal: 2016]. This allowed for the effects of acid conditions to truly be displayed by the plants. These results supported the experiments previously discussed, as the acid rain did have an effect on how the pea plants allocated their resources in order to best obtain the nutrients from the soil, by producing a higher root to shoot ratio [Reich, Schoettle, Stroo, Troiano, Amundson: 1987].  These results occurred because the presence of acid rain impact the sprouting and growth of the seeds, causing the plants to allocate energy to growing a more extensive root system to obtain nutrients and a necessary amount of water from the soil in the most efficient and effective way possible to support necessary life functions. A recent study investigating the effect of pH in soil revealed that a decreased pH leading to an acidic environment was linked to osmotic stress of plants in that environment [Kang,Park,Kim, Jeong: 2011], thus further supporting the hypothesis of the experiment and the subsequent results and data collected. Conversely, the tap water plants did not require a higher root to shoot ratio because there was not an impounding factor inhibiting the ability to get nutrients from the soil. Investigating how plants react in terms of resource allocation and specifically toward the effect of acidity is essential as environmental changes become more prevalent and impact plant life worldwide. Furthering this experiment could  include the addition of different abiotic factors such as an influx of nitrogen to further understand how plants react to certain environmental changes and to what extent they are impacted.
