Title: The Effects of Sevin on Voltage Threshold of the Neuromuscular Junction

Abstract:
Neuromuscular transmission is facilitated by the movement of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve to the post-synaptic muscle tissue. Once these ACh molecules have attached to their receptors and caused a contraction of the muscle they are quickly taken up by the acetylcholinesterase (AChR) located in the synaptic cleft. The destruction of ACh by AChR allows the synaptic cleft to clear and ready the muscle for another contraction. We tested the hypothesis that the addition of an AChE inhibitor, Sevin, to the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg would increase the voltage required to break the threshold and cause a contraction. In our experiment, we compared the threshold voltage of frog legs injected with Sevin and without Sevin. A paired t-test found a p-value of .423. The results showed no increase in threshold voltage from the control treatment to the experimental treatment. The results showed that future studies would require greater precision in determining voltage values of the threshold. 

Introduction:
Skeletal muscles in vertebrates and invertebrates are innervated by motor neurons, who’s cell bodies are located in the gray matter of the spinal cord. Axons of motor neurons extend into the muscle, then branch out to innervate individual muscle cells, also known as myofibers, at points called neuromuscular junctions. Nerve impulses arriving at the neuromuscular junction cause the release of a neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. [Johnson: 2016] ACh crosses the synaptic cleft and binds to specialized acetylcholine receptors (AChR) clustered on the muscle fiber. Activated AChR allows current to enter the muscle fiber and generate a localized membrane depolarization. The depolarization of the muscle fiber membrane causes the opening of voltage-activated sodium channels, which propagates an action potential down the muscle fiber. [Webster: 2018] This action potential stimulates the release of Ca2+, causing muscle fibers to shorten and contract. [Johnson: 2016] Once ACh have transmitted the chemical signal to the muscle cell they are rapidly taken up and hydrolyzed by enzymes called acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which clear the synaptic cleft of all released ACh. Action potentials are generated according to the principle of “all or nothing,” meaning that any depolarization exceeding threshold results in the generation of the same action potentials. [Petrov: 2018] We are interested in testing how the presence of an AChE inhibitor in the neuromuscular junction of a frog gastrocnemius muscle will affect the threshold voltage required for a response. We hypothesize that the addition of the AChE inhibitor, Sevin, to the frog gastrocnemius muscle will increase the voltage required to break the threshold and cause a contraction. 

Materials and Methods:
To conduct our experiment, we obtained three severed frog legs with their attached sciatic nerves. Using a pair of forceps, we removed the skin from the legs, pulling from the top of the leg down towards the foot. We placed the skinned legs onto a dissecting pan, moistening them with Ringer’s solution to keep the muscles and nerves from drying out. On the first leg we used a dissecting probe to gently separate the inner thigh muscles, beginning at the upper end down to the knee. This allowed us to expose the sciatic nerve where we would attach electrodes that would transmit the electric current. Using dissecting needle and forceps we carefully detached the sciatic nerve from its attaching connective tissue. In order to more accurately observe a contraction in the gastrocnemius muscle we detached the muscle from the leg at the Achilles tendon, and using string tied part of the Achilles to a hook extended out directly above the leg. We made sure the gastrocnemius muscle was extended perpendicular to the rest of the leg, with a small amount of tension on the string. We then laid the sciatic nerve over the two electrodes so that both electrodes were making contact with the nerve. The electrodes were attached to an electrical stimulation device that was connected to LabScribe software, allowing us to adjust the amplitude of the electric stimulus. Once the frog leg was hooked up to the electrical stimulator, we began stimulating the gastrocnemius muscle to find the threshold for a muscle stimulus, increasing the stimulus by 0.1 Amps. Once we received a stimulus, we dialed back the Amps to find a more accurate threshold and recorded the voltage received from the stimulus. Then with the same leg still attached we injected the 2% solution into the muscle. After allowing the solution to spread we repeated the same process stimulating the muscle with electric current and increasing the level of the stimulus by 0.1 Amps until finding the threshold and recorded the voltage. We repeated this same process for two more frog legs which were tested under the control treatment and the experimental treatment. After completing all six trial we had obtained three voltage levels for a control group and three voltage levels for a treatment group. The dependent variable in this study was the presence of the AChE inhibitor Sevin and the dependent variable was the voltage level. We used a paired t-test to determine the significance of our data. 

Results:
When comparing the control and treatment group we found no increase in the voltage threshold in the treatment group. Figure 1 provides the voltage thresholds for each subject under control conditions and experimental conditions and compares their voltage values for each treatment. The first frog leg under the control treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.175 mV and under the experimental treatment, it had a threshold voltage of 0.175 mV. The second frog leg under the control treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.1 mV and under the experimental treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.1 mV. The third frog leg under the control treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.175 mV and under the experimental treatment had a threshold voltage of 0.15 mV. The threshold voltage of the Sevin treatment was not significantly greater than the threshold voltage of the control treatment as we received a p-value of 0.423.

Discussion:
The results obtained in this experiment do not support the original hypothesis that the addition of the AChE inhibitor, Sevin, to the neuromuscular junction of the frog leg would increase the threshold voltage of the gastrocnemius muscle. Two of the subjects experienced the same threshold voltage in the presence and absence of the AChE inhibitor, and the other subject experienced a slight decrease in threshold voltage. The application of Sevin had little to no effect on the threshold voltage of the muscle. AChE inhibitors have two effects on neuromuscular transmission. When AChE is inhibited more ACh molecules reach the postsynaptic membrane without being hydrolyzed by the AChE in the synaptic cleft. [Petrov: 2018] The presence of an AChE inhibitor would therefore have the effect of lowering the voltage required to stimulate a muscle contraction, as a lower number of ACh molecules would need to be released from the presynaptic neuron to depolarize the postsynaptic muscle cell. Additionally, the inhibition of AChE causes ACh molecules remain bound to their receptors on the postsynaptic cell, increasing the net amplitude and duration of depolarization in the post-synaptic membrane, causing the muscle to repeatedly contract without a following electrical stimulus. [Petrov: 2018] This experiment determining the voltage required to reach threshold potential could produce viable results, however greater precision would be required in determining the value of that voltage. In modifying our experiment, we would need to narrow in further on the voltage of the stimulus by both using smaller increments and repeatedly applying the stimulus to obtain a more accurate voltage value. Inhibition of AChE can cause muscle fiber degeneration at the end plate. [Bois: 1980] Further studies could be conducted to investigate the effect of prolonging effect of AChE inhibitors on the stimulation of the muscle could provide insight into the effects of continued muscle contraction over time.
