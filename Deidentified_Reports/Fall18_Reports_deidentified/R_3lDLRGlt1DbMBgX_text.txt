Title: The Effects of Precor on the Growth and Development of Manduca Sexta

Abstract:
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) have become an effective mechanism for pest controll as they target the development of insects by causing abnormalities in hormones that inhibit their chance for survival. We examined the effects of an insect growth regulator, Precor, which raises levels of juvenile hormone (JH) in holometabolous insects. We tested the hypothesis that the juvenile hormone analog, Precor, would increase the growth of Manduca sexta. In our study we compared the growth of two groups of Manduca sexta larva. One group received a diet with Precor solution added, while the other received a normal diet with no Precor. While the results showed greater growth in the group treated with Precor, the statistical tests found a p_value of 0.3. The results however, did reveal that none of the Manduca sexta treated with Precor did not pupate, while all of the surviving subjects in the controll group reached the pupal stage. The result helped shape ideas for future studies, that would examine the effect of Precor on the rate of pupation within a larger sample.

Introduction:
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) are an emerging approach to insect pest controll that differ from traditional insecticides. IGRs use substances that can adversely affect the growth and development of insects by causing abnormalities that reduce insect survival (Johnson, 2016). Most IGR’s have shown to be effective by causing the rapid death of insects by causing the failure of key processes controllled by hormonal regulation. IGRs are designed to interfere in the insect development or reproduction (Riddiford and Truman, 1978). The Manduca sexta, is an insect in the order Lepidoptera, which includes all butterflies, moths, and skippers. In its holometabolous life cycle, it undergoes metamorphosis after transitioning from the larval to the pupal stage. In order for this transition to occur the Manduca sexta must reach the commitment pulse, a signal that tells the larva it is ready to pupate. (Johnson, 2016). The Manduca sexta caterpillar must be large enough with enough stored nutrients to complete the next step in development (Johnson, 2016). At its final larval stage, the Manduca sexta must reach a critical weight of around 5 g in order initiate the process of pupation (Nijhout and Williams, 1974). A hormone that plays an important role in Manduca sexta development is juvenile hormone (JH), which is important for facilitating early growth. At the start of development in the larval phase the Manduca sexta produces large amounts of JH to stimulate rapid growth. As it progresses through the larval stage and nears the pupal stage, JH levels decrease as the larva produces more ecdysterone (20E) a hormone that regulates the timing of molting and produces the commitment pulse, a signal that tells the larva it is ready to pupate. At the commitment pulse JH levels are very low and remain low during metamorphosis (Johnson, 2016). We are interested in testing the effects of an IGR called Precor on the development of the Manduca sexta. Precor is a juvenile hormone analog, meaning it raises the levels of JH hormone in all parts of larval development (Johnson, 2016). We hypothesize that if Precor is added to the food of the Manduca sexta caterpillar then the resulting higher levels of JH will lead to an increase in its growth in weight.

Materials and Method:
In setting up our experiment we decided to set up two groups of four Manduca sexta caterpillars, making one the treatment group to receive the Precor and the other, the controll to receive a normal diet. In the treatment group, we fed each caterpillar 10 grams of good, with 7 drops of Precor added and mixed into each 10 gram increments. In the controll group, we fed the caterpillars 10 grams of the same food without any Precor. Each group was placed in four-celled clear plastic containers with each caterpillar being placed in its own cell. Holes were punched into the containers so the caterpillars would be able to breath. The caterpillar food was replenished every two days in amounts of 10 grams, adding 7 drops of Precor for the experimental group. Our independent variable was the presence of the Precor in the caterpillar food. Our dependent variable was the growth of the caterpillars by weight in grams. We measured this by collecting the weights of each caterpillars every two days, then subtracting the difference in weights between each day. This was done mainly due to the the fact that caterpillars started out with different weights. Measurements were recorded for one week. A two sample t_test was conducted to determine the significance of our data.

Results:
When comparing growth between the controll and treatment group we found that the treatment group experienced more growth over the week-long period of development. Figure 1 provides the increases in weight between each day that weights were recorded. From September 6th to September 8th, the controll group had a higher average growth of 1.368 g while the treatment group had an average growth of 1.048 g. From September 8th to September 10th the average growth of the treatment group increased significently to 2.995 g compared to an average growth of 2.46 g in the controll group. From September 10th to September 12th this trend continued as the treatment group grew an average of 3.15 g while the controll group grew  an average of 2.54 g. On the final day of data collection we found that one of the caterpillars in the controll group had died. This caterpillar did not have an increase in weight from the 10th to the 12th. We did not include the weight of the dead caterpillar in the average weight of the controll group on the 12th. When taking the averages of these separate growth increases, we calculated that the controll group grew an average of 2.123 g every two days, while the treatment group grew an average of 2.398 g every two days. The average growth rate of the of the treatment group is not significent as our statistical tests yielded a p_value of 0.3. Although data collection and feeding were completed after one week, when disposing of the Manduca sexta a week later we discovered that the three surviving subjects in the controll group had all been able to pupate, while none of the subjects in the treatment group had reached the pupal stage.

Discussion:
The results obtained in this experiment did not support for the original hypothesis that adding Precor to the food of the Manduca sexta larva would lead to a significent increase in growth. While the average growth of group treated with Precor was greater than the average growth rate of the controll group, the one tailed two sample t_test found that this result was not significent. The lack of growth in the caterpillar that died death in the controll group significently lowered the average growth of that group. Had that subject experienced normal growth the difference in growth between the controll and treatment group would have been smaller. 
This study did yield significent findings in our observation that the Manduca sexta larva  receiving a normal diet were able to pupate and the larva receiving a Precor diet did not despite reaching similar weights in the final larval stage. In their regulation of development in the Manduca sexta, JH and 20E target the epidermis to either program it for a larval molt or for metamorphosis. When JH levels are high the epidermis in the larva is programmed for a larval molt. If JH levels remain high the epidermis cannot be programmed for metamorphosis and pupation is inhibited (Eto, 1990). This provides explanation for why the larva receiving Precor continued to grow and molt instead of initiating metamorphosis. The effectiveness of JH analogs depends on the timing of application. Manduca sexta are most sensitive to juvenile hormone analogs at the last larval instar between the disappearance of JH and before the production of 20E. JH analogs throw off the delicate hormonal balance that is necessary for a successful pupation to occur (Miyamoto et. al., 1993).
	Based on the results of this experiment it is apparent that testing the variables of the weight of the larvae, may not provide results that directly explain the effect of JH analogs on the process of Manduca sexta development. In modifying this study, we could test the effect of different levels of a JH analogs, like Precor, solely on the rate of pupation among the subjects. The study would contain a controll group receiving a Precor free diet, along with several treatment groups receiving different amounts of JH. This study would use much larger sample sizes in order to obtain a more accurate pupation rate among a larger population. Studies researching the application of IGR’s as insect pest controlllers should consider not only whether the cycle of development in insects is disrupted, but when it is disrupted. The most effective pest controlller would be the one that kills the pest at the very beginning of development. If larval pests are still able to consume crops through their early development to the point of metamorphosis, then the IGR’s would be ineffective for the purpose of reducing the destruction of crops.
