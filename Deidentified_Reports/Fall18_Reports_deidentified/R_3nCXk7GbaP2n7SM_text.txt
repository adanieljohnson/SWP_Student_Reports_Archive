Title: The effects of different concentrations of Calcium Chloride on Physarum Polycephalum growth after 24, 48, and 72 hours. 

Abstract:
Physarum Polycephalum, a bacterium commonly known as slime mold, is becoming more frequently used to study cellular signaling processes. Physarum moves by utilizing actin-myosin contractions, a process usually involving calcium, but previous research has found calcium to be inhibitatory to Physarum. To further research this claim, we grew Physarum on PDA plates soaked in different concentrations of CaCl2. We expected to see growth of the Physarum over the first 24 hours with a decline or inhibition in growth over the second 48 hours. We expected a greater inhibition shown in the higher concentration of CaCl2. Our experiment was inconclusive due to the use of a culture of Physarum that did not grow in the way it normally does. There are many biological reasons to explain why the culture of Physarum did not grow normally, one of which being the reproductive cycle of the bacteria. 

Introduction:
Physarum Polycephalum is a bacterium more commonly known as slime mold. Physarum is becoming more frequently studied due to the complex cellular processes the slime mold is capable of preforming. Terry, Stefanski, and Eisemann (2009) cite previous research conducted on how Physarum utilizes the cell cycle, growth and differentiation, cell motility, and cell migration as examples of these advanced cellular processes [Terry: 2009]. Physarum is a useful bacterium to study because it displays advanced cellular signaling in the absence of a nervous system [Alim: 2017]. This cellular signaling is similar to how signaling, chemoreception, works in humans; however, Physarum displays a more basic form of chemoreception known as chemotaxis. Bacterium, such as Physarum display chemotaxis by moving either towards or away from certain chemicals [Ueda: 1995]. Physarum also uses cytoplasmic streaming to move. In this process the endoplasm moves by creating a flowing motion through the tubes. When the bacterium is moving forward, it is because the streaming motion is going forward for a more extended time period [Terry: 2009]. Utilizing processes such as chemotaxis and cytoplasmic streaming, Physarum is able to find the shortest and most efficient route between food sources by making use of an actin-myosin cytoskeleton that allows the bacterium to contract tubules and propel forward [Alim: 2017]. These actin- myosin contractions are a crucial part of movement in Physarum, however, it is thought that instead of acting on a form of conventional myosin, the cytoplasmic streaming of Physarum acts on the non- conventional Myosin II. Myosin II is inhibited by direct calcium binding [Farkas: 2003]. 

Based on these processes and previous findings, we were interested in investigating how calcium would affect the growth and movement of Physarum polycephalum. Another previous study conducted by Kohama (2016), showed that calcium initially activated growth of Physarum, however later calcium inhibited the slime mold [Kohama: 2016]. Terry et.al, also found the effects of calcium on the slime mold to be inhibitory [Terry: 2009]. In this experiment different concentrations of calcium (we will use CaCl2) will be tested in order to determine if increased concentrations of calcium increase the excitatory and inhibitory responses of the Physarum polycephalum. We hypothesize that if Physarum polycephalum is exposed to calcium chloride over a 72-hour period, then during the first 24 hours the calcium has an excitatory effect on the growth and movement of the slime mold, however during the second and third 24 hours calcium will have an inhibitory effect on the organism. In addition, increased concentration of calcium will increase the inhibitory effects on the growth of the organism.



Materials and Method:
We began this experiment by creating calcium concentrations to soak 9 PDA plates in order to test our hypothesis. The controll concentration (3 plates) contained 0Ml of 0mM CaCl2. The first test group contained 5Ml of 2mM CaCl2 (3 plates) and the second test group contained 5Ml of 5mM CaCl2 (3 plates). The correct concentration of CaCl2 was poured onto each PDA plate, was labeled, and given 10 minutes to soak in. The excess was poured off.  A 1mm x 1mm block of Physarum was added to the center of each plate. 

To place the Physarum, we took a Physarum stock plate and cut a line through the middle of the plate using a sterilized spatula. Then we cut half of the plate into 1cm blocks using the spatula blade to measure. After cutting the blocks of Physarum we re-sterilized the spatula with ethanol. On the back of each PDA plate we drew a horizontal line through the middle of the plate, then we drew a 1cm x 1cm square in the middle of the line. After removing and disposing the block from each PDA plate, we used the sterilized utensils to remove and place one block of 1cm x 1cm Physarum in each PDA plate making sure the block completely filled the space in the PDA plate. We made sure that the block of Physarum was face up. After each plate had a Physarum block placed we replaced the cover and taped each plate closed. After each plate had been taped shut, we wrapped each set of three in aluminum foil and labeled with the correct concentration of CaCl2. Then we placed each stack of foil in a black plastic bag and placed the entire bag in dark dry environment. 

After 24 hours, we came back and removed the foil from the plates. We left the tape in place and turned the plates face down. We used a millimeter ruler to measure the distance that the Physarum migrated. To measure the growth, we used the millimeter ruler to span the entire distance of the growth and then subtracted the 1cm block of Physarum in the middle. We recorded these distances in a table. After measuring, we recovered all the plates with foil and returned them to the dark environment. 

We repeated the above measurement after 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. Each time we recorded the start time, end time, and total hours elapsed from the previous measurement. 

To analyze the data, we planned to use 2 two- sample t_tests. 



Results:
Figure 1 below displays the data collected from the experiment we conducted. The Physarum culture used in the experiment did not behave as expected. Overall the data collected was very inconsistent and displayed no growth in most samples of the cultures tested. The data does show a decline in growth, however the decline occurred after the first 48 hours and not after the first 24 hours. 

Figure 2 below is a hypothetical display of the results we expected to see had our hypothesis been correct. The graph shows a decline in Physarum growth after the first 24 hours indicating inhibition, with more inhibition shown in the culture treated with 5mM CaCl2 than the cultures treated with 0MM CaCl2 or 2mM CaCl2. This graph is not based on data or results collected in this experiment, it was created in order to illustrate possible results had each sample of each culture grown as expected. 

Figure 3 below is a hypothetical display of possible results based on the results we saw from our experiment, as well as the results communicated in Terry et.al (2009). The displayed results could be a more likely outcome of this experiment had the Physarum grown as expected. This graph is specifically modeled after figure 3 in the results section of the experiment conducted by Terry et.al (2009). This graph is not a display of data collected during our experiment. In this graph the Physarum was not inhibited until after the first 48 hours and the culture treated with 5mM CaCl2 was more inhibited than the culture treated with 2mM CaCl2 which was more inhibited than the culture treated with 0mM CaCl2. 

When we conducted 2 sample t_tests on the data retrieved from our experiment, there was no significance found. However, in the similar experiment conducted by Terry et.al (2009) both the 1mM CaCl2 and the 2mM CaCl2 samples were significent. This is an indicator that figure 3 may be the best representation of similar experiments to the one we conducted. 


Discussion:
The results of our experiment were inconclusive due to the culture of Physarum Polycephalum that we had access to and used as the test subject. Many of the samples of Physarum used in our experiment showed no growth at all, interfering with the overall results of the experiment. There are many biological explanations as to why this particular culture of bacteria did not grow as expected; one explanation lies in the reproductive cycle of the bacteria. 

Physarum is a class of Myxomycete and therefore exists in two forms—a uninucleate ameboma and a multinucleate plasmodium. The ameboma is haploid and each isolate carries different alleles that mate to form the diploid plasmodium [Adler: 1974]. When forming the multinucleate plasmodium Physarum goes through a reproductive cycle of spores, gametes, and zygotes. At the most basic level throughout the reproductive cycle spore nuclei go through mitotic divisions and form gametes which then fuse to make zygotes which form the Physarum plasmodium and then the culture in its entirety [Howard: 1931]. While allowing the mitosis and growth of a new culture Pysarum there are  many steps that must be taken to foster growth. These include a suitable and maintained environment that has both water and nutrients, the right pH and other factors. Once the culture is fostered you must avoid bacterial contamination in order to promote proper growth [Howard: 1931].  Physarum can also become sclerotized or hardened  with lack of moisture or food and an abundance of oxygen is necessary in order to reactive the bacterium [---]. Lastly, in Howard’s experiment he found that Physarum only formed sporangia during the night and he also found that the formation of sporangia needs at least an established area of about twelve square centimeters [Howard: 1931]. All this is to say that growing a culture of Physarum requires careful procedure and attention to detail. All plasmodium have specific growing and reproducing conditions and it is possible that a minor disturbance in the reproductive cycle could have been the instigator of a culture of bacteria that did not respond as expected.
