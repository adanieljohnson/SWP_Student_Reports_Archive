Title: Chemotaxis in Physarum Plasmodium

Abstract:
Slime molds, commonly like Physarum Plasmodium which grown in damp dark outdoors habitats are experienced everyday by gardeners and average people. In testing the chemotaxis of physarum which we did in our past experiment using different light conditions and now have done in this experiment using different chemicals, which can be a useful tactic for farmers and gardeners in order to prevent the spread of physarum. In our experiment we have tested the positive and negative effects that A23178 and neomycin have on the chemotaxis of physarum. Our results remain somewhat inconclusive due to what we think could have been temperature or humidity change of the environment which we grew the organism. 

Introduction:
:  Physarum is a slime mold that lives in damp or decomposing leaves. It uses actin microfilaments in order to move around to find food. It engulfs food through endocytosis, if no food is available physarum responds by starting its reproductive cycle. The nuclei of such a plasmodium undergo synchronous mitoses even when the organism is 5 cm in diameter. [Guttes,1961] In their reproductive cycle they fragment into little pieces, sporangia, which form capsules which are spore like. In the spore capsules, meiosis takes place to create haploid gametes called spores. These spores germinate and ideally turn into swarm cells which are cells that mate. The swarm cells find each other and fuse to form one cell which is diploid and called a zygote. [Guttes,1961] The cell then undergoes mitosis and becomes a mature plasmodium. The feature we are testing in this lab is chemotaxis which can be positive or negative and it takes place when it senses molecules in its environment and crawls toward or away from the molecules depending on what they are. found that plasmodia of Physurum polycephalum Schweinitz responded to glucose solutions by positive chemotaxis but were indifferent to sucrose solutions. [Carlile,1970] We will be testing the effects of A23187 which activates Phospholipase C; IP3 and Neomycin which inhibits Phospholipase; IP3. The purpose of Phospholipase C is determined in IP3 mediated pathways. PLC is an enzyme which cleaves membrane phospholipids in order to make 2 second messenger molecules which are IP3 and diacylglycerol. [Bunney,2011] Diacylglycerol activates PKC which controls other proteins. IP3 is primarily used in order to release calcium from the smooth ER. When phospholipase C is activated we would expect there to be more movement and if it is inhibited we would expect to see less movement, because that means that no calcium could be released, and PKC could not be activated. Therefore, we hypothesize that when given A23187 the physarum will move a lot but, when given neomycin we will see little to no movement in physarum. 

Materials and Methods:
: We used PDR plates which have food infused all over them. First, we prepped 3 plates by pouring 5ml of A23187 all over them for 10 minutes. Then we prepped 3 more plates by pouring 5ml neomycin all over them for 10 minutes. The final three plates had no solution poured over them because they were the control plates. Then we prepped all 9 plates by cutting two squares out of each one using forceps. It was necessary for us to sterilize the forceps in between each use. We then cute squares out of a tenth plate containing physarum and oatmeal and placed each of the physarum blocks into the empty spaces previously cut on the 9 PDR plates. We then secured all of the plates shut with tape and placed them in a dark bag so that light would not shine on them. After 24 hours we went back to look at the movement of physarum in each plate. 

Results:
Overall, the inhibitor showed more movement by .07cm. Which we would not have expected given that the inhibitor should have delayed movement and the activator should have motivated movement.

Discussion:
Since our results were so minimal, we were not able to run statistical tests. However, there are many scientifically supported reasons why the physarum lab did not produce results. For example, one reason could be the natural weather change in Winston Salem. The week that we did this experiment the weather had a major drop in the twenty-four hours that we allowed the physarum to grow. Potts (1902) observed a delay in the onset of aggregation if the myxamoebac were incubated at a low temperature. [Konjin, 1965] This shows that at lower temperatures the slime mold moved much more slowly and delayed reproduction. Another factor that may have affected the physarum is the humidity. On the day we allowed physarum to grow the humidity may have decreased too much for the physarum to grow. Humidity affects physarum in that, . Harper (1914) has shown that plasmodia of Didymium melanospermum (Pers.) Macbr. lose water when about to fruit, and for this reason Sku- pienski (1920) stated that sporangial formation is the result of desiccation and that small plasmodia will fruit more quickly than large plasmodia because they may lose water more easily. [Gray, 1939] This reveals that water is necessary for the production of spores in plasmodia and if there was a lack of humidity in the room which it was being grown the water may have moved through osmosis to the lower concentration (out of the physarum) which would cause the physarum inability to create spores and perform chemotaxis. This could also explain the small amount of growth we saw which could have been a factor of high humidity in the beginning of the twenty-four-hour period and then a sudden decrease in humidity.
