Title: The Effect of Various Salt Concentrations on the chloroplast’s Photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Environmental factors and stressors affect a plants ability to properly and efficiently photosynthesize. This particular lab sought to examine the relationship between increased salinity concentrations and photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves (Spinacia oleracea) through utilizing the Hill reaction. It was hypothesized that as the concentration of salinity increased, the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts would decrease. Chloroplasts were extracted from spinach leaves than prepared in solution with varying NaCl concentrations: 0.25M, 0.50M, 1.0M. These experimental solutions along with the positive control went through a Hill assay with DCIP to measure photosynthetic activity through the reduction of DCIP. Ultimately, our results showed a trend of decreased photosynthetic activity as the concentration increased; however, the data was not statistically significant which could be due to the absorbance being read at the incorrect wavelength.

Introduction:
      Photosynthesis is a mechanism by which plants capture energy from the sun and utilize it to synthesize glucose for glycolysis. The energy produced from glycolysis is then harnessed for other cellular processes in the plant. Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast in two separate stages: the light dependent reactions and the light independent reactions. Ultimately, in this lab, the light dependent reaction was the focus. The light dependent portion of photosynthesis takes place within the thylakoid stacks and on the membrane [Johnson: 2016]. On the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast, photosynthetic electron transport converts photon energy to light energy by using light-driven redox reactions [Sudhir: 2004]. It is in this reaction that a proton gradient is generated which ultimately drives the synthesis of ATP. This ATP produced ultimately is used to produce glucose in the light-independent reactions.            
        It is possible to measure electron transfer reactions in chloroplasts and thus photosynthetic activity through the utilization of an alternate electron accepter, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), in the Hill reaction. DCIP serves as an alternate electron acceptor as it is reduced in the electron transport chain in the chloroplast. As photosynthesis proceeds in making ATP, DCIP which is a blue compound when oxidized, accepts electrons thus reducing it and turning colorless [Johnson: 2016]. As photosynthetic activity increases, DCIP is reduced becoming colorless thus resulting in lower absorbance readings.            
       Since plants do not live in isolation, it is important to investigate how various environmental factors and stressors can affect a plant’s ability to photosynthesize. In this experiment, increasing salinity and its effect on photosynthetic activity of spinach leaves’ (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts was studied [Robinson: 1983]. Chloroplasts were exposed to various salinity concentrations and their photosynthetic activity was measured through utilizing the Hill reaction. It is hypothesized that as the salt concentration increases, photosynthetic activity will decrease. This decrease in photosynthetic activity will result in fewer DCIP molecules being reduced; therefore, this will result in higher absorbance readings. 

Materials and Methods:
        To start the experiment, chloroplasts had to be extracted from spinach leaves through differential centrifugation. First, four large spinach leaves were washed, dry, and the central vein was removed. Next, 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) was added to the leaves in a chilled mortar. They were then ground up into a thick paste with a pestle until no chunks of leaf were present. An additional 10 mL of the buffer was added to the paste and grinding was continued until the leaves were homogenized. The entirety was then strained through a piece of cheesecloth that had been folded over three times into a chilled beaker. Next, 200 µL of the filtered liquid was put in a microtube marked “Sample of A” and placed on ice. The remainder of the filtered liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube labelled “A” and spun at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4°C. Once it was spun, the supernatant from “A” was poured into a new, chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube labelled “B”. Then 200 µL from “B” was placed on ice in a microtube labelled “Sample of B”. Next, “B” was spun at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4°C. Next, the supernatant suspended in “B” was transferred to a new, chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube labelled “C”. The pellet remaining in “B” was suspended with 20 mL of grinding buffer. The suspended pellet of “B” was kept on ice and used in the second exercise of the lab as the source for the chloroplasts.  	
        The second exercise in the lab involved creating the various dilutions of NaCl: 0.25 M, 0.5 M, 1.0 M. First, 25 mL of the 2M of the NaCl stock solution was added to 25 mL of water to created 50 mL of 1M NaCl solution. Next, 25 mL of the 1M NaCl solution was taken then diluted a second time with 25 mL of water to create 50 mL of the 0.5 M NaCl solution. Lastly, 25 mL of the 0.5 M NaCl solution was taken and diluted with 25 mL of water to create 50 mL of 0.25 M NaCl Solution. Next, sixteen test tubes were labelled as blank then 1-15. First the blank was made by adding 8 mL of water and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100mM phosphate, 6.5 pH). Next, the negative control (test tubes 1-3) and the positive control (test tubes 4-6) were made by adding 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of reaction buffer. Test tubes 7-9 were made by adding 6 mL of the 0.25 M NaCl solution, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Test tubes 10-12 were made by adding 6 mL of the 0.50 M NaCl solution, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Lastly, test tubes 13-15 were made by adding 6 mL of the 1.0 M NaCl solution, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer. Next, 100 µL of the chloroplasts from the tube labelled “B” were added to test tubes labelled as the blank and 4-15. Each test tube was quickly mixed. The absorbance of each was quickly measured with the spectrophotometer at 420 nm. The absorbances were marked as “Time 0”.  The samples were then placed under a light for ten minutes then the absorbance was measured at “Time 10”. The percent change for each was calculated between “Time 0” and “Time 10”. These was then repeated twice so that ultimately the samples spent a total of thirty minutes under the light with their absorbance being measured every ten minutes at “Time 20” and “Time 30”. The percent change from “Time 0” was then calculated each time and recorded. Lastly, a one tailed, not paired t-test was performed as the statistical test for our data. The statistical test compared the experimental groups absorbance’s to the absorbance’s of the positive control. 

Results:
            The data shows an overall trend that as the concentration of NaCl of increases, the smaller the percent change in absorbance as illustrated in Figure 1. In the positive control, chloroplasts performing photosynthesis in an environment with no salt, the average change in absorbance from the beginning of the experiment to the end was 100.14%. The first experimental group, chloroplasts with 0.25 M NaCl, had a percent change from Time 0 to Time 30 that was 118.47%. This group’s data for each time interval was compared to that of the positive control for statistical analysis with a one tailed, not paired t-test. The p value at the Time 10 was 0.29, it was 0.32 for Time 20, and 0.50 for Time 30. These two groups are not statistically significant from each other.               
          The second experimental group, chloroplasts with 0.50 M NaCl, had a percent change from Time 0 to Time 30 that was 91.25%. This group was compared to the positive control as well for statistical analysis as well using a one tailed, not paired t-test. The p-value for Time 10 was 0.039, for Time 20 it was 0.03, and for Time 30 it was 0.13. For the first two readings of absorbance these results are statistically significant; however, the reading at the 30-minute mark is not statistically significant.
           The third experimental group, chloroplasts with 1.0 M NaCl, had a percent change from Time 0 to Time 30 that was 69.41%. This group was compared to the positive control as well for statistical analysis as well using a one tailed, not paired t-test. The p-value for Time 10 was 0.07, for Time 20 it was 0.064, and for Time 30 it was 0.08. This third experimental group does not show statistical significance because the p-values are greater than 0.05.

Discussion:
           Overall, our data supported our hypothesis that chloroplasts in environments with increased levels of NaCl will have decreased levels of photosynthetic activity. However, it is important to recognize that our data though the trend is what we hypothesized, overall, it is not statistically significant. Through further investigation of our data and conversation with the lab group, it became understood that our spectrophotometer was set at 420 nm rather than the desired 600 nm. DCIP when it is in its oxidized state absorbs maximally at 600 nm; therefore, reading it at anything less than will result in erroneous readings that do not accurately measure the DCIP [Johnson: 2016]. This could also explain the inconsistency amongst the p-values for the second experimental group. However, with error in the spectrophotometry aside, our data did present the trend that was hypothesized. As the concentration of salt that chloroplasts were exposed to increased, the average change in absorbance at Time 30 decreased. This is due to the fact that the salt was affecting the chloroplasts ability to reduce the DCIP. This lowered ability to reduce DCIP results in a higher absorbance reading and therefore a lower percent change. This relationship is shown in Figure 1. All the experimental groups have higher absorbance readings than the positive control. Sudhakar and colleagues completed a study on Horsegram seedlings under salinity stress and concluded that the presence of increased salinity concentrations could inhibit Hill activity through potentially inhibiting of Photosystem II [Sudhakar: 1991]. This could be one potential explanation for our results.            
           It is also important to understand how salinity concentrations affect plants long term as it concerns to crop productivity. In a more recent study done by Petjukevičs and colleagues on the effect of varying levels of NaCl on chloroplasts in Elodea canadensis, it was found that prolonged exposure to high concentrations of NaCl results in the degradation of chloroplasts. They observed that these high levels of salt causes chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b to break down. Chlorophyll, which absorbs light in the chloroplast, is the pigment that initiates photosynthesis. Therefore, the destruction of chlorophyll due to abnormal salt concentrations in plants will produce lower crop yields due to plants hindered photosynthetic ability [Petjukevičs: 2015].  	
                 For our data’s trend to be confirmed and statistically significant this experiment must be repeated and measured at the correct absorbance: 600 nm. If that proves to be significant, this experiment should be widened to include higher concentrations of salt. It would also prove interesting to repeat this experiment with smaller concentrations of salt. This would allow us to examine if there is a salinity value that the chloroplasts can tolerate before photosynthesis is compromised. In Robinson’s study on salt-stressed spinach, it is discussed how not only is it the concentration of salinity but also the type of salt, the way in which the stress is introduced, and the species of focus that all influences the decreased photosynthetic activity [Robinson: 1983]. This allows for multiple areas of further research as it pertains to salinity and photosynthesis. It could also prove to be beneficial to introduce the salt to the chloroplasts in a different mechanism, perhaps in growing the spinach and watering it with salt water.  Overall, this experiment has many areas for improvement as well as future study.
