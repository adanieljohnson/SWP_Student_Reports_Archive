Title: Salt Concentration decreases the Photosynthetic Activity of Spinacia oleracea Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Plants need sunlight to utilize the process of photosynthesis. Chloroplasts capture this energy utilized in photosynthesis. The amount of photosynthetic activity exhibited by autotrophs depends on the concentration of ions around chloroplasts in the cytoplasm of plant cells. Salt is an ion that can affect the rate at which plants photosynthesize. This effect of salinity on the Spinacia oleracea, or more commonly known as Spinach, was determined by enriching the chloroplasts by differential centrifugation, as well as the quantification of photosynthetic activity reduction with the Hill Reaction at different salt concentrations. There was a significant statistical difference between the average percent change of photosynthetic activity over time between the 0.2M concentration and 0.4M concentration sodium reaction buffer, as well as the 0.2M concentration and 0.6M concentration sodium reaction buffer (Fs=4.02, df=3, p-value=0.016). This can be explained by the interruption of thylakoid complexes by salt ions.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process by which autotrophs convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen through the utilization of light. Chloroplasts are the organelle in autotrophs responsible for the capture of sunlight and energy production; they contain chlorophyll, a pigment, that absorbs photons of light.The number and location of chloroplasts varies in different cells and tissues of autotrophs. The chloroplasts capture energy through the use of stomata, which have guard cells that control the stomatal opening and closing. This conductance of the stomata is controlled by environmental conditions surrounding the autotroph. Ions, gases, and light enter the autotroph through the stomata opening. In a study, the presence of sodium-chloride in the water provided to Spinacia oleracea, more commonly known as Spinach, resulted in a decrease in photosynthetic activity [Downton: 1985].  The Spinacia oleracea grew thicker with less chlorophyll per unit area [Downton: 1985]. This resulted in a decrease in the stomatal opening; thereby, decreasing the carbon dioxide levels in the tissue of Spinacia oleracea in order to increase water use efficiency [Downton: 1985].The stomatal closing is the result of the guard cells lose water in response to being surrounded in a high salt concentration environment [Downton: 1985]. In another study looking at the salt stress in Spinacia oleracea, salt concentrations 0.1M NaCl grew thicker leaves, decreasing stomatal opening [Guenther: 1987]. This stomatal closing resulted in a decrease in photosynthetic activity [Guenther: 1987]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the photosynthetic activity of Spinacia oleracea treated with a high concentration sodium reaction buffer will be statistically different than the Spinacia oleracea treated with no sodium reaction buffer. 

Materials and Methods:
Mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes were placed into crushed ice to cool. The large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves were removed; then, they were rinsed with tap water and blotted with paper towels.The spinach leaves were placed inside the mortar and 10 ml of cold grinding buffer containing 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0 was poured in the mortar. The spinach was ground until it is a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves were left. 10 mL of grinding buffer was mixed mix with the spinach and previous grinding buffer. The entire volume of grinding buffer and spinach was strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. The remaining green liquid was transferred to a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “A”, and spun at two-hundred times the force of gravity, one thousand two-hundred rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degree celsius, a balance tube was included in the centrifuge. The supernatant was poured out of the tube marked “A” into the second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube marked “B”. The debris at the bottom of tube “A” was not transferred. The 50 mL tube containing chloroplast suspension, tube “B”, was centrifuged at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. The supernatant was poured into a clean 50 mL tube marked “C”.The pellet was not disturbed. Tube “B” was placed on ice where 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. Thirteen large test tubes were numbered 0-12 and placed in a tube rack. The spectrophotometer was set it to read at 600nm. Test tube #0, the blank, contained 8 mL of distilled water and 2 mL of reaction buffer. Test tubes #1-9 contained 6 mL of distilled water and 2 mL of 130mM DCPIP. In test tubes #1-3, 2 mL reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #4-6, 1 mL 2M sodium reaction buffer and 1 mL of 2M sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #7-9, 2 mL of sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. In test tubes #10-12, 5 mL of distilled water, 2mL of 130mM DCPIP, no reaction buffer, and 3 mL of sodium reaction buffer was placed in each. Ten microliters of chloroplast from test tube “B” were placed in each test tube #0-12 and the absorbance of each tube was taken at time 0, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes. The average percent change in absorbance between the first, second, and third ten minutes was recorded. The one-way ANOVA test compared the different concentrations of sodium reaction buffer, 0M, 0.2M, 0.4M, and 0.4M to time. The Tukey-Kramer test was used in conjunction with the ANOVA test to find which average concentrations were significantly different from each other.

Results:
There was a significant statistical difference between the average percent change of photosynthetic activity over time between the 0.2M concentration and 0.4M concentration sodium reaction buffer, as well as the 0.2M concentration and 0.6M concentration sodium reaction buffer (Fs=4.02, df=3, p-value=0.016). There was a general increase in the average change in photosynthetic activity over time for all concentrations, as seen in Figure 1. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis was supported in regards to the average percent change in absorbance comparing 0.2M and 0.4M, as well as 0.2M and 0.6M sodium reaction buffer concentrations; the p-value was less than 0.05. In a study investigating the effects of NaCl Stress on the photosynthetic activity of Mangrove Bruguiera parviflora chloroplasts, it was found that NaCl induces oxidative stress in chloroplasts caused alterations in the thylakoid membrane [Parida:2003]. The concentrations were only tested at 0.1M NaCl, 0.2M NaCl, and 0.4M NaCl and the absorption was recorded from 360-750nm [Parida:2003]. Our investigation only investigated the photosynthetic activity of concentrations of 0.2M, 0.4M, 0.6M NaCl at absorbances of 600nm. The samples treated with 0.4M NaCl had a significant structural decrease tha resulted in less photons of light being absorbed. The inefficientcy of the structure to absorb photons in chloroplasts of the mangrove Bruguiera parviflora plants in salt stressed environment can help explain the signficant decrease photosynthetic activity of the plant Spinacia oleracea at 0.4M concentration sodium reaction buffer compared to 0.2M concentration sodium reaction buffer. However, the model organism for the investigations were different, but they were both autotrophs and utilize the same organelles for photosynthetic activity, chloroplasts.
In another study investigating photosynthesis and ion content of leaves and isolated chloroplasts of salt-stressed Spinacia oleracea, plants subject to 0.025 to 0.2M NaCl concentrations did not decrease in any photosynthetic potential [Robinson: 1983]. It was found that the rates of electron transport by isolated intact chloroplasts and by thylakoids were only 10 to 20% below those plants that were not treated [Robinson: 1983]. In the study, the chloroplasts had been extracted by differential centrifugation, but instead of measuring the photosynthetic activity reduction through the Hills reaction, the investigation measured oxygen evolution was by polarographically with Hansatech oxygen electrode [Robinson: 1983]. This was discussed to be the result of damage to the chloroplast during the experiment, or the result of chloroplasts not being in the site of metabolic activity, the cytoplasm [Robinson: 1983]. This could explain why salt reaction buffer concentrations of 0M and 0.2M were not statistically significant in our investigation.  Even though, the study did not find that the photosynthetic activity was decreased significantly, the addition of NaCl to the nutrient solution did result in a significant decrease in biomass, as well as stomatal conductance [Robinson: 1983]. 
In another study investigating effects of salts and electron transport on the conformation of isolated chloroplasts, salt caused the chloroplasts to shrink in response to modification of the organization of chloroplasts [Izawa: 1966]. The study investigated the chloroplasts by looking at the optical density over time where the concentration of NaCl subjected to the chloroplast was only 0.5M [Izawa: 1966]. The interference by concentrations of NaCl in the presence of chloroplast explain the decrease in photosynthetic activity of Spinacia olercera. The effects of salt stress on chloroplast photosynthetic activity is crucial to understanding how nutrients in crop fields, or plants near the ocean or subject to salt runoff after snow storms biologically interact with their environment. This can help prevent the degradation of plant life in urban areas that are subject to salt runoff from salting the roads during the winter.
