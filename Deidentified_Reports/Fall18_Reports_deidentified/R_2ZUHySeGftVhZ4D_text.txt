Title: Effect of calcium ionophore injection on muscle twitch amplitude of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Calcium plays a pivotal role in skeletal muscle contraction, and the leg muscle of a Rania pipiens is a prime example; with an adequate calcium supply, the muscle can contract even if the leg has been frozen for days.  In this experiment, we determine the effect of an injection of A23187 (calcium ionophore) on the twitch amplitude of the frog muscle, in relation to the twitch amplitude of the muscle before the injection.  Our expectation was that the amplitude of the injected muscle would be greater than that of the controll muscle, due to a greater amount of calcium available.  However, while the average difference between the two favored the amplitude of the injected muscle, the difference was not close to statistically significent (P-value of 0.590 from a paired t_test).  While the experiment implies that a higher calcium concentration in the muscle has little impact on muscle twitch amplitude, it is possible that a higher concentration could impact the amplitude and length of muscle tetanus in a skeletal muscle of a frog (or any other organism with skeletal muscle).

Introduction:
This experiment tests the effects of a calcium injection on the muscle twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens gastrocnemus (leg) muscle.  Rania pipiens (a frog) is an ideal species to use for the experiment because its leg muscles can contract after being frozen for days at a time, so the legs do not have to be as fresh as other species.  In addition, their leg anatomy is relatively simple, and that combines with their small leg size to make for an easy dissection.  During muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (through the ryanodine receptor) due to an action potential that is carried through the neuromuscular junction and comes through the muscle cell’s membrane [Johnson: 2018].   The calcium then binds to troponin on the actin filament, which leads to the “power stroke” involving a myosin head binding to actin.  ATP causes the myosin head to release, and hydrolysis of ATP brings the myosin head back to the cocked position.  If calcium is unavailable, the muscle relaxes, but if calcium is available outside the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the contraction will continue.  While Bull and his colleagues determined that the amount of ryanodine released impacts the opening and closing of the calcium channels [Bull: 1989], it is unclear how a calcium injection from an outside force would impact the muscle contraction.  We as a group will attempt to provide clarity on the topic, as we will stimulate muscle contractions in the frog leg and measure the muscle twitch amplitude of the frog leg both before and after a calcium injection has been administered.  We hypothesize that if we raise the calcium concentration in the leg muscle, through an injection of calcium ionophore (otherwise known as A23187), then the voltage of the muscle twitch amplitude will be greater in the calcium-injected muscle than in the controll muscle.  The greater concentration of calcium will mean that the muscle has a greater ability to contract, which will lead to a higher voltage reading of the muscle twitch amplitude.

Materials and Method:
We gathered 3 frog legs and 100mM A23187 and isolated the sciatic nerve in each frog leg by isolating it from the gastrocnemus muscle.  We then connected the muscle to sleeve electrodes, and set up LabScribe, applying values of 1.5 to the pulse amplitude, 1 to the number of pulses, 5 to the pulse width (in milliseconds), and 1 to the frequency (Hz).  We applied the stimulus to the frog muscle and calculated the amplitude of the muscle twitch (in volts), using the LabScribe technology.  We repeated the stimulus two more times, before disconnecting the muscle from the electrodes, and injecting 0.2 Ml of 100mM A23187 (calcium ionophore).  We waited 5 minutes to allow the muscle to rest, before reattaching the electrodes to the muscle.  We then ran three trials of electrical stimulations and calculated the voltage for the twitch amplitude in each trial.  We also calculated the average voltage for the three trials before and three trials after the injection.  After all trials were completed, we removed the frog leg from the electrodes, and repeated the process with the two frog legs that had not yet been stimulated.  We calculated the average twitch amplitudes for the pre-injection and post-injection trials of each frog.  We used a paired t_test to calculate the difference between the average controll muscle twitch amplitude and the average calcium-injected amplitude in each frog, as well as to calculate the standard deviation between the controll and experimental averages.

Results:
The visual difference between the twitch amplitudes of the controll and experimental trials appeared to be negligible – unless there is a massive voltage difference between amplitudes, the frog leg doesn’t show a huge difference in twitch between trials.  Frog 1 (across 3 trials) had an average controll amplitude of 0.502 volts, and an average experimental amplitude of 0.474 volts, (Fig. 1) for a difference of -0.028 volts.  Frog 2 had average controll and experimental values of 0.295 and 0.308 volts, respectively, (Fig. 1) which gives a difference of 0.013 volts.  Frog 3 had average controll and experimental values of 0.078 and 0.146 volts, respectively, (Fig. 1) and a difference of 0.068 volts.  Our paired t_test gives us an average difference of 0.018 ± 0.048 volts, with a d.f. of 2, a t-value of 0.635, and a P-value of 0.590 (from a paired t_test).  Since the p_value is greater than 0.05, the difference in muscle twitch amplitude between the pre- and post-injection muscles is not statistically significent.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the injection of calcium ionophore would cause an increase in muscle twitch amplitude of a frog leg, was not supported by the experiment.  While the average change in voltage between pre-and post-injection muscles was positive, the P-value was so large that the difference in voltage is not statistically significent.  Such a conclusion makes sense; the muscle will most likely have enough calcium for three separate twitches, so injecting calcium for the stimulations to happen one at a time may be unnecessary.  In addition, it only takes 5-10 nM of ryanodine to activate a calcium channel, so calcium is usually not at a premium for twitches [Bull: 1989].  While it is possible that there actually is an increase in muscle twitch amplitude due to calcium injection (that is simply too small to be significent), the more likely answer is that a calcium injection has little to no effect on muscle twitches from stimuli. However, a calcium injection could have an impact on a muscle tetanus; as Cannell and Allen pointed out, [Ca2+] experiences a rapid and large fall during tetanus in frog muscle, as the repeated stimuli lead to a slowed rate of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and a rise in myoplasmic (contractile ) calcium [Cannell 1984].  Thus, a calcium injection that precedes a muscle tetanus could theoretically prolong the amplitude and time of the tetanus in any skeletal muscle, compared to a muscle that does not undergo the injection.  Our findings, along with Cannell and Allen’s findings, could be used by athletes to gain an advantage in building up their muscles – while injecting calcium into their bodies probably won’t improve their reflexes from a stimulus, it could improve their muscle tetanus, which would enable them to hold a contraction longer.  Athletes that would benefit from an injection would include those with mainly fast-twitch muscles (i.e. weightlifters).

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Effect of calcium ionophore injection on the change in muscle twitch amplitude of a Rania pipiens leg muscle.  The twitch amplitude of the muscle after the calcium injection was higher than the pre-injection twitch in legs 2 and 3 and was slightly less than the pre-injection twitch in leg 1.  The first three stimulations were applied separately, before the muscle was injected with 0.2 Ml of 100mM calcium ionophore and given 5-minute rest period.  The last three stimulations were then conducted, with the amplitude recorded for all stimulations.  Each twitch amplitude displayed was calculated as the average of three trials, meaning that each frog has two data points displayed.*************************************************************************
