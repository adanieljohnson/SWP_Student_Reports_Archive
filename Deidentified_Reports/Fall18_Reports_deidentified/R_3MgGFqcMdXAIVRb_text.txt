Title: How the external factor of shelter impacts agnostic behavior in male Betta Splendins 

Abstract:
To understand the physiological purpose of behavior and how it has evolved you must bring together ecology, genetics and evolutionary biology. I observed how intraspecific agnostic behaviors exhibited by Betta Splendins changed when shelter was present versus when it was not. It is important to understand how the longevity of intraspecific agnostic behaviors changed when shelter was present and the impact it has on sexual selection. In order to test the difference, I tested six pairs of Betta fish, with and without the presence of an aquarium dinosaur skull and recorded quantifiably data. The data suggests that there is a significent difference between behavior exhibited with and without shelter present. The fish that showed a high level of agnostic behavior even with shelter present could suggest that sexual selection may favor elaborate male agnostic behavior. 

Introduction:
Ethology brings together ecology, genetics and evolutionary biology to understand both physiological purposes for behavior and how it has evolved. I will focus on intraspecific agnostic behaviors exhibited by Betta Splendins [Johnson: 2016]. Betta Splendins are common aquarium fish that originated in Southeast Asia. Both wild and domestic Betta’s will react strongly and aggressively to the appearance of another Betta’s, this is an intraspecific behavior [Cain: 1980].  I will concentrate on the behavior in order to understand cost and benefits, and the role they play in evolution. I will observe the Betta fish in a variety of situations and in response to an aquarium dinosaur skull. I am looking to observe the interaction between the fish in response to the introduction of shelter. I hypothesized that the presence of shelter will allow the Betta fish to flee, causing a reduction of the longevity of agnostic behavior. 

Materials and Method:
In order to collect relevant data, I gathered four male Betta fish. The four fish were divided into a compartmentalized aquarium, each separated by a removable wall. In order to test the behavior, I removed the divides to test each of the six pairs. I tested the behavior of each pair without the presence of shelter and with the presence of the aquarium dinosaur skull. I watched for agnostic behaviors and then observed behavior and quantifiably recorded it. Compile data and perform a statistical one tailed t_test to find the p_value. 

Results:
According to the data complied mean aggression is greater when Betta fish do not have shelter present. The mean aggression displayed by Betta fish without shelter was 45.5 while with shelter it was 12.0. This shows the significent difference between the mean agnostic behavior that shelter caused. The difference was found to be statistically significent (degree of freedom 5, t-value=8.4862, p_value=0.000373).

Discussion:
The results supported our initial hypothesis, agnostic behavior declines when shelter is introduced. The Betta fish acted with more aggression when there was no shelter in all six pairs. The Light Blue fish and Dark Blue fish had to be separated because of aggression when there was no shelter but showed little to no aggression after the shelter was introduced. The Red/Blue fish and Rainbow fish were the only pair that needed to be separated when the shelter was present, however their agnostic behavior was abnormally high with and without the shelter. This aggression could be related to the physical nature of the Rainbow Fish who displayed the most agnostic behaviors in all pairings. Prior social experience plays a role in male Betta agnostic behavior [Bronstein: 1983]. The agnostic behavior presented links to sexual selection, cost of reproduction is thought to cause female preference for elaborate male agnostic behavior [Justus: 2018]. The aquarium and it’s dividers was one limitation of the experiment, a recent study found that chemical cues associated with plastic tank dividers can influence Bettas' social behavior [Bronstein: 1983].
