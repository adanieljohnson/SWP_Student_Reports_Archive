Title: The effects of caffeine on the movement of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The effects of caffeine on movement were evaluated in Physarum polycephalum. Physarum uses a signal transduction pathway to controll its movement, more specifically a G-protein coupled receptor pathway in which cAMP is the second messenger. The signal pathway is stopped when cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase. Caffeine is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, and inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity mimics the stimulation of cAMP production. It was predicted that caffeine treatment would result in increased movement of physarum. The PDA plates were treated with different caffeine concentrations, then physarum was added to the plates and its movement was measured after 24 hours in the light incubator. There were no valid results from this experiment, and this could have been due to the disruption of the resting phase in physarum as the slime mold was moved into and out of the incubator several times. 

Introduction:
Organisms respond to many different stimuli in the environment around them. Responding to different stimuli allows organisms to gather the resources they need to survive. Physarum is a slime mold that spends most of its life in the plasmodial stage,  a yellow flat mass that can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. Physarum lives in damp decomposing leaves and eats ground debris, it engulfs bacteria and other organic debris and then actively transports hydrolytic enzymes into the food vacuoles in order to digest them. Physarum crawls by extending its leading edge using actin microfilaments. It remains a multicellular plasmodium as long as it remains in a dark damp environment, otherwise it moves around looking for food. In the lab physarum is grown on a petri dish using 2% agar and oatmeal flakes, or potato dextrose agar. Physarum displays a complex array of behaviors in response to the stimuli in its environment. These observable behaviors include cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis movement towards or away from a light source, and chemotaxis movement towards or away from the sensed molecules from the environment [Johnson: 2018].    

Physarum uses intracellular signal transduction pathways to respond to its environment. Much of the behavior in physarum is regulated through G-protein coupled receptors and ion-coupled receptors. A specific example of the G-protein coupled receptor pathway in physarum is the cAMP mediated pathway, in which cAMP is used as a second messenger and activates the signalling pathway. During the cAMP mediated signal pathway cAMP diffuses through the cell and binds to several substrates. One enzyme that is commonly activated by cAMP is protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates many other enzymes which can activate their activity, causing the signal to continue to travel down the pathway. This signal pathway is stopped when cAMP is broken down by phosphodiesterase [Johnson: 2018]. Because phosphodiesterase is responsible for breaking down cAMP, inhibiting phosphodiesterase activity can often produce the same effect as stimulating the production of cAMP. This experiment tested whether caffeine’s inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity in physarum would cause increased movement in response to light. Caffeine was used because it is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase activity [Kincaid: 1979]. Caffeine prevents the production of phosphodiesterase, and this mimics the continued production of cAMP. It was therefore predicted that movement in response to the light source would increase due to the continued production of cAMP. To test this, varying concentrations of caffeine were added to PDA plates with physarum, and the effect of caffeine on movement was measured. 

Materials and Method:
Preparing Caffeine concentrations:
1Ml of 20mM caffeine solution was diluted with 19Ml of water to make a 0.05mol solution. And 0.5Ml of 20mM caffeine solution was diluted with 19.5Ml of water to make a 0.025mol solution. 

Preparing the plates: 
Three controll PDA plates were labeled as controll and two squares of 1cmx1cm physarum were added to the center of each plate. The lids were then secured with tape and the plates wrapped in foil, with a 1cmx1cm window cut out at the bottom of each plate. The plates were then labeled again on the outside of the foil. 

Three PDA plates were labeled 10mM caffeine, and 5Ml of caffeine solution was added and spread around each plate. After 10 mins the excess caffeine solution was blotted off using kimwipes. Two squares of 1cmx1cm physarum were then added to the center of each plate. The lids were then secured with tape and the plates wrapped in foil, with a 1cmx1cm window cut out at the bottom of each plate. The plates were then labeled again on the outside of the foil.

Two squares of 1cmx1cm physarum were then added to the center of each plate. The lids were then secured with tape and the plates wrapped in foil, with a 1cmx1cm window cut out at the bottom of each plate. The plates were then labeled again on the outside of the foil. 

All 9 plates were then placed in the light box incubator for 24 hours. After 24 hours the distance of physarum migration was measured in each plate, and the distance as well as the direction of the migration was recorded. A one way ANOVA test was used to compare the means of each group to each other to determine if the concentration of caffeine had a significent effect on the movement in each group.

Results:
The results from this experiment were inconclusive as there was no movement in the 10mM Caffeine treatment group, and the 20mM Caffeine treatment group moved the same distance as the controll group. 

If the experiment had proceeded as expected, then there should have been increased movement in the two caffeine treatment groups, as shown below with the example data of what should have been observed. 

The graph shows that the average distance moved was the greatest in the 20mM Caffeine treatment group, an average distance of 6.34mm. The average distance moved was greater in the 10mM Caffeine treatment group than the controll group, an average distance of 4.67mm. The treatment group with the highest concentration of caffeine showed the greatest movement, but both caffeine treatment groups had greater movement than the controll group. 

Discussion:
We expected to see greater movement in the two caffeine treatment groups. Caffeine is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and this mimics the stimulation of cAMP production [Beavo: 1970]. cAMP activates the signalling pathway and affects the motile behavior of physarum, therefore increased intracellular cAMP concentration should have resulted in increased motility in physarum via enzyme inhibition [Adamatzyky: 2013]. This is shown in the results that show the expected observations for this experiment. 

Our results however did not support the hypothesis, as there was no movement in the 10mM Caffeine treatment group, and the 20mM Caffeine treatment group moved the same distance as the controll group. A possible explanation as to why the expected results were not obtained could be due to the disruption of the resting phase in physarum. For resting phase to be successfully maintained in physarum, the continued presence of the inducing stimulus is required, and the resting phase is important in the development of physarum [Dove: 1980]. Changing the stimulus that the physarm was exposed to, such as changing the temperature and light exposure, could have disrupted the resting phase. 

We moved the physarum into and out of the incubator several times throughout the experiment, and this changed the temperature and also the light intensity that the physarum was exposed to. Exposing the physarum to different temperatures, including cold temperatures in the lab, could have disrupted the normal development of physarum. The temperature in the lab would get colder at nights, and this decrease in temperature could have negatively affected the physarum. A previous study found that microfilament structures in physarum disintegrated in cold temperatures [Furuya: 1986], and this could have inhibited the movement of the physarum in our experiment. Exposing the physarum to different light intensities could have also disrupted the normal development of physarum. The light the physarum was exposed to changed when the plates were wrapped and unwrapped several times throughout the experiment. Physarum undergoes sporulation in response to light [Weaver: 1976], therefore changing the light exposure could have affected the normal development and movement of our physarum.
