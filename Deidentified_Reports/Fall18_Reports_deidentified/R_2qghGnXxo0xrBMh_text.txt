Title: The effect of a sodium channel blocker on the threshold voltage in the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipiens

Abstract:
An organism’s action potentials and the subsequent muscle contractions play an extremely important role in the organisms well-being.  One crucial element in an action potential is the cell membrane depolarizing past the threshold voltage. In our experiment we investigated the role of a sodium channel blocker on the threshold voltage of the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle through the sciatic nerve, in which we hypothesized that a sodium channel blocker would cause a change in the threshold voltage. We used three frog legs, measured the threshold voltage before and after we injected a sodium channel blocker into the gastrocnemius muscle. We performed a Paired T-test with a confidence level of 95% and got a p-value of 0.422 so therefore we failed to reject the null hypothesis that the sodium channel blocker had a significant effect on the threshold voltage. We then concluded that it is necessary to go in greater detail to more accurately get the threshold voltage as well as experiment with various concentrations of sodium channel blockers to see if the results are consistent across concentrations. 

Introduction:
Movement of an animal requires a communication mechanism between the central nervous system and the muscular system. Most organisms do this through sending action potentials from motor neurons to the various muscles in its body. An example of this process is the Rana pipiens and its sciatic nerve which stimulates the gastrocnemius muscle. Rana pipiens and other similar organisms, send signals through motor units, which are broken down into a motor neuron and the several myofibers which it ennervates (muscle cell)[Johnson: 2016]. These motor neurons send a signal to the myofibrils it is connected to by sending an action potential down its axon and through the membrane and t-tublules of the muscle cells. An important molecule involved in this is Na+. Na+ is responsible for depolarizing the membrane past a threshold and starting the action potential. Since and action potential is an all or none event, in order to get a larger contraction (that is a larger amplitude) it needs to either recruit more motor neurons (spatial summation) or recruit them more frequently (temporal summation). In our experiment, we will study the effect of a Na+ channel inhibitor, which effectively decreases the amount of sodium available because sodium ions aren’t able to go in or out of the cell membrane as efficiently. A previous study found that in the Cockroaches giant axon a sodium deficient solution interfered with the action potential [Yamasaki: 1959]. Due to this result, we predict that if we add a Na+ channel blocker to the gastrocnemius muscle, then there will be a change in the threshold voltage.

Materials and Methods:
We used 3 frog legs from the Rana pipiens species and each frog leg was used in both groups in the experiment. The first of which was the control group which was tested under no alterations (the details how they were tested will be described later) followed by, the second group, the experimental group, received 1 mL of Na+ inhibitor. We separated the gastrocnemius muscle from the rest of the frog’s leg and kept it facing upwards while taut. Several pins were put in the frog’s leg to keep it stable. Also, the sciatic nerve was connected directly to the force transducer, where we used a frequency of 1 Hz and Voltages of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0. Then we recorded the force (in volts) of the resulting contraction (there may or may not have been a contraction). We then ran a Paired T-Test on the threshold voltage.

Results:
The Control Group had a mean threshold voltage of 0.2666 while the experimental group had a mean response voltage of 0.40 and standard deviations of 0.115 and 0.346 respectively (Fig. 1). The 2-Sided-Paired T-Test gave the results (t=1, p=0.422, and df=2) with a confidence level of 95% and therefore an alpha of 0.05.

Discussion:
Due to us failing to reject our null hypothesis (p-value was greater than 0.05) we concluded that adding a sodium channel inhibitor does not cause a significant change in threshold voltage. This result is most likely due to the action potential being an all or none event so injecting the Na+ inhibitor wouldn’t cause the action potential to stop once it got to the gastrocnemius muscle. Also, the amount of motor units stimulated would most likely be the same because the same nerve is being activated with the same voltage so therefore each of the associated motor units would also be activated. This therefore causes the threshold voltage to not be significantly different between the two groups. Our results were similar with a previous experiment that found that when the cockroach’s giant axon is in a sodium deficient solution the action potential was slower [Yamasaki: 1959]. This is because a sodium deficient solution is analogous to a sodium channel blocker in that they both allow the axon to have functionally less access to sodium than they normally have access to. Another important part of this experiment was that in the sodium deficient solution, the action potential was slower but still occurred. A complicating factor could be that we injected the sodium channel blocker into the muscle but stimulated the sciatic nerve. Since we stimulated the sciatic nerve, the action potential had already started by the time it reached the muscle and since an action potential is either off or on it continued albeit possibly slower but still continued propagating and eventually causing the muscle to contract at the same threshold voltage of the control group. An area for further research would be to determine whether stimulating the sciatic nerve versus the gastrocnemius muscle directly would yield a different result, and if so whether a sodium channel blocker would impair the Action Potential. Our experiment suggests that a few mis-folded or mutated membrane proteins for either Na+ or K+ doesn’t influence the depolarization or repolarization of the membrane and therefore won’t prevent a muscle from contracting.
