Title: Effect of Tamoxifen Citrate on the growth of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
The effect of tamoxifen citrate on the growth of Physarum polycephalum was tested by measuring the migration rate under normal conditions and under application of 1: 19 diluted tamoxifen solution. Water agar was prepared as cultures. Oatmeal flakes were food source to attract migration of the Physarum. 6 controll and 6 experimental petri dishes were prepared and the migration distance on each dish was recorded after 20 hours interval. No growth was observed on all cultures except for two out liners in the controll group. Expected data and figure were presented. A paired t_test was used to analyze expected data and the results supported our hypothesis that the tamoxifen will slow the migration of Physarum polycephalum towards food source. For our experiment, the depression of migration of Physarum polycephalum could be explained by changes on the osmotic pressure and other external conditions such as the ion concentration.

Introduction:
The binding of signaling molecules, the ligands, to receptors that trigger events inside the cell is involved in the majority of signaling pathways. The binding of a signaling molecule with a receptor causes a change in the conformation of the receptor, which is the receptor activation. That signal transduction pathways allow cells to respond to their external and internal environments, and is thus essential in the biological system. (Hickey: 2008). The signal transduction pathways can be explored by studying the slime, Physarum polycephalum, which is a model organism mold. Physarum polycephalum has multinucleate syncytium, which gives it the structure of multiple nuclei contained within a single plasma membrane. All the nuclei in one mass can undergo mitosis at the same time. Each Physarum mass or a plasmodium behaves as a single giant cell. Its behavior can be observed directly without examining under the microscope. External influences such as changes in phototactic or chemotaxis conditions stimulate the slow network movement of Physarum on the fast shuttle streaming.  As a plasmodium behaves as a system of loosely coupled nonlinear oscillators, each small component oscillates at a frequency determined by local energy input and feedback conditions. (Durham: 1976). It is suggested in the context that chemicals can systematically affect the frequency of each plasmodium and induce attraction or repulsion from the organism.  (Durham: 1976).  In the lab, Physarum polycephalum samples were planted in cultures of 2% agar melted in distilled water on plastic petri dishes.  In contrast with the controll group, the experimental group cultures were prepared by adding the protein kinase C inhibitor, diluted tamoxifen citrate solution onto the water agar. Each culture was applied with oatmeal as food source. Previous studies reveal that the effect of tamoxifen on protein kinase C activity highly relies on the phospholipid environment of the enzyme. As an example, tamoxifen inhibited the enzyme with respect to phospholipid yet did not affect phosphorylation of the Mr 28,000 protein. An explanation is that the effect of tamoxifen on protein kinase C activity highly relies on the phospholipid environment of the enzyme. (Issandou: 1990). We focus on the effects of tamoxifen on protein kinase C in the signal transduction of Physarum polycephalum. We hypothesized that the tamoxifen will slow the migration of Physarum polycephalum towards food source. 


Materials and Method:
Water agar  were prepared in 12 petri dishes as cultures. The plates were divided by half as controll group and experimental group. 19 portions of water and 1 portion of tamoxifen were added into a beaker. The diluted tamoxifen solution was poured on the 6 experimental plates. The plates were left soaked for 10 minutes. Excessive solution were removed from the plates. A center square with 1 cm sides was cut out from each of the plate by spatula. The spatula was sterilized in 95% ethanol solution for 15 seconds after each use. A square with sides of 1 cm was cut from the Physarum stock plate and was filled in to the block on each petri dish plate. On each plate, 5 to 6 oatmeal flakes were distributed on the surface. The lids of the petri dish plates were taped. The samples were kept in dark and retrieved after 18 hours for measurement of the migration of Physarum polycephalum. For each sample, the time interval and the distance from the side of the block to the tip of the longest growing strand were recorded. 


Results:
As expected, in the controll group, the Physarum polycephalum would grow and move toward the oatmeal flakes on the water agar medium. In experimental group, the tamoxifen inhibits the protein kinase C, which is an important component on the IP3 mediated signaling pathway. Since the IP3 pathway is blocked and signal transduction can only go through other pathways, the migration of the Physarum polycephalum would be slowed down. Growth of Physarum polycephalum would be observed on all petri dishes as expected. The experimental samples would exhibit less migration than the controll samples. In our experiment, migration of the Physarum was not observed in all samples except for two out liners in the controll group. The average migration distance of the controll samples is possibly 18.2 mm. The average migration distance of the experimental samples is possibly 7.5 mm. Paired t_test of the expected data results in that p=8.33E-5, t=2.57 and d.f.=5. The p value is less than 0.05. As the expected data suggests, there is significent difference between the controll group and the experimental group in the migration or growth rate of the Physarum polycephalum. As the result, our hypothesis that the tamoxifen will slow the migration of Physarum polycephalum would be supported.


Discussion:
In our experiment, the expected data was not obtained. No growth was observed on all the petri dishes except for two out liners in the controll group. One potential cause of the suppressed migration is sugar. Previous study emphasized on the effects of carbohydrates on Physarumâ€™s migration.  In the experiment similar to what we performed, the Physarum polycephalum was fed by oat flakes and planted on water agar to test direct effect of chemical substance on migration. As suggested in the previous article, our experiment was not effective in determining how the substance affects the migration rate, since the nutritional status of the plasmodium was not determined. (Knowles: 1978) The carbohydrate nutrition of the plasmodia was examined. The sugar in the cultures changed the carbohydrate concentration and thus affect the growth of the Physarum. A conclusion was drawn that the depression of migration rate was possibly caused by osmotic pressure that affected the locomotion of migration and the permeation of sugar into the plasmodia body. (Knowles: 1978).  In our experiment, the introduction of food source, the oat flakes changed the carbohydrate level on the water agar and as a result the sugar could induce depression on the migration of Physarum. Other studies emphasized on how factors affect the chemotactic response of Physarum polycephalum. Osmolarity, pH value, temperature, and specific ion concentrations are environmental conditions that could determine the migration rate of oriented plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum. (Denbo: 1976). It was determined that osmotic withdrawal of water from the plasmodium shifts the sol to gel equilibrium in the direction of gel thus cause the reduction in migration rate. (Denbo: 1976). In addition, all tested cations exhibited inhibitory effects on migration rate by a common mechanism at high concentrations. (Denbo: 1976). In our experiment, all of the environmental factors could cause inhibition on the migration of Physarum polycephalum. Though all the samples were kept in darkness and light is prohibited, other factors such as the moisture and temperature were not kept stable for the migration of Physarum. As expected, the tamoxifen inhibits the protein kinase C and the signaling pathway would be blocked as result. The migration of the Physarum would appear slow with application of tamoxifen than under normal condition. Our hypothesis would be supported by expected data. In the future, we will shift our focus on exploring external influences that affect the migration rate of the Physarum polycephalum, such as the induced change on the osmotic pressure. We will also apply different substances to test the chemotactic response of Physarum polycephalum. Substances that attract or repulse migration of Physarum would be studied under controllled environment.
