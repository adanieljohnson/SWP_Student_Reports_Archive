Title: The Photosynthesis Activity is Higher in Spinach than in Kale Under Light and Dark Environments

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the energy harvesting process of plants. Plants prefer a shaded environment have higher photosynthesis under less intense light condition while plants prefer light environment have higher photosynthesis under more intense light condition. In the experiment, we want to find out the how the activity of photosynthesis under light environment and dark environment differ between spinach and kale. According to previous studies, Kale prefers shaded environment more than spinach does. Our hypothesis is Spinach has a higher photosynthesis activity in light while Kale has a higher photosynthesis activity in dark. Our data shows that Spinach has a significantly higher photosynthetic activity than Kale in both light and dark. Because the lower the absorbance and the photosynthesis activity level is conversely related. We conclude that the spinach has a significantly higher photosynthesis activity than kale in both the light and the dark environment. This result does not support our hypothesis. In this experiment, we did not take different leave surface area in Spinach and Kale into consideration. We suggest that to find out the light preference of Spinach and Kale, a further experiment should be done on the net photosynthesis in the two species. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process which plants harvest energy from light protons. It is carried out by photosystem  I and II with chlorophyll-protein complexes. The light proton with high energy hits photosystem II and excites the electron. The excited electron is passed on to photosystem I, and the energy released pumps protons across thylakoid membrane to create a proton gradient. In photosystem I, NADP+ is reduced by the excited electron to be NADPH. This creates an accumulation of access protons which pumps protons back into stroma through ATP synthesis complex to produce ATP. Light proton is the major driver in photosynthesis [Iwasa, 2016]. But instead of always preferring a higher light intensity, different plants prefer different light intensity. A previous study shows that the photosynthesis rate of Jeffersonia into increased as the shading area increased [Rhie: 2014]. In this experiment, we aim to find out how the photosynthesis activity in different plant species would respond to different light intensity. Kale and Spinach are the two subject plants studied in this experiment because these two species are sometimes involved in intercropping. Studying how the photosynthesis activity is deferred in light and dark in the two species can lead to a better design of intercropping timing and environment. A study showed that a small intensity of light over a long day allows more photosynthesis activity than a large intensity of light over a short day in Kale. This indicates that Kale prefers a shading environment [Monteith: 1965]. Our hypothesis is Spinach has a higher photosynthesis activity in light while Kale has a higher photosynthesis activity in dark.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we are going to determine the photosynthesis activity of Kale and Spinach by measuring the absorbance of Kale and Spinach samples using a spectrometer. The lower the absorbance is, the higher the photosynthesis activity level is. The reaction buffers for Spanish and Kale, 00mM phosphates at pH 6.5, was prepared as with the following steps. We took 6 Kale leaves and removed the veins. We put them in an iced mortar. We added 10 mL of Grinding Buffer, which is 400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8.0, into the mortar. We ground the leaves with a pestle until there was no vein left. We added another 10 mL of Grinding Buffer and ground it until we got a thick green paste. We strained the paste through a three-layer cheesecloth into a chilled beaker. We transferred the solution from the beaker to a chilled microtube and span it at 200G for 3 minutes at 4 degree Celsius. We left out the debris and span the solution at 100G for 10 minutes at 4 degree Celsius. We left out the debris and added 20 mL of grinding buffer to the solution and got the Kale reaction buffer. We repeated the same steps to prepare the Spinach reaction buffer. We labeled 10 blank test tubes and assigned samples to them. The samples we used in this experiment includes one blank, one negative control, four Kale samples, and four Spinach samples. The blank sample was used before each round of measurement to zero the spectrometer. It was prepared with 8 mL of water. The negative control sample was measured with test samples. It was prepared with 8 mL of water and 2 mL of 130mM DCIP buffer. The test samples of Kale was prepared with 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130mM DCIP buffer, and 2 mL of reaction buffer. We measured the absorbance right after we prepared the samples and recorded the initial absorbance. We left the 10 samples in the light for 10 minutes and recorded the absorbance in the light. We moved the 10 samples in the dark for 10 minutes and recorded the absorbance in dark. We ran a two-tailed t-test to compare the absorbance of spinach and kale under different light conditions before and after the reaction.

Results:
In order to find the how photosynthetic activity, we found the average in absorbance of spinach and kale after ten minutes in light. The initial absorbance of spinach is 0.585. The initial absorbance od Kale is 0.473. The p-value is 0.43. Because it is greater than 0.5, there is no significant difference between the initial absorbance of Kale and Spinach. The average absorbance is presented in figure 1.  After reacting for 10 minutes in light. The average absorbance of spinach is 0.0107. The standard deviation is 0.152. The average percentage change is -98.17%. The average absorbance of Kale is 0.2547. The standard deviation is 0.224. The average percentage change is -46.12%. The average absorbance is presented in figure 2.  We ran the two-tailed t-test to find if there is a significant difference in the average absorbance of spinach and kale in light. The P-value is 0.037. This p-value is smaller than 0.05, indicating a significant difference exists. The average absorbance of spinach is significantly higher in light. After reacting for 10 minutes in dark. The average absorbance of spinach in dark is 0.270. The standard deviation is 0.008. The percentage change is 24.23%. The average absorbance of Kale in light is 0.5125. The standard deviation is 0.197. The percentage change is 1.12%. The average absorbance is presented in figure 3. We ran the two-tailed t-test to find if there is a significant difference in the average absorbance of spinach and kale in dark. The P-value is 0.050. This p-value is smaller than 0.05, indicating a significant difference exists. The average absorbance of spinach is significantly higher in dark. We ran paired t-test for the percentage change in absorbance in kale and spinach samples before and after reacting in light. The p-value is 0.12, indicating no significant difference. We ran paired t-test for the percentage change in absorbance in kale and spinach samples before and after reacting in dark. The p-value is 0.04, indicating there is a significant difference. This entails while the photosynthetic activity is inhibited in Spinach more than in Kale after 10 minutes in dark. 

Discussion:
The result of our experiment shows that the average of absorbance of spinach sample is significantly lower than the average of absorbance of kale sample in both light and dark condition. This leads to the conclusion that the spinach has a significantly higher photosynthesis activity level than kale in both the light and the dark environment. Our hypothesis that Spinach has a higher photosynthesis activity in light while Kale has a higher photosynthesis activity in dark is rejected. We predicted that Spinach would prefer light more than Kale would, and Kale would prefer dark more than Spinach did. This result fails to show any preference. In both light and dark, Spinach shows a higher preference than Kale. One possible explanation is Spinach has an over-all higher photosynthesis than Kale has. However, Kale did not experience as sharp drop in photosynthetic activity as Spinach did after reacting for 10 minuets in dark. This indicates that the photosynthetic activity was not inhibited in Kale as much as it was inhibited in Spinach. It supports the hypothesis that Kale favors environment with lower light intensity. We want to conduct further experiment on this hypothesis. In this experiment, the photosynthetic activity we measured in this experiment does not indicate the result of net photosynthesis. One thing to notice  is Kale has a lower photosynthesis activity than spinach because it has a larger leaf area. One previous study shows that the increase of leaf area directly increases net photosynthesis [Jeffers: 1965]. In order to better approach our hypothesis, we need to perform a further experiment on the light preference of Kale and Spinach by measuring the net photosynthesis. As Kale has a greater leave surface area, an overall lower photosynthesis activity is presented. Further studies can be done on the net photosynthesis of spinach and kale in the light and the dark to exclude the difference in leaf surface area.
