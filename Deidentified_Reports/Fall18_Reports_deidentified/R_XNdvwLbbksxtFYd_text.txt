Title: Temperature Affects Rate of Transpiration in Vigna Radiata Plants 

Abstract:
Transpiration is the process in which water is moved from the roots to the leaves of a plant in a network of vessels known as the xylem and the water evaporates escaping from the stomata. Various environmental factors can affect how efficiently transpiration can occur. In this experiment, the effects of temperature on the rate of transpiration were studied. Three groups of  four Vigna Radiata Plants were exposed to three different temperatures: cold, room temperature, and hot. The initial weights of the plants were recorded and the weights after 24 hours. These plants were all given the same amount of water and their leaf surface area calculated. After, the rate of water loss was recorded and the averages recorded. The results proved to be statistically significent when comparing the average rate of transpiration of all three groups. The hypothesis was supported as the Mung Bean Plants in the hot environment had a significently higher transpiration rate than the plants in the cold environment. The room temperature group transpiration rate was higher than the cold group, but lower than the hot group. 



Introduction:
In order to maintain homeostasis, plants must have mechanisms to maintain the right concentration of water and ions. Water accumulates transport solutes in its roots allowing water to passively pass through with osmosis. This balanced solution for ideal plant function enters the xylem tubes and is transported upwards through water potential to the stems and leaves allowing for the process of transpiration to occur [Johnson: 2018]. Transpiration moves this solution from the roots to the xylem which allows water and other ions to leaves through the stomata. The opening and closing of stomata affects both the rate of transpiration and photosynthesis. The stomata allows for carbon dioxide to enter the leaves and oxygen to leave providing the proper concentration gradient for photosynthesis [Johnson: 2018]. If the stomata close, both the rates of transpiration and photosynthesis will be affected. Transpiration rate is controllled through the production of the hormone abscisic acid, but various external environmental factors can decrease or increase the rate in which transpiration occurs. These factors include air temperature, humidity, leaf temperature, and wind [Gates: 1990]. These factors affect transpiration which could decrease or increase the efficiency of plant growth and survival. The hypothesis for this experiment is that as the mung beans are exposed to higher temperatures, they will experience higher rates of transpiration . 


Materials and Method:
In order to test the effects of temperature change on mung bean plant transpiration rates, 12 mung bean plants were separated into three groups of four. Each mung bean plant was given 50 Ml of water and allowed to drain for around 10 minutes. Each plant was placed in a plastic bag and weighed recording the initial weight. The plants were all labeled and four of them were placed in an incubator at 35 degrees celsius, the hot group. The second group of plants was left out in room temperature. The third group was placed in a refrigerator set at 20 degrees celsius. Each group was left in their designated environment for 24 hours and their final weights recorded after. A clear grid was used to calculate the leaf surface area for each plant. Finally, the water rate of water loss was calculated and the averages between groups compared. 


Results:
The results of the experiment indicate that the average rate of transpiration for the cold group was 0.00207. The average rate of transpiration for the hot group was 0.00602, and finally the room temperature group had an average rate of transpiration in between these two at 0.00472 grams of water lost per centimeter squared per hour. This demonstrates that the cold group transpired the least, the hot the most, and the group at room temperature the second highest. A p value of 0.002071 was acquired using an one way anova test which demonstrated significent difference among the groups. The Turkey Kramer Test further demonstrated a statistical significance between the averages demonstrating that the rate of transpiration of the room temperature group was significently higher than that of the cold group. 


Discussion:
According to the results and observations, the hypothesis presented in this experiment was supported. The anova and Turkey Kramer Test demonstrated a statistical significance between the data collected. The group of mung bean plants exposed to 35 degrees celsius for 24 hours had the highest rate of transpiration. This demonstrates that the rate of transpiration in a plant can be directly affected by environmental factors like temperature. The opening and closing of the stomata directly affects the rate of transpiration of a plant. Cold or chilling temperatures, as used in the experiment, can result in stomatal closing and affect guard cell function which controlls gas exchange in plants [Allen: 2001]. This can affect the balance of ions needed to allow the plant to undergo photosynthesis effectively. This loss in guard cell function can affect Rubisco activity in the plant causing an undesired rise in CO2 concentration in the plant [Allen: 2001]. Although CO2 is absorbed by the plant for photosynthesis, an overaccumulation of CO2 can affect the efficiency of photosynthesis. When exploring the effects of hot temperatures on transpiration rate, research has shown that high temperatures allow for an increase in stomatal opening in the light and cold temperatures prevent stomatal opening in light [Gates: 1990]. The effects of various external conditions like temperature can have real world implications for the efficiency of plant growth and agricultural productivity. Although the mung bean is not an agricultural staple, it is a tropical plant and its transpiration function can be compared to other tropical agriculture. Low temperatures can limit photosynthesis, the geographical distribution of tropical plants, and the productivity of plant growth [Allen: 2001].
