Title: Caffeine induced tetanus in gastrocnemus of Rania pipiens

Abstract:
The gastrocnemus muscle from the posterior side of Rania pipiens, the Northern Leopard Frog was isolated to study the impact of caffeine on muscle contractions. The muscle contractions where recorded and analyzed through the relative change in amperage (V) between a muscle contraction without caffeine and a muscle contraction with the addition of a caffeine injection directly into the muscle. This change in amperage was recorded using a data collecting device with pin electrodes. When the gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated after the addition of caffeine, the amperage (V) was shown to increase significently. This can be seen in the p_values 1.34E-9 for leg one, 1.25E-10 for leg two, and 6.33E-7 for leg three. 

Introduction:
Neuromuscular controll is unique to the animal kingdom. Animals have nerves which carry electrical signals across their body and controll movement along with other bodily functions called motor neurons. In order for the electrical signals carried by the motor neurons to reach the muscle and cause a contraction the motor neuron must release Acetylcholine (Ach) and Calcium (Ca2+) into the neuromuscular junction, the connection between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle cell [Caputo: 2016]. The neuromuscular junction allows electrical impulses from the nervous system to create muscle contractions in animals. These muscle contractions are important for the survival of organisms because it allows them to escape danger, find food and water, reproduce, and perform other activities necessary for survival. In order to better understand muscle contractions and the neuromuscular junction muscle contraction in legs of Rania pipiens The Northern Leopard Frog. Muscle contractions in the frog muscle was studied by injecting the muscle with caffeine and stimulating contraction in the leg using electrical stimulus. We hypothesized that by injection the muscle with caffeine, we would observe a significent increase in amplitude of the muscle contraction.

Materials and Method:
Three frog legs where prepared by first removing the skin and dissecting out the sciatic nerve. Then the tissue connecting the gastrocnemus muscle to the bone was separated and the Achilles tendon was cut. Finally, the Achilles tendon was tied to the data collection device, the leg was pinned down to the dissecting plate, and pin electrodes where inserted into the gastrocnemus. Once the legs where prepared, the recording software was set up. The legs where then stimulated to find their twitch threshold by changing the voltage until the recording software registered a contraction. Once the threshold was found, the voltage was increased by half a volt from the determined threshold and 0.1Ml of caffeine was injected into the muscle and them muscle was shocked again. Once all of the data was collected, the data was analyzed using a two-sample t_test.

Results:
When a change in amplitude occurred, the muscles where observed to become hard and inflexible after their being injected with caffeine. Also, in this experiment it was found that when caffeine is injected into the gastrocnemus muscle of Rania pipiens the amplitude of the muscle contraction increases. In the first leg the difference between the pre and post injection amplitude was 0.3016V with a p_value of 1.34E-9, in the second leg the difference in amplitude was 0.9748V with a p_value of 1.25E-10, and in the third led the difference in amplitude was 0.6496 with a p_value of 6.33E-7. This data indicated that there was a significent increase in amplitude between the leg before it was injected with caffeine and after it was injected with caffeine. 

Discussion:
As the results indicated, there was a significent increase in the amplitude of muscle contractions in the legs after caffeine was injected. Thus, the null hypothesis can be rejected. This is likely due the fact that caffeine opens calcium channels in the skeletal muscle and increases the ability of a muscle to contract [Caputo:2016}. And, in our case this lead to tetany. The Ca2+ channels where forced open and the constant flow of calcium caused the muscle to cramp and remain in a contracted position. The article by Caputo et. al. also examines this effect of caffeine on the amplitude of muscle contractions [2016]. The effect of caffeine on muscle contractions is significent because of the potential health implications this has on humans. The consumption of caffeinated drinks can have a negative impact on human health by altering the amount of Ca2+ available. Each time a muscle contracts Ca2+ is necessary and by consuming large amounts of caffeine it is possible that blood calcium levels could be impacted; altering both normal muscle contractions and other necessary biological functions. High doses of caffeine alter normal muscle contractions and cause tetany. This helps us understand the importance of calcium and calcium channels in animals as well as the relationship between the motor neuron, neuromuscular junction, and the skeletal muscle cell. This information can be applied to humans and be used to improve health with respect to caffeine intake.
