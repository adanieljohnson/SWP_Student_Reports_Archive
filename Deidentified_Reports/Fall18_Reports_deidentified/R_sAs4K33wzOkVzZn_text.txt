Title: Effects of Acid Rain on the Root to Shoot Ratio of the Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to compare the root to shoot ratios of buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum) under two different conditions, one group treated with acid rain and one group treated with regular water. These plants typically grow under stable conditions where water, sunlight, and nutrients are readily available. In the lab, the group decided to measure twenty plants from the experimental (acid rain) and twenty plants from the controll (water) groups. Water and acid rain were applied to the plants every day for a week, half receiving acid rain and half receiving regular water. The plants were kept under stable conditions in the greenhouse during the week. Buckwheat plants grown under acidic conditions tended to have higher root to shoot ratios due to the lack of nutrients. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of the buckwheat plants treated with acid rain will be larger than the buckwheat plants only provided water. The data received from this experiment was determined to be inconclusive due to the large differences in plant growth. However, the fact that the buckwheat plants were impacted negatively due to the acidic conditions was still supported. 

Introduction:
Buckwheat is a common crop that can mainly be found in southern parts of China in a rather warm and wet climate. This crop is mainly meant for the animals to eat but can be used in various food products. [Pavek: 2016] In this experiment measurements will be made of buckwheat plants after a week that were administered acid rain and will compare the root to shoot ratios with buckwheat plants (Fagopyrum esculentum) given water instead. The acidic compounds found in acid rain are known to harm plants. The acidic water dissolves many of the essential nutrients plants need to grow and flourish. [Likens: 1996] Resource allocation is a term used for describing a pattern in which a species distributes and uses its limited resources. In other words, resource allocation is a fundamental plant response to abiotic or biotic stress in a given environment. Plants under biotic or abiotic stress in the environment typically have larger root to shoot ratios as they try to increase their overall surface area to absorb as many nutrients as possible.   In a similar study to the one that will be conducted, Thomas El-Mallakh found that the effect of acid rain on root systems, specifically in Scindapsus aureus, is not as severe as many believe. El-Mallakh concluded that the pH of plants in more acidic pH remained unchanged, as some may prefer a more acidic environment. [El-Mallakh: 2014] Based on these conclusions, it can be hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of the buckwheat plants treated with acid rain will be larger than the buckwheat plants only provided water. Because of the acid rain being present in the soil, the buckwheat plants will have to increase their surface area by elongation of their roots to obtain as many nutrients as they can (resource allocation).

Materials and Method:
Measurements of twenty buckwheat plants that were planted with acid rain and twenty buckwheat plants treated with normal water were made after a week of testing. Specifically, the heights and weights of the roots and shoots were measured separately. The plants were planted in a total of eight separate pots, four for the acid rain and four for the normal water. Approximately twenty-five milliliters of acid rain was applied to one half of the pots and the same amount of water was used for the remaining four pots. Once the week elapsed, the plants were removed from the greenhouse where they were kept during the week. In the lab, it was decided to measure twenty plants from the experimental (acid rain) and twenty plants from the controll (water) groups. The plants were removed from their respective pots and separated in a large container of water. This was done to separate them from the soil. The plants were then dried to obtain accurate masses. The roots from each plant were separated from the shoots by cutting each plant apart at the root-shoot junction. Each individual root and shoot height and weight were measured and recorded from both groups. A two-tailed T-test was used to calculate the p_value for both groups of plants. The calculated standard deviation was used to tell how the measurements were spread out from the average within each group. 

Results:
The data collected from the buckwheat plants were separated into average root to shoot heights and weights. Average root to shoot weight for the plants treated with water was 0.951283 +/- 0.541052, and 0.733879 +/- 0.429525 for the plants treated with acid rain. Average root to shoot height for the plants treated with water was 1.019283 +/- 0.328512 and 1.089183 +/- 0.400986 for the plants treated with acid rain. The calculated p_values for the weights (0.338) and heights (0.665) of both groups of plants were larger than 0.05. Thus, both data were determined to be not significent. Each replicate was averaged, separated, calculated, and graphed individually to account for error. 
The average weight of the root to shoots of the buckwheat plants treated with water were larger than the buckwheat plants treated with acid rain. However, the average heights of the root to shoots of the buckwheat plants treated with water were lower than the buckwheat plants treated with acid rain. Each T-test that was ran was two-tailed to account for the ratios possibly being nonbinary. 


Discussion:
In the end, the calculated p_values for the weights and heights were not significent enough to support our original hypothesis. The calculated standard deviations portrayed this. As originally hypothesized, it was suggested that there would be a significent difference in root to shoot ratio between buckwheat plants treated with water versus acid rain. There was not much significent difference between the two groups as originally predicted. This follows what El-Mallakh concluded in his study, that there should be little to no difference in root or shoot height. [El-Mallakh: 2014] However, resource allocation was probably conducted by the buckwheat plants as acid rain depletes the soil of its nutrients. [Likens: 1996] It could be possible that weight and height do not correlate as some plants may want to increase their surface area by increasing the height without increasing the root weights to reach further to obtain more nutrients. One reason for receiving inaccurate data could have been due to the fact that no liquid was given to the plants for three days consecutively. As a result, this could have led to the plants becoming unhealthy and not at their full potential. Another reason that could have led to the data received was that maybe a larger amount of acid rain should have been applied to the experimental group. Maybe more acid rain could have led to the plants having to allocate more as the rain absorbs many of the nutrients found in the soil. Lastly, maybe a higher concentration of acid could have been used to lead to better results. The higher the concentration of the acid in the rain, the lower the pH of the soil. It would be expected to see a greater difference between both groups if these points were administered.
