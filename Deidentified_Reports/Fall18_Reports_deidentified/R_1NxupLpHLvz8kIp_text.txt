Title: The Effect of Fluridone on the Photosynthetic Rate of Chlorophyll Molecules

Abstract:
The Fluridone herbicide is widely used to treat unwanted weeds, such as hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil, by decreasing the effect of photosynthesis on the chlorophyll molecules. The validity and efficiency of Fluridone can be tested by comparing the photosynthetic rate of a control and experimental solution. By measuring the absorbances after five trials of a solution with the herbicide and one without, the herbicide’s effect on photosynthesis is graphed, comparing the control and experimental solution. The percent changes after intervals of ten minutes are recorded and state the consistency of each solution. The data reveals the inverse correlation between a lower rate of photosynthesis and a higher absorbance.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the method by which plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars—for enzymes and growth—and oxygen. Plants capture and store energy from the sun in the process of photosynthesis and this energy is subsequently released during glycolysis. The process is directed primarily by the transfer of electrons from chlorophyll molecules into the neighboring cytochromes. These electrons are passed along a series of cytochromes in the electron transport system. Sunlight activates the electrons where they are passed along another electron transport chain and are eventually used in a carbon-fixing reaction. The summary equation for photosynthesis is: 6 CO2  (carbon dioxide) +   12 H2O (water) ---------------&gt;  C6H12O6  (glucose) +  6 H2O  (water) +  6 O2 (molecular oxygen). If any of these photosynthetic complexes are disrupted, the process will shut down and the plant will die. Photosynthesis, therefore, is the target of a group of herbicides known as photosynthetic inhibitors. Photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides function by restricting the transfer of electrons, affecting the rate of photosynthesis which can be further measured. Without electron transfer, energy from the sun cannot be transformed into energy that is usable by plants to generate new tissue and sustain life [Oorschot: 1970]. The herbicide, Fluridone, widely used to control hydrilla and Eurasian watermilfoil, works by interfering with carotene formation which leads to chlorophyll degradation. By comparing two chloroplast solutions—one with Fluridone and one without—and recording the absorbances, we can test the efficiency and validity of the herbicide. We hypothesize that the experimental chloroplast solution will have significantly higher absorbances than the control, and therefore the rate of photosynthesis will decrease due to the addition of the Fluridone herbicide. 


Materials and Methods:
Four spinach leaves were grinded in ten milliliters of grinding buffer and strained through a filter. The chloroplast from the spinach leaves was then extracted through a centrifuge for five minutes at 200G and four degrees Celsius. Two chloroplast solutions are then made, the experimental solution with the Fluridone herbicide, and the control without the herbicide. The control consists of five separate trials with 2ml of grinding buffer, 2ml of reaction buffer, and 2ml of DCIP. The experimental solution consists of five separate trials with the same volumes but with the addition of the herbicide. The experimental and control solution are then exposed to a light source under 10, 20, and 30-minute intervals. The absorbances are recorded for each interval and the percent changes are calculated. A two tailed paired t-test and the mean absorbances for the experimental and control were used to analyze the data and test the statistical significance. 

Results:
The comparison between the control and experimental group averages, figure 1, provide a clear contrast between the two solutions, and it is evident in the first figure—which averages the absorbances for all intervals—that the experimental solution has substantially higher absorbances than the control. Figure 2 provides the absorbances as a means of consistency between the intervals, revealing that the experimental solution remains higher than the control throughout all intervals and there is no one outlier. 

Discussion:
The results indicate that our hypothesis was supported since the absorbances of our experimental values were significantly higher than the absorbances for the control. Since absorbance is a measure of the amount of light absorbed by the solution, a decrease in photosynthetic activity will cause the solution to increase in absorbance and darken in color. Because the experimental solution has a higher absorbance, and thus a darker color, light cannot reach the chlorophyll as efficiently. The rate of photosynthesis is a factor of the various wavelengths of light a plant is exposed to; different pigments in chloroplasts absorb different wavelengths to utilize in photosynthesis [Ruban: 2009]. The absorbance associated with the experimental solution does not correlate to the maximum wavelength absorbed; therefore, the rate of photosynthesis was lower. This proves the validity of the herbicide, which interferes with carotene formation and leads to chlorophyll degradation. As tested in the diuron and atrazine herbicides, the transfer of electrons was blocked by the inhibitor, and without this electron transfer, energy from the sun cannot be transformed into energy can be used by plants to produce new tissue and support life [Allen, et all: 1983]. Because the Fluridone herbicide has been proven to decrease the rate of photosynthesis, it can be used to treat unwanted weeds.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1 states the averages of five separate trials for both the control and experimental chloroplast solutions after intervals of 10, 20, and 30 minutes. Trend: the control group has significantly lower average absorbances than the experimental. The p-value is 0.02, implying statistical significance. Figure 2 states the average percent change of the experimental and control chloroplast solutions based on 10, 20, and 30-minute intervals. The experimental solution has a consistent higher absorbance and less change than the control solution. The p-value is 0.029, implying statistical significance.*************************************************************************
