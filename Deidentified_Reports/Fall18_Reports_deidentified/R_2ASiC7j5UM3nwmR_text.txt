Title: The developmental effects of the hormone blocker AZAGUARD on Manduca Sexta (tobacco hornworm)

Abstract:
The control of insect populations oftentimes proves to be a necessity in agriculture and research in this area is useful in determining the effects of various hormones and hormone blockers on the development and life cycle of different insect species. In this study Azaguard was predicted to prevent the pupation of Manduca sexta into an adult. A control group fed a diet of Manduca food and water was created alongside an experimental group fed a diet of Manuduca food and the hormone blocker Azaguard. This was done to acertain the affect of Azaguard on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. These factors were measured in the change in length, weight, and physical appearance of the two caterpillar groups over multiple days. We found that Azaguard has a negative effect on Manduca sexta in that it prevents pupation and in concentrations of about 1 drop per gram of food can result in the death of the caterpillar population over time.

Introduction:
The control of certain insect populations is essential in protecting valuable food and cash crops. As the need for food and other resources increases it is valuable to understand the effects of certain hormone-blocking insect controlling substances. In this case a specific look is being taken on Manduca sexta, otherwise known as a hornworm. This species has been used extensively in hormone regulation research which makes it a perfect species for us to look at. We choose the hormone blocker Azaguard to be used on our experimental group. Azaguard prevents insects from moving between larval, pupal, and adult stages by stopping the release of the hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, that regulate the growth and development of insects. In our experiment we started with the larval caterpillar stage of Manduca sexta and wanted to see the effects of Azaguard on our experimental group. We wanted to see if the caterpillars in the experimental group would molt or not and also to see the chemical’s effect on their growth and development. The only difference between control and experimental was water or Azaguard in the food, respectfully. We hypothesized that the introduction of Azaguard into the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars would prevent the commitment pulse and therefore pupation into an adult.

Materials and Methods:
1.)	Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars were taken from a sample without regard for original size, weight, or appearance.
2.)	Two, four section containers with lids were taken and labeled control and experimental. Two small holes were punched in the side of each of the four sections in the two containers.
3.)	Two types of food were prepared.
a.	For the control group 40 grams of Manduca sexta diet mix (premade) was measured out and thoroughly mixed with 40 drops of water. Water was used with the control group to match the texture of their food to the experimental group. The 40 grams of food was then balled up into 10 gram patties and put into the four sections.
b.	For the experimental group 40 grams of Manduca sexta diet mix (premade) was measured out and thoroughly mixed with 40 drops of Azaguard. The 40 grams of food was then balled up into 10 gram patties and put into the four sections.
4.)	1 caterpillar was put into each of the 8 sections at random being designated by a number 1-4 Control and 1-4 Experimental. They were then measured from head to tail in centimeters. Then they were massed in grams. Any other observations were noted such as color, texture, activity, et cetera.
5.)	Over the course of 13 days the caterpillars were massed, measured, observed, had their sections cleared of waste, and had their food replaced as needed.

Discussion:
Our 10 drops of Azaguard per 10 grams of food appears to not only prevent the pupating of Manduca sexta but also causes them to cease eating and eventually die as they lose mass. The control group successfully gained mass and pupated while continuing to eat normally until pupating. The control group likely provides an accurate representation of the natural development and life cycle progression of Maduca sexta from larva to pupa. The experimental group shows the effects of Azaguard on development of Manduca sexta until they die from those effects. Our hypothesis was supported as we were correct in our theory that our chosen hormone blocker and the amount of it given to each caterpillar in the experimental group would prevent pupation. We did not foresee the hormone causing death, however. It can be established that Azaguard led to their deaths as all experimental caterpillars died and none in the control group did so.
	Other research with hormone blocking/suppression in Manduca Sexta has shown similar results in the prevention of pupation. A 2003 study showed that the regulation of juvenile hormone can effectively halt the development of Manduca sexta by preventing their pupation into an adult [Riddiford: 2003]. Another study from 1974 found similar results in preventing juvenile hormone production and release as responsible for halting Manduca sexta development [Nijhout: 1974]. These studies, like ours, show the effect of hormone regulation by blocking result in halting the development of Manduca sexta. The main effect of our research showed a quick and effective hormone blocking that was strong enough to prevent pupation and result in a chemical imbalance that led to the deaths of our experimental caterpillars.
	The research we carried out has practical implications. For the population control of Manduca sexta a strong concentration of the hormone blocker Azaguard may be used. If the result is to prevent the pupation of the species and/or to cause them to weaken and die it provides a highly effective method of doing so.
