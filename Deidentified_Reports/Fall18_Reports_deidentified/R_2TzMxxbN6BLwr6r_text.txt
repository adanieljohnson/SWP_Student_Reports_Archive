Title: The Effect of pH on Photosynthetic Activity in Spinach Chloroplasts

Abstract:
Organisms need energy to be able to implement cellular processes that keep them alive. Plants can get their intake of glucose by creating it themselves, through a process called photosynthesis, which is the process of harvesting sunlight and transforming it into glucose. This process occurs in a unique organelle that is found mostly in plants called the chloroplasts. This experiment is investigating the effect that pH has on the photosynthetic activity in spinach chloroplasts. We hypothesized that the chloroplasts treated with would have the highest photosynthetic activity. We treated chloroplasts in buffers at a pH of 2, 6.5, and 10 for then minutes and then ran a Hill’s reaction for 30 minutes to measure the photosynthetic activity. The results showed that we could accept our hypothesis since the percent change in neutral treated chloroplasts was 90.3% which is much larger compared to the acidic and basic treated results (1% and 2.9% respectively). We hypothesize that this occurs due to the conformational changes that occur due to pH change. Because of this pH change, the proteins involved in the photosynthesis reaction no longer can function and inhibit the process altogether.

Introduction:
In all organisms, there are multiple cellular processes and chemical reactions occurring at once to keep them alive. But, for these process to work and function properly, they need energy. There are three sources that this energy can come from: chemical energy that is stored in covalent bonds, the energy stored as redox reaction potential, or some electrical or chemical gradient found across a lipid bilayer (membrane) [Johnson: 2016]. Organisms must be able to extract energy from at least one source. Plants can use photosynthesis, glycolysis, and respiration to produce and eventually use energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Heterotrophs, such as humans, for example, have to rely on other organisms to get their source of glucose or sugar (which can then be converted into ATP thanks to cellular respiration). However, plants have no dependence on other living beings for energy but can use photosynthesis to harvest light energy from the sun to make glucose, which makes them autotrophs [Govindjee, 2018]. 

Chloroplasts are the organelle in the plants that are responsible for harvesting light to make glucose, a process called photosynthesis. In this experiment, we will be investigating the effects that a plant’s pH environment has on the overall photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts. Photosynthesis activity will be measured using Hill’s reaction, which is estimated based on the absorbance given by 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCIP), which measures the electron transfers that occur in the chloroplast and result in a color change. DCIP in its original color is blue, but after photosynthesis occurs, two hydrogen ions bond to the DCIP resulting in the release of oxygen and the production of DCIPH2, a colorless compound. The decrease in absorbance will directly relate to the photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts [Calera: 1995]. 

In the 21st century, there are many ways that pollution can affect the vegetation of plants. Run-off from rain can collect pollution and toxins to the soil and change the pH. There have been many studies on multiple species that find a decrease in growth in plants due to a pH change [Long: 2017]. This experiment is investigating the effect of different pH treatments on the photosynthetic activity in spinach leaves. We will treat chloroplasts at an acidic, neutral, and basic pH to see if it changes the photosynthetic activity measured by the DCIP and Hill’s reaction. We hypothesize that the spinach chloroplasts will have the most photosynthetic activity in the neutral buffer since a difference in pH can change the conformation of proteins and inhibit the photosynthetic reaction.


Materials and Methods:
Isolation of Chloroplasts
Put a mortar and pestle, a 150 mL beaker and three 50 mL centrifuge tubes on ice. While these are cooling, take four medium-sized spinach leaves and remove the large central veins. Next, wash and dry these leaves and place them into the cold and dry mortar and pestle. After adding ten mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer at pH 8) to the leaves, grind until it is a mushy paste. Add another ten mL of grinding solution and strain slurry through a cheesecloth into a centrifuge tube. Spin down the sample at 200 x G for three minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After spinning, collect the supernatant into another centrifuge tube and spin that at 1,000 x G for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then collect supernatant and suspend the chloroplast solution in 20 mL of grinding buffer.

pH Treatment
From the 20 mL of chloroplast solution, add five mL into three separate centrifuge tubes, one for each pH condition (2, 6.5, and 10). Add five mL of the appropriate pH buffer into the centrifuge tubes and incubate for ten minutes at room temperature. After incubation, spin down the centrifuge samples at 1,000 x G for ten minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After spinning, discard the supernatant and resuspend the chloroplast pellet in 5 mL of grinding solution. 

Hill’s Reaction
Prepare the separate tubes for the following conditions: blank, no chloroplasts, and the three chloroplast samples at their respective conditions. For every condition, except the blank, produce triplicates. The blank should only have eight mL of water and two mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). The rest of the samples should have six mL of water, two mL of 130 mM DCIP, and two mL of reaction buffer. Then add 100 microliters of the chloroplast solution into the respective pH condition tubes, use the five mL chloroplast solution that was not used for the pH treatment for the blank solution. Mix the tubes after adding the chloroplasts and read the absorbance at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer, using the blank tube to zero the spectrophotometer. After reading the absorbency of each solution at time zero, incubate the tubes at room temperature for thirty minutes and place the rack of tubes on a window sill to ensure sunlight exposure. After light exposure, measure and record the absorbency of each tube. 

Statistical Analysis
A two-tailed T-test was used to analyze the data and to conclude whether the difference in data between experimental and control groups was statistically significant.


Results:
The no chloroplast sample was used as a negative control for the Hill’s Reaction. The difference in absorbency for the negative control was 17.5%. Looking at the results, the chloroplasts that were treated with both an acidic and basic buffer (1% and 2.9% respectively) had a lower percent difference in absorbency than the negative control. On the other hand, the chloroplast that was treated with a buffer at a neutral pH had a large percent difference in absorbency (90.3%). Even by observation, the other two pH conditions did not seem to change color wise, but the neutral pH condition was almost colorless compared to the dark blue color it was at time zero. 
There is an apparent statistical difference (p &lt; 0.05) between percent difference in the chloroplasts incubated at a neutral pH, between all the other data sets. However, there is no statistical significance between the chloroplasts treated with both acid and base buffers, but there is a statistical significance between the acid and base treated chloroplasts and the negative controls. 


Discussion:
From the data collected it seems evident that the chloroplasts at the neutral pH had the highest percentage decrease in absorbency, which also correlates to having the highest photosynthetic activity, while on the other hand, the chloroplasts in an acidic and basic buffer both had extremely low percent decrease values resulting in deficient levels of photosynthetic activity. The percent change was so low, that it was even lower than our negative control samples that did not contain any chloroplasts, to begin with. This data means that we can accept our hypothesis that the chloroplasts would have the most photosynthetic activity at a neutral pH. 
Researchers have discovered that natural phenomenon like acid rain has been shown to “increase global warming potentials…and alter soil pH” which could lead stunt in plant growth [Wang: 2018]. It is interesting as to why the acidic and basic treated chloroplasts photosynthetic activity than the negative control probably has to do with the effect that pH has on proteins in the cell when it comes to enzyme binding specificity as well. It is known that a difference in pH can cause a conformational change in proteins and we hypothesized that is what happened with our acidic and basic treated chloroplasts [Hove-Jensen: 2016]. Photosystems I, Photosystem II, and the Calvin Cycle would not be working properly, and DCIP would not be able to transfer into DCIPH2 and change the color of the solution. Our next step would be to treat the chloroplasts with increments of pH (1 through 14) to see how drastic the effect pH has on the proteins in the spinach chloroplasts and to also find the pH range where photosynthetic activity is normal.
