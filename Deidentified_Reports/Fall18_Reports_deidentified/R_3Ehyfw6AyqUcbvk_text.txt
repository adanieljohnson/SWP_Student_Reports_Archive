Title: The Effect of Color on the Aggressiveness of Male Betta splendens Fish

Abstract:
Male betta fish (Betta splendens) show agonistic behaviors toward other male betta fish when they are exposed to them. These behaviors can range from erecting their pectoral fins to creating a red mane by extending their branchiostegal membranes. These fish commonly come in two colors: red and blue. We tested three individuals of each color against a fake betta fish to determine which color was more aggressive. Based off of a previous pilot study, we hypothesized that blue fish would be more aggressive after doing the first experiment with male betta fish. After running our experiment and analyzing the data, our hypothesis was rejected as the red fish on average showed higher levels of aggression. These results are not conclusive however and really depend on the behaviors exhibited by the individual fish, not the color of their scales. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish or simply the betta fish, is a small tropical species of fish native to Thailand, formerly known as Siam. These fish are known to exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to other males. These behaviors are territorial as the species evolved these behaviors to ward off competitors for territory, food, as well as to protect their nests. [Alyan:2010] In the wild, these characteristics are less pronounced as the bright colorations are only shown during their fights, also known as agonistic behaviors. Male betta fish are known to fight each other in the presence of another male, or even after seeing their own reflection. They exhibit two separate kinds of agonistic behavior: broadside displays and facing displays. Broadside displays function more as warnings than anything with the fish erecting their caudal fins and swimming sideways so as to appear bigger than the other fish. Facing displays are more aggressive and include behaviors such as erect pectoral fish, tail beating, and spreading their opercula (gill coverings) which eventually leads to a protruding branchiostegal membrane, giving the betta fish their famed red “manes.” [Johnson: 2016] The fish come primarily in two colors: red and blue. Before running this experiment, we ran a pilot study on both red and blue male Bette splendens in which the blue fish exhibited more aggressive behaviors more frequently. We then wanted to further research if there was an effect from the coloration of the fish on the levels of aggressive behavior displayed by the fish. Based on our observations from the pilot study, we hypothesized that male blue Betta splendens will exhibit more aggressive behaviors than their red counterparts in the presence of another male Betta fish. 

Materials and Methods:
We used a fake red betta fish to simulate the presence of another male in a partitioned fish tank. One side had a red male and the other side had a blue male. Each fish was exposed to the fake fish for five minutes at a time, twice per fish. The fish were given a five minute rest period in between tests to prevent any habituation from occurring, We ran this test on three red fish and three blue fish for a total of six tests. This was to eliminate the possibility of an exceptional response from one fish and to get a general trend of aggression among colors. Had we only tested one individual per color, the results could have been inaccurate if, for example, the only red individual tested displayed high levels of agonistic behaviors while the blue individual did not display any agonistic behavior at all. Testing multiple individuals per color prevented that potential problem from occurring in our experiment. As the fish interacted with the fake fish, we carefully observed for agonistic behavior and if/when we saw one of these behaviors, it was recorded. We recorded both the number of agonistic displays as well as the level of aggression. Level one agonistic behaviors include erect pectoral fins and pelvic fin flicking, level two behaviors include tail beating and the spreading of the operculum, and level three behaviors include the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane and tail flicking. We then used an unpaired t-test to analyze the data we collected. 

Results:
Two fish of the six that were tested (Red 2 and Blue. 3) showed no aggressive behaviors, as shown by the lack of a corresponding bar in Figure 1. Two fish (Red 1 and Blue 1) showed only mildly aggressive behaviors. Blue 2 had one instance of a level two behavior (spreading of the operculum) but his mean value level of aggression was only at level one because he displayed more level one behaviors than level two behaviors. Red 3 had extremely aggressive behaviors, but he was an outlier. We compared the raw data of agonistic behaviors in male blue Betta fish and male red Betta fish using an unpaired t-test (t-stat:1.077, df:23, p:0.2923)

Discussion:
As mentioned above, during a previous pilot study, male blue Betta fish displayed higher levels of agonistic behavior more frequently than male red Betta fish. Our hypothesis was rejected after running this experiment as the p-value obtained showed that there was not a significant difference statistically between the aggression levels of blue Betta splendens and red Betta splendens. The fish were largely unresponsive to the fake fish utilized in the experiment. This could be due to the fish not viewing the decoy as a threat to themselves and their territory because the decoy did not properly imitate and display the agonistic behaviors of a live male Betta fish. This experiment likely could have been improved by exposing the fish used in the experiment to a live male rather than a decoy and the results could have been different. In several cases, the Betta fish did not react at all to the fake fish and in several others, the fish reacted in such minor ways that their responses could not even be quantified as agonistic behaviors. There is no evidence that red fish are more aggressive than blue fish and vice versa, as the aggression levels and behaviors depend mostly on the individual fish rather than the color of the fish on a population scale (blue population of Betta fish vs. red population of male Betta fish) [Bones: 2017] Today’s betta fish are not commonly bred for aggression as they were in the past; they are now bred for their specific morphs with aggression slowly being weaned out. [Lucas: 1968] The uncertainty surrounding the aggression levels of male Betta splendens with respect to their coloration leaves a lot on the table and allows for future hypotheses and research to be done to determine whether or not there is a correlation between aggression and coloration in male Betta fish.
