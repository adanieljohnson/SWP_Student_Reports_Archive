Title: The Effects of Temperature on the Photosynthetic Reduction Activity of Spinacia oleracea  (italicized) 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effects of temperature on the rate of photosynthetic reduction activity in Spinacia oleracea. The rate of photosynthetic reduction activity can studied by measuring the quantitate amounts of light of different wavelengths absorbed and then transmitted by a given pigment solution prepared in the lab. Photosynthesis is a biological process used by many organisms including prokaryotic and some eukaryotic cells to produce food from water and carbon dioxide. We tested our hypothesis that at higher temperatures, more hydrogen would be given off by the process of photosynthesis, leading to the synthesis of DCIP H2, an indicator for photosynthetic rate, by manipulating the conditions in which photosynthesis takes place in spinach leaves. To do so, we placed the chloroplasts from these leaves in three different temperature conditions and used a spectrophotometer to determine the rate of absorbance of light. We used three conditions: warm (36 degrees Celsius), cold (15 degrees Celsius), and room temperature (23 degrees Celsius) to test this idea. We hypothesized that as the temperature increases, the process of photosynthesis emits more hydrogen which leads to the production of DCIP, an indicator for photosynthetic reduction activity. Our hypothesis was re

Introduction:
	Photosynthetic organisms are the main producers of food and without photosynthesis, earth’s atmosphere would lose its oxygen and everything would die [Lambers: 2008]. Spinacia oleracea are spinach leaves that will be used in this study as a mechanism to quantify photosynthetic reduction activity. During photosynthesis, many oxidation-reduction reactions takes place in which electrons are moved throughout the electron transport chain [Johnson: 2018]. Energy generated through photosynthesis drives the proton gradient. This process allows hydrogen ions to be moved across the lipid bilayer, which produces ATP as a result. During photosynthesis in spinach leaves, their chloroplasts function by absorbing energy from the sun in chlorophyll molecules, and electrons are thus emitted from carrier molecules. As a result of the electrons being energized, water releases electrons, stored as NADPH, to replace the ones that left their original carriers. NADPH and ATP are used to produce glucose from 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules. One study focused on the optimal conditions that affect the rate of photosynthesis in plants [Anten: 2005]. The study concluded that tradeoffs exist when balancing the rate of photosynthesis with environmental conditions in plants. Many factors influence the rate of photosynthesis, such as temperature, carbon dioxide concentrations and light intensity. We will focus on the environmental condition of temperature. 
During our study, we will use a spectrophotometer which works like a prism and separates the light into different component wavelengths. We used enriched chloroplasts to reduce the electron acceptor DCIP that absorbs light most light at 600 nm on the spectrometer. 
By doing so, we measured the effects of some commonly used herbicides on photosynthesis
It is known that oxidized DCIP is naturally colored dark blue. Reduced DCIP is colorless as it has has conjugated carbon carbon double bond [Johnson: 2018]. We will use the color change in DCIP reduction as a decrease in light absorbance at 600 nm as this is the standard optical density measurement. DCIP accepts electrons in the form of hydrogen atoms and is turned into DCIP H2 during normal chloroplast activity. This conversions results in a decrease in absorbance and thus portrays photosynthesis reduction as shown on the spectrophotometer. Increased activity makes the DCIP solution clear. Likewise, when the absorbance shown on the spectrophotometer increases, lower levels of photosynthetic activity are taking place in our sample. Cold temperatures reduce the rate of photosynthetic since enzymes do not work as well as at the optimal temperature [Anten: 2005]. Based on precious knowledge, we hypothesize that as temperature increases, the process of photosynthesis emits more hydrogen and electrons which leads to the production of DCIP, an indicator for photosynthetic reduction activity. Lower absorbances will be recorded as a result of the clearer color of DCIP H2 and not DCIP. Likewise, the production of DCIP H2 will be significently lower in cold conditions since the rate of photosynthetic reduction activity will be decreased, which will lead to an increase in absorbance.

Materials and Method:
To conduct our experiment, we obtained 5 large spinach leaves from our instructor. For the first experiment we performed, we enriched chloroplasts by differential centrifugation. We first packed a mortar and pestle, a medium-sized beaker (150-250 Ml size), and 3, 50 Ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to cool. While the mortar and pestle were cooling, we removed the large central veins from 5 medium-sized spinach leaves. We then threw away the veins, and rinsed the remaining leaf pieces with tap water. We blotted off the excess moisture from the leaves. We then added 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) and fringed the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. We added an additional 10 Ml of grinding buffer, mixed with the spinach slurry, and strained the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker. We obtained our chloroplasts through centrifugation. To do so, we put 200 µl of the filtered liquid from the beaker into 
a tube and spun it at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We included a balance tube in the centrifuge.

	For the next exercise, we quantified photosynthetic reduction activity with our chloroplasts. For this exercise, we labeled 13 large test tubes (#1-#13) and placed them in a tube rack. We turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to read at 600nm. Next, we created 3 replicas of each of the following reaction mixes. To the assay, we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts we prepared previously to the blank tube (tube #1), and to Tubes #5-13. Group 1 (tubes 2-4) had no chloroplasts at room temperature setting (25 degrees Celsius), while Group 2 (tubes 5-7) had chloroplasts at room temperature setting (25 degrees Celsius). Group 3 (tubes 8-10) had chloroplasts at warm temperature setting (36 degrees Celsius), while group 4  (tubes 11-13) had chloroplasts at cold temperature setting (-2 degrees Celsius) We then mixed each tube immediately after adding chloroplasts and transferred the mixtures to spectrophotometer cuvettes. The blank tube (tube 1) had 8 Ml water, chloroplast, and 2 Ml reaction buffer. Tubes in group 2 had 6 Ml of water, 2 Ml of reaction buffer, and 2 Ml of  130 mM DCIP. We immediately blanked the spectrophotometer at 600nm using Tube 1 and then immediately measured the absorbance of all the samples at 600nm. Group 1 was kept in the open air without any treatment. Group 2 was placed in room temperature (23 degrees Celsius) conditions. Group 3 was placed in a warm temperature environment (36 degrees), which was verified by a thermometer. Finally, group 4 was placed in a cold bath (-2 degrees Celsius). Light was provided above each bath through a heat lamp. After 10 minutes, we blanked the spectrophotometer with tube 1. Next, we read the absorbance of each sample at 600 nm. After 10 more minutes (20 minutes total) in the different temperature settings, we blanked the spectrophotometer. Then, we measured the absorbances a second time for each sample. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total) blank the spectrophotometer and measure absorbances one more time for all 12 samples. We ran an ANOVA test to test the difference between our different mean values with an alpha value of 0.05 and 3 degrees of freedom. Then, we ran a post-hoc turkey test as a follow up for ANOVA. We wanted to confirm which specific groups in our study differed from one another. 


Results:
	The results were not statistically significent as evident by our ANOVA test and these results are portrayed in figure 1. The f-ratio value is 0.80486 and the p_value is .514973. Based on these numbers, the result is not significent at p &lt; .05. According to the turkey kramer pos hoc analysis (alpha=0.05), there was no significent difference between the means of the four groups. 


Discussion:
During this study, we quantified photosynthetic reduction activity. We hypothesized that 
as temperature increases, the process of photosynthesis emits more hydrogen which leads to txhe production of DCIP, an indicator for photosynthetic reduction activity. We expected to see lower absorbances as a result of the clearer color of DCIP H2 and not DCIP. Likewise, we thought that the production of DCIP H2 would be significently lower in cold conditions since the rate of photosynthetic reduction activity would be decreased. We thought that this would have lead to an increase in absorbance. Our hypothesis was rejected as our data was statistically insignificent, as portrayed with the p_value of 0.514973, greater than the alpha of .05. Tukey’s HSD ANOVA portrayed that the means of the four groups were not different from one another. We were expecting lower absorbances portrayed on the spectrophotometer since DCIP H2 is a clearer color than DCIP for cold conditions. The spectrophotometer became too confused with the different temperature conditions; the absorbances were not consistent due to condensation on the cuvettes. Figure 1 includes a graph of the four experimental groups in their specific temperatures and portrays their light absorbencies over a time span of 30 minutes. As shown in figure 1, the absorbance values portray a negative trend and this represents an increase in photosynthetic reduction activity. However, it is important to note that there is a large increase in the absorbance from 10-20 minutes. In reference to Group 2, the group with chloroplasts at room temperature, the rate of absorbance increased which is indicative of a decreased in photosynthetic reduction activity. Group 2 does not follow the previously researched inverse relationship between temperature and the rate of photosynthetic reduction. Finally, the downward trend in Group 4, the group with chloroplasts in a cold setting, illustrates how the rate of photosynthetic reduction activity increased as temperature decreased. Once again, this is an exception to the accepted inverse relationship. 
	One study focused on the effects of increasing temperature and carbon dioxide on photosynthesis, growth and elemental ratios in cyanobacteria [Fu: 2007]. The cyanobacteria did increase in growth as a result of increasing temperature and carbon dioxide. Another study focused on how heat stress affects the rate of photosynthesis due to the denaturation of enzymes [Sharkey: 2005]. The study found that moderate heat stress can potentially reduce photosynthesis activity to zero. Lastly, another study that pertains to our own focused on the mechanisms involved in the changes in temperature dependence of photosynthetic rate [Hikosaka: 2006]. The study concluded that the optimal temperature that maximizes the rate of photosynthesis increases with a higher growth temperature. These studies are relevant to our own in that they portray how temperature does affect the rate of photosynthesis and the articles generally support that the idea that an increase in temperature generally leads to an increased in the photosynthetic reduction rate.
	As previously mentioned, sources of error in this lab include problems with the spectrophotometer. The different temperatures in the cuvettes produced condensation and affected the absorbance rate shown on the spectrophotometer. The absorbance number kept fluctuating over a wide range of values and not providing us with constant numbers. For future studies, larger sample sizes will allow for better statistics. We will also need to wipe down our cuvettes to prevent condensation. Our study extends beyond spinach leaves to photosynthesis in that photosynthesis allows for human, plants, and animals to live as it provides oxygen to the atmosphere. DCIP mimics NAD+ being reduced during photosynthesis. In this way, we used spinach leaves as a model to manipulate factors that affect photosynthetic reduction activity. This study can be used by botanists in order to affect the rate of photosynthesis, which produces oxygen for us to breathe. Botanists can also use this study to determine which herbicide to put in their plants.
