Title: Effect of Blue and Red Light on the Cell Signaling  of Physarum. 

Abstract:
This experiment measured the amount of phototaxis in Phyasrum placed under different light conditions, with the intention of viewing the significance of the movement under blue light and red light. Ultraviolet light is already proven to be harmful to Physarum, prompting the organism to avoid it, but blue light falls within the color spectrum for visible light, implying that it could have no adverse results because of this fact, or it would be feared by the Physarum because it is the closest visible color to ultraviolet on the color spectrum. We hypothesized that the group under blue light would have less phototaxis than groups under red and white light. The results of our experiment rejected the hypothesis (P value of ANOVA Test, degrees of freedom of 2=.898856, Tukey’s HSD with an alpha of .05 not showing significance) showing that there is less phototaxis in the blue light group, but not enough for it to be significant.  

Introduction:
Stimuli such as light and heat, when combined with a lack of food, trigger Physarum’s reproductive cycle [Johnson:2018]. The triggering and path of the reproductive cycle is what allows Physarum to have a sense of directionality, thus allowing it to move to different places. Plasmodium, the matured Physarum, occasionally move away from light via a process called negative phototaxis. The opposite, positive phototaxis, could occur if Physarum moved towards the light. [Johnson:2018]. White Light is absorbed by the plasmodium, generating a photoreceptor signal which prompts sporulation [Starostzik:1994]. Yellow pigment in Spot C, a predetermined area of the Physarum, induces sporulation which proves that both white light and yellow light are capable of prompting sporulation in Physarum [Wormington:1976].  Other extremes of lights inhibit sporulation in the slime; for example, ultraviolet light is proven to harm the genetic code of Physarum during mitosis [Funderud:1978]. This means that the organism should avoid that light at all costs in order to ensure survival. The short wavelengths (100-380 nm) for ultraviolet light account for its high energy, prompting mutations in the slime. Blue light falls within the visible spectrum and is contained within white light, but it is the closest color to ultraviolet in the visible spectrum (380-450 nm) [Wikipedia:2018]. In this lab, we hypothesize that blue light, because it is closer to ultraviolet light than other colors in the visible spectrum, will result in less movement towards the stimulus in the Physarum culture than red or white light because of their shorter wavelengths (affecting the procreation of the culture), while at the same time showing more positive phototaxis in the red group due to lower energy. 

Materials and Methods:
We obtained 12 PDA plates from our TA, and labeled them in groups of 3 as “No Light”, “White Light”, “Red Light”, and “Blue Light”. On the bottom of each plate, we drew a line dividing the plate in half, and then drew boxes a third and two thirds along the length of the line, a centimeter squared in area. We cut out one of the squares, and placed it back in. We removed the agar from the other square, and replaced it with a square of the same size from the Physarum culture plate. We placed lids on each plate, taped them shut, and wrapped all of our plates in foil, and cut out a small window at the top of the plates. We then placed each group in an incubator with a light bulb appropriate for each group’s name, with the exception of the no light group, which was placed in a drawer. After a day, we calculated the distance traveled by the Physarum and in what direction. We used an ANOVA test with a degrees of freedom of 2 to test the differences between distance traveled for each group with an alpha of .05 and a Tukey’s HSD test (alpha=.05) to quantify the results. 

Results:
The graph is a comparison between the amount of or lack of phototaxis occurring in the samples with their respective wavelengths for the appropriate lights. Standard deviation is present in the form of error bars. The no light group was excluded from the graph due to clutter, and a lack of necessity for it due to it all being 0 cm difference. After running an ANOVA test, with a degrees of freedom of two, and an alpha of .05, we can see that the f-ratio value is 0.19211. The p-value is .898856.  Tukey’s HSD (alpha=0.05): No significant difference between any two groups.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that blue light, because it is closer to ultraviolet light than other colors in the visible spectrum, will result in less movement towards the stimulus in the Physarum culture than red or white light because of their shorter wavelengths (affecting the procreation of the culture), while at the same time showing more positive phototaxis in the red group due to lower energy,  was rejected due to our data being statistically not significant, as the p-value of .898856 is greater than the alpha of .05. Thus, we conclude that blue does not limit phototaxis significantly more than red or white light. The higher amount of  negative phototaxis in the blue group shows that blue does seem to have some effect on the path of growth of Physarum, but not enough for it to be significant. This experiment could have been better performed with recordings of the sample being taken every day for a week, and means being taken of that data, allowing for a better sample of the data for statistical purposes. Furthermore, an ultraviolet light group should have been used as well, in order to compare how similar the effects of the blue light are to ultraviolet light. There was an error with the culture of Physarum provided to our research team, in which their growth was not ideal. It would also have been a good idea to have starved the Physarum, because that makes them more likely to use the blue light as a path, and would have removed the confounding variable of oatmeal being present as a food source [Schreckenbach:1982]. In our experiment the Physarum were fed, meaning that they would have not been as desperate to pursue even more sustenance and venture out into the light. In a greater biological context, the findings in this experiment would explain several mechanisms of other slimes, such as the signaling mechanisms in Dictyostelium discoideum. Mechanisms of chemotaxis of this amoeba could have the implications of facilitating metastasis of cancer, as well as facilitating curing infections in people [Wang:2011]. The medical implications of such discoveries are obvious, but understanding the signaling of such organisms would better allow for the understanding of human cell signaling. Furthermore, the ways by which Physarum signals to find food could be better understood in order to determine how certain types of mold grow in certain conditions, and how to better prevent them from harming human health [Alim:2017]. Our experiment begins to touch on the details of Physarum signaling, but more work will have to be done in the field in order to better understand how to apply the results to a modern field. The results of this experiment, while rejected, can be used to further more research in the field of slime molds.
