Title: Effect of injecting Calcium ions into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg on the strength of its contractions

Abstract:
Calcium ions play a prominent role in many biological processes in vertebrates including muscle contraction. Action potentials  allow Ca+2 to flow along its concentration gradient out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and into the sarcoplasm where the ion binds to troponin, uncovering actin binding sites and initiating contraction. Consequently, we tested the effect of injecting calcium ions into the gastrocnemius muscle (calf) of a Rana pipiens frog leg on the strength of its contractions when the sciatic nerve is stimulated. We speculated that activating voltage-gated calcium channels in the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg would result in stronger contractions when the sciatic nerve is stimulated. We were provided with two frog legs to measure their calf muscle contraction amplitude when the sciatic nerve-calf muscle complex is stimulated using a force transducer and myogram. Although the graph shows that there is an increase in amplitude of the contraction when calcium is injected to the gastrocnemius muscle, the paired t-test showed that these results were not significant. Increasing the sample size may have helped us achieve statistically significant results. This conclusion is supported by a previous study in which caffeine was found to increase Ca+2 release and amplitude.

Introduction:
When nerves work efficiently with muscles, they effectively allow organisms to sense and respond to the internal and external environments. Neuromuscular control — the unconscious trained response of a muscle to a signal regarding dynamic joint stability — involves a system that can respond within milliseconds, rather than responding in seconds to days as hormone-based systems do. Experiments testing the effects of stimuli on the neuromuscular system in animals have been carried out, and in one experiment tested on rabbits, researchers were able to correlate the twitch potentiation with the fraction of time during which the cell membrane is depolarized by the action potentials [Edman: 1976]. In our experiment, we demonstrated some properties of neuromuscular control in the Rana pipiens frog, commonly known as the Northern Leopard Frog. Our nerve-muscle complex of interest in frogs is the sciatic nerve and gastrocnemius muscle located in the legs of the frog. Calcium ions play a prominent role in many biological processes in vertebrates including muscle contraction. After acetylcholine crosses the neuromuscular junction and an action potential propagates along the motor endplate, the depolarization travels down transverse tubules to voltage-gated receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The receptors sense the change in voltage brought about by the action potential and trigger a conformational change in the DHP-ryanodine receptor complex [Davies: 1963]. This change allows Ca+2 to flow along its concentration gradient out of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and into the sarcoplasm where the ion binds to troponin, uncovering actin binding sites and initiating contraction. Consequently, we wanted to figure out why the aforementioned information about calcium is important and how it impacts muscle contraction strength and so the main objective of this experiment was to test the effect of activating voltage-gated calcium channels in the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg on the strength of its contractions when the sciatic nerve is stimulated. We hypothesized that activating voltage-gated calcium channels in the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg would show an increase in the average amplitude of contraction compared to its own baseline because of an increase of Ca+2 in the sarcoplasm which increases the tension achieved by a twitch and makes the muscle more likely to achieve tetany at high calcium concentrations [Allen: 1995].

Materials and Methods:
We were provided with two frog legs in order to be able to test with more accuracy and reliability. We placed a leg in a dissecting pan, and grasped the skin at the top of the leg and pulled the skin down towards the foot with a pair of forceps. We then laid the skinned leg in the dissecting pan and moistened it with frog Ringer’s solution, a solution that consists of sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, and sodium bicarbonate. With dissecting probe, we gently separated the inner thigh muscles beginning at the upper end and extending to the knee in order to reveal the white sciatic nerve along with its accompanying muscles. We freed this nerve from its attaching connective tissue using a dissecting needle and forceps. We also separated the gastrocnemius muscle from the adjacent muscles. Then, using one meter of thread, we tied a double knot around the distal end of the muscle, suspending it upright relative to the remaining muscle. Following that, we pinned the remaining muscle down to prevent its movement during contraction. We tied the end of the string to the force transducer allowing a bit of leeway for contraction; the string not being completely taut.                  On each frog leg, we measured the amplitude of the muscle contractions at the lowest amplitude that still gave strong contractions without any injections (control). Using a delta acquisition system, we recorded the baseline myogram from the force probe for five traces, with approximately one second between each stimulation to prevent summation from affecting the results. We recorded the average amplitudes of contraction for all five traces. We then injected 0.1 mL of 200 mM concentration of hi Calcium Ringer’s solution into the gastrocnemius muscle to activate voltage-gated calcium channels and measured the strength of the sciatic response at the same amplitude (frog 1 1.5V and frog 2 0.7V).  We recorded the myogram results for five traces of stimulation as done with the baseline measurement. The average amplitude for these five traces were recorded as well. A paired t-test was used to compare the averages recorded in the two conditions for any significant differences in the amplitudes of contraction between the control and treatment groups. Significance is defined as a p-value less than 0.05.

Results:
The results of the experiment are outlined in the figure above. Figure 1 shows a substantial increase in amplitude of contraction with the injection of calcium in each frog leg. The average contraction amplitude of leg 1 appeared to increase at a greater rate than that of leg 2. As for the statistics, the paired t-test comparing the average amplitude of contraction produced by the gastrocnemius before and after treatment did not find a significant difference between the two groups (d.f. = 2, t-value = 3.124, p-value = 0.09), thus the null hypothesis could not be rejected. However, Table 1 shows two additional paired t-tests that do not play a role in determining the overall significance of the results of this experiment whatsoever, but tell us that the original p-value can decrease substantially and produce significant results if we make minor improvements to this experiment.

Discussion:
Statistically, our hypothesis was not supported and therefore we must conclude that the caffeine-Ringer’s solution of 200 mM did not increase the amplitude of contraction in the gastrocnemius of Rana pipens significantly. In the Rana pipiens frog leg, the increase of Ca+2 in the sarcoplasm most likely increased the tension achieved by a twitch and made the muscle more likely to achieve tetany at high calcium concentrations [Allen: 1995]. However, the trend in the data, both graphically and while looking at the differences in the respective conditions’ means and Table 1, suggest that the p-value has a potential to decrease to less than 0.05 and yield significant results had we tested with a larger sample size and improved other steps in this experiment like proper connection between the frog nerve and muscle to the force transducer and the like. In future studies, the sample size used should be increased to decrease the possibility of errors caused by tissue degradation over time spent in the open air from effecting the overall results. This conclusion is supported by a previous study in which caffeine was found to increase Ca+2 release and thus tension of contraction increased proportionally to the concentration of caffeine administrated [Olorunshola: 2011]. In the latter study, if tetanic contraction is facilitated by Ca+2 remaining in the sarcoplasm,--inducing continuous contraction by keeping the sarcomere short--then clearly calcium achieved that tetanic contraction in the experiment performed here given the myograms post-treatment and qualitative results. Further experimentation is needed, however, to definitively say—with statistical significance—whether caffeine was the cause and that Ca+2 was released in response to its injection. All in all, our experiment’s results could have future implications on human health because the structure of the myofibril in Rana pipens is very similar if not the same as that of humans [Silver: 2018]. A study of this type would not explain or demonstrate why calcium induces alertness as the brain is not studied, only the muscle. Also, generalizability would come into question when applying the results of one study across species; therefore, human trials—within ethical boundaries of course—would be necessary to truly generalize the findings.

Figure 1. The Average Amplitude of Contraction of each frog leg's gastrocnemius baseline versus calcium treatment. A bar graph displaying the trend seen in the data which was that the average amplitude in the caffeine condition was greater than that of the baseline. The Baseline/Control value is about 0.1V. The Caffeine/Experimental value is 41.682 g. Error bars represent standard deviation. No significant difference was detected for the average gastrocnemius muscle contraction amplitudes between the two legs before and after Ca2+ injection (p-value = 0.09, d.f. = 2, t-value = 3.124).

Table 1. Respective p-values of three different paired t-tests, with the one comparing the average muscle contraction amplitudes (the first one) deciding the overall significance of results of our experiment. The other two t-tests show interesting p-values, being much less than 0.05. This suggests that the first paired t-test p-value has a potential to yield statistically significant results.*************************************************************************
