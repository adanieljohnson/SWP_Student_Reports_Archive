Title: Effect of cAMP Signaling Pathway on the Migration of Physarum polycephalum Towards Glucose

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum has common behaviors to certain stimuli, including glucose, which has been observed to migrate towards a glucose source. The cAMP signaling pathway is involved in the Physarum’s observed behavior of migrating towards glucose by activating the Protein Kinase A. In this experiment, we are testing the effects of curcumin (a PKA inhibitor) and dibutryl cAMP (a cAMP agonist). We hypothesized that the dibutryl cAMP would increase the migration rate of Physarum to the glucose, and the opposite will occur with the curcumin-treated Physarum. We placed one by one-centimeter blocks of Physarum on a water agar plate, three centimeters away from a 25mM glucose agar block. The experimental plates were treated with ten Ml of a 20X solution of the reagent and were incubated for ten minutes. The controll samples had an average migration rate of around 0.02 centimeters per hour toward the glucose block, the dibutryl-cAMP had an average migration of approximately 0.008 centimeters per hour, and the curcumin had an average migration of about 0.008 centimeters per hour away from the glucose. We found that none of the samples were statistically significent with each other, which might have been due to a poor Physarum stock sample, which means our experiments need to be retested.

Introduction:
Physarum polycephalum spends most of its life cycle in the plasmodial stage. It lives in a flat, slimy, yellow mass up to thirty centimeters wide and moves around using actin microfilaments. Slime molds are typically invasive species and can be detrimental to environments, so it is essential to understand this species and how to controll it [Urcelay: 2018]. Physarum is known to have common behaviors to certain stimuli such as light and certain amino acids. In this experiment, we will be investigating the typical behaviors of Physarum to glucose sources thanks to the cAMP signaling pathway. This pathway is crucial for many of Physarum’s common behaviors such as phototaxis where the Physarum move away from light since they prefer a dark living environment [Shiratori: 2017]. 

This pathway starts with a signal binding to a G-protein coupled receptor. The alpha subunit then activates adenyl cyclase which produces the second messenger cAMP. cAMP then activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) which is the protein that is responsible for the growth towards glucose [Guevara: 2018]. We will be treating Physarum with dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin since we know their effects of the cAMP signaling pathway, we can investigate the resulting impact on the growth of Physarum towards glucose. Dibutryl-cAMP activates PKA which we hypothesize will lead to an increase in migration rate towards glucose since more PKA will be activated from the normal cAMP produced from the signaling pathway and the dibutryl-cAMP. Curcumin is known to inhibit PKA which we hypothesize will result in a lower or no rate of migration towards glucose [Johnson: 2016].


Materials and Method:
Sterilizing Equipment
When setting up the plates for experiments two pieces of equipment were used: forceps and a spatula. Before using the equipment, it is crucial to sterilize them with ethanol to avoid contamination. Dip the tip of the instrument in a bath of ethanol and light it with a lighter. Wait for the flame to burn off and then wait an additional ten seconds for the piece of equipment to cool off. If you hear a sizzle when the instrument touches the gel, then that means you have not waited long enough for the apparatus to cool off. Make sure to sterilize each time you take the spatula out of the plate. 

Setting up controll plates
First label the three controll water agar plates and draw a one by one-centimeter block in the middle of the plate (for the Physarum sample) and then another block approximately three centimeters above it (for the 25 mM glucose sample). Make sure to cut one by one-centimeter blocks in both the Physarum and glucose dish using the tip of the spatula, which should be one centimeter in length. Then use the forceps to pick up the block and place in the appropriate wells. Then tap the lids on the plates, wrap in aluminum foil, place into a dark bag, and incubate in an incubator for 24 hours.

Setting up experimental plates
Again, make sure to label the different experimental water agar plates, three plates for the dibutryl-cAMP plates and another three for the curcumin plates. Dilute the dibutryl-cAMP and curcumin from a 1X solution to a 20X solution using deionized water. Then pipet ten milliliters of the appropriate solution onto the top of the water agar plate and let it incubate at room temperature (on the bench) for ten minutes. Then decant the remaining solution and use a chem-wipe to clean up the remaining solution on the plate. 

After treating the plates with the appropriate reagent, draw a one by one-centimeter block in the middle of the plate (for the Physarum sample) and then another block approximately three centimeters above it (for the 25 mM glucose sample) and cut them out using the tip of the spatula. Make sure to cut one by one-centimeter blocks in both the Physarum and glucose dish using the tip of the spatula, which should be one centimeter in length. Then use the forceps to pick up the block and place in the appropriate wells. Then tap the lids on the plates, wrap in aluminum foil, place into a dark bag, and incubate in an incubator for 24 hours.

Statistical Analysis
A two-tailed T-test was used to analyze the data and to conclude whether the difference in data between experimental and controll groups was statistically significent.


Results:
Below (Figure 1) are the results of the distance of the migration of the Physarum to the glucose block. None of the samples are statistically significent with each other (p &gt; 0.05). The controll samples had an average migration rate of around 0.02 centimeters per hour toward the glucose block, the dibutryl-cAMP had an average migration of approximately 0.008 centimeters per hour towards the glucose, and the curcumin had an average migration of about 0.008 centimeters per hour away from the glucose. 

Below is a figure of the hypothetical data that we expected due to our knowledge of the signaling pathway and the amino acids being tested. We should have expected an increase in the rate of migration with the dibutryl-cAMP samples since there is a higher activation of PKA, while on the other hand, assuming a decrease in the rate of migration in the curcumin samples.

Discussion:
From Figure 1, it was evident from the standard error bars for each sample that there is not much of a difference between the average migration rate of each plate. After running a paired T-test, our observations were confirmed when none of the p_values between the experimental groups and the controll, or even between the two experimental groups were statistically significent. However, we cannot disregard our hypothesis due to the weak growth of our Physarum samples. We expected that the Physarum treated with dibutryl-cAMP would increase the migration rate towards the glucose blocks since there are now two-second messengers that are phosphorylating and activating Protein Kinase A [Trevithick: 1977]. Similarly, we believe that the curcumin would inhibit or slow down the migration rate towards glucose since it inhibits PKA in the cAMP signaling pathway, which is crucial for the migration towards glucose [Shin: 2018]. Figure 2 above depicts the data we hypothesized.
On the other hand, the Physarum samples treated with curcumin should have a decreased migration rate since curcumin is a known PKA inhibitor since we know that the cAMP signaling pathway and the activation of PKA lead to the motile behavior towards glucose [Matveeva: 2012]. We noticed in the controll plates that the Physarum were not growing properly, and there may be some problem with the culture. For our Physarum blocks, we used two different culture plates, and we saw growth in some of the dishes, but none in the others. It is possible that one of the plates of Physarum was in the dormant or inactive stage of its life cycle, which leads to the low rates of migration and growth [Johnson: 1978]. Therefore, our next steps would be to rerun the same experiment, to determine whether these reagents (dibutryl cAMP and curcumin) affect the migration towards glucose, and make sure we have Physarum in the active growth stage in their life cycle.

Figure 1. This graph shows the Physarum migration rate towards the glucose block. Control and the dibutryl cAMP samples had an average of 0.02 centimeters per hour and 0.008 centimeters per hour respectively towards the glucose. The curcumin samples have an average of 0.008 centimeters per hour rate away from the glucose (+/- SD).
