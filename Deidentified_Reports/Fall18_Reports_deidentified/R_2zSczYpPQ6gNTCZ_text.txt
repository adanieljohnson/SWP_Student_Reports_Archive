Title: The effect of detergents on the photosynthetic rate of Spinacia Oleracea 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a significant natural process that produces Oxygen as a waste product which is a fundamental nutrient for life for many organisms on Earth. In this experiment, we focused on the various effects that a single detergent (Charlie’s Soap) had on the rate of photosynthetic activity of Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). Our experiment aimed to determine whether or not Charlie’s Soap detergent would significantly reduce the photosynthetic activity of the spinach, given that detergents are found to pollute the environment. Spinach was chosen as the model organism for this experiment as it is usually available throughout the year and is relatively inexpensive. We used a “Hill Reaction” assay for our experiment in order to create spinach chloroplast samples at a stock detergent concentration as well as a 50% dilution detergent concentration (in addition to positive/negative controls). We found that we were consistently able to see that both the stock concentration sample as well as the 50% dilution sample had lower changes in average absorbance compared to the positive control.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the natural process by which plants are able to use solar energy (sunlight) to create food from water and carbon dioxide [Bassham, 2018]. The most significant component to this process is Chlorophyll, as it creates Oxygen as a waste product. Oxygen is a gas that is considered to be essential for various organisms on Earth as it allows them to breath; in saying that, however, technological advancements, specifically in the fields of industry, have lead to the inadvertent production of pollution [Austin, 2016]. This in turn harms the environment in many ways, one of them being the disruption of photosynthesis. In an experiment conducted in 2010, Jovanic tested the effect of laundry detergent on bean leaves. After 21 days of treating and watering the plants with a solution which had been mixed with laundry detergent, he saw that the photosynthetic activity of the plants with mixed solution was approximately 45% less than that the control (no laundry solution) [Jovanic, 2010]. Our group  decided to run a similar experiment on our own, where the effect of various concentrations of detergent on the rate at which electrons are transferred (indirectly measuring rate of photosynthesis) was measured. For our experiment, we obtained multiple leaves of Spinach (Spinacia Oleracea) in order to obtain samples of enriched chloroplasts. The samples of chloroplasts were treated with “Charlie's Soap” detergent at a control (0%), stock concentration, and a 50% dilution (with water). In order to determine the rate of electron transport, the hill reaction was used and measured absorbance change. The experiment was conducted with the following hypothesis in mind, the plants treated by the Charlie's Soap detergent are likely to experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity.

Materials and Methods:
A mortar/pestle, a 250 mL beaker, and a 3 x 50 mL tubes were placed on ice. Spinach was then ground in 10 mL of buffer solution, after grinding, 10 more mL was added and the sample was strained into the 250 mL beaker. The chloroplasts of spinach were isolated by placing them in Tube A and then centrifuging them twice (200 x G for 3 min). The supernatant was poured into centrifuge tube B and spun (1000 x G for 10 min). The supernatant was poured off and then pellet B was resuspended in 20 mL of buffer solution. The negative control group was treated without chloroplast or laundry detergent. And the positive control just contained chloroplast (no detergent). The tubes/treatments that had laundry detergent were prepared using 8 mL of water, 2 mL of the cold reaction buffer and (100 Mm) and a phosphate of pH 6.5.The negative and positive controls were also created using similar means, the difference being whether or not chloroplast were included in the sample. After each control/treatment was prepared, the absorbance was measured at 10 minute intervals, for a total of 30 minutes by using a spectrophotometer measuring at 600 nm. Lastly, a two - sample t-test was used to analyze the extent to which photosynthesis was inhibited in each of the samples after having been exposed to stock and 50%  dilution of detergent, by looking at the percent change in the absorbance of DCPIP.


Results:
After conducting the experiment, there was a decrease in photosynthetic activity for the treatment group of spinach chloroplasts groups (more so than the control group).According to figure 1, during the total 30 minute time period of which the experiment was conducted, on average (in terms of percent change of absorbance), the positive control sample had the largest difference in the initial value recorded, and the recorded value of absorbance at the end of the experiment was approximately 17.80%. The opposite is true of the negative control, recording roughly -0.84%. Additionally, figure 1 also shows that the stock concentration has the largest difference over the 30 minute period for the treatment groups, averaging roughly 0.65%.
We also conducted a 2 sample T test for both experimental groups. For the stock concentration vs no detergent, we calculated a T value of 15.256, and a p value of 0.00000501. For the 50% dilution of detergent vs no detergent, a T value of 11.816 and a P value of 0.0000222 were calculated. For both T tests, 6 was the degrees of freedom.


Discussion:
Photosynthesis is a significant natural process that produces Oxygen as a waste product which is a fundamental nutrient for life for many organisms on Earth [Bassham, 2018]. In this experiment, we focused on the various effects that a single detergent (Charlie’s Soap) had on the rate of photosynthetic activity of Spinach (Spinacia oleracea). For our experiment, we hypothesized that the plants treated by the Charlie's Soap detergent are likely to experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity.After conducting our experiment, the data collected supports our original hypothesis, which states that the samples treated by the Charlie's Soap detergent are likely to experience a decrease in photosynthetic activity. Since our data is statistically significant, this means that there is statistical likelihood that a relationship between photosynthetic activity and detergent concentration is caused by something other than chance. Both of our experimental groups, stock concentration and 1:1 dilution did produce data at a statistically significant level, p = 0.00000501, and 0.0000222 respectively. This supports the notion that pollutants inhibit/decrease the rate of electron transport.This data is also aligned with desptovic’s work that displayed that bean plants were impacted by detergents, in that detergents in both experiments (Ours and Desptovic’s) lead to the respective organism to have a decreased rate of electron transport.[Jovanic, 2010]. We anticipated the treatment groups to have a lower change in absorbance over time, because, according to a separate study conducted by Deamer, biologically speaking, the introduction of detergents causes chloroplasts to burst, leading in turn to a decreased rate of electron transport as the chloroplast are rendered innate [Deamer, 1967]. For the 50% dilution experimental group, we see that there is a lower change in absorbance over time compared to the stock concentration, we would anticipate the dilution having a larger percent change value over time (given that electron transport is more likely to occur at a faster given that the dilution solution is not as strong of a pollutant as the stock detergent). In order to be certain that this result was not due to error, we could run additional trials of the experiment in order to determine if the expected outcome is what is observed, or it there is an error in experimental procedure. Aside from sources of error, there were various limitations to our experiment as well. To start, we only tested two (or 3, if one counts 0%) varying concentrations of detergent. Increasing variability of the concentrations of  “Charlie’s Soap”  detergent would have reproduced conditions more similar to those representative to its environment. Additionally,  the fact that we only tested one form/brand of detergent is a much more severe limitation to the experiment as there are multiple forms of pollution (in relation to detergent) that pollute the environment. Since there are various types of pollutants, they may all each have their own respective effects on the photosynthetic process, in terms of severity and the means through which they stop photosynthesis. In terms of expanding the scope of this experiment, we could potentially test a variety of plants to see how differently various plants respond to detergents (to see if certain plants are more resistant to pollutants than others). For future study, I find it beneficial to test how various pollutants affect the rate of photosynthetic activity, I believe that in doing so, we can see how various advancements in technology affect the rate at which a plant conducts photosynthesis.
