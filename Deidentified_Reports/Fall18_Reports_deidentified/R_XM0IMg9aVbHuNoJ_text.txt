Title: Sciatic Nerve Response of Frog Legs in the Presence of Calcium Inhibitor

Abstract:
Calcium is one of several ions that is necessary for movement and responding to internal and external stimuli. Calcium and ATP are important in making muscles contract, so for this lab we decided to test the sciatic nerve response to a stimulus in the presence of calcium receptor inhibitor. Using three different frog legs, we tested each leg with and without calcium receptor inhibitor, therefore, we used a two-tailed paired t-test. We found the results to be statistically insignificant. The benefits of doing a study on frog legs is that they have the same muscle contracting mechanisms as humans, so we are able to study the effects of calcium inhibition without having to perform studies on humans. Studies like this also emphasize the importance of calcium in the muscular system

Introduction:
All complex organisms have both a neuromuscular system and an endocrine system. The neuromuscular system and is made up of neurons and muscles and is much faster than the endocrine system because it works with neurotransmitters. The endocrine system is made up of glands that secrete and respond to hormone inputs which makes it much slower. The neurons and muscles in the neuromuscular system respond to internal and external stimuli. There are specific ions that are vital to the neuromuscular system to make a response happen, one of which is calcium. Calcium is vital in making muscles contract; however, sufficient ATP must be present or else fatigue will occur in the muscle [Johnson: 2018]. In this lab, a force transducer was used in order to measure the contractile force of the muscle when calcium was present and when it was inhibited. A force transducer is used because they can easily monitor the contractile activity of muscle fibers [Melzer: 1995]. We hypothesize that if calcium is inhibited, then the neural response will change.

Materials and Methods:
We tested our hypothesis in the field by using 3 frog legs. Each leg that the experiment was performed on and acted as the control and experimental group. The frog leg was set up following the steps shown in the videos, then the response of the sciatic nerve was tested to stimuli of 0 volts, .5 volts, .75 volts, and 1 volt. Data was recorded, then the leg was injected with .2 mL of calcium receptor inhibitor. After waiting 8 minutes to allow the calcium inhibitor to bind with the receptors, the sciatic nerve response was tested to stimuli of 0 volts, .5 volts, .75 volts, and 1 volt again, and data was recorded. This process was repeated for the other two frog legs. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze the data.

Results:
When the leg was injected with the calcium inhibitor, the leg swelled up and looked bloated. After the inhibitor was injected and 8 minutes had past, the sciatic nerve was stimulated and there was a smaller but visible response. For the first two legs, the sciatic response decreased after being injected with the calcium inhibitor. The third leg had a higher response at every stimulus after it had been injected with calcium inhibitor. This leg reacted differently than the other legs. Graph 1 shows the sciatic response of each frog leg prior to being injected with calcium inhibitor and the sciatic response of each frog leg after being injected with calcium inhibitor. The data shown in the graph is the results of the sciatic nerve response in response to .75 volts of stimulus. We used a two-tailed paired t-test and found our p value to be .358.

Discussion:
Given that the p-value is greater than .05, the results are not statistically significant. The hypothesis that if calcium receptor inhibitor is injected into the leg than the neural response will change is not accepted. While this seems to disagree with the science behind it, the response of the sciatic nerve should have changed as a result of the presence of calcium receptor inhibitor. Calcium is the final activator for a muscle contraction. It does not directly interact with myosin and actin, but instead interacts with troponin which prevents the interaction of myosin and actin [Ebashi: 1968]. Calcium allows for the troponin to expose the actin filament which will then bind with the myosin heads and allow for muscle contraction to occur. When calcium is inhibited this process should not occur because actin will not be exposed because it is still bound to troponin. The results of this experiment do not match this and it is likely due to the results of the third leg. As shown in the graph 1, when injected with the calcium inhibitor, the leg had a high sciatic response than it had when it was not inhibited with calcium. It is possible that the third leg did not receive the full .2mL of calcium inhibitor, so calcium was still able to bind to their receptors and allow for a muscle response that was higher than expected. This study is relevant to the real world because it is an ethically sound way to test the effects of ions like calcium and their importance in muscle contraction. By performing the study on a frog leg, observations that can be generalizes to humans, who similar musculoskeletal systems, without causing harm to them. In the future it would be interesting to test how potassium or sodium inhibitors would affect muscle contraction, or to redo this lab and see if our results would be statistically significant.

Figure Legends: 
The graph above shows the sciatic nerve response to .75 volts of stimulus to three separate frog legs with and without calcium receptor inhibitor. The orange line represents the sciatic response to stimulus after the leg was injected with calcium inhibitor. The blue line is sciatic response before the leg was injected with calcium inhibitor.*************************************************************************
