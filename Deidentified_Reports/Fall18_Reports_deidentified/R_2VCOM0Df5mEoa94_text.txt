Title: Physarum Polycephalum’s Significantly Greater Positive Chemotaxis Towards Glucose than Fructose Suggests Mediation of the Control of the PI3K/ PTEN pathway by a Structure-Specific Membrane-Bound Receptor 

Abstract:
Consulted studies strongly suggest that Physarum Polycephalum’s chemotactic behavior towards glucose operates under receptor-mediated controll and more specifically, by the PI3K/ PTEN pathway. In this study,  the positive chemotaxis of Physarum to glucose and fructose; metabolizable sugar molecules with differing structures, is measured.  The results of a significently larger mean positive chemotaxis of Physarum to glucose in comparison to fructose suggests the existence of a membrane-bound receptor in Physarum cells responsible for initiation of the PI3K/ PTEN pathway upon interaction with 6-membered ring carbohydrates.  A future research objective on this organism is isolating this receptor to more conclusively identify its chemical properties and role in the PI3K/ PTEN pathway. 


Introduction:
In its plasmodial stage, Physarum Polycephalum is a yellow, flat, gooey mass up to 30 cm in diameter, that naturally lives within damp decomposing leaves and ground debris [Johnson:2018].  It can undergo several complex behaviors in this stage such as gravitaxis, phototaxis, chemotaxis etc. [Johnson:2018].  The plasmodial behavior that was considered in this study is chemotaxis, a process by which cells recognize external chemical gradients and in response, systematically translate these cues into amplified intracellular signaling resulting in cell elongation, actin polymerization towards the leading edge, the side where the organism actually extends itself [Johnson:2018], and movement along the gradient [Yu-Wang:2011].  

Several studies have uncovered intracellular signaling pathways responsible for chemotaxis in Physarum Polycephalum and organisms similar to it.  In a study conducted by N.B. Mateeva and V.A. Teplov on Physarum Polycephalum, which investigated the possibility of a tight coupling of the enzyme phospholipase C with the signal pathway PI3K/ PTEN, a ubiquitous mechanism that is known for controllling chemotaxis and cell shape in free-living amoebae and mammalian tissue cells, results suggested tight coupling to be the case [Matveeva: 2012].  This was because U73122, an inhibitor of the signal transduction to phospholipase C, suppressed the chemotaxis of Physarum towards glucose.  Therefore, the motile behavior of the Physarum is believed to operate under receptor-mediated controll, and the PI3K/ PTEN pathway is believed to have controll in the chemotaxis of Physarum towards glucose [Matveeva: 2012]. 

David Knowles and Michael Carlile studied the chemotaxis of Physarum Polycephalum towards various carbohydrates [Knowles: 1978].  Some of the carbohydrates experimented with were unable to support growth in Physarum, and others were.  A major trend in the results of the study was that the sugars capable of supporting growth were attractants to Physarum such as glucose, which was predicted to be the case. However,  2-deoxy-D-glucose, incapable of supporting growth, was also a strong attractant.  Furthermore, fructose, a compound which can be metabolized by Physarum was not an attractant.  Therefore, Knowles and Carlile concluded that the ability to metabolize a compound was not necessary for positive chemotaxis from Physarum [Knowles: 1978].  Interesting to note about the difference between fructose and 2-deoxy-D-glucose is that the former’s structure consists of a 5-membered ring and the latter, a 6-membered ring.  This could have gone unseen by Knowles and Carlile but piqued our interest determining if a 6-membered ring structure is a prerequisite for triggering the pathway responsible for positive chemotaxis toward sugar.

The objective of our experiment was to experimentally determine if the structural recognition of a 6-membered ring carbohydrate triggers the PI3K/ PTEN pathway, leading to positive chemotaxis in Physarum Polycephalum.  An experiment resulting in statistically significently greater positive chemotaxis of Physarum towards a carbohydrate with a 6-membered ring structure that it can metabolize in comparison to Physarum’s positive chemotaxis towards a carbohydrate with a 5-membered ring structure that it can metabolize would be suggestive of this.  Our experimental setup could be characterized as incubation of Physarum on agar plates with localized fructose in one experimental group and Physarum on agar plates with localized glucose in another.  This would be for the purpose of measuring the distance traveled by Physarum in the direction of the respective carbohydrates after a 24 hour period.

We hypothesized that the incubated Physarum on agar plates with localized glucose would have a substantially larger positive chemotaxis than the incubated Physarum on agar plates with localized fructose.  This would be displayed in our results as a statistically significent greater mean positive chemotaxis to glucose than fructose by Physarum.  Our null hypothesis was that the presence of either localized fructose or glucose would not have a statistically significent effect on the positive chemotaxis of Physarum towards either, and our alternate hypothesis was that the presence of either localized fructose of glucose would lead to a statistically significent difference between the positive chemotaxis of Physarum toward either.


Materials and Method:
The experimental setup involved 2 experimental groups and 1 negative controll group.  5 trials were done for each of the experimental groups, and 1 was done for the negative controll group.  11 water agar plates were obtained, and on each, 3 1x1 cm equidistant blocks were drawn on a line on the covering in the center of each plate.  However, the two leftmost blocks were removed.  The left space served as the place for the chemical (fructose or glucose), the middle space was for Physarum, and the right space was for the blank to controll for the gap between the block and the water agar. 
An additional 2 water agar plates were soaked with 25mM glucose and fructose respectively for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, 5 1x1 cm blocks were removed from each plate and inserted into the leftmost space in the water agar plate of the corresponding experimental group, excluding the negative controll group.  11 1x1 cm blocks were removed from 4 additional water agar plates housing live Physarum and were placed in the middle space of each of the 11 water agar plates utilized in the experiment.  The one plate used for the negative controll group had a block of Physarum water agar in the middle and the original water agar to either side of it. 
Each of the plates was then labeled with a marker according to its functional role within the experiment and then sealed with paper tape and placed into a black bag which disallowed any light passage.  After a 24 hour period, the distance of the migration of the Physarum in the direction of the carbohydrate molecules was measured in centimeters.  Since we hypothesized that Physarum would have positive chemotaxis towards each of the carbohydrates, a one-tailed t_test was conducted to analyze any effect that either of the molecules may have had on the positive chemotaxis of Physarum towards it.  The alpha value was 0.05, the degrees of freedom was 4, and the measure of variance, the standard deviation was computed using the 5 trials from each of the experimental groups. 




Results:
The results of the one-tailed t_test comparing the mean positive chemotaxis for the Physarum in the glucose treatment group to that in the fructose treatment group at alpha=0.05  was: (t_stat: 4.02492, d.f.: 4, p_value: .001907), and the result was statistically insignificent.  The mean positive chemotaxis for the Physarum in the glucose treatment group was  2.2 cm, and the mean positive chemotaxis of Physarum to fructose was 0.4 cm, as is displayed in Figure 1.  The standard deviation of the glucose and fructose treatment groups respectively were: .837 cm and .548 cm also displayed as the error bars in Figure 1.  

Trends: The mean positive chemotaxis of Physarum to glucose was more than 5 times greater than that of Physarum to fructose, and the measure of variance differed by .289 cm-the glucose treated Physarum group’s trials had greater variance.   


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, which was that the Physarum on water agar plates with localized glucose would have a substantially larger positive chemotaxis than the Physarum on water agar plates with localized fructose was supported. The result of our one-tailed t_test which compared the means of each treatment group was significent. The value of the mean positive chemotaxis of the Physarum treated with glucose was significently larger than that of the Physarum treated with fructose. 

Figure 1 is demonstrative of the significent difference between the mean positive chemotaxis for the Physarum in each of the experimental groups as the bar representing the mean positive chemotaxis in glucose is approximately 5 times the size of that for the bar representing the Physarum in fructose. Also in figure 1, the error bars show that the variances within the treatment groups were comparable.

Strongly suggested and reinforced by the work of N.B. Mateeva and V.A. Teplov on Physarum Polycephalum was the belief that the Physarum’s motile behavior in the direction of sugar operates under receptor-mediated controll and by the PI3K/ PTEN pathway [Matveeva: 2012].  Since in our experiment, Physarum’s positive chemotactic response towards glucose was significently greater than that towards fructose, even though Physarum is capable of metabolizing both sugars [Knowles: 1978], this is suggestive that Physarum maintained an ability to sense a difference between these molecules.  It is unknown however what the significance of the ability only to acknowledge 6-membered ring carbohydrates as food is, especially if similar compounds with a differing structure can be metabolized [Knowles: 1978].  Since Knowles and Carlile supported in their study that the ability to metabolize a compound is not prerequisite for positive chemotaxis in Physarum [Knowles: 1978], structural difference between glucose and fructose certainly seems to be a major attraction factor considered by Physarum.

Based on the combination of the major result of our experiment which was a significently greater positive chemotaxis towards glucose than fructose by Physarum,  and the previously mentioned conclusions from Knowles and Carlile, and Mateeva and Teplov, we believe that there is a receptor directly involved in initiation the chemotactic response of the PI3K/ PTEN pathway and that it is likely located on the plasma membrane of Physarum cells.  We also hypothesize that its ligand is a exclusively 6-membered ring carbohydrate, which explains why Physarum did not have positive chemotaxis towards fructose even though it could have harvested energy from it.

An objective for a future course of study would be isolating this receptor assuming it exists, for the purpose of experimenting with it more directly to discover other chemical properties unknown such as the exact nature of its interaction with the ligand.  Another of objective would be analyzing Physarum’s chemotactic response to sugars that have neither a 5 or 6-membered ring structure because it could be the case that this receptor is simply exclusionary of 5-membered ring carbohydrates.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1. This figure displays the mean positive chemotaxis of Physarum towards glucose, and fructose, computed from the distance traveled by Physarum on the 5 water agar plates in each of the treatment groups. Note that the lone negative controll group in which Physarum was not treated with a carbohydrate but was plated with regular water agar is not included, as it’s movement presumably was not directed by anything accounted for by our experiment.  The error bars are representative of the standard deviation values for the 5 trials (water agar plates) treated with fructose or glucose.
