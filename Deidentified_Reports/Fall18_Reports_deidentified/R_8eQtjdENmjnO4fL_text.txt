Title: Affects of sodium channel inhibitor on the threshold voltage of the gastrocnemius muscle of Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The spreading of action potentials down the axons of neurons are initiated by the movement of ions such as sodium through voltage gated ion channels [Maarten: 2008] This experiment was aimed at discovering the importance of sodium channels within the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of the Rana pipien. To distinguish this importance, a sodium inhibitor was used to inactivate the sodium channels within the muscle. The effects of a sodium inhibitor on the threshold voltage for muscle contraction was examined on three (3) separate frog legs. Each frog leg was tested for initial threshold voltage response, then for threshold voltage response post introduction of the sodium inhibitor. The differences between the average threshold voltage response of the frog leg pre and post sodium inhibitor was recorded and tested for significance. The results confirmed that there was in fact a difference between the average threshold voltage response between the frog legs pre and post sodium inhibitor, but this difference was proven to be insignificant by the p-value test. Due to the results being insignificant, the hypothesis could not be confirmed. This experiment can be improved upon using a different stimulus for the sciatic nerve of the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg. 

Introduction:
Myofibers are “cylindrical, multi-nuclear, fused aggregates of cells” [Johnson: 2018] that bind together to make skeletal muscles. The action of all skeletal muscle is controlled by an interworking mechanism of motor neurons. The sciatic nerve of the frog leg is the messenger that is responsible for the transfer of action potentials from the brain to the muscles of the frog leg. The contraction of the skeletal leg muscles of the Rana pipiens is stimulated by a depolarization of the axons of motor neurons which control multiple myofibers of skeletal muscle. More specifically, the opening of sodium channels within the axons of neurons lead to the depolarization of axons throughout the muscle fibers. The spreading of depolarization in the muscle fibers cause the release of calcium which causes the muscle fibers of the frog leg to contract. [Johnson: 2018] But what if the sodium channels were somehow prevented from opening? Would this affect the spreading of the action potential down the axon and ultimately prevent the muscle from contracting? To answer this question, we have designed an experiment that involves the injection of a sodium inhibitor into a frog leg. In theory, the sodium inhibitor will leave the sodium channels impermeable to sodium ions. Thus, ultimately preventing the spread of the action potential down the axon and into the muscle. [Bertil: 1968] If sodium channels are inhibited, then there will be a change in the threshold voltage between the frog leg pre and post introduction of the sodium inhibitor. 

Materials and Methods:
The first part of this experiment involved collecting three (3) legs of the Rana pipiens. Each frog leg underwent the following steps; First, the frog leg was deskinned, and the Gastrocnemius muscle was separated from the thigh bone, then cut at the tendon connecting the Gastrocnemius muscle to the knee of the frog. A knot was then tied around the tendon that was previously connected to the knee. This knot was then attached to a stretching mechanism that is connected to a pole and was suspended just over the frog leg. This was intended to keep tension in the muscle to better see the contractions. The frog leg was held in place by pins and a probe was placed over the sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Electric currents were sent through the probe and into the frog leg at increasing voltage. The voltage was increased slowly until a threshold response was recorded. The sodium inhibitor was then introduced to the frog leg and five (5) minutes was provided for the sodium inhibitor to take effect on the frog leg. After the five minutes were up, the same test of increasing the voltage until a threshold response was recorded was implemented. The thresholds for pre and post sodium inhibitor of each frog leg was recorded, as was the differences between the two. The threshold responses for pre and post sodium inhibitor was then averaged and compared. 

Results:
From Figure 1 it can be confirmed that there is a difference between the average threshold response of the frog leg pre and post-exposure to the sodium inhibitor. The frog legs before the introduction of the sodium inhibitor had an average threshold voltage of 2.6, while the frog legs after the introduction of the sodium inhibitor had an average threshold voltage of .4. Using the results found in this experiment, Figure 2 provides that the p-value was found to be .42265.

Discussion:
From the results it can be concluded that there was in fact a difference in the average threshold voltage size between the frog legs pre and post introduction of the sodium inhibitor. The p-value of .422 being larger than .05 proves that the results are insignificant, and our hypothesis is not supported. Sodium does play an important role in the depolarization of axons and the transfer of action potentials between neurons and skeletal muscle. In living organisms, the transfer of action potentials is dependent on the movement of ions within the neuron. Sodium plays an important role in the initial stages of depolarization. [Johnson:2018] However, the results of this experiment show that the inhibition of sodium channels does not cause a distinguishable difference between the threshold voltage of the frog leg pre and post sodium inhibitor. The action potential still travels down the axon and into the gastrocnemius muscle of the frog leg even with the sodium channels being inhibited. This could be due to the fact that the stimulus used to contract the gastrocnemius muscle was an electrical one, not a chemical one. “action potential generation in the axon can be explained by the more hyperpolarized voltage-dependence of activation of sodium channels in the axon initial segment” [Maarten: 2008] The electrical stimulus could have directly bypassed the need for sodium to cause a depolarization of the axon which leads to the spreading of an action potential down the axon of living organisms. This would explain why the sodium inhibitor can cause paralysis on living organisms that are stimulated by the movement of ions, but not on an individual frog leg that is stimulated by an electric pulse.  
The results of this lab, although insignificant, can be used to further understand the importance of sodium channels within neurons. This lab showed that using an electrical pulse as a stimulant to the sciatic nerve of the frog leg might overrule the importance of the sodium channels found in the axons of the frog nerve. In future experiments, avoidance of an electrical pulse in the stimulus of the sciatic nerve could produce different results. 
Possible sources of error within this lab include the measuring of the threshold voltage of the frog legs. The electrical input values that were used were not initiated at a low enough voltage. This could have caused the recorded threshold values to be higher than the actual threshold voltage values.
