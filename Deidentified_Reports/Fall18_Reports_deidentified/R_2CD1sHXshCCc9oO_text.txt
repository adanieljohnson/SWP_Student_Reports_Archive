Title: The Impact of Herbicide Inhibition in Chloroplast Samples of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
All living organisms need a source of energy to survive. Autotrophs capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis In our experiment, we tested the effect of acid rain dilution, homemade herbicide, and synthetic herbicide (RoundUp) on the rate of photosynthesis. The main objective of this lab was to determine whether or not environmental factors inhibit the process of photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea . By utilizing DCIP, an electron carrier that turns from blue to clear when reduced, we were able to simulate the electron transport chain in photosynthesis and measure the amount of reduction by calculating the percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes. It is hypothesized that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the controll group tested (chloroplasts without herbicide). Further, based off of its very low pH, acid rain was expected to show the least percent change over 30 minutes. Our hypothesis was not supported as the data showed that the synthetic herbicide had the least percent change of -19.22+/-3.39%, demonstrating the most inhibition of photosynthesis. Using an ANOVA test, the p_value for our data was 0.295 showing the inhibition was not statistically significent. 


Introduction:
All energy on Earth originates from the sun. 3 billion years ago, cyanobacteria became the first living organism that was able to harness the sun’s energy and convert it to energy that can be used in cellular processes. Once the key to capturing that energy was found, organisms have evolved over time to harness and capture that energy in the most efficient and effective manner, a process we know today as photosynthesis. This process begins in the chloroplasts of plant cells where chlorophyll molecules found within the chloroplasts first absorb solar radiation. Once absorbed, electrons are immediately excited from this influx of energy and they leave their carrier molecule resulting in a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane. That gradient is extremely important as it allows the cell to move into the next part of photosynthesis, ATP synthesis using the ATPase. With the help of the newly made ATP, glucose is formed and stored within the cell. When needed, glucose is broken down into ATP by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and then respiration, which occurs in mitochondria. 
In our experiment, we will be focusing on the role of environmental factors on the electron transport chain and the efficiency of photosynthesis. The general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts plus light is called the Hill reaction. With this knowledge, an alternative electron carrier, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), was chosen to simulate the electron transport chain in photosynthesis. Naturally, DCIP is a dark blue compound; however, when reduced, DCIP changes from dark blue to colorless. Therefore, DCIP reduction can be measured using a spectrophotometer by calculating the absorbance over time. The absorbances can then be compared to determine if certain herbicides disrupt reduction reactions required for photosynthesis.
This study specifically involves testing the effects of different herbicides on photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea.  Spinacia oleracea is a plant in the family Amaranthaceae, and is an ideal plant to study photosynthesis due to its strong photosynthesis effects [Roberts: 2016].  In our lab, we test the effects of acid rain, homemade herbicide, and common store bought herbicide (Round-up) known to disrupt photosynthesis. The first inhibitor, acid rain, is a well-known pollutant with a low pH that damages the plant and disturbs the photosynthetic process [Zhang: 2018]. It is seen in Zhang’s study that treatments of acid rain reduced the rice chloroplast ATPase activity and gene transcription level [Zhang: 2018].  The second inhibitor tested is a homemade herbicide, comprised of vinegar and a clove oil. This herbicide has been previously examined in Evans’s study and was seen to limit weed growth in sweet corn, potatoes, and onions due to manipulated inhibitions in the chloroplasts  [Evans: 2008]. The last inhibitor tested, glyphosate, is a store bought synthetic herbicide known as Round-up. In a study conducted by Gomes, RoundUp was shown to effect on photosynthesis, respiration, and pigment concentrations due to glyphosate inducing oxidative stress from hydrogen peroxide accumulation [Gomes: 2016].  
For this experiment, we decided to put our samples under blue light.  Studies have shows that blue light, with a wavelength of 490-450 nm, has a positive influence on chloroplast development in plant cells [Poudel: 2008]. Blue light also was responsible for the highest number of stomata observed in all the genotypes with a significent difference compared to red light [Poudel: 2008]. Due to this, we decided blue light would be the best option to promote maximum photosynthesis. Using the information given above, we look to test the extent that different herbicides affect photosynthesis over time under blue light. The results will give us a better understanding of how herbicides with varying acidity and different herbicide mixtures can affect the rate of photosynthesis. We hypothesize that the three herbicides will disrupt the rate of photosynthesis and will show a smaller percent change in absorbance over 30 minutes compared to the chloroplasts without herbicide.  We also hypothesize that acid rain will show the least percent change over 30 minutes.  This hypothesis is based off of research that indicated the harsh effects of acid rain, an extremely acidic solution (pH 4), goes beyond disrupting the electron transport chain and into the actual degradation of plant cells from chloroplasts to the cell wall [Zhang:2018].


Materials and Method:
Method for preparing solutions: 

Dilute Nitric acid to a 1:4 ratio of acid to water. Need 6 Ml of diluted solution. 
Prepare home-made solution: 4 Ml white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2 Ml clove oil. 
A blue light bulb hungover test tube solutions. 
Attain 6 Ml of synthetic herbicide (RoundUp 1.33 Gal. Ready-to-Use weed and Grass killer). 

Method:
This lab began by deveining five medium-sized spinach leaves and putting them into a mortar and pestle with 10Ml of cold grinding buffer (400mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  The leaves were grinded to a thick paste before an additional 10Ml of cold grinding buffer was added. With the use of 3 layers of cheesecloth, the slimy green solution was then strained into a chilled beaker.  This strained green liquid was then put into a 50Ml tube and centrifuged for 13 minutes with a balance across from it.
        	Before the now enriched chloroplast solution was added in, 16 large test tubes were prepared with the reaction mixtures seen in the table shown above.  Test tube 1 was used to blank the spectrophotometer. Test tubes 2-4 with no chloroplasts were used as negative controll in the experiment. The chloroplasts with no herbicide, test tubes 5-7, served as the positive controll for the experiment.  The acid rain found in test tubes 8-10 were prepared with 1Ml of 25% nitric acid.  Just like with acid rain, 1Ml of homemade herbicide was added to tubes 11-13 made from a mixture of 4Ml white vinegar pH 2.4 and 2Ml of clove oil. The synthetic herbicide used in tubes 14-16 came from 1Ml of RoundUp. Each tube was mixed well after adding the chloroplasts and transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes to measure their respective absorbances.
        	After blanking the spectrophotometer at 600nm, the initial absorbance for each sample at was recorded at time zero.  Immediately after the absorbances were collected, all of the samples were placed under a blue light. The same two steps were performed every 10 minutes until 30 minutes was reached.  Once the data is gathered and percent change calculated, an ANOVA test was used to determine whether or not our data was statistically significent.  The legitimacy of the ANOVA test is ensured by running it with our negative controll. The ANOVA test will compare the absorbances of the groups with chloroplast to the groups with chloroplasts plus the different herbicides.


Results:
The absorbance reading at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes per test tube allowed us to calculate the percent change after each 10 minute interval as seen in Table 1. This date was then converted into a graph shown below (Figure 1). The only solution that did not display a negative percent change over 30 minutes was our negative controll, the solution with no chloroplasts. This was expected as there were no chloroplasts in the solution to reduce the DCIP and change the color from blue to clear. Further, these results help support the assumption that the spectrophotometer was properly functioning during the experiment. The solution with chloroplasts on the other hand showed the most percent change over 30 minutes at -44/46% change in absorbance. These results show that the enriched chloroplasts we were using worked and reduced the DCIP. Of the three specific inhibitors tested, the synthetic herbicide Roundup was seen to have the greatest impact on the rate of photosynthesis with only a 19.22% change in absorbance after 30 minutes. Our data had a p_value for the percent changes of 0.295 determined from an ANOVA test, which yielded no statistical significance.


Discussion:
In conclusion, our hypothesis that acid rain would inhibit the rate of photosynthesis the most was not supported by the data collected. Rather, it was Roundup, the synthetic herbicide, that resulted in the most inhibition observed. By comparing the three inhibitors tested to the controll sample of just chloroplasts, all three were shown to decrease the amount of photosynthesis observed. This conclusion can be drawn from comparing the percent changes in absorbance over 30 minutes. The change in absorbance and the amount of photosynthesis are correlated due to the understanding and use of the Hill Reaction to simulate the reduction that occurs on the electron transport chain of photosynthesis. The Hill Reaction, as previously mentioned in the introduction, involves the enriched chloroplasts, obtained from spinning down the spinach leaf paste, reducing DCIP, an electron carrier. The reduction of DCIP causes the originally blue liquid to turn clear overtime and can be measured using a spectrophotometer. In the end, the less change in absorbance one observes, the more effective the herbicide is at disrupting the reduction of DCIP and by association, the process of photosynthesis. 
Using the ANOVA test, a p_value of 0.295 was calculated for our date. The ANOVA test compared each of the average absorbances with chloroplast sample to the average absorbances of the three different inhibitors tested. The high p_value computed is not statistically significent and thus the null hypothesis must be accepted that the three inhibitors tested did not have a significent effect on the rate of photosynthesis. However, the data collected can still be analyzed to draw conclusions and interpret what our results mean. 
In a similar study, herbicides made of vinegar and clove oil were tested to see how effective it was in preventing weeds from growing and negatively affecting sweet corn, potatoes and onions. The weeds in each of the three different crops were treated with different concentration of the vinegar and clove oil herbicide. Weed controll, biomass, crop injury and yield were all measured to determine the total effect of the herbicide at different ratios [Bellinder, Evans: 2008]. The experiment led to the discovery that the 200-grain vinegar at 636 liter per hectare was the most effective in decreasing the amount of weeds in each crop. After analyzing the results, a trend was found that the weed species and size at the time of treatment plays a role in how effective the herbicides were. The idea to test a “homemade” herbicide came from this experiment as it supported our assumption that vinegar and clove oil would reduce the rate of photosynthesis. However, Bellinder’s study was much more large scale, produced a lot of data over 4 weeks, and also showed the clove oil to not be as effective of an herbicide as vinegar. This leads to our reasoning as to why our results were not statistically significent. 	
Alternate explanations as to why the experiment gave us the data it did is that maybe our dilutions of the three inhibitors tested were not strong enough. Instead of making the homemade herbicide a 1 to 1 ratio of clove oil to vinegar, based off of the study cited above, the solution should have had a greater concentration of vinegar as it was shown to inhibit weed growth the most. Further it is possible that the synthetic herbicide was much more potent than the acid rain and homemade herbicide that were made in lab. This assumption is due to the fact that the specific concentrations of ingredients were not given on the bottle of RoundUp. This could be one possible explanation as to why the Roundup was seen to be more effective at disrupting photosynthesis than the other 2 inhibitors. Additionally, when the DCIP was first added to the acid rain sample, it did not turn the solution as blue as the other samples. This may be attributed to human error in adding the correct amount of DCIP to the acid rain test tubes. Nonetheless, any minute change in the absorbance produces a large percent change since the initial absorbance was so low. To show this one only needs to compare the data obtained from the homemade herbicide to the acid rain. The homemade sample decreased in absorbance by a total of 0.039 over 30 minutes and showed a percent change in absorbance of -29.77%. Inversely, acid rain decreased in absorbance by a measly 0.005 over 30 minutes, but that small decrease was calculated to be practically the same as the homemade at -29.63% change in absorbance.
 A study similar to Bellinder’s tested various concentrations of acid rain at different dilutions to see their effect on photosynthesis. The experiment specifically wanted to focus on how acid rain disrupts disrupts ATPase, the protein responsible for generating ATP after the electron transport chain has cause a proton gradient to form. The different samples of acid rain were made to correlate with different environments that produce acid rain such as industrial factories or volcanic areas. After analyzing the data, the results showed that different concentrations of acid rain led to different results. Some samples proved to be effective in disrupting ATPase activity while others had little to no effect. [Zhang, Hu, Wang, Zhou, Huang: 2018]. The dilution of 1:4 Nitric Acid  that was used in our lab may have been an ineffective amount and thus explains why little inhibition was seen. More research should have gone into determining the exact dilution for our acid rain sample used in lab. 
Some possible sources of error during the lab may have come from not wearing gloves while using the spectrophotometer. When handling the vials put into the spectrophotometer, smudges may have formed on the side that could skew the absorbance numbers recorded. Likewise, as explained above, it is probable that the statistical insignificance came from errors in the way the three inhibitors were prepared. If conducted again, additional research should be made to find the most effective concentrations for each of the inhibitors tested in this experiment. Finally, when using the pipettes the amount of each reagent placed into the test tubes could have been slightly different if proper pipette technique was not used. Although different concentrations of each reagent could have affected the absorbance reading, since three trials were conducted, the slight possible human error from pipetting slightly different concentrations can be ruled insignificent. 
Overall, the purpose of this lab was to determine which inhibitor served as the best herbicide and thus was the most effective at decreasing the rate of photosynthesis. While our results were insignificent, the synthetic herbicide still stood out as the most effective of the three tested. That being said, if the long-term goal is to find the most effective herbicide, a follow up experiment could use the same procedure but instead test different store bought synthetic herbicides against each other to determine what herbicide is the most effective. In this lab we used the same plant species the entire time, Spinacia oleracea. To see if the three inhibitors tested would have different effects on different plant species as observed in Bellinder’s study, one should run the same experiment but with different plant species. If this lab was to be conducted again, more trials for each sample should be tested to increase the legitimacy of the results and decrease the effect of outliers. 
Applying this lab to the real world, whether you are a farmer or a just simple homeowner who wants his lawn to look good, herbicides are something that many people are familiar with and use quite often. However, very few people understand what exactly is happening when herbicide is sprayed on unwanted plants. This lab helps to explain how herbicides work and how they disrupt the process of photosynthesis. While this experiment is small scale, industrial farmers spray herbicide on acres and acres of land which results in a lot of runoff. This runoff has devastating impacts on the environment as it can lead to the death of untargeted plants that come in contact with the herbicide. A greater impact that runoff sparks is algae growth in nearby bodies of water. This growth, coined eutrophication, depletes the saturated oxygen found in the water, resulting in the death of any aquatic organisms previously living there and thus throwing the whole ecosystem off balance. This lab can be extended to comment on current environmental issues seen today in the form of pollution, that gives rise to acid rain, and overusing herbicides that can lead to the destruction of nearby habitats and ecosystems.
