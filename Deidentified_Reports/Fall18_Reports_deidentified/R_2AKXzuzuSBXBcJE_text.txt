Title: The Effect of Color on the Aggressiveness of Male Betta Fish

Abstract:
Male betta fish (Betta splendins) show agnostic behaviors toward other male betta fish when they are exposed to them. These behaviors can range from erecting their pectoral fins to creating a red mane by extending their branchiostegal membranes. These fish commonly come in two colors: red and blue. We tested three individuals of each color against a fake betta fish to determine which color was more aggressive, after hypothesizing that blue fish would be more aggressive after doing the first experiment with male betta fish. After running our experiment and analyzing the data with an unpaired t_test, our hypothesis was rejected as the red fish on average showed higher levels of aggression. These results are not conclusive however and really depend on the temperament of the individual fish. 

Introduction:
Betta splendins, commonly known as the Siamese fighting fish or simply the betta fish, is a small tropical species of fish native to Thailand, formerly known as Siam. They are popular in the aquarium trade for their brightly colored bodies and flowing fins. In the wild, these characteristics are less pronounced as the bright colorations are only shown during their fights, also known as agnostic behaviors. The aquarium trade has bred these fish to permanently stay in their fight colors as opposed to the dull green or brown colorations they show in the wild. This domestication began in the 1800s in Thailand where people would bet on the fish fights for money and over the years, they have been selectively bred for specific colorations and scale morphologies, similar to how many reptiles have specific morphs for people to purchase. [Pauly: 2010] Male betta fish are known to fight each other in the presence of another male, or even after seeing their own reflection. They exhibit two separate kinds of agnostic behavior: broadside displays and facing displays. Broadside displays function more as warnings than anything with the fish erecting their caudal fins and swimming sideways so as to appear bigger than the other fish. Facing displays are more aggressive and include behaviors such as erect pectoral fish, tail beating, and spreading their opercula (gill coverings) which eventually leads to a protruding branchiostegal membrane, giving the betta fish their famed red “manes.” The fish come primarily in two colors: red and blue. Going off of our results from the previous week’s experiment, blue fish are expected to be more aggressive than the red fish in the presence of another male.

Materials and Method:
We used a fake red betta fish to simulate the presence of another male in the partitioned fish tank. One side had a red male and the other side had a blue male. Each fish was exposed to the fake fish for five minutes at a time, twice per fish. We ran this test on three red fish and three blue fish for a total of six tests. This was to eliminate the possibility of an exceptional response from one fish and to get a general trend of aggression among colors. As the fish interacted with the fake fish, we carefully observed for agnostic behavior and if/when we saw one of these behaviors, it was recorded in our lab notebooks. We then used an unpaired t_test to analyze the data we collected. 

Results:
Two fish (R2 and B3) showed no aggressive behaviors whatsoever, while two fish (R1 and B1) showed only mildly aggressive behaviors. B2 had one instance of a level two behavior (spreading of the operculum) but his median level of aggression was only at level one. R3 had extremely aggressive behaviors, but he was an outlier, which is why we ran the experiment on many individuals so as to prevent the skewing of results. (t_stat= 1.077, d.f.=23, p=0.2923)

Discussion:
Our hypothesis using information we collected from the previous week proved to be incorrect as fish R3 exhibited the highest levels of aggression as opposed to one of the blue fish. The fish were largely unresponsive to the fake fish utilized in the experiment. Had the fish been exposed to live betta fish as opposed to a decoy, the results could have been different.  There is no evidence that red fish are more aggressive than blue fish and vice versa, as the aggression levels and behaviors depend mostly on the temperament of each individual fish rather than the morphology of the fish. Today’s betta fish are not commonly bred for aggression as they were in the past; they are now bred for their specific morphs with aggression slowly being weaned out. [Brannan: 2015]
