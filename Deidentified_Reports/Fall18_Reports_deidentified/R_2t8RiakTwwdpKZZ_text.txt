Title: Influence of Lighting on Intraspecific behavior patterns of Betta splendens

Abstract:
Intraspecific behavior is an important topic in ethology. With changing environmental stimuli, individual may exhibit different behaviors. This experiment evaluates the influence of light condition on the intrasoecific behavior of Betta splendens. It was hypothesized that the male Betta splendens kept in the dark environment for 24 hours would exhibit more aggressive behavior compare to the controlled group. The one-tailed two-sample t-test was adapted to test the significant difference between the two group. The data showed no significant difference in the mean of the time duration of aggressive behavior and number of aggressive behavior. It is possible that the lighting level has no effect on aggressiveness of Betta splendens. 

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the influence of light condition on the intraspecific behavior of Betta splendens. The individuals in the same population facing similar selection pressure from the environment[Townsend:2008]. However, according to the Population principle ”Population, when unchecked, increases at a geometrical ratio, Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio.” The resource from the environment is limited, therefore, individual facing competition from members of same species[Elwell:2013]. The competition behaviors vary among different species, yet that behavior is part of social interactions, particularly those associated with aggression, sexual activities. In intraspecific competition, individuals of the same species compete against each other for food, mates, and shelter. The organism will have different behaviors when they were facing different environmental stimulus. Betta splendens is chosen because their colorful displays are more recognizable than other species. Male Bettas may fight to claim territory or to protect their eggs or offspring from rival males. The Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include two main type of movements: broadside movements and facing movements. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. In increasing order of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing. Facing movements, in increasing aggressiveness, are pectoral fins erecting, the spread of opercula and protrude the branchiostegal membranes. This experiment aims to test the level of aggressiveness of Betta fish under normal light and darkness. It was hypothesized that the male Betta splendens kept in the dark environment for 24 hours would exhibit more aggressive behavior when separated from another Betta fish that the fish would exhibit if they had been in light conditions for 24 hours leading up to the experiment. 

Materials and Methods:
This experiment had chosen Betta splendens as the experimental subject. There were two groups in the experiment, one controlled group and one treated with no light condition for 24 hours. For each group, there were two replicates. In total eight fishes were tested. In control groups, four fish were kept in continues sunlight for 24h. In the experimental group, four fish have held in complete darkness for 24 hours. A transparent glass divider and an opaque plastic divider were placed in both tanks to separate two fish physically. The number of aggressive action and length of time of red mane were recorded in both groups. A two sample one-tailed t-test will be used to determine the significant difference between the two groups.



Results:
The average number of aggressive behavior displayed between Betta splendens in light was 17.3±18.7(Fig.1). The average number of aggressive behavior between Betta splendens in the dark was 11.5±13.3(Fig.2). The average length of time Red mane was displayed was 101.8±97.3s while in the dark is 68.3±84.3s. The mean of the number of aggressive behavior experimental group was not statistically significant to compare to the controlled group (t-stat =0.501, df= 6, P = 0.317). The mean of the time duration of aggressive behavior experimental group was also not statistically significant compared to the controlled group (t-stat =0.520, df= 6, P = 0.311).



Discussion:
The hypothesis that the Betta fish kept in the dark environment for 24 hours will exhibit more aggressive behavior was rejected. Based on the data, there are no relations between the dark condition and Betta’s aggressive behavior. The past experiment suggests that the Bettas kept in continues light environment will be more aggressive since Betta fish can’t rest in continues light condition. Therefore more likely become stressed and exhibit aggressive behavior.[Bronstein: 1983] There is substantial systematic and random error present in the experiment. First, the experimental group of Bettas only kept 4 hours in complete darkness instead of 24 hours. It is possible that a longer period is needed for Betta fish to change its behavior. Also, the number of aggressive behavior counted in the experiment does not distinguish the degree of aggressiveness. In the experiment, controlled group bettas displayed pelvic fin flickering more frequent than tail flash. In the further study, different aggressive behaviors should be quantified in different values. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the data group is incredibly high. More trails are needed to make the data more precise. Lastly, we didn’t distinguish the size and the color of Betta fish we used in the experiment. Past study has shown that betta fish tend to exhibit more aggressive behavior toward others with similar size and color[Bronstein: 1983]. In the further study, the size and color of Betta fish should maintain the same.
