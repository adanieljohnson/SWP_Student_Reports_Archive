Title: The effect of Precor on the growth rate of Manduca sexta 

Abstract:
This study was designed to examine the impact of Precor, an insect growth regulator (IGR) and hormone analog, on the tobacco hornworm, otherwise known as Manduca sexta.  By exposing or failing to expose the subjects to the IGR and recording the insects’ weight over a period of several days, a measurement applicable to growth rate was obtained. Our alternate hypothesis was that exposure to Precor would cause the growth rate of Manduca sexta to increase. However, the results did not support this hypothesis. Yet, it was made clear that exposure to Precor after the minimum weight threshold for metamorphosis prevents the transformation, allowing the caterpillars to continue eating and growing for a prolonged period. 

Introduction:
This experiment involved hormonal regulation of the larval form of the tobacco hornworm, or Manduca sexta. This insect undergoes a holometabolous life cycle [Johnson:2018] in that it experiences four basic stages of life (egg, larva, pupa, and adult). However, the larval stage is divided further into five instars, and progresses from one to the next via molting [Johnson:2018]. After the fifth instar, there is a molt that results in metamorphosis (the transformation of the larva into an adult via the pupa stage). The mature insect that emerges from the pupa stage is drastically different in physiology. This type of life cycle is applicable to a vast variety of other insects (order Hymenoptera, order Diptera, and order Coleoptera) [Johnson:2018], making Manduca sexta an ideal experimental subject. These processes are controlled by endocrine function [Johnson:2018]. While several hormones are responsible for development in insects, this experiment manipulates juvenile hormone (abbreviated JH) or rather an analog to it. An important feature of this hormone is that, when the corpus allata begins to secrete less JH during the fifth instar, triggered by a weight threshold [Nijhout:1974], the larva experiences an event called the commitment pulse. This indicates that the insect possesses enough stored energy for healthy metamorphosis [Johnson:2018]. It was of interest to investigate how the insects would be affected by an excess of JH. It seemed possible that an insect, if continuously exposed to JH,  might continue to eat and gain weight instead of stagnating in preparation for metamorphosis after reaching the weight threshold. To investigate, the experimental group was exposed to an IGR (insect growth regulator) [Johnson:2018] called precor, which mimics the effects of JH. The control group was not provided with Precor. Thus, the independent variable was the addition or absence of Precor, and the dependent variable would be growth rate As such, the alternative hypothesis was that exposure to precor would cause the growth rate of the insects to increase.

Materials and Methods:
Eight Manduca sexta larvae were selected for the experiment; four for the control group, and four for the experimental group. Each individual was kept in a separate plastic compartment with its own food supply. These plastic containers where stored under identical incubation conditions. The control group received 10g of food per caterpillar, rolled into a sphere with 5 drops of water. The experimental group also received 10g of food per caterpillar, but, instead of water, 5 drops of Precor were added. This process was repeated every time one of the compartments was devoid of sustenance. In addition to adding food, feces were removed. Each day, measurements were taken of weight and length for each individual with an electric balance and a ruler. This continued for 11 days, omitting 3 days due to inability to collect data at that time. After the raw data was collected, an average of the change in weight and length for each individual on each day was taken. Then, the means for the control group and the experimental group were averaged, resulting in mean differences in weight and length for each day. A two sample t-test was then performed, using only the weight data. This was because the length data was considered to be inaccurate due to the caterpillars’ stretching and contracting movements during measurement. 

Results:
Organizing the means for each day’s change in weight for the control and experimental groups, it was found that, during days 1 through 4, the data was almost identical between the experimental and control groups. During days 5 and 6, the control group showed greater positive change in weight than the experimental group. However, from day seven onward, the experimental group showed greater positive change in weight, whereas the control group mostly lost weight. Day eight was particularly dramatic, the control and experimental groups displaying inverse tendencies where the control group lost 3.38g on average and the experimental group gained 2.875g on average. This followed the trend established on day seven, but was much more extreme. The P value for this data was 0.19, which was not a significant result. It is also noteworthy that, while the control group experienced pupation, the experimental group did not. 


Discussion:
The P value demands rejection of the alternative hypothesis. The provision of Precor did not significantly increase the growth rate of Manduca sexta. However, there was a portion of the data (day seven onwards) that, if studied in isolation, might concur with the alternate hypothesis. It is possible that the control group suddenly lost weight because they reached the weight threshold, experienced the commitment pulse, and began to pupate. The endergonic-reaction intensive process of metamorphosis consumed their resources, and they took no new resources in. Thus, they lost weight. The experimental group was not affected by reaching the weight threshold, because the dietary supplement of Precor made it so something similar to JH always existed in their system. They did not pupate, and continued eating and gaining weight. Though the rate of growth was not exactly measured, weight gain, day by day, allowed for the inference of growth rate. What was seen in this experiment demonstrates that an excess of JH or its analogs has no effect on growth rate, or at least weight gain, until late in the fifth instar when the larva reaches 5g [Nijhout:1974]. A final concern presents itself in that there were three days during which no data was recorded. If the data for those days had been recorded, the results may have differed.
