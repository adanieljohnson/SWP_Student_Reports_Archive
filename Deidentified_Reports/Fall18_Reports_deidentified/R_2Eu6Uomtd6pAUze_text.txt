Title: Effect of the Presence of a Fake Fish on Aggressive Behaviors in Betta splendens

Abstract:
The effect of the presence of a fake fish with Betta splendens, or Betta, was tested in order to see if there is a change in the aggressiveness of the fish’s behavior. If a male Betta fish is presented with a fake Betta fish and a real Betta fish, then it will produce more aggressive behaviors towards the real male Betta. To measure aggression, a ranking system was used where values of 1, 2, or 3 were assigned to behaviors from least aggressive to most aggressive. The points were totaled and a final number quantifying aggression was recorded. The independent variable was the type of Betta: real or fake. The dependent variable was the amount of times an aggressive behavior was displayed. The results of the experiment showed that real Betta fish elicit a greater aggressive response than fake Betta fish. The statistical test, however, was showed that there was no significant difference. The response of the fish is likely due to the process of habituation, and in future experiments the behaviors of females should be tested in order to see if males and females elicit similar aggressive tendencies. 

Introduction:
	B. splendens, or more commonly known as Bettas, were the main focus of this experiment. When presented with an opponent, whether it be a male or a female of the same species or a male of another species	, Bettas tend to show a number of aggressive behaviors. These behaviors can be intraspecific or interspecific behaviors. There are two types of intraspecific behaviors: broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements, from least aggressive to most aggressive, include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing [Johnson: 2018]. There are also three types of facing movements, and in increasing aggression they are: pelvic fin erection, opercula expansion, and creation of a red mane [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, the aggressiveness of Bettas in the presence of a fake and a real Betta fish was compared. Another study used a colorful marble as a stimulus and found that the Betta initially presented aggressive behaviors and decreased aggression with time [Johnson: 1973]. The purpose of this experiment is to see how Bettas react to fake and real Bettas, and how the level of their aggression changes in response to the presence of a real or fake fish. More specifically, how do the aggressive behaviors of Bettas change in the presence of a fake or real Betta in two separated scenarios? The independent variable is the use of a fake Betta or a real Betta. The dependent variable is the amount of aggression displayed. If the male Betta is presented with a fake Betta, then it will exhibit less aggressive behavior, opposed to being in the presence of another male Betta. 


Materials and Methods:
First, 4 real male and 1 fake male Betta fish were obtained. A male Betta fish was placed in a glass tank. A glass separator and an opaque separator was placed in the tank separating the tank into two sections. Another male Betta fish was placed in the second section of the tank. The opaque separator was removed and the glass separator is kept in place. The aggressiveness of the behavior is measured. In order to quantify aggression, the number of times aggressive behaviors are displayed is determined. Broadside and facing movements are ranked based on least aggressive to most aggressive. In this experiment, each behavior level of aggression received a ranking in order to develop quantifiable data. The least aggressive behavior received a value of 1, more aggressive was a value of 2, and the most aggressive behaviors a value of 3. Each time a behavior was exhibited, the fish received a number of points according to the values listed above, and the points were added together to get a final number for aggressiveness. The two male Bettas were observed for 5 minutes, the opaque separator was replaced, and a 5-minute rest period followed. The second fish was removed and the fake fish was added. The value of aggression was recorded and the interaction was observed for 5 minutes. Then, the opaque separator was placed and the fish was allowed to rest for 5 minutes. The first male Betta was removed and another male Betta was added. The same steps using the real fish and the fake fish was conducted. The same procedure was repeated 2 more times for a total of 4 trials using 4 different Betta fish. After the experiment was completed, a statistical analysis using a two-tailed paired t-test was conducted. 


Results:
In figure 1, it can be seen that male Bettas are less aggressive towards fake fish than they are to real male Betta fish. The fake fish group had an average display of aggressive behaviors of 6.5 ± 9.68 and the real fish group had an average of 57.25 ± 61.99. The results in figure 1 show that male Betta fish tend to display more aggressive behaviors towards real male Betta versus opposed to fake Betta fish. A two tailed paired t-test was conducted using the amount of times aggressive behaviors was displayed in the fake fish and real fish scenarios (t stat= 1.62, df= 6, P=0.157).

Discussion:
The results demonstrated that male Betta fish are more aggressive towards real fish instead of fake fish supporting the hypothesis. The statistical analysis, however, does not support the trends viewed in Figure 1. There was not a statistically significant difference in male Betta aggressiveness towards a fake male Betta fish or a real male Betta fish. Despite the results of the statistical test, the overall mean and standard deviation seen in Figure 1 shows that there is a relationship between the aggressive tendencies in male Betta fish when presented with a fake or real fish. Biologically, this occurs due to habituation. Habituation is when the Betta fish reduces its aggressive tendencies when exposed to a stimulus repeatedly [Meliska: 1976]. Another study conducted found that Betta fish presented with mirror images decreased the number of times it used aggressive behaviors [Meliska]. Similarly, the male Bettas used less aggressive behaviors less frequently when presented with the fake fish due to habituation and the lack of the fake fish also presenting aggression. The fake fish was unable to produce agnostic behaviors in response to the aggression of the male Betta resulting in the Betta to reduce and stop presenting aggression. In future studies, one can also study the responsiveness of female Bettas in the presence of the fake fish and see if both males and females have similar responses to fake and real Bettas.
