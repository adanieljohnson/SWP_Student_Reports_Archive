Title: No difference shown in aggression level in response to tank size in Betta Splendins

Abstract:
The physiological purpose of behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection are analyzed when investigating animal behavior. Intra- and interspecific agnostic behavior is one type of behavior of interest because of the usual communication which regulates social interactions that is showed in the behavior. The objective of this study was to discover the effect of tank size on aggressive behavior of fish. Betta Splendins were used as the model organism in the study. The aggressive level was indicated by the number of behaviors displayed and ranking of aggressiveness of each behavior. The hypothesis was that the subjects in big tank would have a lower aggression level than those in small tank. The study found that there was no statistically significent difference between the small tank and the big tank, suggesting that tank size tend not to change the aggression behavior in fish. I inferred that there might be some flaws in the timing method. Further study would be carried out amending the flaws in experiment design that might have caused the result to be not significent.

Introduction:
The physiological purpose of behaviors, and how behaviors have been shaped by evolution and selection are analyzed when investigating animal behavior. Intra- and interspecific agnostic behavior is one type of behavior of interest because of the usual communication which regulates social interactions that is showed in the behavior. Betta splendins are chosen to be the subject of the study because of their colorful display in the presence of other member of their own species. They have two types of intraspecific movements, broadside movements and facing movements [Simpson: 1968]. Broadside movements are displays performed when a fish turns its side toward an opponent. Typical behaviors include: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing (increasing order of aggressiveness). Facing movements, also in increasing order of aggressiveness, are pectoral fins erect, spread of opercula and protruding the branchiostegal membranes to create a red “mane” [Johnson: 2016]. The hypothesis is that when two male betta splendins are put in a small tank, they will exhibit more aggressive behavior than when they are put in a big tank. 

Materials and Method:
Two male Betta splendins were put in one small tank. The timer was started when the two fish saw each other. The different behaviors each fish shown were counted and categorized in the level of aggression in 60 seconds. Then the two fish were moved to a bigger tank. Their behaviors were also recorded for 60 seconds. One-tail paired-t test was used in the study. 

Results:
For convenience of carrying out statistical test, the behaviors were ranked from 1 to 3 in both broadside movements and facing movements. Then the level of aggression was calculated taking the average of the mean aggressive level of each type of movement. 
According to the data, the aggression level of large tank was 4.75 ± 2.5 and that of small tank was 6 ± 1.4 (Fig.1). The mean aggression level of the large tank was not statistically significently different than that of the small tank (t_stat=1.67, d.f.=3, P=0.19). 

Discussion:
Overall, there was no significent difference between the aggression level in the small tank and big tank. My hypothesis that the big tank would show a lower aggression level than the small tank was rejected. The space did not appear to influence the aggression level of the fish. I suggest that there might be several reasons contributing to this result. First, the timing method may cause inaccuracy to the result. Because the timer was started when the fish saw each other, it may offset the effect of lower aggression level. Since I assumed that the lower aggression level was caused by the lower chance of them running into each other. Second, I might need to record their behavior for a longer time period. In observation, the timer was stopped when the frequency of aggressive behavior started to decline. Perhaps the large tank would cause the behavior to diminish faster than the small tank and thus cause a lower level of aggression. Third, more subjects might be needed for the study since individual difference is relatively large in regards of animal behavior. Other related study has shown that correlation was founded between space allowance and agnostic behavior [Kondo: 1989]. For future study, the study time period could be elongated to observe behavior change.
