Title: The negative effect of changing temperatures on agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to determine if a changing environment affected agnostic behaviors in Betta splendins. The decision to display agnostic behaviors or to focus on survival, demonstrates a cost-benefit relationship, which requires an organism to choose if a self-benefit is worth the cost on their survival. These relationships are important to all animals, therefore, understanding of this behavior in Betta splendins can be important to predicting behaviors of other species. If a change in environmental conditions affects agnostic behaviors, then bettas in room temperature water will have more red mane appearances than those in cold water. In this experiment, two groups of the same six fish were placed in room temperature water and red mane appearances were counted for each fish. Then, the experiment was repeated in cold water. Red appearances were significently higher for the bettas in room temperature than those in a cold temperature (p=0.023). The bettas in cold water need to allocate more resources to survival, therefore, less agnostic behaviors will be observed. In the future, different species of fish, from a similar environment to Betta splendins, should be assessed using the same procedure to determine the applicability of these results to other species.  

Introduction:
Animals respond to certain conditions and stimuli based on evolution’s effects on the way they view the world. In this experiment, the decision of a Betta splendins (betta) to choose the benefit of territory defense in comparison to the cost to survival will be observed. Territory defense is important to reproductive success; a female will rarely, if ever, mate with a male that does not have a territory. Therefore, male bettas will immediately enter an aggressive stance of erect fins in order to intimidate invaders [Hollis: 1984]. In this experiment, the behavior of a male Betta splendins (betta) toward another betta will be observed in a room temperature environment and in a cold-water environment. A change in environmental conditions requires an organism to allocate more resources to adapting to the environment rather than on other aspects of survival, like agnostic behaviors toward competitors. These agnostic behaviors are vital to a betta’s survival and nest protection. However, in a summary of data collected on male bettas, following agnostic behaviors, the betta was found to have increased metabolic rates, energy depletion, and physical damage to their body [Castro: 2006]. Without these behaviors, a betta would not be able to defend its territory and reproduce, therefore, if a betta is unable to adjust to changing temperatures and perform these agnostic behaviors, its chances at survival become limited. If a change in environmental conditions affects agnostic behaviors, then bettas in standard condition, like room temperature water, will have more red mane appearances than those adapting to new conditions.

Materials and Method:
In this experiment, the behaviors of six different male bettas were observed. In room temperature water (11ºC), the behavior of two isolated male bettas was observed for five minutes. Then, the opaque barrier was removed, with the transparent barrier still present, and red mane appearances in each fish were counted for five minutes. A red mane is characterized by the protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane located underneath the opercula. The opaque barrier was then replaced, and fish were rested for five minutes. This procedure was then repeated twice more with different bettas so all six fish were viewed once.  Then, the entire procedure was repeated for cold water (8ºC), with the bettas exposed to a different male betta than they were in the room temperature water. Red mane appearances were compared between room temperature and cold water using a two-sample t_test. A p_value of 0.05 was used to determine if the groups were statistically different from each other.

Results:
The betta fish in room temperature water has a greater number of red mane appearances (10.33±7.81) than betta fish in cold water (0±0). There was a significent difference between the groups, as seen in Figure 1 (t=3.24, d.f.=5, p=0.023). 

Discussion:
Male bettas in room temperature water displayed agnostic behaviors that were not visible in cold temperature water, therefore, the hypothesis is supported. Bettas are ectotherms, therefore, when placed in a new environment, their metabolism slows down because of temperature change. Inactive ectotherms show a low rate of oxygen consumption because the organism is using it for maintenance metabolism alone. This maintenance metabolism is relatively insensitive to temperature changes that fall within a typical environmental range, therefore, when survival is the highest priority, this inactive state is initiated [Hawkins: 1995]. 
In a similar study, the likelihood of a betta performing an aggressive behavior in varying temperatures was observed. It was determined that bettas in 28ºC water were more likely to perform an aggressive behavior than those in 22ºC water [Hess: 1952]. Although the present study only looked at the number of red mane appearance, this study supports the claim that any type of aggressive behavior in bettas would be decreased in decreasing temperatures.
Another cost benefit analysis of territory defense or prolonged survival was studied in Passeridae (sparrow). When a predator approaches a nest, the female sparrow attempts to protect her nest through direct attacks and alarm calls. However, despite being of a lesser size than her typical predators, in the study, mortality due to nest protection was rare [Montgomerie: 1988]. This study supports the idea that the cost to survival is often worth the benefit of nest protection. This study also suggests that the results of the present study can be applied to other species.
In this experiment, only two temperatures were tested. In order to determine the threshold of cold water that bettas can tolerate before behavior is affected, a range of water temperatures should be chosen for future studies. Also, a different species of fish, from a similar environment to bettas, should be assessed using the same procedure to determine the applicability of these results to other species.
