Title: Temporarily increased weight and length in Manduca sexta caterpillars when fed Azaguard.

Abstract:
In this study, we added Azaguard (an insect growth regulator) to Manduca sexta food to increase their mass and length. By adding Azaguard to the food, we hypothesized that it would increase mass and length of the experimental group because Azaguard is a Juvenile Hormone (JH) inhibitor. JH is the hormone that triggers the commitment pulse when it lowers its concentration levels in the caterpillar. From weighing and measuring the length of the caterpillars daily, we found that although the Azaguard increased the weight and length for the first few days. However, after day three of the study, the weight and length of the caterpillars went down and eventually all of the experimental caterpillars died. It is unknown if these results were caused by the Azaguard because our results were not significant for length or for weight (DF: 18, t-value: 0.769443, p-value: 0.225805) (DF: 18, t-value: 0.451263, p-value: 0.328595). This study is relevant because if we find the amount right amount Azaguard to add to caterpillar food, it would allow people to keep the Manduca sexta out of its adult stage. This would keep it from becoming a pest and keep it from procreating.

Introduction:
Manduca sexta is an insect that starts its life as larva and then pupates into a moth. It goes through the life stages of embryo, larvae, pupa, and adult. This life cycle lasts typically between 39 and 48 days. Juvenile Hormone (JH) is a hormone in insects that regulates the type of molt during development. Insect growth regulators (IGR) are in insecticides that affect development. Azaguard is an IGR that when added to Manduca sexta affects the development and pupation of Manduca sexta larvae. Azaguard affects development by affecting the size of the larvae before pupation. Manduca sexta typically have a larval mass of 11.3 +/- 1.5 grams [Grunert, L;2015]. We hypothesize that if we add Azaguard, the caterpillars will grow in length and weight.

Materials and Methods:
We collected eight Manduca sexta caterpillars in their larval state, Azragard, standard caterpillar food, and water. We then separated the caterpillars into two groups of four. One group is the experimental and the other is the control.  Before we started, we measured the length (cm) and weight (g) of each caterpillar. We gave 10g of food to each caterpillar. For the experimental group we added ten drops of Azaguard to the standard caterpillar food and for the control we added ten drops of distilled water to keep the food consistency similar. After that, we put the caterpillars in separate containers and kept them in an incubator at 25 degrees Celcius. Once the experiment was set up, we checked in on the caterpillars daily to feed, measure weight and length, and record important observations. After we measured them everyday for two weeks, we ran two one tailed two-sample t-tests (one for weight and one for length) to see if the results were significant.

Results:
Overall, the mass and length of the caterpillars increased for the first three days and then declined for both the control and experimental groups. This can be seen in figure 1 and 2. However, the control group began pupating on day 7 and eventually all four caterpillars pupated. An important note is that by day twelve all four of the experimental caterpillars were dead. The results of our two two sample T-tests were (DF: 18, t-value: 0.769443, p-value: 0.225805)   With a p-value that is greater than 0.05, we concluded that the results are not significant. (DF: 18, t-value: 0.451263, p-value: 0.328595) Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, the results are not significant.

Discussion:
In this experiment, we hypothesized that if we gave Azaguard to the Manduca sexta caterpillars, they would increase in both length and weight. Our hypothesis was mostly refuted. While the length and weight of the Manduca sexta increased in the first few days of the experiment, they declined for the next week and a half. This could be due to a variety of causes. First, it appeared that after the first couple days, the experimental caterpillars stopped eating and moving in general, which would cause a decline in growth.  This could indicate that this amount of Azaguard is toxic to the Manduca sexta. Additional evidence of Azaguard being toxic in higher concentrations is that all of the caterpillars in the experimental group died before the study was over. Second, Manduca sexta caterpillars usually stop growing and lose weight as they approach the commitment pulse [Grunert, L;2015]. In addition, there is also large room for error in this experiment because we could not feed and measure the caterpillars for three days due to hurricane Florence. This error may account for why our p-value was so high. Our p-value indicated that there was not a significant difference in both our weight and length experiments. This did not support our hypothesis because we cannot reject our null hypothesis. The next logical step for this study would be to redo the experiment and give the caterpillars less Azaguard to see if they would continue to eat and grow. Finding this prime Azaguard amount would benefit both everyday people and those in the agricultural field because it would keep Manduca sexta from maturing and becoming a pest as an adult. On the other hand, it could also be seen as beneficial to people if the caterpillars death was caused by Azaguard and not by error. This would allow for the elimination of Manduca sexta.
