Title: The Effect of Herbivore Consumption on Pisum sativun Energy Allocation

Abstract:
In biology, it is important to understand how plants' interactions with their environments and other organisms affect their ability to grow and develop. Root:shoot serves as an indicator of either strong or weak growth and development. In this experiment we observe how consumption of plants by other organisms affects energy allocation in the form resultant of root; shoot ratio. We find that even while there is an observed difference in average root; shoot ratio, that this difference is not statistically significent, not supporting our hypothesis that if herbivores are present in an environment and consumes Pisum sativa leaves that this would increase resultant the root; shoot ratio. The results we gathered suggest that there is no noticeable difference, and that plants may have gene expressions that prepare them for consumption.


Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the influence of herbivore consumption on the resource allocation and growth of Pisum sativun. There are many different factors that affect resource allocation in plants such as P. sativun. Some factors are believed to include temperature, annual rainfall, and invasive species presence, and environment [Maron & Crone 2006]. The resources affected by these external factors are what contribute to plant growth and development, and can be divided into resources acquired above and below ground. Above ground resources are equivalent to plant shoots and serve as the source of carbon compounds (ex: sugars derived from photosynthesis). Below ground resources are equivalent to the roots, and collect things such as water and essential nutrients. With all of these factors in mind, it must be also noted that plants such as P. sativun allocate their energy to above and below ground resources in varying amounts with consideration to their environment [Casper & Jackson: 1997]. In this experiment, researchers are looking specifically at the factor of herbivore consumption on P. sativun energy allocation. It is shown through other research studies that herbivores can have strong effects on plant growth, survival, and reproduction [Maron & Crone: 2006]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that if herbivores are present in the environment or ecosystem of Pisum sativun and consume their leaves, then this will inhibit photosynthesis and increase root:shoot ratio.

Materials and Method:
144 Pisum sativa more commonly known as field peas were collected. To prepare the peas for experimentation they were then all soaked in water in a glass dish over a 24 hour period. To set up the plant plots, 6 pots were collected and filled with soil. The soil in each pot was then water before the seeds were placed in. In each pot there were 12 holes created to hold two seeds in each hole. After the pots were prepared the seeds were placed in (2 seeds in each hole), and then covered. After which each pot had 50Ml of miracle grow solution poured onto the soil bed. Next the plants were watered with about 50Ml of water each day. Then, when Pisum sativun begins to show growth of "full-sized" leaves, all of the leaves were cut in half to simulate herbivore consumption. After 2 weeks the root:shoot ratio of average weight and length of the plants were collected and recorded. A two-sample T-test was used for statistical analysis of this data.

Results:
The Mean mass of the experimental group of P. sativun was (1.101 +/- .18) , and the mean length of the controll group of M. sexta was (1.20 +/-.237) (Table 1). The Mean length of the controll group of P. sativun  was 0.761 with a standard deviation of .737, and the mean length of the experimental group of P. sativun was 0.620 with a standard deviation of .530 (Table 1). All data mentioned is rounded to the nearest 1000th place. We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean length of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the weight experimental group (t_stat = 2.344, d.f.= 22, P = 0.035). However, the mean weight of the controll group was not statistically significent compared to the mean length of the experimental group (t_stat = 1.126, d.f.= 22, P = .272). 


Discussion:
The statistical results calculated shows the average root: shoot ratio (R:S) information being statistically insignificent. From figure one, researchers can see that there was a higher R:S ratio for the controll group than the experimental group. This can be seen through the collected data results which shows the average R:S ratio for weight being (1.20 +/-.237) for controll and (1.10 +/- .18) for  experimental. With the difference between these results having little difference between the two, the statistical insignificance is supported. These results do not support our hypothesis, which was that if P. sativun had herbivores in their environment that root:shoot ratio would increase. Thus, suggesting that herbivore consumption does not significently alter or change plant resource allocation. These results also suggest that future investigative research should focus on the adaptive feature of plants such as P. sativun to herbivore consumption.
