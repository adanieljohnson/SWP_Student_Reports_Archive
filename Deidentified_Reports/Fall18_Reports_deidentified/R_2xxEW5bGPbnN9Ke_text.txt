Title: 20E Inhibitor Affects the Development of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars Resulting in Death

Abstract:
Ecysdone (20E) hormone and JH hormone are two hormones that work together to controll and initiate the transition process of a larvae to an adult insect. They are responsible for an insect’s proper development and life cycle. In this lab, we will focus on how the Manduca Sexta undergoes this process, specifically in terms of the 20E hormone. We inhibited 20E in a group of Manduca Sexta caterpillars, which resulted in a loss of weight, length, and ultimately inability to pupate. Eight caterpillars were split into two groups of four. The experimental group received a diet of the standard Great Lakes Manduca diet (GLM)  mixed with ten drops of Azaguard, a 20E inhibitor. The controll group received the GLM alone. Data for the weight and lengths of all eight caterpillars were measured and recorded over the course of two weeks. Our results support our hypothesis, as the experimental group had lower lengths and weights in comparison to the controll group. By the end of the two weeks, those in the controll group underwent pupation, while those in the experimental where unable to do so, and died.

Introduction:
The lifecycle of a Manduca Sexta insect goes through several phases. In order for the larvae to develop and properly progress in their lifecycle, two hormones, Ecysdone (20E) hormone and JH hormone, work together to controll and initiate the transition process of a larvae. They propel the molting process of each phase. The caterpillars begin their life cycles with higher levels of the JH hormone, and experience a sudden rise in 20E along a drop in the JH levels, triggering a commitment pulse which begins their pupation process.  In this lab, we will focus on how the Manduca Sexta undergoes this process, specifically when the 20E hormone is inhibited. My hypothesis is that the Manduca Sexta caterpillars that receive a diet including the 20E inhibitor will undergo loss of weight, length, and ultimately the inability to pupate, resulting in death. 

Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were selected. Their initial weights and lengths were recorded. Then, two plastic containers including dividers were set up with four caterpillars placed in each, separate from each other. The containers had perforated sides, to allow for oxygen to reach the developing caterpillars. The containers also were carefully labeled "Experimental" and "Control", as well as marked with the numbers of the caterpillars to ensure proper data collection in the future. The diet was created as follows: The controll group received 10 g of the Great Lakes Manduca Sexta diet mixed in with 10 drops of distilled water to maintain the same consistency as the experimental diet. The experimental group received 10 g of the Great Lakes Manduca Sexta diet mixed in with 10 drops of Azaguard. The containers are then stored in a temperature controllled Celsius incubation chamber in a twelve hour dark/twelve hour light cycle. Their weights and lengths are monitored and recorded once a day over the course of two weeks. Their food is monitored as well, and if it is consumed or dry, the food should be replaced with 10 g of the respective diets again. Once all data is collected, it will be analyzed and compared to support the hypothesis, and a T test is conducted.

Results:
T test for the Weights of Control Group and Experimental Group: 
Degrees of freedom= 94
T value= 1.67 
Two tailed p value= 0.099 

T test for the Lengths of the Control Group and Experimental Group: 

Degrees of freedom=94 
T value=0.2
Two tailed p value=0.82 


Discussion:
Upon reviewing the data and observations we collected, the results supported our hypothesis. For the first four days, the caterpillars seemed to be following the same consistent patterns of growth. However, they both experienced a sudden decline in weight and length. This could be explained by their food not having been replaced frequently enough. As the days continued, those in the controll group maintained their lesser weight and length, while the others continued to lose weight. The weight loss of the controll group is explained biologically as before a caterpillar begins pupation, it loses weight, becomes smaller, and becomes a bit more active. All of these conditions occurred. Studies show that once Manduca Sexta larvae reach their adult stages, they no longer continue to grow, and remain at the size they reached during their development (Grunert: 2015). Due to this, it makes sense that those in the controll group stopped displaying substantial changes in growth in the days leading to the commencement of their pupation. By the end of the two weeks, those in the controll group had pupated, meanwhile two of the experimental caterpillars were deceased. The other two had a very faint color, were not mobile, and were experiencing symptoms of the beginning of death.
