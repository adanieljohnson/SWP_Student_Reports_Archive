Title: Effects of Acidic and Alkaline Environments on the Rate of Photosynthetic Reduction of Chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
In this lab, we investigated the effects of acidic, basic, and neutral pH levels on the rate of photosynthetic reduction in Spinacia oleracea. More specifically, we wanted to see how different pH levels would affect the ability of isolated chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea to initiate photosynthesis. The chloroplasts in plant cells are the major organelle for used for carrying out the light-dependent reactions that start photosynthesis. Therefore, if the chloroplast were to be damaged in some instance, the rate of photosynthetic reduction would decrease tremendously. In order to see how pH could affect the functionality of the chloroplasts, we first isolated the chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea leaves. Then, we set up three different pH environments: a pH 5 environment, a neutral environment, and a pH of 10 environment, to place the chloroplast samples in. We then measured the absorbance of the chloroplasts in 10 minute intervals, totaling to 30 minutes, after they were placed in each environment. We hypothesized that the rate of photosynthetic reduction of the chloroplasts would decrease if the isolated chloroplasts were placed in the acidic and basic environments. After collecting data and running an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test, we were able to determine that the chloropla

Introduction:
During photosynthesis, plants undergo a series of oxidation-reduction, or “redox”, reactions in order to generate electrochemical gradients for the production of ATP, or adenosine triphosphate. These redox reactions begin with the reduction of carbon dioxide occurring at the chloroplast, the major photosynthetic organelle of plants [Bassham : 1971]. This pathway for photosynthetic reduction begins when solar energy hits the chloroplast and excites the electrons into higher, energy-rich compounds. The conversion of this light energy into chemical energy like NADH and ATP, is what allows for plants to undergo photosynthetic redox reactions. In regards to the phosphorylation of photosynthetic material, it begins with light-dependent reactions decomposing water, then the electrons received from water travel down the electron transport chain, where they undergo go a series of coupled redox reactions to generate energy and ultimately reform back together to produce water [Jagendorf & Avron : 1958]. For this experiment, we will be investigating the effects of pH levels on the chloroplast of Spinacia oleracea, otherwise known as spinach. Through the isolation of the chloroplasts, we will test the rate of photosynthetic reduction after placing the chloroplasts in an acidic, neutral, and alkaline environment. Since spinach is typically found to grow best in a neutral environment, we hypothesized that the chloroplasts placed in the acidic and basic environment would reveal a low absorbance, constituting a lower rate of photosynthetic reduction.     

Materials and Methods:
To begin this experiment, a mortar and pestle, a 150 mL beaker, and a three 50 mL centrifuge tubes were placed in crushed ice to cool. Then, four medium-sized spinach leaves were selected and had their central veins removed. After this, they were rinsed and blotted dry to remove excess moisture. Using the cold mortar and pestle, 10 mL of cold grinding buffer and the spinach leaves were grinded up until a thick paste was formed. Then, 10 mL of grinding buffer was added to the thick paste. The thick paste was then strained through three layers of cheesecloth into a chilled 150 mL beaker. Using a micropipette, 200 L of the filtered solution was transferred from the beaker, into a micro tube labeled “Sample of A” and it was stored on ice. Then, the remaining liquid was transferred into a 50 mL centrifuge marked “A” and spun at 1200 rpm for 3 minutes at 4C. A blank liquid was placed across the experimental centrifuge to ensure that it was balanced. After the centrifuging, the supernatant was poured out of the tube, leaving debris at the bottom, and placed in a new centrifuge tube marked “B”. Then, 200 L were removed from the tube marked “B” and placed in a micro tube labeled “Sample of B” and stored on ice. After this, the centrifuge marked “B” was spun at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4C. Then, the supernatant was poured into another centrifuge tube marked “C”. Then, 15 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet in the “B” tube and stirred gently to re-suspend the pellet. After this, the re-suspended pellet was divided into 3 conical tubes, each receiving 5 mL of the re-suspended pellet. Then, 5 mL of the corresponding pH level buffers were added to each specific tube. One received a pH 10 buffer, another was the pH 5 buffer, and the last one was the pH 7 or grinding buffer. Once these tubes received each buffer, they were then spun again at 2800 rpm for 10 mins at 4C. After centrifuging, 200 L were removed from tube “C” and placed in a tube labeled “Sample of C”, then stored on ice. After this, 13 large test tubes were labeled and placed on a tube rack, and 3 replicates of each reaction mix were prepared. The first test tube received 8 mL of water and 2 mL of Hills reaction buffer. This served as the blank for the experiment. Then, the next three test tubes received 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of Hills reaction buffer. Test tubes 5-7 received 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of Hills reaction buffer. Then, test tubes 8-10 received 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of Hills reaction buffer, and 1 mL of pH buffer 5. And lastly, test tubes 11-13 received 5 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, 2 mL of Hills reaction buffer, and 1 mL of pH buffer 10. Then, to start the assay, 100 L of the enriched chloroplasts in tube “C” were added to the blank tube, and tubes 4-12. The tubes were then mixed immediately and transferred to spectrophotometer cuvettes. Then, the spectrophotometer was immediately blanked, and the absorbance of each sample was measured at time zero. The chloroplast samples were then placed under light for 10 minutes, then their absorbance was measured again. This was repeated two more times, totaling for 30 minutes and 4 absorbance readings. The percent changes for each environment were then tested for statistical significance using an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test.

Results:
Our data revealed that the average percent change in absorbance for the neutral environment with no chloroplast produced the smallest percent change (2.0331.121)(See Figure 1.) The chloroplasts placed in the neutral environment (34.3752.742) revealed a higher average percent change than the basic environment (28.20337.207)(See Figure 1.). The chloroplasts in the acidic environment produced the greatest percent change in absorbance (60.4003102.366)(See Figure 1.). The ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test revealed that the difference in percent changes was not significant (p-value=0.711, df=3). 

Discussion:
At the conclusion of our experiment, we found that there was no significant difference in photosynthetic reduction, when the chloroplasts were placed in the neutral, acidic, and basic environments. Therefore, our hypothesis that photosynthetic reduction would decrease in both the acidic and basic environment was not supported by our results. Although our statistical test did not reveal a significant difference between percent change, our averaged percent changes did reveal slight differences amongst each other. The chloroplasts in the acidic environment revealed the greatest averaged percent change, whereas the chloroplasts in the basic environment exhibited the least percent change. A similar study investigated the homeostatic nature of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts in response to changes in pH. The results from this study ultimately revealed that the chloroplasts has a proton exchanger that accounts for changes in environment, and maintains homeostasis [Song et al.: 2004]. The results from this study can help to explain why we did not see a significant difference in pH environments in terms of percent change. Chloroplasts are also ancestors of organelles known as plastids, which are responsible for carrying out photosynthesis. Plastids helped to maintain homeostasis with the plant cells through cell signaling and metabolism [Jarvis & López-Juez : 2013]. Therefore, the results from our experiment could reveal the evolutionary nature of the chloroplasts themselves. When the chloroplasts were placed in the various pH environments, they did not experience a significant change; ultimately revealing that the chloroplasts knew how to account for a change in pH and prevent it from affecting the rate of photosynthetic reduction. Environmental stresses, especially drought, are very harmful to the growth and rate of photosynthetic reduction of the plant [Reddy et al.: 2004]; therefore, a future study could investigate the extremes to which Spinacia oleracea chloroplasts can maintain photosynthetic reduction, when placed in a water-limited environment. This study would further research surrounding the homeostatic nature of chloroplasts and ultimately reveal their evolutionary capabilities.
