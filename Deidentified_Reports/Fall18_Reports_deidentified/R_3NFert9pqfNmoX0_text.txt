Title: The Effects of Dyed Water on the Agonistic Behavior Response Times of Betta splendens

Abstract:
The purpose of this study was to compare the response time to agonistic behaviors of Betta splendens fishes in clear water (high intensity light) and colored water (low instensity light). Three sets of two male fishes were tested, both from each set tested in clear and colored water. The fish were tested in a medium-sized tank. In order to keep the fish from becoming tired, a time limit for testing was five minutes. It was hypothesized that as the light intensity of the water increased, the response time to agonistic behavior would also increase as the fish were more capable of seeing each other. The data received from this experiment was determined to be inconclusive due to the large differences between groups. 

Introduction:
In this experiment, the effects of dyed water on the behavior response of male Betta splendens fishes will be tested. The behavior that will be measured specifically is aggression. These fish are also known as Siamese fighting fish that originated in southeast Asia. Male Betta splendens become excited by flaring their gills and fins when in the presence of another male fish of its species. They are also known to express this aggressive behavior even more when in the presence of a female Betta splenden fish. [Doutrelant: 2001] This is known as intraspecific behavior, reactions to others of its same species. Intraspecific behaviors of bettas include broadside movement and facing movements. The typical expressions of aggressiveness are pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Aggressive behaviors in facing movements include erection of pectoral fins, spreading the opercula, and protruding of the branchiostegal membranes under the opercula. Measurements of how long it took for the aggressive behaviors of the fishes to be expressed were made in both conditions of water, clear and dyed. 
	In a similar study, salmon aggression was tested at varying levels of light intensity. It was concluded that as the light intensity increased, the overall aggression of the salmon also increased. [Valdimarsson: 2000] This same conclusion was made in another study with the use of Nile tilapia. It was also found that as the light intensity increased, so did the aggression. [Carvalho: 2013] Based on these conclusions, it can be hypothesized that as light intensity increases, the response time to agonistic behavior in the Betta splenden fishes should increase as well.


Materials and Methods:
The behavior of three sets of two male Betta splendens fishes were tested in clear and colored water. The fish were tested in small aquarium tanks with each fish separated by a clear plastic divider. To make the water darker three drops each of red, green, and blue food coloring was added to the tank. The amount of time it took for each fish to exhibit aggressive behaviors in the clear water and the colored water was recorded using a stopwatch on a phone. This process was repeated for the next two sets of fish as well. A two-tailed T-test was used to calculate the p-value for all three sets of fish in each environment. The calculated standard deviation was used to tell how the measurements were spread out from the average within each group.

Results:
It was observed that with the colored water, the reaction and displayed aggression times were all within a similar range of time. However, this was not seen when the fish were placed in the clear water as the aggression times varied, typically higher. This can be seen above in Figure I. The calculated P-value for this experiment was 0.38, the T-value was -1.01, and the degrees of freedom was 2. What was rather peculiar was that the third group of fish in the clear water did not exhibit any sort of agonistic behavior towards the other in the allotted amount of time of five minutes. On average, the fish displayed agonistic behavior quicker in the colored water as compared to the clear water. 

Discussion:
In the end, the calculated P-value for the response time to agonistic behavior was significant enough to support our original hypothesis. The calculated standard deviations portrayed this. As originally hypothesized, it was suggested that as light intensity increases, the response time to agonistic behavior should also increase. [Valdimarsson: 2000] However, this was not the case in this experiment as it was observed that as the light intensity increased, the Betta splendens fishes had a slower response time as compared to when they were in the low-light intensity environment. This could have been a result of testing the fish in the colored water first, not letting them rest and adapt in the clear water for a sufficient amount of time. The fishes are known to express more of an aggressive behavior when in the presence of a female Betta splenden fish. [Doutrelant: 2001] With this considered, better results could have been received as a result of adding a separated female into the tank as well, as this could stimulate more of a reaction from the male fishes.
