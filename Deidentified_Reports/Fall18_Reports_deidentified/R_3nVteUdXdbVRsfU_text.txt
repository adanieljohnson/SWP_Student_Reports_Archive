Title: Impact of lanthanum trichloride on phototactic and chemotactic migration in the physarum 

Abstract:
The aim of this experiment was to determine if the introduction of the calcium channel blocker lanthanum trichloride would influence cell signaling in the physarum and render it immobile. Calcium release is vital for the polymerization of actin, which allows for cell migration in response to external stimuli. It was hypothesized that blocking these channels would inhibit actin contraction such that the physarum would not be able to migrate in response to light or food cues. For this experiment, the physarum was placed in a condition where it had to either migrate for food (chemotaxis) or respond to light (phototaxis). A control group that was not treated with the inhibitor was used for both conditions. The physarum in the chemotaxis and phototaxis conditions were were placed in an incubator and a lightbox, respectively, for 24 hours. Following this, distance migrated was measured using a ruler, and two two-sample t-tests were run to determine significance. The results did not support the hypothesis; the introduction of lanthanum trichloride had no significant effect on phototactic or chemotactic movement in the physarum. This may have resulted due over-dilution of the chemical or as a result of the physarum having additional calcium stores depending on its physiological state.

Introduction:
The physarum polycephalum, or slime mold, is a model organism for studying signal transduction pathways due to the fact that it is able to respond via several different motor behaviors to the external environment. In addition, the organism uses similar signaling pathways to the human cell and is easier to cultivate and study. Despite the fact that the organism lacks a nervous system, it is able to react to light or chemical stimuli, either moving towards or away from it depending on several factors. Phototaxis, the process of migrating in response to light, is negative where the slime mold moves away from light or positive where it migrates towards the light. It is important to note, however, that under normal conditions negative phototaxis is more likely to take place due to the fact that the organism’s optimal condition involves a dark and humid environment. Furthermore, the physarum is able to respond to both noxious and attractive chemicals through a process known as chemotaxis [Johnson: 2018]. For attractants such as different carbohydrate-based foods, the organism will respond by migrating towards it as a means of obtaining nutrition for the continuation of growth [Carlile: 1970].
	The slime mold is able to migrate through the extension of it’s leading edge through actin microfilaments. It is thought that the contraction and relaxation of actin projections allows the organism to advance through an environment in a way which maximizes survival [Anderson: 1993]. The contraction of these projections involves the activation of IP3-mediated pathways in which the effector enzyme phospholipase C produces second messengers, including diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to receptors located on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and allows for the release of previously stored Ca2+ ions [Johnson: 2018]. These ions are then able to bind to multiple proteins, many of which are actin-binding. Research has shown that this interaction controls the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to extracellular stimuli. While the underlying mechanism is not fully understood, it is theorized that actin-binding proteins, following the release of intracellular calcium, allow for conformational changes in key components of the actin microfilaments promoting actin polymerization [Hall: 1994]. 
	This experiment aims to disrupt the IP3 signaling pathway within the physarum through the introduction of lanthanum trichloride. This chemical targets IP3 activated intracellular calcium channels and inhibits them. Prior research has shown that calcium channel blockers such as lanthanum trichloride inhibit negative phototactic movement, rendering the physarum immotile due to the fact that actin can no longer be extended to allow for movement [Hader: 1985]. Another study on neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, found that the introduction of lanthanum ions reduced chemotactic responses [Boucek: 1976]. It is important to note that despite this being a different type of cell, the signaling cascade is similar when compared to the physarum. As a result, it is hypothesized that the introduction of lanthanum trichloride will render the physarum immobile such that it will not be able to respond to light or chemical stimuli in the environment.   

Materials and Methods:
In order to study the effect of lanthanum trichloride on phototaxis and chemotaxis in the physarum, six water-agar plates and six potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates were used. The water-agar plates were labeled one through six, with one through three having the additional label of control condition and four through six having the label of treatment condition. This labeling procedure was repeated for the PDA plates. Following this, the plates labeled as the control condition for both types of agar plates were soaked in five mL of lanthanum trichloride for ten minutes. It is important to note that the chemical was first diluted by adding 20 mL of distilled water to 3 mL of the chemical. After the ten minute soaking period was complete, a 1x1 cm cube of agar was removed from the center of all twelve plates using a sterilized spatula and forceps. These empty gaps were then replaced with 1x1 cm cubes of agar that were cut from a plate containing physarum. For the water-agar plates, five oat flakes were sprinkled on the upper quadrant of all plates and, after taping the lid shut, the plates were placed in a dark bag and moved to an incubator at 24℃. The PDA plates, on the other hand, had their lids taped and then were wrapped in tin foil with a hole in the upper quadrant large enough to allow light to penetrate.  Following this, they were placed in a light box. All twelve plates remained in either the incubator or the light box for 24 hours. Once 24 hours had passed they were removed and the distance the physarum had migrated was measured in millimeters with a ruler. The direction of migration (towards or away from the food or light) was also noted. Finally, two two-sample t-tests were conducted in which the control and treatment groups were compared within the chemotaxis condition and within the phototaxis condition. The alpha value of 0.05 was used to determine significance [Johnson: 2018].  



Results:
The results of this experiment showed that the average distance migrated for the physarum in the chemotaxis treatment group was 18.3 ∓ 16.03 mm while the average distance migrated in the control group was 22.3 ∓ 7.64 mm (figure 1). In addition, the average distance migrated for the physarum in the phototaxis treatment group was 2.33 ∓ 2.52 mm when compared to the control group which migrated 4.67 ∓ 0.57 mm (figure 2). In the chemotaxis condition, a two-sample t-test determined that the difference between the treatment and control group was not statistically significant (df=4, t-stat=0.49, p=0.65). A two-sample t-test showed that the results in the phototaxis condition were also statistically insignificant (df=4, t-stat=1.37, p=0.24). The statistical insignificance in both experimental conditions can further be seen in figures 1 and 2 which display the overlap between the standard deviation error bars. 


Discussion:
The results of this experiment did not support the hypothesis in that the introduction of lanthanum trichloride had no effect on phototactic or chemotactic movement in the physarum. As a result, it can be concluded that the inhibitor did not significantly influence the organism’s ability to polymerize actin and hence respond to external stimuli. Initially, this seems counterintuitive given that previous research has found that inhibitors of IP3-induced Ca2+ release such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate and lanthanum ions suppress contractile activity in the physarum. However, this research has also outlined that the cessation of actin functioning following the introduction of calcium channel blockers may occur either as an immediate stop or a gradual dampening depending on the concentration of the inhibitor [Matveeva: 2010]. As such, it is possible that by diluting the chemical the effects it had on the motility of actin occurred gradually, and because of this, no significant trends were observed after 24 hours. This premise is supported when looking at Figure 1 and Figure 2, which despite insignificance and large error bars demonstrate that the inhibitor did seem to dampen migration to a small extent. In order to test this theory, the experiment should be repeated with varying concentrations of lanthanum trichloride. It is also important to note that the standard deviation in this experiment was relatively high in the treatment groups, which demonstrates that the data was widely spread around the mean and hence likely not reliable. In order to increase reliability, a larger sample size should be acquired and each sample in the treatment groups should be exposed to the inhibitor for longer than 24 hours. This, in turn, could increase the significance of the results and therefore be used to make more accurate conclusions about the data.  
 Another possible explanation for the continued migration of the physarum after the introduction of lanthanum trichloride can be seen when exploring research on physarum calcium stores. The slime mold, when starving and placed in a food-scarce environment, has an accumulation of Ca2+ within vacuoles and to some extent the endoplasm. It was hypothesized that this occurs because a starved physarum shows decreases in mass, which leads to a rise of calcium ions in the cytoplasm [Kuroda: 1980]. The premise that calcium concentration changes depending on the physiological state of the slime mold can help explain why in the actin continued to contract and allow for movement in the chemotaxis condition. In a sense, proteins sensitive to calcium were still able to function properly and lead to actin polymerization without the IP3-induced Ca2+ release since Ca2+ was readily available within the cytoplasm and within vacuoles. The storage of Ca2+, when put in a food-scarce environment, is likely a survival mechanism which guarantees that the physarum is able to continue to migrate until it finds a source of nutrition. Another study also found that calcium accumulation occurred not only after starving but also after illumination, in which the organism was placed under a bright light [Achenbach: 1981]. Based on this, the results in the phototaxis and chemotaxis conditions in this experiment can be explained through calcium accumulations in which calcium was still readily available despite the inhibition of IP3 activated intracellular calcium channels. Further tests should be conducted in order to determine the validity of this explanation.
Understanding the mechanisms which underlie cellular signaling is vital due to the fact that they help explain what motivates and allows an organism to behave in response to a stimulus. These complex communication pathways govern cellular activity and allow cells to coordinate their responses in order to maximize survival. The signaling pathways studied here are applicable to human cells as was shown in the previously discussed study on white blood cells which utilize chemotaxis to regulate immune responses [Boucek: 1976]. From this example, the value of studying cell signaling pathways in model organisms such as the physarum can be seen.
