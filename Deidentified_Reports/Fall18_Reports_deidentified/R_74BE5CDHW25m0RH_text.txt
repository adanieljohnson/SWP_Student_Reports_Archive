Title: The Effect of Herbivore Consumption on Pisum sativun Energy Allocation

Abstract:
In biology, it is important to understand how plants' interactions with their environments and other organisms affect their ability to grow and develop. Root; shoot serves as an indicator of either strong or weak growth and development. In this experiment we observe how consumption of plants by other organisms affects energy allocation in the form resultant of root; shoot ratio. We find that even while there is an observed difference in average root; shoot ratio, that this difference is not statistically significent, not supporting our hypothesis that if herbivores are present in an environment and consumes Pisum sativa leaves that this would increase resultant the root; shoot ratio. The results we gathered suggest that there is no noticeable difference, and that plants may have gene expressions that prepare them for consumption.

Introduction:
The purpose of this experiment is to assess the influence of hormones on the growth and development of Manduca sexta. Hormones are chemicals in insects and mammals that promote specific gene expression. This alteration in expression can be shown through things such as the process of puberty, in which growth can either be inhibited or accelerated. One example of an organism that may experience these effects due to hormones is the Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta, also known as the Carolina Sphinx, is a large green caterpillar commonly found in the Eastern United States and Central & South America (Kanost, M. et. al : 2016). The life cycle of the M. sexta can be longer or shorter depending on the quality or diet available, average daily temperature, and hormone regulation. The M. sexta goes through a Holometabolous life cycle, which means using hormone – based and neuron based signaling to controll growth, development, and behaviors. Hormones such as Juvenile Hormones (JH) and Ecdysterone (20E) are known to have an effect on the life cycle and commitment pulses of insects. In this study, we are looking specifically at the effect of AzaGuard on these hormones. AzaGuard is an insect growth regulator known to have an effect on insect development by interfering with the metabolism of ecdysone (Echegaray, E. R., & Cloyd, R. A. : 2012). And because Ecdysterone is a steroid hormone which helps to regulate the timing of molts during insect development, it is believed that if AzaGuard is added to the diet of Manduca sexta, then they will reach adult moth stage faster than those larvae who do not have the growth regulator added to their diet.


Materials and Method:
Cultivation of Manduca sexta. Before the instar larva were placed into their respective observation chambers, two holes were punctured (with a metal bar and hole puncher tool) into each of the chamber compartments. There were four compartments in one chamber. Next, 8 Manduca caterpillars all in varying larva instar stages were then collected and placed into one of two observation chambers. Each caterpillar was placed in its own compartment in both the controll and experimental chambers. One observation chamber was designated to hold the controll group, consisting of 4 caterpillars, and the other observation chamber was designated as the experimental group, holding the other 4 non-controll instar larvae. In the experimental group, each caterpillar was fed 10g of previously prepared food with 5 drops of AzaGuard hormone (hand-mixed) mixed in. In the controll group, each was fed 10g of previously prepared food with 5 drops of water (hand-mixed) mixed in to match the consistency of food presented to the experimental group. Manduca were kept in an incubator at a set 32 degrees Celsius when not being measured. Manduca Measurement. The resulting length and weight of the caterpillars was observed and recorded over a period of two weeks. Each instar larva was weighed using a standard lab balance and measured in length (from head to end in cm) using a standard 12-inch ruler. During experimentation, if caterpillars were thought to need more food, they were given another 10g of food mixed in with either water or hormone depending on which group they belonged to. The statistical analyses. A two-tailed two-sample T-test was used to determine differences in the average weight and length of Manduca sexta developing over time with exposure to AzaGuard (which interferes with the effects of Ecdysterone) compared to caterpillars not exposed to any additional hormone.


Results:
The Mean mass of the controll group of M. sexta was 5.786 with a standard deviation of 0.970, and the mean mass of the experimental (AzaGuard) group of M. sexta was 4.454 with a standard deviation of .780 (Table 1). The Mean length of the controll group of M. sexta was 6.013 with a standard deviation of .737, and the mean length of the experimental group of M. sexta was 6.208 with a standard deviation of .530 (Table 1). All data mentioned is rounded to the nearest 1000th place. We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The mean weight of the controll group was statistically significently different than that of the weight experimental group (t_stat = 3.210, d.f.= 16, P = 0.005). However, the mean length of the controll group was not statistically significent compared to the mean length of the experimental group (t_stat = 0.642, d.f.= 16, P = .530). Those in the experimental groups rapidly decreased in weight while those in the controll group maintained a fairly steady decline and leveled-off weight (Figure 1). There were no noticeable differences in length for the experimental and controll groups (Figure 2).


Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if AzaGuard is added to the diet of Manduca sext, then they will reach adult moth stage faster than those larvae who do not have the growth regulator added to their diet, was not supported. When observing the caterpillars during the final stages of the experiment there was a noticeable visible difference in the development between the two groups. Those in the controll group had either begun the pupa stage or reached the final instar larva phase. Meanwhile, those in the experimental group had either died or not developed past their initially observed instar phase. Overall, those in the experimental groups rapidly decreased in weight while those in the controll group maintained a fairly steady decline and leveled-off weight. This would make sense, as in past investigations it has been found that these insects in this experimental group (consuming AzaGuard) tend to eat less as the experiment goes on (Echegaray, E. R., & Cloyd, R. A. : 2012). This could suggest that the AzaGuard interferes with ecdysterone negatively and essentially inhibits development of the insect, shown through symptoms of things like weight loss and lost appetite. The next logical step for this experiment would be to see to what concentration or levels of AzaGuard it would be considered a "safe" amount to expose insects or specifically the Manduca sexta to. And another extension of this experiment would be to compare this data to data that looks at the amount of the insecticide or insecticides like AzaGuard in the field, and how that affects populations of M. sexta.
