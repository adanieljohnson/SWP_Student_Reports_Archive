Title: Resource and Energy Allocation in Vigna radiata

Abstract:
Vigna radiata is a plant which allocated resources to roots or shoots depending on the environment in which it is placed. This experiment looks at this particular plant’s ability to allocate resources when placed in normal sun exposure as well as in a shaded area. We placed plants in both normal sunlight exposure and under a shade, then measured root:shoot ratios after the plants grew. In this experiment we found that those plants exposed to less light had a larger root:shoot ratio, as we expected them to. 

Introduction:
A vital aspect of a plant’s life is uptake and allocation of resources. When certain abiotic factors in a plant’s environment are changed, the plant also changes its physical form in order to gain appropriate amounts of nutrients and continue to live. This is called Resource Allocation; Resource Allocation happens on the phenotypic level when a plant must make a change in order to be more fit for the environment in which it lives. Such patterns of allocation “play a pivotal role in life history evolution and functional plant ecology” [Bazzaz: 1997]. Plants being exposed to various amounts of light will cause variation in the ways they allocate resources in order to be most fit for their environments. Vigna radiata was an appropriate model organism for this experiment because it is a relatively quickly adapting plant, which allowed easy viewing of its ability to allocate resources. Since the shoot is the part of the plant responsible for photosynthetic processes and a larger root:shoot ratio in a darker area will allow the plant to survive as well as those in areas with greater amounts of sunlight, those plants exposed to less light will allocate more energy for shoot length than those exposed to more light. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment we first soaked 50-60 seeds from the model organism in water prior to planting them. We then placed the seeds in pre-soaked vermiculite with 50mg of “Miracle Gro” in each individual seed hole (six bins of about 6-10 seeds in each bin). We placed three bins on one tray of plants in a greenhouse with natural light exposure, and three under a shade cover with much less light exposure. We watered the plants daily for two weeks, and after they grew appropriately we began to measure the root:shoot ratios. We gathered ten plants from the natural light group and ten from the shaded group. We first weighed the plants respectively, then separated the roots from the shoot (precision and consistency is crucial here for the integrity of the experiment). We then weighed the roots and the shoots of each respective group and calculated weight ratios, after this we measured the length of root and shoot and calculated that ratio as well. Last, measure the maximum root and shoot lengths of each group and record the mean values for both of the plant groups. 


Results:
The results of this experiment showed a significant difference for weight (t= 13.378, df=4, p= 0.000181) as well as height (t= 3.983, df=4, p=0.016353) with an alpha level of 0.05. The graphs show the differences in both ratios of root:shoot weight and length in the light and dark areas. To calculate significance we used a two-sample t-test and an alpha level of 0.05. 

Discussion:
	Our results supported our hypothesis, as the p-values for both the height and weight ratios were less than the alpha level of 0.05. These data show that the plants which were exposed to less light allocate more energy and resources to shoot length and growth in order to maximize photosynthetic ability. From this experiment we can conclude that plants in generally darker areas will tend to allocate more resources towards shoot growth, which could mean less energy for appropriate root growth. This adaptation can be beneficial for plants needing to increase surface area for photosynthesis, but it could also be dangerous in that less resources will be allocated toward root growth which is also a key factor in a plant’s survival and vitality. Knowledge regarding the adaptability of plants can allow researchers to understand exactly how a specific plant will survive in certain, varying environments. This can be essential and helpful in agricultural farming, as we are now able to show which environment a plant will thrive in and have the optimized crop yield. Since plants change so rapidly phenotypically, technologies such as underground x-rays are being created in order to gain a better understanding of plant structure and architecture. Such techniques will “provide a better understanding of how overall plant architecture is regulated...and how best precision agriculture can be exploited to optimize plant growth and seed/fruit development” [Bennett, 2012]. By understanding resource allocation, we can grow crops in highly conducive areas and soils in order to generate the highest possible crop yield.  In the future this experiment could be done with varying levels of light exposure (rather than just two) in order to better understand the levels of allocation.
