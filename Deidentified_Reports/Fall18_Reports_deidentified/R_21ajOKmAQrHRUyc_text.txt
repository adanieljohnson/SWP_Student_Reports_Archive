Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Oilseed Radish Root:Shoot Ratios

Abstract:
In this experiment the effect of light on oilseed radishes, or raphanus sativus, root:shoot ratios were tested with the hypothesis that the radishes grown in sunlight would have smaller root:shoot ratios than those of radishes grown in shade. Our hypothesis was based on the experiment before that that confirmed the root:shoot ratio would be higher than in plants that received less nutrients. 40 radish seeds were planted, with half exposed to sunlight and the other half constantly under shade. At the end of two weeks we gathered the data and used a one-tailed, two-sample t-test. Our hypothesis was rejected, as the mean root:shoot ratio of weight and length for the radishes grown in the light was larger than of radishes grown in the shade.



Introduction:
Plants need various resources to create a product, whether it be a leaf or a root system [Bloom, Arnold J, et al: 1985]. The plants take the resources and allocate them to either the roots, the leaves, and the roots [Weiner, Jacob: 2004]. In a previous lab we discovered that a lack of nutrients causes a larger root:shoot ratio in Buckwheat due to less resource allocation going to roots unless there was a significant amount of necessary resources in the soil. Root:shoot ratios are used to measure the biomasses of vegetation and can be used for various plants, and so we used it on the radishes [Mokany, Karel, et al.: 2005]. Radishes grow during the day, which is when they acquire resources from the sunlight necessary for photosynthesis. If a radish is placed in sunlight, then the root:shoot ratio will be smaller than a radish placed in constant shade.


Materials and Methods:
Forty radish seeds, which were soaked for 24 hours in advance of the lab, were acquired for the experiment, along with eight dishes with which to plant our radish seeds in. 5 radish seeds were planted in each plate and covered with soil, before being water. Then the 8 plates were placed together on a tray and transported to a greenhouse. 4 dishes, or 20 radish seeds, were placed under a shade to prevent them from gaining sunlight, whilst the other 4 dishes were placed where the seeds would be able to receive sunlight. Each day, for two weeks, the radishes were watered 100 mL of water at 6 p.m. At the end of two weeks, 3 plants from each replicate, or dish, were harvested and their shoots and roots were separated at the beginning of the root. Then each individual root and shoot was then weighed, in grams, and measured, in centimeters. This was to determine the root:shoot ratio of the radishes. Two one-tailed two-sample t-tests were used for the length and weight.

Results:
The mean root:shoot ratio of the length of the radishes in the sunlight was 2.09 and the standard deviation was 0.84. The mean root:shoot ratio of the length of the radishes in the shade was 1.65 and the standard deviation was 0.81. The mean root:shoot ratio of length of the radishes was not significant (t-stat=1.33, df=22, p=.010).
        	The mean root:shoot ratio of the weight of the radishes in the sunlight was 0.29 and the standard deviation was 0.14. The mean of the root:shoot ratio of the weight of the radishes in the shade was 0.18 with a standard deviation of 0.12. The mean root shoot ratio of the weight of the radishes was significant (t-test=1.93, df=22, p=.03).
        	More radishes overall grew in the sunlight than they did in the shade. The standard deviation of weight was higher than for length.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis that radishes growing in sunlight would have a lower mean root:shoot  ratio was rejected. The mean root:shoot ratios for length and weight for radishes grown in the sunlight was larger than those of radishes grown in the shade. A significant difference was in the weight but not the length, so sunlight did not affect the length, but rather the weight of radish root:shoot ratio. A possible explanation the seed of a radish is grown underneath the soil, and the radishes allocate more resources to the roots regardless of nutrient availability. It is a part of the deep root growth system [Jacobs, Alayna]. Also, the radishes were only planted for two weeks and likely were not able to reach maturity. To improve our experiment, we could place radishes in constant shade and constant sunlight, as in the greenhouse the radishes able to retrieve sunlight did not do so at every hour of the day. Also, our experiment could be more focused on the weight of radishes than the weight and length, as, the length was found to be insignificant, and I have learned that radishes that receive too much shade will allocate their resources to the leaves rather than their roots [Old Farmer's Almanac]. The greenhouse may have been too hot for the radishes to efficiently grow, as radishes grow best in cooler temperatures [Old Farmer's Almanac]. A final improvement would be to allow the radishes to grow for a longer period, as radishes are supposed to be planted four to six weeks before being harvested [Old Farmer's Almanac]. In conclusion, the radishes growing in sunlight have larger root:shoot ratios for length and width than radishes grown in the shade.
