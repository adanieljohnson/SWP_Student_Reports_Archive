Title: Increased levels of K+ have no visible effect on contractile force response in frog leg muscle

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to observe the effects of increased levels of potassium in a frog leg muscle on the contractile force response received after electrical stimulation. This was done by testing and observing the contractile force responses of three different frog legs before and after a concentrated K+ solution was injected into the muscle. Since potassium has the ability to depolarize the cell membrane, it was predicted that an increase in the levels of potassium in the muscle would change the observed contractile force response. However, the results gathered by the statistical analysis of the data proved unable to determine a direct or stable correlation between the injection of the potassium and the contractile force response. 

Introduction:
It is a known fact that at a resting state, muscle cells maintain low levels of sodium and high levels of potassium. When potassium is in excess or increased in levels inside the cell, it becomes hyperpolarized because of potassiumâ€™s ability to depolarize the cell membrane. [Adrian: 1956] Hyperpolarization of a cell inhibits action potentials by increasing the stimulus required to move the membrane potential to the action potential threshold. Hyperpolarization changes the cell membrane potential to be more negative. During this phase, a neuron is unable to generate action potentials. The purpose of this lab is to iolate and determind a correlation (whether positive or negative) between increased levels of potassium in the gastrocnemus of a frog leg. Activity of the muscle can be monitored at the macroscopic level using a myogram. We record the myogram by attaching a muscle to a force transducer, and recording the amount of force generated over a given time. A typical myogram has three phases: latent period, contraction phase, and relaxation phase. For the purposes of this experiment we will look specifically at the contraction phase. It is predicted that an increase in the levels of K+ in muscle cells will change the contraction force observed on the myogram.

Materials and Method:
For this experiment you will need gloves, three frog legs, a computer with the appropriately downloaded LabScribe software, a syringe, and a K+ concentrated solution. We started the process by degloving the first frog leg and separating the gastrocnemus muscle. We then connected the muscle to the electrodes. Then, we applied stimuli of 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 in increasing intervals and recorded the force of contraction response for each stimulus received. Then injected 0.1 Ml of a 20mM K+ solution into the muscle and waited approximately 5-10 minutes. We proceeded to repeat application and recording of stimulus and contraction force response and repeated the entire process with two other frog legs and recorded data for comparisons. 
We then used a two-sample paired t_test to analyze our data. We used the data from the average amplification at which we saw a contraction force response which in this case was 0.5V. The difference was subtracted before and after the addition of the K+ solution to the muscle. That difference was used to calculate the values and the graph.


Results:
The average contraction force response before the addition of the K+ solution amplified at 0.5V was 0.084V. The average difference after the addition of the K+ solution amplified at 0.5V was 0.154V. With the average difference in response between the addition of the K+ solution being 0.07V [Figure 1]. The data produced from the running of the two-sample paired t_test proved our data to be insignificent (t-value= 0.4168, d.f.= 2, p_value= 0.7173). 

Discussion:
In the comparison of the data recorded from the experiment, we are unable to determine a relationship between an increase of potassium in the muscle and a change in the contraction force As our p_value was much greater than the statistically significent value of 0.05. We were also unable to view any general trends in the data correlating to the addition of the K+ solution. This proves our hypothesis that an increase in potassium will change the contraction force, false. It is possible that we were unable to determine anything significent from this experiment due to the fact that the muscles and thresholds vary from frog to frog and so having such different numbers threw the statistical test.
