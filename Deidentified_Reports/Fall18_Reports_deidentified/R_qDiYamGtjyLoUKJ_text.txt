Title: Effect of Low and High pH on the Photosynthetic Rate of Chloroplast in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica

Abstract:
pH is an environment condition that can impact the process of photosynthesis in plants. Drastic changes in environmental pH (acidic or basic) can cause inhibition of proteins that are important in many processes, including the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. When these changes occur, photosynthetic rates of plants can be affected. In this experiment, the effect of both acidic and basic pH on photosynthetic rates in chloroplasts from Brassica oleracea var. sabellica was tested. We predicted the photosynthetic rate of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica would decrease when placed in acidic or basic conditions and compared to the optimal pH condition for photosynthesis (7). Using the DCIP electron acceptor (Hill’s reaction in the light dependent reaction of photosynthesis) as a color indicator, absorbance of the samples can be measured in a spectrophotometer to determine changes in the rate of photosynthesis between the different pH solutions. From the data collected, the chloroplasts in the different pH conditions showed no significent difference in photosynthetic rate. This showed that when put in these pH conditions, photosynthetic rate of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, was not shown to be affected when using the DCIP electron acceptor method used in the experiment.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a cellular metabolic process used by plants to capture light energy and store the energy for use. This energy is stored in the form of covalent bonds, oxidation-reduction potential, and electrical gradients across the lipid bilayers, which will later be broken down through processes of glycolysis and respiration in order for plants to use the energy [Johnson: 2018].  The process of photosynthesis follows the basic format of this equation: 6 CO₂ (carbon dioxide) + 12 H₂O (water) ⇋ C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) + 6 H₂O (water) + 6 O₂ (molecular oxygen). The main point to understand is that light energy is being transformed into chemical energy (glucose). Within the process of photosynthesis, there are two stages, light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light dependent reactions involve two stages: photosystem I and photosystem II. Within this part of photosynthesis, light photons are absorbed and used to excite electrons. By exciting electrons, the cleavage of water is triggered, which also causes a photon gradient to generate ATP. This ATP will be used to create the glucose molecules produced later in the light-independent reactions. Using the electron transfer in the photosystems, we can measure the rate of photosynthesis in the light dependent reactions.
To measure these electron transfer reactions in the chloroplasts (rate of photosynthesis) ATP production, NADP+ reduction, or reduction of plastiquinone could be used, but these are difficult to measure. An easier reaction of electron acceptors can be used (Hill’s reaction) instead of NADP+ acceptor reaction. Specifically, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol is used as the alternate acceptor. Normally, this electron transfer follows the Hill’s reaction (2H₂O + 2A ⇋ 2AH₂ + O₂), going from the oxidized to reduced form of the acceptor. When DCIP goes through this reaction, the color of the molecule goes from dark blue to colorless (at 600 nm) due to the reduction of DCIP to DCIPH₂. This allows for electron transfer to be easily measured through absorbance, specifically if a higher absorbance is measured, then less electron transfer is occurring (less photosynthesis) [Johnson: 2018].
pH is an environmental condition that plants can come in contact with and be affected by. Normally plants maximally go through photosynthesis at a pH around 7-8 due to acidic and basic conditions inhibiting photosynthesis [Heber: 1976]. The Hill’s reaction in the photosystem II, is the electron transfer reaction, but it involves the evolution of oxygen as a product from water, making it an acid-base reaction. When a high or low pH is introduced to the system, the Hill’s reaction is inhibited, due to the acid or base affecting and interfering the electron transfer needed for photosynthesis (the acid would donate protons and the base would accept protons) [Ikehara: 1970]. Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, or more commonly known as kale, is a plant that has a high photosynthetic rate in best conditions, similar to spinach (light, normal water, etc.) [Erwin: 2017]. Considering the use of kale as a source of chloroplasts, and the measurement of photosynthetic rate through the reduction of DCIP, the effects of pH environmental change will be tested on the photosynthetic rate change of kale. With this in mind, we believe that if Brassica oleracea var. sabellica is placed into either acidic or basic environments, then the photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts will decrease compared to a neutral pH due to inhibition of the Hill’s reaction in Photosystem II. 

Materials and Method:
In conducting this experiment, first chloroplasts had to be abstracted from the kale leaves. After grinding 3 kale leaves, without the main veins, in a cold mortar and pestle with 20 Ml grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8) and straining the paste made, the liquid was transferred to a centrifuge tube and spun at 200x G (1200 rpm) for 3 minutes at 4°C. After the mixture spun, the liquid portion was put in to a new tube and spun at 1,000x G (2800 rpm) for 10 minutes at 4°C. This time with the centrifuge was finished, the liquid was removed, and 15 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet left at the bottom of the second tube. This liquid was then mixed and separated into three tubes, each of which was given 5 Ml of a different pH buffer solution (4, 10, and distilled water). Each of these tubes were put into the centrifuged and spun again at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. After finishing the last centrifuge, the liquid was poured out of each and the pellet were resuspended in 3 Ml of grinding buffer and mixed.
	After preparing the chloroplasts, the 12 test tubes were labeled: Blank, 1-3 (pH 4), 4-6 (pH 7), 7-9 (pH 10), 10 (negative controll for pH 4), and 11 (negative controll for pH 10). Equal variance was used in the sample size; each of the testing categories (pH 4, 7, and 10) had three replicates. 2 Ml of DCIP (130 mM) was added to all test groups except the blank, 6 Ml of distilled water was added to all test groups (except the blank which had 8 Ml), and 2 Ml of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 8.5) was added to all test groups. Chloroplasts were added to the test groups according the pH, the acidic test group received pH 4 chloroplasts, controll test group and blank received pH 7 chloroplasts, the basic test group received pH 10 chloroplast, and negative controlls received no chloroplasts. Each of these replicates and controlls were then measured for absorbance in a spectrophotometer (600 nm) to get an initial reading. After the initial reading, all the samples were place under a grow light and re-read three times after 30-minute increments. After the results were recorded, a graph showing the average difference in absorbance from initial to 30 minutes was created to compare photosynthetic rate difference between pH 4 and pH 7, and pH 10 and pH 7. Two two-sample one-tailed t_test with an alpha/significance level of 0.05 were completed to find significent difference between the pH 7 and pH 4, and pH 7 and pH 10.

Results:
After measuring the absorbances of the different pH/chloroplast solutions after 30 minutes of exposure to light, similar changes in values of absorbance were found between the pH 4 and pH 7 solution and the pH 10 and pH 7 solution. The average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 7 solution after 30 minutes was -0.004666666667±0.00503322 [Figure 1]. The average change in absorbance found in chloroplasts in the pH 4 solution after 30 minutes was -0.01466666667±0.0140119 [Figure 1]. Lastly, the average change in absorbance of the chloroplasts in the pH 10 solution after 30 minutes was -0.001333333333±0.00057735 [Figure 1]. Once a two-sample one tailed t_test was completed, the average difference in absorbance in chloroplasts placed in pH 4 was compared to the same value in chloroplasts placed in pH 7 (t_stat=1.16335, d.f.=4, P-value=0.154677). When a two-sample one tailed t_test was completed for the difference in absorbance of the chloroplasts placed in pH 10 and pH 7, values for a comparison of significance were found (t_stat= 1.139606, d.f.=4, P-value= 0.15903).

Discussion:
Looking at the results of the average absorbance differences between both the acidic (4) and basic (10) solutions and the neutral/optimal pH (7), we can conclude that our results do not support our hypothesis that the photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts will decrease when put into acidic and basic conditions compared to a neutral pH. When two-sample one-tailed t_tests were completed, no statistical significance was shown when comparing pH 4 to pH 7 (P-value= 0.154677) and comparing pH 10 to pH 7 (P-value= 0.15903). Ultimately, it can be said that in this experiment there was no photosynthetic rate difference between the acid and basic conditions and the optimal condition (Figure 1). 
	Compared to the results in this experiment, other studies show the opposite result. In a study on the effects of pH and oxygen on photosynthetic reactions of chloroplasts in spinach, pH change into acidic or basic conditions was found to show drops in photosynthetic rates [Heber: 1976]. This experiment looked at the production of oxygen which occurs in Photosystem II of the light-dependent reactions, connected to the Hill’s reaction used in out experiment. Another experiment that showed opposite results to ours was an experiment done on pH alteration of photosystem II (where Hill’s Reaction occurs), when washing chloroplasts in a tris buffer. The experimenters found that when placed in pH lower than 7 and higher than 8, oxygen evolution formed through the Hill’s reaction decreased in rate, indicating inhibition to this reaction [Ikehara: 1970]. Both of these previously done studies on the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis show contradiction to the results we obtained, indicating that the experiment needs to be conducted again possibly due to errors.
	Two possible errors could have occurred when conducting this experiment. One reason our results did not match with previous studies could be due to the pH affecting the DCIP reaction. DCIP is a chemical that acts as an alternate electron acceptor in this experiment. This is due to DCIP going through a reduction to DCIPH₂ turning the solution colorless, while the normal DCIP turns the solution blue [Dean: 2006]. When mixed with different pH values, DCIP can go through color change due acidic pH donating H+ (to DCIP) and basic pH can accept H+ (from DCIPH₂) [Obata: 1982]. This could automatically affect the color change in the sample if contaminated with these pHs. When conducting the experiment, I noticed an initial color change when mixing the chloroplasts centrifuged with different pHs with the DCIP solutions, going first from a light blue to a darker blue before initial absorbance was read. Compared to the negative controlls, which had no chloroplasts in them and stayed a light blue color, we can determine that the pH caused a color change with DCIP. To fully understand if this is the result of DCIP, a follow-up experiment could be run looking at a different electron excerptor, running the experiment with more acidic or basic conditions or even running the centrifuge one more time to make sure the pH is really mixed into the chloroplasts to risk less contamination. 
	Another possible reason for our results could be due to the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica chloroplasts used. In a study about the quality and shelf-life of kale in relation to storage, it was found that chlorophyll content, a pigment in chloroplasts that is used to absorb light in photosynthesis, in kale decreased the longer it was stored before use [Albornoz:2016]. This could cause less photosynthesis to occur in the time frame that we measured in (30 minutes), due to less light being absorbed to the chloroplasts. Since we do not know how fresh the source of kale was and how it was stored, a possible reason to seeing no change in the photosynthesis rates in any of the test groups, could be due to the chloroplast source. A way to minimize the effect and to controll this aspect of the experiment, would be to repeat the experiment using fresh kale, or a different source of chloroplasts.
	Environmental pH conditions are becoming a problem as the plant environment is exposed to runoff waste and other pH changing factors. Seeing how the process of photosynthesis is impacted by these changes in environmental conditions is important to understand in order to stop harmful agents from decreasing or stopping photosynthesis. This could ultimately lead to a dangerous situation for all organisms that rely on this process to survive. Looking at this result of pH change we can see that small differences to the optimal pH do not have much effect on the photosynthetic rate according to the light dependent reactions, but this is only one aspect of photosynthesis and only one environmental condition. With this experiment, the extent in which pH environmental change can have no effect on photosynthesis before it inhibits the process is only touched on but is a good starting point of looking at how environmental changes will affect important processes if not controllled.
