Title: The effects of growing Vigna radiata (mung beans) in different densities on their root to shoot ratio.

Abstract:
When resources are limited, plants must choose to allocate them to creating different structures based on what will best help the plant survive to reproduce. We studied how shoot:root energy allocation in mung beans responds to different planting densities in an effort to understand how they allocate resources under different environments. The mung beans were grown over two weeks in different densities in small planters in the greenhouse. The roots and shoots weights and lengths were then measured and average ratios found. There was a clear difference in the weight ratios between the two groups but the difference in length was negligible. We concluded that due to the competition for resources the roots of the mung bean were given more resources and grew more robustly in order to collect enough resources. This indicates that planting in high density might not be efficient for crop plants because the plants had to direct more resources to their root systems which do not produce edible structures.




Introduction:
Understanding resource allocation in plants is important to understanding how to get the most productivity out of crops. Plants get their energy from many different sources such as light, water, and nutrient resources in the soil and when one is rarer than the others, the plant will redirect resources into whichever structures are needed to collect the rarer resource [Lechowicz, 1987]. If all resources are in abundance, the plant will then be able to direct more resources towards creating other organs focused on other tasks like reproduction [Lechowicz, 1987]. When growing crop plants, it would be more efficient for more of the plant's resources to be allocated to creating the edible structures which are usually the reproductive organs such as beans and fruit. Resource Allocation can be measured by measuring the root/shoot ratio of a plant. If the root to shoot ratio is zero, then the plant is allocating equal resources to the roots and shoot. If the ratio is more then zero it shows that the plant is not allocating resources equally. If the plant is allocating the majority of its resources to its roots, then the shoot of the plant and the part that yields a crop will not grow as much or be as productive. 
In this study we examined mung beans or Vigna radiata which are high in protein and are also a rich source of calcium, phosphorous and other vitamins, making them desirable for crops. These beans are a very important crop as populations of developing countries rise and so, it is important to figure out the most efficient way to raise them in order to produce the most yeild.  
This study involved looking at how mung beans allocate resources when grown in different densities.  In a study conducted on silage corn, another crop plant, to determine the effects of planting the seeds at different densities, it was determined that as seed density increased within the rows, the average time it took for seeds to sprout decreased [Malasli:2017]. According to the two-year experiment, there were significent positive effects on plant height, on the number of ears per plant and on ear weight as spacing increased [Malasli:2017].
Because of the mung beans need to compete for limited resources, we hypothesize that mung beans grown in a high-density environment will develop a higher root to shoot ratio than beans grown in a low-density environment in their effort to find ample amounts of resources. 
 


Materials and Method:
First, we filled six small planters with vermiculite then we added 50 Ml of “miracle-gro” to each planter and soaked all of the planters in water. We made nine holes in each planter about an inch deep and a few centimeters in diameter all evenly spaced about 1-2 inches apart. For the low-density planters, we put two mung bean seeds in each hole. For the high-density planters, we put six seeds in each hole. We placed all the planters in the greenhouse and watered all of them equally once per day for two weeks. We then rinsed the vermiculite off the plants, gently separated them and chose four random plants from each planter for a total of 12 plants from each of the low and high-density groups. We measured the weight in grams and length in centimeters of each plant’s root and shoot. We then measured each plant’s root and shoot length in centimeters and weight in grams. We used this data to find the root:shoot ratio for each plant’s length and weight and then found the averages for each statistic. We used a one-tailed t_test with an alpha value of 0.05 to determine whether the high-density group had a significently higher root to shoot ratio compared to the low-density group.

Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio for weight was 0.44 for the low density and 0.66 for the high-density mung beans [Fig. 1]. The mean root to shoot ratio for length was 0.62 for the low density and 0.64 for the high-density mung beans [Fig. 2]. The p_value for weight root:shoot ratio was 0.0006 which showed a statistically significent difference between the two groups at ⍺ = 0.05. The p_value for length was 0.345 which was not statistically significent. 



Discussion:
Our hypothesis was partially supported by the weight root:shoot ratio but not the length root:shoot ratio. Due to the higher competition for soil nutrients, we thought the high-density group would have an overall higher root:shoot ratio. The high-density mung beans had skinnier stems but both plants looked about the same height. This supports the finding that the weight root:shoot ratio was larger than the ratio for length. Malasli’s study also found that the increased spacing between seeds led to an increase in stem diameter [Malasli:2017]. 
One limitation of our experiment is that we only tested two separate densities. Malasli’s study which tested different densities and found that there was an increased yield from the lowest to the middle density but a decreased yield between the highest density and the others. 
There might be a higher density treatment that we could apply to mung beans that would be somewhere between the two we used which would not negatively affect the root:shoot ratio. But in order to test this, we would need to do further research.
It is possible that the root:shoot length ratio was not significent because the nutrient rich environment the plants were growing in provided enough resources for even the high-density planters and the roots were not actually under much competition. This possibility is supported by Berendse’s study on Plantago lanceolata which found that when the plants had less access to nutrients, the allocation to root mass increased as competitive stress increased. Comparatively, with access to higher levels of nutrients, there was a neutral relationship between competitive stress and shoot to root ratio [Berendse: 2009]. These two studies corroborate our findings that when plants are competing for soil nutrients they will allocate more resources to their roots. Increasing the density at which they were planted increases this competitive stress, so planting mung beans in higher densities is not effective according to our experiment as a way to produce more crop output because it causes the plants to allocate more resources to the roots. Another study also found that when Potentilla recta was grown at high densities, fewer resources were allocated to the reproductive structures of the plant [Soule, 1981]. This helps demonstrate the necessity of understanding how different crop plants allocate resources in order to help efficiently produce the highest yield.
