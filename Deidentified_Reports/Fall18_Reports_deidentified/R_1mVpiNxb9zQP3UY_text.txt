Title: The Effect of herbivores on Radish R:S Ratio

Abstract:
The goal of this experiment was to observe whether plant R:S ratios were decreased by the presences of an herbivore. This was accomplished by growing radishes without any treatment and comparing these R:S ratios to radishes whose leaves were clipped periodically over a span of two weeks. It was found that plants do not have lower R:S ratios because a one tailed t_test performed between the two groups for weight and length R:S ratios indicated that the variation was most likely natural variation (weight: p=0.059; length: p=0.26). The results led to the conclusion that plant growth is not significently affected by herbivores with a short time frame in early development. However, a longer duration of the study might have yielded different results. 

Introduction:
Plants are known to allocate their resources in different ways as a response to biotic factors (Agarwal et. al., 2006). In this experiment, we will be analyzing the response of Rahanus sativus commonly known as the oilseed radish to a loss in leaf mass resulting from the presence of an herbivore which is a biotic factor. Herbivores limit the amount of energy a plant can synthesize because it is common for them to consume the leaves which is where photosynthesis occurs (Viswanathan et. al., 2007). Plants need this process to gain energy from their environment (Johnson, 2016). We expect that plants treated with herbivores will have a significently lower average R:S ratio because they will have less energy available to allocate for continued growth.

Materials and Method:
In order to conduct this experiment, radish seeds first had to be soaked in water. Then approximately five seeds were placed in each pot of soil. After they were planted, equal amounts of miracle grow were placed in each pot. There were five pots for each treatment group with or without herbivores. Plants were watered everyday and as soon as the plants of the treatment group had three or more leaves, nail clippers were used to simulate the effect of an herbivore eating the leaves. One clipping of just less than half the total leaf size was taken from each replicate of the treatment group. Five plants from each pot replicate were taken for a total of twenty plants from the controll and twenty plants from the plants treated with herbivores. After two weeks’ time, the plants were harvested and the length and weight root to shoot ratios were measured. A one-tailed two sample t_test was performed to see whether the plants of the treatment group had lower R:S ratios than the controll.

Results:
The herbivore group had a greater mean weight R:S ratio than the controll group (controll: 0.188±0.07g; herbivore: 0.220±0.05g). The controll group had a greater mean length R:S ratio than the herbivore group (1.20±0.27cm; herbivore: 1.42±0..25cm). The t_test performed between the weight R:S ratios indicated that there is no significent difference between the R:S weights of the controll and the treatment group (t_stat=-1.59, d.f.=38, p=0.059). A t_test performed between the length R:S ratios also displayed no significent difference between the herbivore and controll groups (t_stat=0.638, d.f.=38, p=0.26). 

Discussion:
Based on the results of this experiment, no significent difference was found between the length and weight R:S ratios of radishes treated with herbivores and radishes given no treatment. The statistical tests indicate that the variation present in our data was likely attributable to natural variation. The hypothesis that those treated with herbivores would have lower R:S ratios is rejected. This is parallel to a previous study that indicates plants undergo compensatory growth when damaged by herbivores and that overall plant yield is rarely proportionally decreased relative to the damage the plants receive from the herbivores (McNaughton, 1983). Contrastingly, a different article indicates that native herbivores decrease overall plant growth, seed set and survival capability (Maron, Vilá, 2003). Perhaps, herbivores have no effect on R:S ratio in radishes; however, some error may have contributed to the results. One source of error could be that less time was provided for the plants to grow than necessary for a difference to have been observed. Another source of error that affects both treatments would be present in the harvesting. It is possible that some root mass was lost during the process, however, it probably had little effect on the results because this was present in all replicates. This experiment could be improved if more time was allotted for plant growth. Perhaps, one month rather than two weeks would have allowed a significent difference to be observed.
