Title: The effect of herbivores on the growth of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus

Abstract:
Plants can be one of the most vulnerable organisms in an ecosystem. Relatively stationary, plants do not have the ability to directly avoid predators. To cope with this, plants must carefully allocate their resources. The hypothesis that radish seeds with herbivore simulation will have smaller root to shoot ratios than those not treated with herbivore simulation was rejected. In order to analyze this, the experiment conducted included a control and treatment group of Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. Sativus, or radish plants, including 40 individuals, with 4 replicates for each group.  The plants were grown in miracle growth and fertilizer over a week, the treatment group having the effects of herbivores simulated once the plants had grown three leaves or more. Once the data was collected, it showed that on average, plants that were treated with herbivore effects were still longer than those that were not. Aside from this, a one tailed two sample t-test was conducted and did not yield significant results.

Introduction:
When in a natural environment, organisms must allocate their resources to best optimize their level of fitness, or risk falling to one of the many risks that factor into an ecosystem. One of the main risks that organisms face when in a natural ecosystem is that of predation. While there are external factors that cannot be controlled such as temperature, predation is one that cannot be avoided. This is especially true for organisms that are stationary, such as plants. Plants are a primary energy source for herbivores, typically falling relatively low on most food chains and webs [Johnson 2016].  To overcome this prey-specific ordeal, plants must appropriately and carefully allocate their resources to extend their survival. The length and weight of the root and the shoot typically reflect how a plant allocates their resources  [Johnson et al., 2016]. Another factor of resource allocation is competition. This is known as resource limitation, where there is only a certain amount of available water and nutrients. With resource limitation and the fact that plants can only absorb nutrients and water from a certain distance from them, the competition that plants face in an ecological environment is high. While there is an immense variety of plants on the earth, a plant that can easily be analyzed is the Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, or more commonly known as the radish. The radish is grown as a crop in many parts of the world, which many eat for the nutrients it provides. However, accompanied with that “many” are herbivores and pests. If either of these organisms get to the radishes, the radishes will be facing a direct threat which they have no way to truly defend themselves against. How a radish responds to this can be examined in an experiment. While actual herbivores were not brought in for the experiment, the effect of an herbivore on a plant was simulated. Doing this, it was able to be hypothesized that radish seeds with herbivore simulation will have smaller root to shoot ratios than those not treated with herbivore simulation. This is because the radishes that are treated with herbivore simulation will have less energy to allocate for growth  due to having less resources in their smaller leaves to retain nutrients. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, a radish seeds were retrieved. 40 individuals were taken, split into 4 replicates. Once retrieved, five seeds were put into eight planters. This was done in order to collect forty replicates of the plants. These planters were filled with soil and then had miracle growth and fertilizer added to them. Once this was completed, the seeds were split into a control and treatment group. Over the span of a week, the plants were given water in order to grow. Once a plant in the treatment group had grown three leaves or more, the effects of an herbivore feeding were simulated. After the week had come to an end, the plants were then weighed and measured, still separated into control and treatment groups. Once the data was recorded, the averages of the weight and the length of the groups were compared to deduce which group had the heavier weight and the longer length. A one tailed two sample t-test was conducted in order to analyze if there was any significance.  

Results:
One pattern noticed was that plants treated with herbivore stimulation tended to weigh less than those that were not.  Plants that were treated with herbivore simulation opposed to those that were not had a SD of 0.220498  +/- 0.187641. However another pattern noticed was that plants that were not treated with herbivore simulation were longer than those that were, on average. This is shown with the SD of 1.19574 +/- 1.14285.  Aside from this, the statistical one tailed two sample t-test  that was ran did not yield significant results . The test ran for the weight of the root to shoot ratio did not yield significant results (t-stat = -1.59441, p-value = 0.059564.  The test that was ran for the length of the root to shoot ratio (depicted bin between the two groups did not yield any significant results as well. The t-stat found was to be 0.63856 and the p-value was found to be 0.263375. In more depth, the t-stat values are not significant due to how close both values are to 0. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis that radish seeds with herbivore simulation will have smaller root to shoot ratios than those not treated with herbivore simulation will be  rejected . According to figure 1, plants that were treated with herbivores were on average longer than those that were not, which takes away from hypothesis. Other, similar experiments show a variety of results. One study found that when faced with herbivores, plants tend to modify their metabolism [McNaughton, 1983], which is more than likely what the radish plants did in order to make themselves longer.  According to another study, leaf quality tends to increase when a plant is young [Campo, Julio, and Dirzo, 2003], which is another possibility as to why the radish plants were able to continue growing . Aside from this, many plants, radishes included, have increased their fitness over time to respond faster and better to insect and herbivore predation [Kessler, André, and Baldwin, 2002]. A limitation to this experiment was the time constraint. Given more time, significant data may have been yielded as a week is not enough time to test for herbivory effects as plants tend to be out longer in natural environments. For future experiments, the span of a month should be used in order to properly gather more data . A month would allow for the plants to allow the plants to grow larger and develop the systems they use for resource allocation better.
