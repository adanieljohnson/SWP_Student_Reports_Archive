Title: Effects of the addition of Calcium to Rana Pipiens Gastrocnemius

Abstract:
The effect of ions and ion channels is an important topic in nerve and muscle study in comparative physiology. When trying to understand what makes living things move and react to stimuli, it is important to understand how a certain chemical will affect the internal processes of plants and animals. In this experiment, we look at the effects of injecting calcium directly into the gastrocnemius muscle in the leg of the Rana pipiens frogs. The expectation was that the additional calcium ions would open more ion channels in the muscle, releasing more acetylcholine, thus creating a greater amplitude when stimulated by the sciatic nerve than the legs before calcium was added. However, our data and statistical tests showed no significant difference in amplitude of muscle twitch between the frog legs in their control state and their experimental state.

Introduction:
Rana pipiens is a frog that is used as a model organism in laboratories. These organisms are vertebrates, so their skeletal muscles are innervated by motor neurons at the neuromuscular junction. Nerve impulses cause the release of acetyl choline from the presynaptic nerve terminal. This neurotransmitter binds with Sodium ions which open sodium channels that generate action potential. Action potential then spreads throughout the length of the muscle fiber, causing the release of calcium. This ion activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fiber, which causes it to move [Johnson: 2018]. Calcium ions do this by targeting proteins in the muscle fiber called troponin. This attack allows actin and myosin to bind to contract a muscle [Rüegg: 1986]. Due to calcium’s activating nature, a calcium overload in muscles, especially those that have started to atrophy, can promote skeletal muscle breakdown, which can cause the cytoplasmic calcium not to be released in organisms, thus limiting muscle contraction [Gao: 2014]. Our group hypothesizes that if we add calcium to the gastrocnemius of one frog leg, then it will have different muscle contraction strength, in the form of amplitude, than before the addition of calcium.

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained three frog legs, each to be used as its own control and subsequently as the test group. We prepared all three legs by skinning them and separating the sciatic nerve from the inside of the leg to make it easily assessible for electrical stimulation. Next, one frog leg was hung from the equipment by the Achilles tendon so that the gastrocnemius of the leg was at a 90-degree angle from the tray. The sciatic nerve was then directly stimulated at an interval of 0.2 voltages from 0.2-2.0 volts at 4 Hz. The nerve was pulsed ten times, and the amplitude was recorded each time. Following this control, the gastrocnemius was treated with 0.1 mL of calcium and waited one minute for the effects to take place. The sciatic nerve was then stimulated ten more times at the same intervals and voltage, and the amplitudes were recorded. This process was repeated on the remaining two frog legs. Once all of the data was recorded, we used a paired t-test to determine if the calcium causes a significant difference between the control and experimental tests at 1.4 voltage.

Results:
The mean difference in amplitude at 1.4 voltage was -0.268 [figure 1]. The standard deviation of amplitude in the control group was 0.601 and the standard deviation of amplitude in the experimental group was 0.435. The p-value after performing a paired t-test was 0.182. The paired t-test value was greater than 0.05.

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that if we add calcium to the gastrocnemius of one frog leg, then it will have different muscle contraction strength, in the form of amplitude, than before the addition of calcium, was not supported by the experiment because results for the experiment were not statistically significant. This means that we accept the null hypothesis that Rana pipiens that receive additional calcium in muscles do not have stronger muscle contraction than those that do not receive additional calcium. Potential explanations for these results could include that the gastrocnemius muscles of the frogs could have fatigued from the repetitive stimulation before the addition of calcium ions. Additionally, results could have been different if the frog were alive to circulate the calcium injection as well. Throughout the experiment, we noticed that the baseline for the amplitude after the addition of calcium was higher than for the control. We interpreted this observation as the muscle tensing up with the additional calcium. This could have been an example of Gao’s findings that a calcium overload inhibits calcium release from inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Gao: 2014]. However, our results only indicate that we cannot rule eliminate the possibility that the differences in amplitude were through chance.
