Title: The Effect of Acidity on Photosynthetic Rate in Spinacia oleracea 

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted in order to determine the effect of pH on photosynthetic rate in Spinacia oleracea because pH has an effect on the rate of enzymatic activity that is essential to performing catalytic processes. pH was tested because it is a confounding variable in determining the photosynthetic rate of plants which is essential to plant survival and contributes oxygen to the atmosphere which is important for life and normal functioning of many organisms. If the pH in soil is altered by human activity such as fossil fuel use or runoff from agriculture, then plants could be more susceptible to early death and would not produce oxygen at maximum efficiency. Photosynthetic rate was measured through absorption rate using a spectrophotometer using light with a wavelength of 600 nm. The spectrophotometer calculates the amount of photons (the intensity of light) absorbed after it passes through sample solution. In this experiment it is used to measure absorbance of the chloroplasts. As the absorbance decreases, more photosynthesis occurs as more electrons are transported from the chloroplasts to DCIP. The absorbance was compared for 3 groups: pH 3 solution, pH 5 solution and a neutral pH control group, all containing 3 tubes each. The neutral pH group was found to have the 

Introduction:
highest average percent change at 22.37% so it had the highest rate of photosynthetic activity followed by the pH 5 group (14.80%) and the pH 3 group (58.83%). The data appeared to support the alternative hypothesis but the results were found to be statistically insignificant because the p-value calculated by the multivariable ANOVA test was 0.616.

In this experiment, Spinacia oleracea (spinach) is studied in order to determine whether or not a more acidic (lower pH) solution would inhibit the rate of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts of a plant. Spinach was used because it is cheap, easy to obtain for lab use and its chloroplasts undergo a very efficient photosynthetic process. Human activity such as the use of fossil fuels and agriculture runoff can affect pH of soil so it is important to understand the effects of this on photosynthesis as it is a key process for plant survival and creating optimal atmospheric conditions. Photosynthesis is a process that plants undergo in order to create food energy from light and produce oxygen (Johnson: 2016). During photosynthesis, there is light independent and light dependent reactions. This experiment will focus specifically on the light dependent reaction in the photosynthetic process that occur to produce NADPH and ATP from light energy and also create a proton gradient which allows for ATP synthesis (Johnson: 2016).  NADPH is produced by this process but is difficult to measure in the lab conditions given. Therefore, an alternative electron acceptor is used that is easier to measure. This alternative electron acceptor is DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol), a Hill reaction reagent (Johnson: 2016). DCIP acts as a substitute for NADP+, the final electron carrier in photosynthesis in the Hill reaction and as DCIP is reduced, the resulting increase in light transmittance can be measured using a spectrophotometer (Hieke: 1979). DCIP can be used to measure the rate of photosynthesis because when it is exposed to light, it loses its blue color as the reduced form of DCIP is colorless. Therefore, a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm (the peak absorbance of oxidized DCIP) as measured by the spectrophotometer can be interpreted as DCIP reduction and a consequent increase in photosynthesis (Johnson: 2016). At low pHs, however, the rate of reduction of DCIP is slower compared to a neutral or basic pH (Haraguchi: 1996). The rate constant, Kapp, is considerably higher in acidic pH ranges than a neutral pH. This means that the maximum number of enzyme catalytic processes occurring per second is lower in acidic pHs. Therefore, photosynthetic rate will be slower in acidic conditions as the reaction takes longer due to slower movement of electrons to DCIP. Because of this, it is hypothesized that as the pH is lowered, the photosynthetic rate will go down as well, as indicated by the most negative percent change in absorbance.

Materials and Methods:
First, a mortar and pestle and a beaker were obtained. Then, 3, 50 mL centrifuge tubes were placed in ice. The central veins were removed from the spinach leaves and then the leaves were added to the mortar.  10 mL of grinding buffer, made of 400 mM sucrose in slightly basic Tricine buffer, is then added the  spinach leaves were grinded into a paste. An additional 10 mL of grinding buffer were added, mixed with the spinach paste and poured through a multilayered cheesecloth into a beaker that had been kept in ice. The contents of this beaker were transferred into a centrifuge tube and spun for 10 minutes before being poured out into a new tube. The pellet was suspended with 10 mL of normal grinding buffer and then separated equally into 3 tubes. Then, 4 mL of pH 3 buffer was added to one centrifuge tube, 4 mL of pH 5 buffer was added to another centrifuge tube, and 4 mL of the normal grinding buffer was added to the last (control) centrifuge tube. These tubes were spun for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm, and resuspended with 20 mL grinding buffer after the supernatant was poured out. They were then placed on ice to cool for 5-10 minutes before being picked up and stirred gently. 200 microliters of supernatant was extracted from each of the three centrifuge tubes using a micropipette. These tubes were poured equally into 3 experimental groups (depending on pH) of 3 test tubes, leaving 1 test tube empty to serve as the blank (10 test tubes in all). 6mL of H2O was added  to all of the centrifuge tubes except for the blank which had 8 mL of H2O added to it. 2mL of 130 mM DCIP was then added to all of the tubes except the blank. After, 2mL of reaction buffer was added to all tubes. After 10 minutes, absorbance was measured using the spectrophotometer set at 600 nm. This process was repeated twice for a total of 3 trials. The statistical test used in this experiment to determine statistical significance was a multivariable ANOVA statistical test and the alpha value was 0.05. 

Results:
According to Figure 1, the average percent change in absorbance between 30 minutes and 10 minutes in the 3 tubes (data was not calculated at 0 time) for pH 3 was -58.833 +/- 138.443%. The average percent change for pH 5 was 14.8 +/- 6.242%. Lastly, the average percent change for the control group with neutral pH was 22.37 +/- 17.216% . An ANOVA test was used to determine whether or not the results were statistically significant. The test determined that the p-value between all the pH values was 0.616. This number is greater than 0.05 so the results of this experiment were statistically insignificant. 

Discussion:
The results from this experiment exemplify several patterns about the effect of pH on photosynthetic rate in spinach. The alternate hypothesis that the rate of photosynthesis would decrease as the pH was lowered was rejected because the p-value calculated determined that the results were not statistically significant. The control group had the most consistent decline in absorbance and the DCIP became the most colorless so it had the most photosynthetic activity. Nevertheless, the ANOVA test determined that all of the data calculated was not significant. This means that the control group had the highest percent change and therefore, the most photosynthetic activity followed by pH 5 and lastly, the pH 3 group. There are many important enzymes in the photosynthetic process but the one used the most is RuBisCO which functions optimally at a pH of 8 (Banas: 2017). When the pH is lowered to suboptimum levels, the enzyme slows down. This is compounded by a study which shows that optimum pH levels for spinach chloroplasts are between 7.8 and 8.2 (Huber: 1979). When the pH was altered in this experiment, the enzymatic activity in chloroplasts was slowed and caused a slower rate of photosynthesis. Nevertheless, there is other factors to be considered in the photosynthetic process other than enzymatic activity rate. Another study shows that K+ exiting from the stroma is associated with a lowered stromal pH (Wu: 1991). This establishes a correlation between K+ movement across the chloroplast envelope and photosynthetic rate. Potassium movement is necessary to create the charge balance needed at the site of ATP production. ATP plays an important role in the light dependent reaction so when it is produced slowly, photosynthesis is slowed down as well. For all of these reasons, pH is observed to have a direct correlation with photosynthetic rate, confirming the relevancy of this study. However, the data collected during this study was insignificant. This could be attributed to chloroplast death which would change the absorbance detected by the spectrophotometer. In the future, more centrifuge tubes containing chloroplasts would be used for each experimental group and there could be a group under basic conditions in order to compare the effects of basicity and acidity on photosynthesis.
