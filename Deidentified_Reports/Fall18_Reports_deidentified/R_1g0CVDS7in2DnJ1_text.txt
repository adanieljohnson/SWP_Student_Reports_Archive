Title: The effects of temperature on resource allocation and root:shoot ratios in Pisum sativum plants

Abstract:
The Pisum sativum are commonly known as the crop plant, Peas. Given certain environmental conditions, the Pisum sativum can choose to allocate their energy towards the growth and development of either their roots or their shoots in a process known as resource allocation. The objective of the experiment was to test the effects of temperature on root:shoot ratios. The hypothesis of the experiment was that the plants growing in the warmer plant incubator will produce a larger root:shoot ratio than the plants growing in the room temperature greenhouse. A total of six Pisum sativum were used in the experiment. Three plants were in the 23⁰C room temperature greenhouse as the control group while the other three plants were placed in the 27⁰C greenhouse as the treatment group. All six plants were on similar light cycles and were watered daily for fourteen days. The results of the experiment for the root:shoot weight ratio (p=0.0263, df=4, t-stat=2.726) and the root:shoot length ratio (p=0.0241, df=4, t-stat=0.0481) were both statistically significant. The results suggest that there is a likely probability that climates with higher temperatures maintain vegetation with high root:shoot ratios. 

Introduction:
Phenotypic variation amongst natural plant species is the primary result of adaptation to environmental stimuli. These environmental conditions include competition over sunlight, water availability and soil nutrients that determine the plant’s growth pattern, resource management and general compatibility with the climate [Madsen: 1991]. A plant’s adaptability occurs through a process known as resource allocation. When a seedling is planted in an environment with limited resources, the plant can allocate its energy to significantly develop its roots or shoots depending on the environment. For instance, plants growing in dessert conditions tend to grow longer roots to reach groundwater, while plants growing in rainforest conditions tend to grow longer shoots to compete with others over sunlight [Madsen: 1991]. The resource allocation process allows the plant to circumvent the challenge of being immobile while maximizing its lifespan and chance of producing offspring [Bazzaz: 1997].  

The study of resource allocation is expanding its importance in modernity as crop yield technologies are increasing while climatic predictability is on the decline. As the temperature of Earth rises, the scientific questioning the sustainability of large agricultural productions for the growing human population. A restricted crop yield due to climate change can increase prices of food and in turn, decrease food security [Rogers: 1995]. Pisum sativum, commonly referred to as Pea plants are good to study resource allocation because they are domesticable crop plants that behave in a similarly in experimentation as they do in natural populations. In this experiment, we predict that the plants growing in the warmer plant incubator will produce a larger root:shoot ratio than the plants growing in the room temperature greenhouse.


Materials and Methods:
The experiment was conducted by using six potted Pisum sativum, commonly known as Pea plants. Each pot of the experiment was filled to rim with vermiculite. Tap water was then added to the vermiculite to dampen the soil. Next, 50 millimeters of liquid plant fertilizer was added to the vermiculite of each pot. Then, nine holes were made in the soil of each pot and multiple pre-soaked Pisum sativum seeds were placed in each hole. The pots were separated into groups for experimentation: three pots were used as a control group and three pots were used as a treatment group. The pots of the control group were placed in a Greenhouse at 23⁰C, room temperature. The pots of the experimental group were placed in a plant incubator at 27⁰C. All six plants were on similar day-night cycles and were watered daily. The experiment was conducted for 14 days. The data was analyzed by using a two-sample t-test. The critical value used to compare the data was p &lt; 0.05.

Results:
The data of the control group resulted in a mean root:shoot weight ratio of 0.94 grams with a standard deviation of 0.14 grams (Figure 1). The treatment group, however, had a mean root:shoot weight ratio of 1.24 grams with a standard deviation of 0.13 grams (Figure 1). The mean root:shoot length ratio of the control group was 0.48 millimeters with a standard deviation of 0.07 millimeters, while the mean root:shoot length ratio of the treatment group was 0.64 millimeters with a standard deviation od 0.069 millimeters (Figure 2). The results of this experiment were statistically significant for both the root:shoot weight ratio and the root:shoot length ratio (R:S weight ratio: p=0.0263, df=4, t-stat=2.726), (R:S length ratio: p=0.0241, df=4, t-stat=0.0481). The results of this experiment were analyzed by using a critical value of p &lt; 0.05 in a two-sample t-test with a one-tailed p-value.

Discussion:
The hypothesis tested in this experiment was that the plants growing in the warmer plant incubator will produce a larger root:shoot ratio than the plants growing in the room temperature greenhouse. The results of this experiment support this hypothesis. The mean root:shoot weight ratio and the mean root:shoot length ratio of the control group were both larger than those of the experimental group. Both results of the two-sample t-test used to analyze this data proved to be statistically significant. These differences were phenotypically displayed between the control group, the plants stored in the 23⁰C greenhouse; and the treatment group, the plants stored in the 27⁰C plant incubator. 

The results suggest that the root:shoot ratio was larger in the treatment group because it was stored in an area with a higher temperature. Higher temperatures increase evaporative water processes within an environment. In turn, causing the plants in the incubator to regularly lose more water than the plants in the greenhouse. Thus, signaling to the plant that energy should be allocated to the growth of the roots to ensure maximum area and depth for water consumption. The control group, however, did not experience water as a limiting resource. For this reason, the plants began to demonstrate patterns of longer shoot growth as competition over sunlight commenced. A similar study was conducted titled, Effect of Root/Leaf Temperature Differentials on Root/Shoot Ratios in Some Pasture Grasses and Clover [Davidson: 1969]. In this experiment, the researcher studied the effects of five different soil temperatures on twelve pasture species grown with the same environmental conditions [Davidson: 1969]. While analyzing the results of this experiment, it was found that root:shoot ratios were lowest at the most favorable temperature, around room temperature [Davidson: 1996]. This experiment proposes the idea that a possible equilibrium could be reached between root:shoot ratios of a plant if the environmental conditions are favorable for that species. Both studies are indicative of the role of temperature in root:shoot ratios of a plant. Rather than being an environmental factor for control, temperature often acts as an indicator of other natural resources such as light, water and nutrient availability for a plant. 

Further research on this topic could be used to study crop yield and abundance and the human population continues to grow alongside climate change. Studies have shown that variability of allocation patterns within a plant due to consistent environmental conditions provide maximum plant growth [Bazzaz: 1997]. In other words, seasonal shifts contribute greatly to the maximum crop yield of commonly consumed goods. A study of the effects of high temperatures on the crop species, Spring Wheat, found that if global temperatures continue to increase as a result of climate change, the crop yield of wheat would be greatly reduced [Ferris: 1998]. In summation, the Pisum sativum plants are good for experimentation because they are crop yielding plants that can provide a basis of study for natural populations. Temperature is an environmental element that effects plant life through the control of water cycles, water availability and the nutrients within the soil. A factor that may have limited the accuracy of our data was mistakenly watering the plants with twice the normal amount in one day, possibly effecting the restrictions of temperature on the plants in the incubator.
