Title: The effect of plant variability on the rate of electron transport and photosynthesis using Spinacia oleracea and Brassica oleracea var. sabellica chloroplasts in light and dark conditions and 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol as the electron acceptor.

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a cellular process that converts light into energy for a plant cell. This process is important because it produces energy from external sources to carry out other cellular and metabolic processes. In this experiment, we studied the rates of electron transfer in kale and spinach chloroplasts under light conditions by measuring the absorbance levels of the chloroplasts with DCIP over a total of 30 minutes. We hypothesize that due to the increased capacity for photosynthetic activity in the thicker kale leaf, kale will have an increased rate of photosynthesis than spinach chloroplasts. Our hypothesis was rejected, as there was no significant difference between absorbances in kale and spinach. This data is important because it compares the rate of photosynthesis in different plants and leaf types and can be reflected on many other green plants as well. 

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is a metabolic process that uses energy from light and converts it into glucose, a source of energy for the plant cell that is then broken up to produce ATP. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. The captured solar energy excites the electrons to leave the carrier molecules, trigger a chemical reaction that release electrons to replace those that left the electron carriers, and generate a proton gradient. The high energy electrons that are stored as NADPH, and the proton gradient that power ATP synthesis and lastly, the electrons on NADPH and ATP are then used in chemical reactions to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide molecules [Johnson: 2016]. Chloroplasts exhibit two different photosynthesis reactions, light dependent and light independent. Light dependent reactions generate most of the proton gradient that drive ATP synthesis and use absorbed photons to generate reducing power. Light-independent reactions, however, uses ATP and reducing power in NADPH to combine carbon dioxide molecules to create glucose molecules [Johnson: 2016]. This lead to ask the question is the variability of a plant, such as shade of green and the thickness of the leaf, affect the reduction reactions required for photosynthesis? Every plant, however, has a different rate of electron transfer, and there are several variables that could be tested to compare the rates of photosynthesis. 
For this experiment, we chose to compare the relative rates of electron transport in different plant leaves under light and dark conditions to test the different variables that affect photosynthesis. Spinach, Spinacia oleracea, and Kale, Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, are two green leafy vegetable superfoods. We chose Spinach and Kale because these two plants and their leaves both exhibit very different physical and molecular characteristics. Kale, for example, is a darker leafy green and therefore has more chlorophyll present so as to maximize the rate of photosynthesis undergone in the kale leaf. 
Although there is not any evident data comparing kale and spinach leaves specifically, a previous study performed on an evergreen tree species, showed that leaf thickness directly corresponds to the amount of mesophyll cells that expose more intercellular space and creates a large photosynthetic capacity in the leaf [Hanba: 2002]. Therefore, the thicker leaf of kale is relative to the more intercellular space available that can be filled with more mesophyll cells, or cells specialized for photosynthesis, which likewise indicate that more chloroplasts are present. The greater the number of chloroplasts available to absorb light, the more light that is captured and converted into energy. Spinach, on the other hand, has a thin, light green leaf which indicates less chloroplasts available to undergo photosynthesis. The use of DCIP is to pull electrons off of the electron transport chain in the place of NAD+. This electron acceptor changes the color of the solution from blue to colorless so that the less color there is in the solution means a higher rate of electron transport from the chloroplasts. Therefore, kale is believed to have lower absorbances than spinach in the lamp light conditions due to the increased rate of photosynthesis that is conducted in the chloroplasts. Our hypothesis claims that kale will show a higher rate of photosynthesis than spinach under light conditions due to the thicker leaf of kale. As a result, in relation to the electron transport chain, there would be an increase in the rate of reduction of DCIP, which suggests photosynthesis has been carried out more in the kale in the light conditions versus the dark conditions. 


Materials and Methods:
In our experiment, we tested the rate of electron transfer of spinach and kale chloroplasts under lamp light conditions and dark conditions. The Spinach and the Kale were obtained by the lab instructor from a grocery store. 
In Exercise 1, consider every step was repeated with Spinach and Kale. First, we removed the central vein of both kale and spinach leaves, then used a mortar and pestle, mixed the respective leaves with 20mL of grinding buffer, to grind up the leaves into a thick paste. This paste was then strained through cheese cloth, to remove any large chunks of leaves, into separate chilled beakers. We transferred 200 μl of the filtered liquid from the beaker of spinach into a microtube labeled “Sample of A Spinach” and stored it on ice, and then transferred the remaining green liquid to a 50mL centrifuge tube marked “A - Spinach”, which was spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4 degrees C. The supernatant “A - Spinach” was then transferred to a second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube marked “B - Spinach”. It is important not to disrupt the debris at the bottom of the tube. 200 μl of the liquid was removed from “B - Spinach” and placed it in a microtube labeled “Sample of B - Spinach”, was put on ice. Tube “B-Spinach,” which contains the chloroplast suspension, was centrifuged again at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees C. Next, the supernatant was poured into a 50mL tube labeled “C-Spinach,” again avoiding disruption of the pellet at the bottom of the microtube and placed on ice. The pellet of kale and spinach, respectively, were suspended and stirred with 20mL of grinding buffer and a transfer pipet. 200 μl of this resuspended pellet was transferred to a microtube labeled “Sample of B Pellet - Spinach” and store it on ice. In the last step of Exercise 1, 200 μl from tube “C - Spinach” was removed and placed it into a microtube labeled “Sample of C - Spinach” and store it on ice the on ice. All steps were repeated with the kale leaves as well.  
In Exercise 2, 17 large test tubes were numbered and placed on a rack. Note that 3 replicates of each of the following reaction mixes were made, but only 1 replicate of the blank. Each test tube was filled with 2mL of DCIP, except for the Spinach and Kale blanks, 6mL of water, except for the 2 blanks which had 8mL, and 2mL of reaction buffer. To begin the assay, 100 μl of Spinach chloroplasts were added to blank 1 and test tubes #6-11, as well as 100 μl of kale chloroplasts were added to blank 2 and test tubes #12-17. The mixtures were transferred to cuvettes and measured for absorbances in the spectrometer set at 600nm. The spectrometer was blanked to start, with the respective blank. Tubes #1-8 and #12-14 were placed in lamp light and tubes #9-11 and #15-17 were placed in darkness. After 10, 20 and 30 minutes, each test tube was measured for absorbance. Finally, we analyzed our results using a two-sample t-test comparing the control group, spinach chloroplasts in light, and the experimental group, kale chloroplasts in light.

Results:
After 10, 20, and 30 minutes, we measured the absorbance values of Kale and Spinach Chloroplasts in light. The experimental group, Kale chloroplasts in light, showed a general trend of a slight increase in absorbance value after 30 minutes. Whereas the control group, spinach chloroplasts in light, showed a general trend of decreasing absorbance values over 30 minutes (Figure 1). The kale chloroplasts had an average change of 0.1237 nm +/- 0.144 s.d. The spinach chloroplasts had an average change of -0.220 nm +/- 0.104 s.d.  Other results of this experiment included a degree of freedom of 4, a t-value of 1.057, and a p-value of 0.350. These results depicted an insignificant difference between both groups.

Discussion:
In a previous experiment, we compared the rates of electron transfer and absorbance values of spinach chloroplasts in light and dark conditions. The results of this experiment aligned with our previous results as the light conditions showed decreased absorbance values and an increase in the rate of electron transfer than the chloroplasts in the dark conditions. However, our original hypothesis was rejected by the results of our experiment, as we argued the kale chloroplasts in light would ultimately have lower absorbance values due to the increased rate of photosynthesis in the thicker leaf of kale than spinach. Our results showed an insignificant difference between rates of photosynthesis in kale and spinach chloroplasts. Specifically, as represented in Figure 1, the kale chloroplasts had an average change of 0.1237 nm0.144 s.d. and the spinach chloroplasts had an average change of -0.220 nm0.104 s.d. A thicker plant leaf has been shown to increase the rate of photosynthesis, which reduces DCIP as it pulls electrons from the electron transport chain and creates a more significant color change that lowers absorbance values due to the clear color of the solution [Johnson: 2016]. 
The importance of our results is determining if leaf thickness in similar green vegetable plants play a role in the rate of electron transport and photosynthetic activity and would vary among other various green plants. Although our data is insignificant, it is important to look at the values and relate it back to previous experimental studies that have a proven correlation between the rate of photosynthesis and leaf thickness. In Hanba’s experiment, different leaves with various detectable thicknesses of an evergreen tree species was tested for the difference between the rate of electron transfer in photosynthesis [Hanba: 2002]. 
Our hypothesis stated that the correlation between leaf thickness and photosynthesis would impact the rate of electron transport within the electron transport chain, and that the thicker the leaf, the greater capacity for photosynthetic activity in the leaf. Although previous studies depicted a connection between leaf thickness and the rate of photosynthesis, other factors could have impacted the absorbance values and overall results of our experiment [Hanba: 2002]. For example, we did not measure an equivalent amount of kale and spinach leaves before grinding them into a suspension. This inequivalent amount of leaves would contribute in an imbalance of chloroplasts and would impact the rate of photosynthesis if there were more pieces of one plant than the other. Other errors in this experiment include the difficulty and inability to grind up the plants, especially kale. For future experiments it would be beneficial to ensure there are enough chloroplasts from the leaves that go into the beaker when strained through the cheese cloth. Lastly, in our experiment, we had a malfunctioning spectrometer and alternated between two machines throughout the lab to measure absorbance values. This could have contributed to an inconsistency of absorbance values due to the variability of two spectrometers. Although our hypothesis was not supported by our data, leaf thickness has been proven to be a factor in the rate of photosynthesis due to the increased capacity of the leaf for photosynthetic activity.
