Title: Effects of the Inhibitor, Curcumin, on the Slime Mold, Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Cell signaling is critical to all aspects of life because a signal transduction pathway allows cells to respond appropriately to their external and internal environment. In this experiment, the presence of curcumin, an inhibitor to Protein Kinase A which directly inhibits growth and migration, was tested on the organism, Physarum polycephalum (a type of slime mold) in order to analyze the effects of the inhibitor on the rate of growth of the mold over a 24-hour incubation period. Generally, the growth of the physarum is directed and controllled by actin filaments, which is ultimately controllled by Protein Kinase A. There was a total of three trials (petri plates) per group – a controll group (no curcumin) and an experimental group (curcumin). With large standard deviation values and a large p_value, there was no general trend between the two groups due to statistical insignificance. Due to statistical insignificance, there is inconclusive data and need for more replicates and experiments. This experiment was utilized to determine the effect of an inhibitor on a cell signal transduction pathway of a type of mold, which then potentially can be applied to other organisms, such as humans, for a better understanding of cellular signal transduction pathways. 

Introduction:
Cell signaling is one of the most important functions to all of life because a signal transduction pathway allows cells to respond to their external and internal environment. The model organism that we’ll be using to analyze this aspect of life is slime mold, also known as “Physarum polycephalum,” which is a multinucleate syncytium (mass of multiple nuclei within one single plasma membrane) [Johnson: 2016]. Because of this and since it behaves as one large cell dividing at the same time, there are a lot of cellular processes that can be analyzed without the need for a microscope. All multicellular organisms, including our model organism, share similar functions so analyzing the signal transduction pathway of this model organism can provide a significent amount of information on the human signal transduction pathway. In general, the “Physarum polycephalum” spends most of its time in the plasmodial stage migrating and searching for bacteria, fungal spores, microbes, and other food. Typically, the physarum is a yellow flat gooey mass that prefers to live in damp decomposing leaves and ground debris, extending itself by using actin microfilaments. By consuming and “eating” other organisms for energy, it’ll actively transport hydrolytic enzymes into food vacuoles to digest them. When this happens, all the nuclei are diploid. When staying in darkness and high humidity, it remains multicellular where it can split forming the same identical daughter organisms or continue scavenging for food. When under stress, the organism will then adjust. When there is a lack of food or low humidity, the plasmodium hardens to form the “sclerotium” (suspended stage), which is a type of hibernation state and which will go away once food reappears. In other times of stress from light, heat, and a lack of food, physarum can respond by starting a reproductive cycle to adjust. The plasmodium can break into small pieces, sporangia, which can undergo meiosis to form gaphoid gametes called spores. These spores can travel over distances in order to find better conditions for the organism to survive. Other individual haploid spores can germinate, forming other mobile cells and thus finding another compatible mate to form produce daughter cells [Johnson: 2016]. Physarum can also respond with a wide variety of behaviors in order to adjust to stress, such as cytoplasmic streaming, phototaxis, chemotaxis, gravitaxis, and structural organization. All of these are appropriate behaviors in response to certain stresses. Cytoplasmic streaming is a response to general direction of growth, phototaxis is the movement of plasmodium masses moving in response to light, chemotaxis is the movement of the physarum in response to chemicals, gravitaxis is the response of the physarum to gravity, and structural organization is the general reorganization in structure of the physarum in response to different environments. Generally, physarum grows away from light, away from dry surfaces, and towards a food source and glucose [Johnson: 2016]. In lab, physarum is grown on a medium of 2% agar melted in distilled water and poured into a petri dish. Food and live physarum are added and physarum will consume the food and growth will be measured. In general, growth of the physarum is directed by actin filaments, which is controllled by protein kinase A [Johnson: 2016]. In our own experiment, we will be analyzing the growth of the physarum in certain chemical environments (chemotaxis) that inhibits protein kinase A, which is the inhibitor curcumin. Curcumin itself is a known inhibitor that can inhibit cell proliferation and cell growth. Curcumin is also a common active ingredient found curry and one of its many common utilities is that it suppresses tumor initiation and tumor promotion [Chen: 1998]. In another case study, it was found that the presence of curcumin inhibited constitutive and IL-6-Inducible STAT3 Phosphorylation in myeloma cells of humans. In the case study done by Bharti, curcumin worked by inhibiting the phosphorylation, thus suppressing growth and proliferation of the multiple myeloma cells [Bharti: 2003]. In our experiment, hoping to see something along the same lines, there will be three plates with blocks of physarum with the presence of food and curcumin and three other plates with solely physarum blocks. Therefore, it is predicted that the presence of curcumin on the three petri plates with food will produce a much smaller and slower rate of growth of the leading edge of physarum stands compared to physarum stands without curcumin. 

Materials and Method:
First, we prepared the plates with Physarum polycephalum. A spatula and a pair of flat-tipped forceps were then placed in ethanol in order to properly clean and destroy any prior bacteria that could interfere with the results of the experiment. Next, we opened the physarum stock plate and cut the plate of agar into 1-cm blocks. When opened, one 1cm by 1cm square of the physarum culture was removed from the stock culture plate. Next, the controll and experimental plates (three total plates per group) were produced with the appropriate treatment. For the controll plates (no curcumin), the spatula and the pair of flat-tipped forceps were placed in ethanol to clean and destroy any prior bacteria. Next, a 100 mm petri plate containing 2% water-agar medium (at room temp.) was labeled with the group name and date. On the back of that same plate, a line was drawn dividing the plate in half and on that same line, a square was drawn approximately 1cm by 1cm. The spatula was then removed from the ethanol and wiped off to get rid of excess. Next, we opened the plate of water agar and used the spatula to cut out the center square only from the plate (repeat two more times for the two other plates). Next, with the water agar plate opened, we slid the square of agar and mold into the empty square (sterilize spatula in between uses). Finally, we added two pieces of oats next to one another near the edge on each plate. Lastly, we taped the plates, covered the plates in foil and labeled them, and then stored them in a drawer. There should be a total of three petri plates for the controll group so repeat steps written above if necessary in order to have three petri plates total. In order to make the experimental plates (three total), with the presence of curcumin, one placed the spatula and pair of flat-tipped forceps in the ethanol to destroy any prior bacteria. Next, we labeled a 100 mm petri plate containing 2% water-agar medium (at room temperature) with the name of the group and date on the back. On that same side, we drew a line dividing the plate in half and on that same line, we drew one square about 1cm by 1cm. Next, the curcumin dilution was produced ((20x)(?) = (1x)(30Ml)). We needed to dilute the 20x stock solution down to 1x stock solution (10mM). In order to do this, and based on our calculations, we needed to add 1.5 Ml of 10 mM of curcumin to 30 Ml of water. Once this was done, we added 10 Ml of the dilution to three water agar plates and soaked them in that same solution for ten minutes. After the ten minutes, the excess dilution that was not absorbed was poured out. Next, the spatula was taken out of the ethanol and wiped off. The three plates of water agar plates were then opened and the spatula was used to cut and removed the square from the plates. Again, the water agar plates were opened next and a square of the agar and mold into the empty squares of those plates (sterilize spatula with ethanol in between uses). Two pieces of oats were then added at the edge of each plate and then each plate was taped closed, covered in foil, labeled, and then stored. After 24 hours of letting the plates developed, the length of the strands of mold were measured and collected. A Two-Sample T-test was then used in order to calculate p_values and the statistical significance of our collected data. 

Results:
The general trend for our observations regarding the rate of growth in physarum over 24 hours was that there was no clear trend based upon the collected data. As seen in Figure 1., there is very little difference between the controll (no curcumin) and the experimental (curcumin) groups in terms of the rate of growth in mold over a 24-hour period. The experimental group actually has a higher averaged rate of growth in mold compared to that of the controll group, which contrasts the expected data being that the presence of curcumin was predicted to inhibit growth of the mold. There was a total of three trials that were ran for each group and as a result, there are standard deviation error bars. For the three trials of the controll group, the first plate had a growth of 31.50 mm (1.3125 mm/hr) for the leading edge, 23.00 mm (0.9580 mm/hr) for the second petri plate, and 4.00 mm (0.1667 mm/hr) for the third petri plate. The average growth, as a result, over a 24-hour period was 19.50 mm (0.8124 mm/hr), with a large standard deviation error bar of 0.5866. For the three trials of the experimental group, the first plate had a growth of 12.00 mm (0.5000 mm/hr) for the leading edge, 32 mm (1.3333 mm/hr) for the second petri plate, and 20 mm (0.6667 mm/hr) for the third petri plate. The average growth, as a result, over a 24-hour period was 20.00 mm (0.8332 mm/hr), with a large standard deviation error bar of 0.4407. The two-sample T-test we ran for the controll (no curcumin) against the experimental (curcumin) gave us a p_value of 0.963. The mean of controll group therefore does not hold statistical significance over that of the experimental group for the growth rate in mold over a 24-hour incubation period, because the p_value is significently greater than 0.05. Due to the large standard values for both controll and experimental groups, as well as the large p_value (p_value = 0.963) warranting the data not statistically significent, there is a need for more replicates and experiments for more accurate data. It was expected that the presence of curcumin would inhibit and thus slow the growth rate of physarum in the three petri plates of the experimental group. Therefore, our data, as opposed to Figure 1., was expected to have clear trend where the “No Curcumin” bar is significently larger than the bar of “Curcumin.” 

Discussion:
Based upon our data, we cannot come to the concrete conclusion that the presence of curcumin inhibits the growth of Physarum polycephalum, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the null hypothesis is supported and cannot be rejected, warranting reason for further tests, replicates, and experiments. Given the average growth rates of physarum in the presence of curcumin and no curcumin that were calculated after a 24-hour incubation period, based upon the measurement of the leading edge of the mold per petri plate, there is no clear evidence that suggests curcumin inhibits growth of the physarum. The greatest rate, as seen in Figure 1., is representative of the most/greatest amount of growth of the physarum in 24 hours, due to the most activity of actin filaments, which is ultimately controllled by Protein Kinase A. The reason why we cannot be certain about our results is because of the calculated p_value between the controll (no curcumin) and the experimental group (curcumin). The two-sample T-test that we ran for the two groups gave us a p_value of 0.963. Because of this number being significently greater than 0.05, the mean of the controll group does not hold statistical significance over that of the experimental group. The average growth rate (mm/hr) of the physarum in the presence of curcumin was 0.83323 mm/hr, whereas the average growth rate (mm/hr) of the physarum in the presence of no curcumin was 0.81239 mm/hr. Both groups had very large standard deviation values – 0.441 for curcumin and 0.587 for no curcumin. Therefore, this means that we would need to run more replicates in order to attain more accurate data and smaller standard deviation error bars, compared to Figure 1. There are a wide variety of possible reasons, factors, and confounding variables that could explain the results that were collected. Contrary to the results collected, the presence of curcumin should have inhibited growth of the physarum, although not necessarily stopping growth all together. The growth and migration of physarum is directly correlated to actin filaments, which is controllled by Protein Kinase A. It is the actin filaments (cytoskeleton) that are responsible for allowing the physarum to grow and migrate. In a study done by Alan Howe, it was shown that many regulated cellular behaviors (i.e. ion channel activity, transcription) are controllled by Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA is suggested to adjust and controll “adhesion-associated events” like actin cytoskeletal growth and migration. PKA activity is directly responsible for cell migration and cytoskeletal organization and thus cell migration can be inhibited by the inhibition of PKA, which is what was analyzed in the physarum experiment. Protein Kinase A is involved with may many components of actin cytoskeleton [Howe: 2004]. Based on given information, Protein Kinase A should be inhibited by the presence of curcumin, thus contradicting the collected data. Also, as mentioned earlier, the presence of curcumin inhibited constitutive and IL-6-Inducible STAT3 Phosphorylation in myeloma cells of humans. In the case study done by Bharti, curcumin worked by inhibiting the phosphorylation, thus suppressing growth and proliferation of the multiple myeloma cells [Bharti: 2003]. Therefore, the narrowed reason that possibly explains the results could be that the inhibitor, curcumin, was diluted too much when preparing the plates. As stated in the materials and method section, the solution of the inhibitor had to be diluted to 1x stock solution. As a result, this dilution could have been to dilute thus not allowing the curcumin to have as “strong” an effect on the growth of physarum. Another possible factor for the lack of significent data could be that the petri plates did not have enough time absorbing the curcumin. As stated in the materials and method section, when the diluted curcumin solution was added to the petri plates, there was a total of ten minutes that passed for each plate, allowing it to absorb as much curcumin as possible. However, to ensure better absorption and results, our group should have allowed the plates to sit for a longer period of time absorbing the curcumin as to make sure there was sufficient absorption to inhibit growth of the physarum in the presence of the inhibitor. These two factors are most likely the reasons for the inaccurate data collected. There most likely were no issues with the plates themselves because there was sufficient growth of physarum in all six of the plates. Also, in reference to the study done by Howe, PKA is directly responsible for growth and migration and from the provided information (Sakai), curcumin directly inhibits PKA. Therefore, due to narrowing down possible reasons for our results, the inhibitor was most likely diluted too much and did not sit for a long enough period of time in the plates to ensure sufficient absorption. Going forth, if this experiment were to be conducted again, the inhibitor should not be diluted nearly as much and also sit for a longer period of time in the plates. This should allow a greater trend in data and statistically significent results. As a side note, the food (two pieces of oats) were placed on petri plates to reinforce the physarum to grow and thus show clearer results in terms of inhibition, and possibly show directionality. Although, the plates were probably not given enough time to allow the physarum to grow and thus find the food, redirecting the leading edge. As stated before, all multicellular organisms have similar functions, such as cellular transduction pathways, so analyzing the pathway for physarum provides important information on the not only the human signal transduction pathway as well. For example, other studies of cellular transduction pathways have been done on other organisms as well. In one study, protein kinases of Caenorhabditis elegans (a type of worm) were analyzed for their cellular signal transduction pathway, representative of other multicellular organisms. The worm’s complete genomic sequence was figured out and provides sufficient insight of the transduction pathways “molecules required for the existence of a multicellular animal.” Despite sharing no similar physical appearances with humans, the molecules that regulate the pathway of both organisms are very similar [Plowman: 1999].

Figure 1. Groups containing Physarum polycephalum that are placed in a 24-hour incubation period in order to measure the rate of growth in the mold. The controll group has physarum present but no curcumin, whereas the experimental group has both physarum and curcumin present. For each group, three trials of mold growth and rates were taken and then averaged together. Due to being averaged together, there are standard deviation error bars. There is no statistical significance between either group, therefore, there are no symbols present on the graph to represent statistical significance between the controll and the experiment. *************************************************************************
