Title: The Effect of Water Temperature on Agonistic Behavior of Siamese Fighting Fish

Abstract:
The purpose of the experiment performed was to test how environmental temperature effected intraspecific aggressive behaviors displayed by Siamese fighting fish. Agonistic behavior between male betta splendens surmounts to physical interaction. Behavior patterns can be altered when influenced by abiotic factors, including temperature. Changes in temperature could have a direct and predictable influence on behavior due to availabilities of dissolved oxygen and energy conservation to maintain homeostasis. It was hypothesized that when placed in cold water, the bettas would take a longer amount of time to become aggressive enough to incite a fight. Each pair of male bettas was tested in room temperature and cold water conditions. A paired t-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of data collected. The hypothesis was not supported, and results suggest that differential effects of temperature are not sufficient explanations of intraspecific interaction of male Siamese fighting fish. 

Introduction:
The subject manipulated in this study was the Betta Splendens, commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. Vision is the dominant sense of many fishes [Rowland: 1998]. Siamese fighting fish exhibit intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behaviors of bettas are categorized under two behavior patterns, broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are performed when a fish is perpendicular to an opponent. Typical behaviors that are categorized as broadside movements are: pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements include spreading of the opercula, or protrusion of the branchostegal membrane [Johnson: 2018]. Agonistic behaviors are either ignored or matched by the opponent. Male bettas monitor aggressive interactions of opponents and use information on relative fighting ability in subsequent aggressive interactions [Rui: 1998]. Escalation of agonistic behavior in bettas leads to a higher intensity interaction in which the bettas begin to bite or grapple [Simpson: 1968]. Male bettas exhibit agonistic behavior because of territorial disputes [Rui: 1998]. Behavior patterns can altered when faced with varying abiotic factors. Abiotic factors can be defined as non-living components of an ecosystem, like sunlight, nutrients, and temperature [Dunson: 1991]. Temperature controls the rate of fundamental biochemical processes and thus regulates organismal characteristics [O’Conner: 2007]. Ectotherms do not use metabolic heat to maintain homeostasis and instead rely on the environment to control their temperature. Thus, fish have thermal preferences for optimal function [Dolomatov: 2013]. Temperatures varying from the optimum produce unfavorable conditions. When water temperature is significantly decreased, less oxygen is present. Thus, there is less dissolved oxygen available for the fish to filter for energy-producing pathways. To ovoid suffocation, fish remain more sedentary when in dissolved oxygen is not as readily available [Kramer:1987]. Thus, it was hypothesized that male bettas in colder water would take longer to come into contact via agonistic behavior than when in room temperature water. 

Materials and Methods:
To begin the experiment, six male Betta Splendens were randomly selected and obtained. Each betta was placed into one of two identical containers that were separated into three sections by opaque dividers. The containers were full of 18 degree Celsius water. The six bettas were paired into three groups. Each group was tested under both cold and room temperature conditions, totally to six trials. The first three trials were run with the water temperature at 18 degrees Celsius. During each trial, the divider separating the pair was removed. The amount of time between removal of the divider and the touching of the fish was recorded. Once the fish touched, they were again separated by the opaque divider and allowed to rest for five minutes. Each trial followed the procedure outlined above. After trials concluded in room temperature conditions, the water in the tanks was cooled to 15 degrees Celsius through the addition of ice cubes. The trials were again performed following the procedure outlined above. The means for each treatment were calculated and a paired t-test was run using the values derived from the experiment to test the statistical significance of the findings. 

Results:
The control treatment, Room Temperature Water, is comprised of the calculated average duration of aggressive displays prior to physical interaction of male bettas. The experimental treatment, is comprised of the calculated average duration of aggressive displays prior to physical interaction of male bettas in cold water. The average time before physical interaction for the males while in the room temperature water was found to be 122 seconds with a standard deviation of 24.759 seconds, while the average time before physical interaction for the males when in cold water was 143 seconds with a standard deviation of 28.024 seconds. Using these results, we calculated the t-statistic to be 1.297, which yielded a p-value of 0.325. This data is demonstrated graphically in Figure 1. 
Therefore, there was not a significant difference between the means of each treatment. Thus, there were no significant interactions among any independent variable, and macro habitat did not have a significant effect on the interactions between male bettas. 


Discussion:
According to the resulting data, it can be inferred that the change in environmental temperature did not significantly alter the agonistic behaviors of male bettas. Statistically speaking, the paired t-test disproved our hypothesis that the bettas would take longer to react in cold water, and thus supported the null hypothesis. The high p-value derived from the p-test determined that there was not enough statistical difference between treatment plans. Therefore, it can be concluded that the manipulation of water temperature does not effect the display of agonistic behaviors among male bettas. The results of the experiment performed in class reflected a similar result as seen in a study performed by Daniel Magoulick and Margaret Wilzbach, in which the effect of environmental temperature on the interspecific behavior of brook and rainbow trout were observed. This study examined the differential effect of temperature on aggressive interactions between brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, on the basis that abiotic conditions influence interactions among species. The study produced the same results in that the change in macrohabitat had no differential effect on the aggressive interactions between brook trout and rainbow trout [Magoulick: 2011]. Thus, they too concluded that the manipulation of environmental temperature did not have statistically sound evidence of a change in aggressive nature. The study of abiotic factors on the behavior patterns of species is important because the environment is always changing, and it is important to know how changes will impact intraspecific species interactions, interspecific species interactions, and overall ecosystems in the future. Therefore, regardless of outcome, more abiotic factors should be manipulated and the effects of such influences should be studied. 
	Possible error in this experiment could have included not cooling the water enough to bring about substantial environmental change for the bettas. Other influences could have included not long enough rest periods, too long of rest periods, or other outside stimuli.
