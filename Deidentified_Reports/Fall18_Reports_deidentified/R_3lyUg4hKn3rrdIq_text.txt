Title: Influence of Juvenile Hormone Over Insects

Abstract:
Hormones, which had always been regarded as the main factor within the development of an organism, has a vital role in the growth during each stage of their lifespan. Different types of hormones worked in different roles within the organism, especially for insects. This experiment generally focuses on the effect of Juvenile Hormone over insect in their metamorphosis and development in each stage of their lifecycle. The comparison between this experiment and existing researches are also mentioned.

Introduction:
Hormones have vital effects during the development of the insect, respectively in different stages of their lives, and affect insects themselves from different aspects.

One of the new methods of regulating the insect pest control was utilizing the different, distinctive effects of hormones on managing the biological mechanism of insect to an effective extent. Those were substances called “insect growth regulators”(also knowns as IGRs), have the effect of influencing insects on the level of physiological control, therefore generating the effect of controlling and regulating the survival of insects. [Tunaz, 2004]
JH, which was also known as Juvenile Hormone, plays an important effect in the lifecycle of insects. It mainly regulates the growing process of the insect when they are in the stage of the larva. To be specific, Juvenile Hormone regulates the processes include molting, pupating, and the development of organs that an adult moth, or butterfly required to have for survival in the natural environment. In our experiment, we investigate the effect of Juvenile Hormone over the Manduca Sexta (the tobacco hornworm), which was a species of larva that has a lifecycle for about 50 days from an egg to a developed moth, which was majorly regulated by JH. Thus, we hypothesized that an increase in the JH level would prevent Manduca Sextas from developing into the stage of pupating and becoming moths. In other words, those larvae who got treated by JH mimics will remain in the stage of larvae with continuous growth stronger than the one without JH mimics since the JH delayed there maturing process. We imposed JH mimics to the larvae through adding the JH mimics into their food to observe the effect of JH on larva (with the comparison to the control group)


Materials and Methods:
Materials: 8 Manduca Sexta that are in the same instar with roughly the same size, 2 container with 4 separated jars in each,  larvae foods, water, droppers and JH mimics (Methoprene, an IGR that simulate the effect of JH).

Methods& General Procedures:
1.    Divide 8 larvae into 2 groups of 4
2.    Place each larva into separated rearing jar.
3.    Feed the first group of larvae food with methoprene added(5 drops for each larva), and marked them as the treatment group.
4.    Treat the second group of larvae the food with 5 drops of water added
5.    All larvae will be kept in the same incubator in 25 ℃ with 12hr dark, 12hr light cycle.
6.    Record the weight of 8 larvae each day for 4 weeks. Subtract the weight to obtain the net change of weight of each larva.
7.    Compare the result obtained from the treatment group and control group, conclude the result.



Results:
The data and the graph of the net change in larvae’s wait for both groups demonstrated only a slight difference between the treatment group that received JH mimic and the control group without it. The general trend demonstrated in the graph only demonstrated the minor difference between the curves. Even if both of the curves demonstrated increasing trend as the time passes, the curve of the control group is relatively higher than it of treatment group for the majority of the graph. The two groups were not significantly differed from each other.


Discussion:
The result we obtained about the net change of weight of Manduca Sexta did not appropriately support the hypothesis that the impose of JH over the larvae will have relatively higher weight at the end of the experiment. The actual result we obtained from the experiment is that the larvae in the treatment group that did not receive extra JH mimic did not demonstrate a significant difference between the weight of themselves and those larvae in the control group. Instead, for the majority of the time, the net change in the weight of the larvae in the control group was relatively higher than it in the treatment group that contradicted to the original hypothesis. 
   Normally the increasing level of JH will cause the larvae to have relatively higher body weight but the delay or cease of metamorphosis process in the development of larvae due to its effect of preventing the precocious adult and let the larvae grew more stronger than those without the treatment of JH in their lifecycle. [Riddiford,2012] Based on the data we collected from the experiment, larvae 1, 2 and 3 in the treatment group experienced a drastic increase of the weight between day 4 and day 5, while the same situation happened later on in the control group as a whole starting from day 5 to day 6. The curve of average net change in weight of both groups expressed the results that were similar to what Riddiford  had introduced in the experiment of JH toward larvae but without the relatively higher body weight. Starting from day 5, the net change, in other words, the rate of change of body weight in control group exceeded the treatment group, which means the control group actually had relatively higher growth rate than treatment group did. 
   There was two possible error in the experiment that might impact the result. One of them was a death of larva 7 in the control group on the third day of the experiment, which impacted the calculation of the average net change of weight of the control group. Data between day 8 (09/13) and day 13 (09/18) was unavailable due to the influence of Hurricane Florence that impacted the area we were in. Therefore, we are unable to measure the change in body weight of larvae, which could lead to a biased conclusion of our experiment. For the further study, we planned to increase the number of experimental larvae in the experiment in order to avoid the existence of occasional result, and sustain the survival of all experimental units. We will extend the time of experiment to the length that typically allows larvae to enter in the pupating stage to observe a more obvious result of JH on keeping larvae stay in the naïve stage.
   In conclusion, the experiment of JH’s effect to the metamorphosis of Manduca Sexta has demonstrated its effect of regulating growth and metamorphosis in the growing stage of larvae, but further investigations from the aspect of larvae’s pupating process were still required.
