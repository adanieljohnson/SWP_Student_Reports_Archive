Title: The Effect of Caffeine on the Average Maximum Force of Contraction of the Gastrocnemius Muscle of Rania pipens

Abstract:
Rania pipiens are frogs native to Canada and the United States. This experiment was conducted to determine if the introduction of caffeine affects the average maximum force of contraction in Rania pipiens gastrocnemus muscles. Three frog legs were tested to find the average maximum force of contraction through electrical stimulation before and after injecting caffeine directly into the leg. The experiment concluded the difference in the average maximum force of contraction between legs without caffeine and with caffeine was statistically significent. 

Introduction:
There are thousands of myofibers that comprise the skeletal muscle of vertebrates and invertebrates. Motor neuronsâ€™ axons extend out of the spinal cord. The axons branch out into the muscle into several individual myofibers at points called neuromuscular junctions. In this experiment, the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve will be isolated in a Rania pipens frog leg. The gastrocnemus muscle was stimulated directly in the muscle. Caffeine is a psychoactive stimulating substance that is widely unregulated and immensely popular world wide[Olorunshola: 2011]. In this experiment, we are interested in the effect of injecting the gastrocnemus muscle with caffeine on the force of contraction. This will be quantified by measuring the grams of force of contraction of myogram peaks. In this experiment, I hypothesize the force of contraction with caffeine will increase compared to the controll circumstances.

Materials and Method:
This lab utilized the iworx software. First, the skin was removed from the frog leg, and the sciatic nerve was located by gently dissecting the inner thigh muscles. The leg was kept moist with frog Ringer's solution. The Achilles was located and cut from the bone to free the gastrocnemus muscle. The leg was then secured to the dissecting tray with pins. The gastrocnemus muscle was secured to the iworx force transducer. The probes were then inserted into the gastrocnemus muscle and 25Hz were delivered to the leg 5 times with approximately one second between each shock. The corresponding myogram was generated and the amplitude was measured. Then, the gastrocnemus muscle was injected with 0.1Ml of caffeine solution. The leg was again stimulated with 25Hz five times in the same manner as before with approximately one second between each fire, and the myogram was generated. The amplitudes of the peaks were then obtained. This same procedure was then repeated with two other frog legs. A one tailed matched pair t test will be performed to determine the significance between the differences in the force of contraction with versus without caffeine.

Results:
Three match pair t_tests were conducted to determine the significance between the differences in the force of contraction with versus without caffeine. The results of the t_tests are as follows; Leg 1: (t= 265.32, d.f.=4, p= 1.21E-09); Leg 2: (t= 322.95, d.f.=4, p= 5.52E-10); Leg 3: (t=33.53, d.f.=4, p=4.72x10-6  ). The t values of legs 1 and 2 were higher than leg 3 because the differences in the force of contraction were greater between the two conditions than leg 3. The peaks of the myograms for the legs without caffeine had significently higher amplitudes but had a smaller maximum force of contraction. The average maximum force of contraction for each leg is displayed in Figures 1-3. When the legs were injected with caffeine, the leg entered chemically induced tetany. The amplitudes of the myogram peaks were much smaller than without caffeine, but the maximum force of contraction was much higher with caffeine.

Discussion:
The results of the three matched pair t_tests indicate there is a significent difference between the average maximum force of contraction with caffeine and without caffeine. Figures 1, 2, and 3 also demonstrate there is a significent difference in the average maximum force of contraction for the two conditions. The average maximum force of contraction is higher when injected with caffeine because the gastrocnemus muscle enters chemically induced tetany upon the introduction of caffeine. When the muscle was further stimulated with an electrical stimulus, the maximum force of contraction increased even more. The compounding of the chemically induced tetany and the electrical stimulus made the force of contraction greater in the presence of caffeine than without. Caffeine reduces the voltage threshold of the ryanodine receptor. This causes more Ca2+ to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum[Kong: 2009]. As a result, more Ca2+ binds to more troponin pulling off more tropomyosin revealing more actin binding sites. This increase in actin binding sites allows for greater muscle contraction. This data supports my hypothesis that the force of contraction will increase with caffeine was introduced to the muscle.
