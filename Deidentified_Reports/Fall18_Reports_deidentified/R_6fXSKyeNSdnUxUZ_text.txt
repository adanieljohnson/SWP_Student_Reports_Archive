Title: Effects on Mass of Manduca sexta That Ingested the Hormone Precor

Abstract:
The study’s main objective was to discover if there was a relation between an elevated amount of juvenile hormone and growth by mass in the Manduca sexta species. The hormone precor was used to simulate juvenile hormone. The controll group of the species was given ten grams of food with ten drops of water. The experimental group was given ten grams of food with ten drops of precor. Both groups had similar habitats. The results found that the controll and experimental group weighed an average of 7.0165g and 5.0648g, respectively. A two sample t_test found that there was a statistical difference in the controll and test group. In conclusion, the hormone precor decreased growth rate in the Manduca sexta species.

Introduction:
The Manduca sexta species is a major pest on many farms and gardens in its larval stages. The species mainly destroys tobacco, tomato, and potato crops. While Manduca sexta destroy crops in their larval stages, adult Manduca sexta cause no issues. On the contrary, adult Manduca sexta are beneficial because they are good pollinators. Larger farms use pesticides to deter or kill Manduca sexta. Smaller Manduca Sexta need to consume a smaller dosage of pesticide for it to work properly [Byron: 2017]. Juvenile hormone controlls growth in Manduca sexta, as well as other biological processes [Noriega: 2014]. The purpose of this experiment is to find the relationship between the hormone precor and mass of Manduca sexta. If Manduca sexta have a diet that consists of precor they should grow at a slower rate.


Materials and Method:
This hypothesis was tested with a controll group of four Manduca sexta and an experimental group of four Manduca sexta. The Manduca sexta used in each group were all chosen for similar size. Two containers with four separate compartments were used as the Manduca sexta’s habitat. One container was solely for the controll group, while the other container was for the experimental group. Three holes were poked in each compartment so the Manduca sexta could breath. The species were kept inside of an incubator. The controll group was fed every other day with ten grams of GLM mixed with ten drops of water. The test group was fed every other day with ten grams of GLM mixed with ten drops of precor. All Manduca sexta were weighed every day. A one tailed two sample t_test and an alpha value of 0.05 were used to determine statistical difference.

Results:
A two sample t test yielded a p_value of 1.4 x 10-5. Since this p_value is less than 0.05 the null hypothesis is rejected. There is a statistical difference between the controll and experimental group. Graph 1 shows the controll group had a mean mass of 7.0165g and the experimental group had a mean mass of 5.0648g.


Discussion:
From the results in this experiment, the hypothesis, precor slows growth by mass of the Manduca sexta species, was supported. Precor mimics the natural hormone juvenile hormone. Juvenile hormone regulates growth speed in the Manduca sexta species. Once the Manduca sexta experimental group consumed the precor, their growth slowed down because the effects of juvenile hormone were intensified. Graph 1 shows the differences in average mass of the controll and experimental group. Other researchers found that a change in juvenile hormone had no effect on weight for locusts [Beenakkers: 1974]. This difference in results was most likely caused by the use of two different species. The results of this experiment show that when Manduca sexta consume precor their growth is slowed. This is very beneficial for agricultural pesticides. If precor is mixed with the pesticides used to exterminate Manduca sexta, the pesticides would be more successful. The smaller the Manduca sexta the less pesticide it has to ingest to be exterminated. If the pesticides are mixed with precor then the Manduca sexta will be smaller, therefore they will have to ingest a smaller amount of pesticide to be exterminated.
