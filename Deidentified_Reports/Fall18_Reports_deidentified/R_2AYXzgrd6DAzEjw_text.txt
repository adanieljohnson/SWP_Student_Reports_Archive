Title: Male Betta splendins fish are significently less aggressive when hungry

Abstract:
This experiment was conducted to see how hunger affects the aggressiveness of Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendins). These fish serve as a good model organism because they show obvious signs of aggression, are easily bred, and readily available. The hypothesis for this experiment was that fed fish will show more aggression than hungry fish because they have more energy to expend. Three different trials were run observing the agnostic behavior of a fed fish versus a hungry fish. Statistical analysis determined that hungry fish were significently less aggressive than fed fish. This is likely because fed fish can afford to expend more energy with aggressive behavior.

Introduction:
The fish serving as the model organism for this experiment is the Siamese Fighting Fish (Betta splendins). Betta splendins is a good model organism because it is easily bred and readily available [Braddock: 1955]. Siamese Fighting fish were originally found in freshwater ponds of Southeast Asia and are currently also in pet stores around the world [MacLaren: 2018]. These fish show two different types of agnostic behavior: broadside movements and facing movements. The expression of agnostic behavior over territory boundaries allows individuals exclusive access to resources (e.g., food, mates, and nesting sites) that are important for both reproduction and survival [Lynn et. al: 2007]. Each type has three different movements that show increasing aggressiveness. Broadside movements have pelvic fin pointing, tail beating, and tail flashing. Facing movements have erect pectoral fins, spreading of the operculum, and protruding of the branchiostegal membrane [Simpson: 1968]. The focus of this study is on how hunger affects the aggressive behavior of these fish. This question is being asked because food is a constant variable in the ecosystem and its effects on behavior are important to the study of ecology. The hypothesis was that fed fish will show more aggression than hungry fish because they have more energy to expend.

Materials and Method:
This experiment was conducted in three separate trials. In each trial a hungry fish and a fed fish were put in the same tank, separated by glass, and their behavior was observed. Their behavior was quantified by assigning point values to each behavior. For broadside behaviors, 1 point was assigned for pelvic fin pointing, 2 points were assigned for tail beating, and 3 points were assigned for tail flashing. For facing behaviors, 1 point was assigned for erect pectoral fins, 2 points were assigned for spreading of the operculum, and 3 points were assigned for protruding of the branchiostegal membrane. Each observation trial lasted 5 minutes. After recording the behavior, two sample, one-tailed t_test was used to determine if the behavior was significently different in hungry fish.

Results:
The observatory period determined that the fed fish (97.6 ± 16.7) was much more aggressive than the hungry fish (22 ± 9.5). Both groups had relatively small variation. Statistical analysis determined that there was a significent difference in aggression between the two groups. When comparing the two means, the fed fish was more than four times more aggressive on average than the hungry fish, as you can see in figure 1. (t-value=6.79, d.f.=4, p_value=.001)

Discussion:
The results received in the experiment support the hypothesis. This is because fed fish will have the energy necessary to participate in aggressive behaviors, while hungry fish do not have the necessary energy to display these behaviors [Hogan: 1974]. These findings have broader implications such as knowing what time of the day and what time of the year Siamese Fighting Fish will be least aggressive, depending on the food sources at that time. These findings are also consistent with what we see in other biological models, for example many bird species become less aggressive when deprived of food [Hinde: 1969]. This experiment can be compared to the results from the [Hogan: 1974] study which tested the choice of Betta splendins to eat or display aggressive behavior. Their results determined that hungry fish would eat while fed fish would display aggressive behavior. While similar to this former experiment, our experiment focused on once the fish has consumed the food, how it then affects their aggressive behaviors. Although our results were significent, there was one possible source of error in our experiment. Because the fish had been used for two weeks straight by multiple lab sections, they might have become habituated with other fish and therefore would have been less aggressive than in an ideal setup. If this study was to be built upon, it would have to be done so in nature. The natural habitats of these fish should be studied to see when the food sources are at their highest and at their lowest, and confirm that this corresponds with the level of aggression seen in the population.
