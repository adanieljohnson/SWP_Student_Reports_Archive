Title: Affects of Extended Exposure to Juvenile Hormone on the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta

Abstract:
Metamorphosis for the Manduca sexta, or “Tobacco Hornworm”, is mediated by the two hormones Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). In this experiment, the effects of JH on the growth and development of the Manduca caterpillar were examined over a period of fifteen (15) days. Two test groups were created, one that received JH mimic and one that did not. The caterpillars were checked every day and length was used as a measurement to tell the overall changes in the caterpillars. It was hypothesized that if the Manduca caterpillars were given the JH mimic, then after fifteen (15) days the controll group would be different from that of the JH mimic group. The results confirmed that in fact there was a difference between the Control group and the JH mimic group, but this difference was proven to be insignificent by the two-tailed p_value test. Due to the results being inconclusive and insignificent, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed. To better this experiment, more samples (Manduca caterpillars) need to be tested and the experiment needs to be carried out for a longer period.  

Introduction:
It is known that the metamorphosis of the Manduca caterpillar is controllled by the levels of juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysterone (20E) within the caterpillar. For a Manduca to initiate metamorphoses, JH levels drop below a certain level and a rise ecdysterone called the “commitment pulse” occurs. It is immediately following this drop of JH and commitment pulse that the caterpillar enters metamorphoses. (Nijhout: 1975) But what if the drop of JH never occurs or is delayed? To answer this question, we have designed an experiment that will prevent the decline of JH levels within Manduca caterpillars. In this experiment a JH mimic was used to prevent the decline of JH within the Manduca caterpillar. If the JH levels never drop, then it is reasonable to believe that the lengths of the Manduca caterpillars that were exposed to JH levels will be different from that of the Manduca caterpillars that were not exposed to the JH mimic. 

Materials and Method:
The first part of the experiment involved collecting eight (8) Manduca caterpillars of differing sizes to be split into two groups. Four (4) caterpillars were randoMly chosen to be part of the “Control” group that did not receive the JH mimic, and four (4) caterpillars were chosen to be part of the “JH mimic” experimental group that was administered the JH mimic. Before splitting the caterpillars up, each were measured for initial length. This measurement is needed to compare the overall change in length from the beginning of the experiment until the end. Each Manduca caterpillar was given 10g of food initially, the controll group receiving 3 drops of water in each portion of food, and the JH group receiving 3 drops of JH mimic in each portion of food instead of water. The caterpillars were kept in two (2) plastic containers, each having four (4) separate cells for the caterpillars to live in. The plastic containers were placed in a temperature-controllled box that remained around room temperature for fifteen (15) days. Each day, the lengths and any additional observations were made and recorded and food was prepared following the same steps as stated before if food was needed. At the end of fifteen days (15) the final lengths of the caterpillars were recorded and the difference in length from the initial length and the final length of the caterpillars was also recorded. Averages for both the “Control” group and the “JH mimic” group were also taken and compared. We then calculated a p_value to conclude whether the results were significent. 

Results:
From Figure 1 it can be confirmed that both the Control group and the JH mimic group changed in size over time. The Control group had an average change in length of .275 cm and the JH mimic group had an average change in length of 2.525cm. Figure 2 confirms that the caterpillars in the JH mimic group changed in size much more visibly than the caterpillars of the controll group. However, after calculating the p_value in Figure 3 using the results found in this experiment, the p_value was found to be .06069. 

Discussion:
From the results, it can be concluded that there was, in fact, a difference in the average sizes of Manduca caterpillars between the Control group and the JH Mimic group. The two-tailed p_value being great than .05, however, means that the difference was insignificent. Due to the p_value being greater than .05, it cannot be said with certainty that adding the JH Mimic to the food was the cause of the differences between the two groups and that it was not due to random chance. Due to the results being inconclusive and insignificent, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed. JH works together with ecdysterone (20E) to controll the growth and development of the Manduca caterpillar. The amount of JH that the caterpillar has is highest around its 1st-3rd instar. At around the 4th and 5th instar, JH levels drop and 20E levels spike, signaling the start of pupation. For pupation to occur, JH levels must drop below a certain level. (Johnson: 2018) A study done by Rountree and Bollenbacher out of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill confirmed that Manduca caterpillars that were treated with additional JH three (3) days into the experiment had a delay in pupation of one (1) day. (Rountree & Bollenbacher: 1986) This supports our results in that the caterpillars who constantly consumed food containing JH did not pupate at all. 
The results of this lab, although inconclusive and insignificent, were a step in the right direction to answering the question of what would happen if JH hormone levels never dropped. If there was an error in this experiment, it was involving the measuring of the caterpillars. The amount of human error possible involving the action of measuring each of the caterpillars every day is enough to raise concerns. Weight would have been a much better measurement than length due to the ability of a computerized scale to eliminate most if not all human error involved. 
Due to time and resource constraints with this lab, this experiment was not carried out to its potential. It would have been ideal to either carry the experiment out until either all the caterpillars died or completed metamorphosis, to get a definitive answer on what affect JH had on the caterpillars’ lives. The sample size also needs to be larger, this played a role in the p_value being insignificent, there simply were not enough samples. Also, the caterpillars not being all the same size at the beginning of the experiment could have had an effect on the average growth for the caterpillars.
