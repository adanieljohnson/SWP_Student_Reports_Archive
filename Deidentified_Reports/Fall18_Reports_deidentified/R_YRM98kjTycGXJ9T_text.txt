Title: The Effect of Seltzer Water on Photosynthetic Activity as Measured by Absorbance due to Reduction of DCIP

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is a vital process that includes converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose in the presence of sunlight.  Chloroplasts of Spinacia oleracea were isolated and suspended in both carbonated water and distilled water in order to analyze the differences in absorbance based on the reduction of DCIP.  Our results indicated that the carbonated water did not statistically significantly show a decrease in the percent change of absorbance when compared to distilled water.  This finding disagreed with our hypothesis as well as previous studies that were completed looking at the effect of CO2 on photosynthetic processes.  In a larger perspective, CO2 from the globe can affect photosynthesis; in today’s time, global warming from increased human activity may negatively affect photosynthesis in plants.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is used by plants in order to capture and store energy from the sun.  It is one of the most important metabolic processes carried out by living organisms.  Photosynthetic processes involve many reduction and oxidation reactions, and they pump protons across a lipid bilayer which generates a proton gradient to synthesize ATP.  An important and crucial component of the reaction is sunlight, which drives the reaction.  It also requires chlorophyll, Mn2+ ions, several electron transport complexes, and an intact phospholipid bilayer so the proton gradient can be produced.  During a photosynthetic reaction, the chlorophyll pigment allows different plants to absorb light [Johnson: 2018].
Photosynthesis occurs in three stages:  the first two reactions are known as the light-dependent which use absorbed protons to generate reducing power in the form of NADPH.  The light-dependent reactions also create the proton gradient used to synthesize ATP.  In the light-independent reactions, the enzyme RUBISCO uses ATP and NADPH to combine 1-carbon CO2 molecules with 5-carbon ribulose phosphate molecules to create 6-carbon glucose molecules.  The Hill reaction is known as the general process of electron transfer in the presence of active chloroplasts and light.  It is used in this experiment to measure the rate of photosynthesis; DCIP can be used as an alternative to NADP+ because it is also an electron accepter.  When DCIP is reduced, it turns from blue to colorless at 600 nm [Johnson: 2018].
The purpose of this experiment was to determine how carbon dioxide from seltzer water affects the activity of chloroplasts in spinach leaves, Spinacia oleracea.  Carbon dioxide is used in photosynthesis to produce glucose and ATP, the energy currency of the cell.  We hypothesize that if we add carbonated water to the chloroplasts of spinach leaves, the CO2 will combine with RUBISCO and reduced NADPH.  This will then combine ribose and glucose at a quicker rate so photosynthesis will increase.  In a recent study, researchers looked at the effects of CO2 on photosynthesis in tomato plants; results showed that the carbon dioxide increased the rate of photosynthesis [Lanoue: 2018].  This could be due to the equilibrium being shifted to produce more products due to an increase in reactants.  If photosynthetic activity increases, the absorbance will decrease.  Therefore, as mentioned previously, since CO2 is a reagent in the reaction of photosynthesis, the increased amounts of carbon dioxide from carbonated water will drive the reaction to produce more product in order to achieve equilibrium.


Materials and Methods:
We placed a mortar & pestle, a medium-sized beaker, and 3, 50 ml centrifuge tubes into crushed ice to make it cold.  The large central veins were removed from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and were to the cold, and dry, mortar along with 10 ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0).  The spinach was grinded with a pestle until it was a thick paste.  We then added an extra 10 ml of grinding buffer to the spinach slurry and strained it through three layers of cheesecloth into the cold beaker.  We transferred the green liquid to a chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuged it at 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 3 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  We poured the supernatant out of the tube into the second chilled 50 ml centrifuge tube.  We were careful NOT to transfer the debris at the bottom of the centrifuged tube.  We centrifuged the 50 ml tube containing chloroplast suspension at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  The supernatant was poured into a clean 50 ml tube without disturbing the pellet.  We added 20 ml of grinding buffer to the undisturbed pellet and suspended it with a transfer pipet.  We placed 10 ml of the re-suspended chloroplasts and 10 ml of distilled water in a 50 ml tube.  In another 50 ml conical tube, we placed 10 ml of the re-suspended chloroplasts and 10 ml of seltzer water.   Both 50 ml tubes were centrifuged at 2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius.  We poured off the supernatant and re-suspended both chloroplast pellets by putting 10 ml of grinding buffer in each tube. 
Eight large test tubes were labeled and placed in a tube rack.  The two blank test tubes consisted of 4 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5).  The six experimental test tubes consisted of 6 mL of distilled water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of reaction buffer.  We turned on the spectrophotometer, and set it to measure at 600nm.  Once test tubes were prepared, we added 200 μl of the enriched chloroplasts, prepared previously, to all tubes.  The chloroplasts suspended with distilled water were placed in the 3 test tubes labeled “Chloroplasts, with Distilled Water” as well as one of the blank tubes.  The chloroplasts suspended with seltzer water were placed in the 3 test tubes labeled “Chloroplasts, with Seltzer Water” as well as the other blank tube.  Each tube was mixed immediately after adding chloroplasts, and then transferred to cuvettes.  The spectrophotometer at 600nm was blanked using the corresponding blank tube (it was blanked after each time interval).  Then, we immediately measured the absorbance of all the samples.  Over a total span of 30 minutes, the absorbance of each sample was taken every 10 minutes.  These results (of raw data) were then compared using an independent one-tailed t-test, with equal variance, in order to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between chloroplasts treated with carbonated water and chloroplasts treated with distilled water - the alpha was set to 0.05.  


Results:
As shown in Figure 1, one can see that the chloroplasts treated with carbonated water steadily decreased in percent change of photosynthetic activity at an absorbance of 600 nm.  However, when running a one-tailed test with equal variance, the chloroplasts treated with carbonated water did not show a statistically significant decrease in the percent change of photosynthetic activity when compared to the control, distilled water (t = 1.065, df = 5, p = 0.17).  The means of percent change for distilled water are as follows:  16.39, SD = 0.11 at 10 minutes, 31.44, SD = 0.17 at 20 minutes, and 45.15, SD = 0.23 at 30 minutes.  The means of percent change for carbonated water are as follows:  11.53, SD = 0.06 at 10 minutes, 22.77, SD = 0.05 at 20 minutes, and 27.95, SD = 0.06 at 30 minutes.  


Discussion:
In order to gain a better understanding of our results, we performed an independent one-tailed t-test with equal variance.  The calculated p-value of 0.17 lead us to reject our hypothesis, as shown in Figure 1.  We hypothesized that the increased carbon dioxide from the carbonated water would increase the rate of photosynthetic activity which would cause the percent change in absorbance to be much higher for the chloroplasts treated with carbonated water than for the control being chloroplasts treated with distilled water.  However, as shown in the results, the chloroplasts treated with carbonated water had a lower percent change in absorbance than the distilled water, but it was not statistically lower (t = 1.065, df = 5, p = 0.17).  The decreased percent change of absorbance indicated that less photosynthetic activity occurred.  This finding completely contradicts our original assumptions as well as a recently completed study.  This study showed that increased CO2 in Rice npp1 caused the plant to display rapid growth [Inomata: 2018].  This could have been due to an increase in photosynthetic activity.  Although our results do not agree with previous studies completed by measuring the effects of CO2 on photosynthetic activity in Spinacia oleracea, we can assume that excess CO2 does still have an effect on the photosynthetic activity in plants.  Globally, CO2 may become an even greater problem due to global warming; therefore, it is important to consider the effects of carbon dioxide on the rate of photosynthesis.
