Title: The Effects of Tamoxifen Citrate of Physarum polycephalum

Abstract:
Physarum polycephalum is a multinucleated organism that uses chemotaxis and other processes to identify its surroundings and also as a means of finding food. In our experiment, we observed the effects of tamoxifen citrate on Physarum polycephalum. We hypothesized that Tamoxifen citrate would inhibit the movement of Physarum polycephalum. But due to the Physarum polycephalum moving into a dormant state, we reach inconclusive results.

Introduction:
Plasmodia of Physarum polycephalum are large multinucleated cells that can extend hundreds of centimeters. (Dussutour et al:2010)This specimen’s cytoskeleton is composed of actin microtubules and has the ability to absorb nutrients with its tendrils to be cognizant of its surroundings. (Vallverdu et al:2018). These components allow Physarum polycephalum to move towards to more nutritiously dense areas for survival. Previous studies conducted by Vallverdu on Physarum polycephalum concluded that Physarum is a prime example of the amalgamation of cognition and computation in a minimally conscious organism.[Valverdu et al:2018]. The research was done by Dussutour, where Physarum polycephalum was observed under 35 different diets, composed of different variations of protein and/or carbohydrates,  suggests that Physarum polycephalum preferred diet is one composed of carbohydrates rather than ones of protein, this was only to a certain degree that did not exceed 60 g·L−1. Slime molds expand across a greater area on more diluted diets, thus increasing the surface in contact with the food and compensating for nutrient dilution. [Dussutour et al:2010]. More specifically in this experiment, we will observe the signal pathways that allow for Physarum polycephalum to move. The main pathway we will be observing is IP3, which is a second messenger molecule produced by a  phospholipase C (PLC).[Matveeva:2010] IP3 binds to a receptor on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. When it binds to its appropriate receptor, Ca+2 channel opens in the smooth ER. The calcium ions then bind to calcium regulated proteins. The presence or the absence of the calcium can either stimulate or inhibit their activity.[Matveeva:2010] Diacylglycerol activates a protein kinase called Protein kinase C, that controls other proteins much like PKA. For our experiment, we observed Physarum polycephalum’s movement in the presence of tamoxifen citrate, known protein kinase c inhibitor. We hypothesized that the movement of the Physarum polycephalum’s movement towards the oatmeal pellets placed will be inhibited by the tamoxifen citrate.

Materials and Methods:
Twelve water-agar plates were prepared by removing a 1*1cm cube of agar from each plate with a scalpel. Foreceps were also used to move pieces of physarum to their according plates and sterilized with 95% ethanol accordingly. Plates 1 through 6 were control plates. A 1*1 cm cube of physarum was placed in the water-agar plate. In plates 7-12, 5 mL of diluted tamoxifen citrate was put in the plates to absorb for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, the excess tamoxifen citrate was absorbed with a Kimwipe. 1*1 cm cube of physarum is placed in the water-agar plate. After 16 hours, physarum movement was measured with a microscope. A two-tailed t-test was conducted.

Results:
The expected results were that the Physarum in the control group would move to the oatmeal placed around it. But for the experimental group, there would still be a movement towards the oatmeal but at a slower rate due to the presence of tamoxifen citrate.



Discussion:
It is known that Physarum polycephalum thrives in dark and highly humid conditions to remain a Plasmodium. Due to the Physarum polycephalum progressing to a dormant state known as sclerotium.[Furuhashi:1998] This occurs due to the Physarum going through the stress of not being in highly humid conditions and significant light exposure. In research by Furuhashi demonstrated the actin microfilaments that give Physarum its ability to move have been phosphorylated, hence inhibiting movement and going into a dormant state. Due to the Physarum moving into a dormant state known as a sclerotium, the signaling pathways it commonly uses such as the IP3 and Diacylglycerol which are second messenger molecules are also not functioning.[Matveeva:2010]
