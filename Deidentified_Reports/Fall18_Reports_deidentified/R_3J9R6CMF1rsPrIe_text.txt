Title: The Effects of Light Energy on Phototaxis in Physarum polycephalum (italicized) 

Abstract:
	This study aims to determine the effects of different wavelengths of light on signaling during phototaxis of Physarum polycephalum. Physarum take in and respond to stimuli in their environment through the use of signal transduction pathways. This experiment measured the phototaxis of physarum, which were each placed under various light energy conditions including red, blue, and white light and compared to the positive control of no light. The study placed emphasis on blue light as it is lower in energy than red or white light. The study mainly focused on how the physarum would respond to blue light since it thought to be less harmful than red or white light. It was hypothesized that the Physarum polycephalum placed under the blue light would not experience a large amount of phototaxis over 24 hours in comparison to the groups placed under red and white light with the groups placed under no light. The hypothesis was rejected. 


Introduction:
	We will use Physarum polycephalum as a model to determine how different energies of light affect certain signaling patterns in multicellular organisms. Physarum are multinuclear slime molds that exhibit patterns of rhythmic contraction [Nakagaki: 2000]. In a similar fashion, when physarum sense signals in their environment, they respond to it and move accordingly. To obtain food, physarum tend to stay in a single mass instead but they move their whole bodies in response to light. Even though physarum have various signaling pathways, G protein coupled receptors and ion coupled receptors generally control the behavior of the physarum. The signaling events for the physarum includes a specific stimulus that is activated by a receptor, the release of a second messenger, and the binding of the second messenger to an effector [Johnson: 2018].Throughout this lab, we observed phototaxis, which involves the movement of our motile physarum in response to the different light conditions. The physarum will either move towards the light which represents positive phototaxis, or the physarum will move away from the light, which represents negative phototaxis [Sineshchekov: 2002]. Physarum can move towards or away from specific since they have a general understanding of their directionality due to their reproductive cycle [Johnson: 2018].
	We wanted to know how the physarum reacts to different types of light including blue, red, and white light. Blue light has peak wavelength at 415 nm, white light has peak wavelength at 600 nm and red light has peak wavelength at 660 nm. Blue light falls within the UV spectrum of light, while red and white do not. [Papageorgiou: 2002]. Physarum will generally move away from ultraviolet light as it is known to be harmful to these slime molds and their genetic codes [Hato: 1976]. Based on our background knowledge and previous studies, we made our hypothesis. We believe that the physarum will move away from the red and white light and experience more negative phototaxis than blue light as red and white are not within the color spectrum for visible light and will be detected as a threat to the physarum. Blue light does fall within the color spectrum for visible light and thus we expect the physarum to be more inclined to move towards the blue light. Since blue light falls within the color spectrum and is closer to ultraviolet in the UV spectrum than white light, the physarum should not need to move away from the blue light. We hypothesize that the Physarum polycephalum placed under the blue light will not experience as much phototaxis as the groups placed under the red light and the groups placed under the white light in comparison with the groups placed under no light due to the fact that blue light falls within the color spectrum that is not harmful to Physarum. 


Materials and Methods:
	To begin the experiment, we obtained a 100 mm stock plate of Physarum growing on oatmeal-water agar from our TA at the beginning of the laboratory period.  We also obtained 12 PDA plates and labeled them in groups of 3 as “No Light,” “White Light”, “Red Light”, and “Blue Light”. We used PDA plates instead of oatmeal-water plates to eliminate confounding stimuli so that the physarum would respond to the light stumble only [Johnson: 2018]. On the back of the plates, we drew a line dividing the plate in half. On that line, we drew three squares approximately 1 cm  x 1 cm spaced equally along the line. We then turned the plate over, with the cover facing up. Between steps of the experiment, we used ethanol to sterilize the instruments. Next, we opened the Physarum stock plate, and used the spatula to cut a line through the middle of the plate. We cut half of the plate of agar into 1-cm blocks. When we finished slicing up half of the stock plate, we used a kimwipe to remove anything on the spatula, then returned it to the ethanol. We opened the stock culture plate, and removed one, 1 cm x 1 cm square of the Physarum culture. We choose a block that had a piece of oatmeal that was well colonized with bright yellow polycephalum. Next, we used the forceps to gently lift the block out of the stock plate and opened our labeled plates. We slide the piece of agar and oatmeal from our stock culture into one of the wells that we just cut in our water agar plate. We then moved the blocks of Physarum into the other two empty slots. Finally, we opened the container of oat flakes, and gently tapped out 5-6 flakes onto the surface of the water agar. Following this step, we then wrapped each plate in foil with a small hole to allow for some light, making sure to keep the plate face up. Next, we placed each group in an incubator with a light bulb appropriate for each group’s name (red, blue, and white bulb). We placed the no light group in a drawer in the classroom. We returned after 24 hours to observe our phototaxis plates and to see if the Physarum had grown towards one or both of the flakes of additional food. We ran an ANOVA test with two degrees of freedom to test the differences between distance traveled for each group with an alpha of .05. 


Results:
	As evident by the ANOVA test we ran with 2 degrees of freedom and an alpha of .05, we found that the f-ratio value is 0.19211 and the p-value is .898856. Tukey’s HSD (alpha=0.05) described that there was no significant difference between our experimental groups and the control group. Figure 1 portrays the average distance travelled (cm) by the Physarum in blue light (as shown as a negative value in the graph) and the positive phototaxis of the red and white groups (as shown as a positive value in the graph). The Physarum traveled an average of -0.34 ± 1.03 cm away from the light in blue light, and in white light, the Physarum traveled an average of 0.81 ± 1.21 cm towards the light. The Physarum traveled an average of 0.27 ± 4.89 cm toward the red light. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was rejected which is portrayed by our statistically insignificant result. We hypothesized that the Physarum polycephalum placed under the blue light will not experience as much phototaxis as the groups placed under the red light and the groups placed under the white light in comparison with the groups placed under no light since blue light has a lower wavelength and is not harmful to the slime mold. We believed that the Physarum would have generally moved away from ultraviolet light as it is known to be harmful to these slime molds.  Following this same idea, we thought that the physarum would not need to move away from blue light as it falls within the color spectrum with a peak wavelength at 415 nm. Overall, the results suggest that blue does not limit phototaxis significantly more than that of red or white light. The average distance traveled in centimeters for each of the groups at their respective light energies is illustrated in figure 1. The negative values in figure 1 represent the physarum moving away from the light source, which is negative phototaxis. In a similar fashion, the positive values in figure 1 represent positive phototaxis, or when the physarum would move towards the light source. The positive control group experienced no light and this is an indication with an issue of physarum plates or experiment that resulted in physalis not responding. This is why the positive control is absent from figure 1. Not much is known about the mechanism the Physarum takes in response to different light wavelengths. More experiments should be performed to understand this mechanism. 

	One study similar to ours sought to understand the multiple food pathways that Physarum can take and focused on the behavioral intelligence of the polycephalum as they obtain multiple food pathways [Nakagaki: 2004]. This is related to our study in that it explains how the slime molds moves to obtain nutrients as it receives a positive stimuli to do so. In a study similar to our own, phototaxis of polycephalum of true slime mold Physarum polycephalum was studied as a function of light wavelength and intensity [Hato: 1976]. The lab reported that the blue light region induced negative taxis, and the red light region led to positive taxis. This study supports the background behind our original hypothesis. Sources of error could have prevented the blue light from inducing less phototaxis for the Physarum under the blue light. Sources of error include the lack of growth of the physarum which affected the rate at which our physarum moved. The lack of growth was most likely due to a systemic problem with the cultures provided. Next time, the lab will make sure the physarum are younger and that they do not die. Other sources of error include potential contamination of the agar plates, which would have affected the movement of our physarum. Finally, the lightbulbs could have been a source of error if one of them were not set at the same power as the rest, which could have affected light energy. This study expands beyond slime molds and explains signaling in a greater sense such as signaling events in multicellular organisms. Even though our hypothesis was rejected, this study should be repeated again in the future as it is pertinent to understanding the stimuli that affects the signaling pathways of multicellular organisms.
