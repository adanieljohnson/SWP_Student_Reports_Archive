Title: The effects of pH on chloroplasts photosynthetic rate in Brassica oleracea var. sabellica leaves

Abstract:
We used the leaves of the Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, otherwise known as kale, to analyze how shifting the pH of a chloroplast will affect photosynthesis. As photosynthesis is the primary way for plants to obtain energy it is relevant in many facets of life. To analyze this process, we took advantage of DCIP as it has the structure so that it starts dark blue but as photosynthesis occurs it gradually becomes clear. Using this we tracked the photosynthetic rate by measuring the absorbance o our various samples and calculating the percent change to get a general understanding of how it shifted every 10 minutes. We found that the acidic sample greatly increased the absorbance, while the basic sample did the same but to a lesser degree. These results suggest that the proton accepting, and donating properties of acids and bases interacted with the proton gradient in the ATP synthesis of the process, preventing photosynthesis from occurring.

Introduction:
All living organisms must extract energy from external sources. Plant do this by capturing and storing energy from the sun through the process of photosynthesis. The stored energy is released by glycolysis in the cytoplasm, and respiration, which occurs in the mitochondria. Both photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two of the most important metabolic processes done by any living cell. During photosynthesis chloroplast absorb solar radiation, which in turn excites electrons to leave the carrier molecule, forming a proton gradient. This triggers a chemical reaction where the high energy electrons are stored as NADPH and the proton gradient that powers ATP synthesis. This reaction is used to help synthesize glucose from CO2.  All of the ATP that is produced by the chloroplasts is consumed in the process of the glucose synthesis(Alberts et al. 2002). Measuring ATP production is rather difficult. However, previous experiments show that electrons are given to many acceptors, not just NADP+. With these alternative acceptors the process became much simpler to evaluate. The alternative electron acceptor used in this experiment was 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP). Oxidized DCIP is a dark blue compound that when reduced becomes colorless. This change in color allows the correlation between absorbance and photosynthesis (Johnson 2016). We used the leaves of Brassica oleracea var. sabellica, kale, as it had large green leaves that hold plentiful amounts of chloroplasts and is a farm crop.  With this general process in mind we began to think of how changing the pH level that the chloroplast was in would change the rate of photosynthesis whether it was basic or acidic. The answer is important as this applies to any water that could possibly be contaminated or even to acidic rain caused by pollution. All of these changes to water’s pH will directly affect crops and other plant life. We believe that the acidic pH will stop photosynthesis altogether as it will disrupt the proton gradient that drives the process of ATP synthesis forward while the basic pH will hep stimulate the process as it will accept the protons increasing the gradient, thus furthering the reaction.

Materials and Method:
To begin the experiment, pack a mortar and pestle, beaker, and 3 50Ml tubes in ice. While those are cooling remove the large central vein from a kale leaf. Next dry the mortar and pestle and add the leaves to it. Add 10Ml of grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) and grind until it is a paste. Once again add 10Ml and mix until the paste becomes more fluid. Strain the entire volume of green slurry through three layers of cheesecloth into the chilled beaker and then pour the beaker into a 50Ml centrifuge marked A. Place in centrifuge at 2800rpm for 3 minutes. Take the supernatant and pour into another 50Ml centrifuge tube, this time marked B and spin for 10 minutes. Once done pour the supernatant out. Take the leftover pellet in tube B and add 15Ml of grinding buffer. Label three new 50Ml centrifuge tubes as pH 2, 6.5, and 10. Add 5Ml of the resuspended pellet from tube B as well as 5Ml of the respective pH to each tube. Let the tubes interact for 10 minutes then place in centrifuge and spin at 2800rpm for 10 more minutes. While the three sample are being spun, label 13 test tubes as blank and 1-12. The blank will be made of 8Ml of water and 2Ml of the reaction buffer(100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5). Test tubes 1-12 will be made of 6Ml of water, 2Ml of 130mm DCIP, and 2Ml of reaction buffer. Then once all of the spinning is done add 100µL of the chloroplasts to the test tubes. 1-3 will get the pH of 2, 4-6 will get the pH of 6.5, 7-9 will get it from the pH of 10, and 10-12 will get no chloroplasts. Once the chloroplasts are added the initial absorbance is recorded at 600nm using a spectrophotometer. The absorbance is then recorded every 10 minutes for 30 minutes.


Results:
In order to determine if the various levels of pH affected the rate of photosynthesis the absorbances were measured and on 10 minute intervals compared the intial measurment to determine how much they changed. We did this so that the percent changes could be compared to the controll and evaluate if the DCIP was becoming clear or if it was remaing its dark blue hue. We found that the acidic pH contiually raised the absorbance over time. While the basic remained consant around 0% change until the last cycle. The neutral pH can also be seen to maintain a siMlar change for the first two but hten dramatically shift to a greater absorbance. This means in the last step all of the phtosythesis stopped. We completed a T-test on the avaerage absorbances of the sample against the no chloro controll and it was shown to indeed be statistically significent.

Discussion:
With the previously stated results it can be seen that with the acidic pH the chloroplasts did not go through photosynthesis as their absorbance only got darker and darker. However, the hypothesis concerning the basic pH was not supported as at no point did it accelerate the photosynthesis of the chloroplasts. As previously stated the most likely reason for acidity to stop the reaction is that it would greatly affect the proton gradient that is so critical in the process of photosynthesis as it would provide its own extra protons shifting the gradient away from what it was meant to be. As for the basic pH sample it seems to have a lesser negating affect, but still prevented the chloroplasts from going through photosynthesis as their absorbance only teetered around the initial and then became much darker. This could be due to the same reason as the acidic sample, it interacts with the proton gradient. As a base in the most general term is a receiver of a proton, then the gradient could have been absorbed by the base, just at a slower rate than how the acid altered the reaction. These results can be seen in a similar light as previously it was found that charged ions would interrupt the process when at a shifted pH(Huber 1979). In another study it was found that the variation of pH had very similar affects as the higher more basic had little affect while the acidic pH sample significently changed(Saenen et al. 2014). As I have no way of explaining why in the last 10 minutes the absorbances changed so dramatically from their previous trends it is possible that extra absorbance was recorded due to the cuvettes used being smudged or being placed in the spec 20 improperly. For future experiments it would be best to conduct this experiment with a larger amount of trials to further find if that was an error or if that is a turning point in the reaction. With all of this in mind looking forward this experiment can provide insight into what possible pollution will do to crops, or even provide ways to enhance photosynthesis in new and unique ways.
