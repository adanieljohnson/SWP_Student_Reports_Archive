Title: The Mass-gain Effect of Juvenile Hormone Imitator on Manduca Sexta Larvae.

Abstract:
The main objective of this experiment was to determine if precor, a juvenile hormone imitator, affected the mass gain of developing Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis being tested was if Manduca Sexta have additional precor in their diet then they will weigh more than those who do not. This is because additional precor will ensure that the commitment pulse cannot occur, and the caterpillar will be uncertain of if it is big enough to start to pupate. This would lead it to continuously grow in mass and ultimately outweigh the control group. This experiment was conducted over the course of fourteen days and with two trial groups, the control and the treatment with additional precor to their diet. It was determined after the fourteen days by using a two-sample t test that the difference between both groups final and initial masses was not significant enough to accept the hypothesis. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta are caterpillars that partake in the holometabolous life cycle where they undergo four major life stages and body reorganization during pupal metamorphosis from larvae to adult [Johnson:2018]. They have five larval instars that are separated by molts depending on hormone levels. Two major hormones involved in the development of the Manduca Sexta are Juvenile Hormone (JH) and Ecdysterone [Johnson: 2018]. JH is hormone that is typically found to prevent metamorphosis of insects, in this experiment Manduca Sexta [Williams: 1956]. Until about the fourth instar, JH is relatively high and regulates molting types during development. However, around the fifth instar there is normally a decrease in the JH levels and an increase in Ecdysterone. This is when a commitment pulse occurs which indicates to the Manduca Sexta that it is large enough to begin pupating to turn into a moth [Johnson:2018]. This then brings up the scientific question: Will Manduca Sexta who receive additional JH to their diet weigh significantly more in difference than those who do not? It is important to ask this question because it will help determine whether JH does affect the molting cycle and if so how. To answer this question, we set up an experiment that has a control and treatment group with JH imitator, in this case precor. This then leads to the hypothesis being tested as if Manduca Sexta have additional precor in their diet then they will weigh more than those who do not because they will be uncertain of how large they are, will continue to grow, and not pupate. 

Materials and Methods:
We first started this experiment by selecting eight Manduca Sexta that were similar in size and then divided them into two groups. Next, we prepared the living quarters for the caterpillars by puncturing two air holes into each of the four cells within the container and properly labelling them. After that, we placed each caterpillar into their own cell with their respective diets. The control group, four caterpillars, received ten grams each of regular diet with five drops of water while the treatment group, the other four caterpillars, received ten grams each of regular diet with five drops of precor. The Manudca Sexta were then left in the same incubator and light cycle for fourteen days. Every other day, the food was changed, and the caterpillars were weighed for observation. We recorded the data for the two weeks and then found their difference in mass by subtracting their final mass by their initial. Lastly, a two-sample t test was used to determine whether the difference was significant or not. 

Results:
Some general trends that were seen throughout the experiment are that, regardless of the group, the masses of the Manduca Sexta fluctuated. Over the two weeks, the caterpillars gained and lost weight, but in the end, the treatment group had only gained mass from the initially recorded mass while the control group had caterpillars that gained and lost mass from the initially recorded number. By the end of this experiment, all the Manduca Sexta in the control group had pupated while the treatment group continued to develop but never reached a state of pupation. General trends that are presented in this table and figure are that the treatment group appears to have a higher average difference in mass than that of the control group. This information was then used to calculate the two-sample t test which indicated that the two-tailed p value was .267.

Discussion:
In this experiment, it was determined through observation and collected data that the presence of five drops of precor in a Manduca Sexta’s diet was not significant. Through the two-sample t test, it was calculated that the control group was not statistically different than that of the treatment group because the p value was greater than .05. Although the group with additional precor had a higher average in difference of mass, it wasn’t significantly more than that of the control group. This means that the hypothesis that was generated is rejected because the Manduca Sexta with precor in their diet did not weigh significantly more than the control group. As seen in Table one, it was observed that the treatment group had only growth from the initial state while the control group had growth and reduction from the initial masses. Even though this observation suggests that the treatment group did weigh more in the end, the difference between the two just was not enough. Also, by looking at figure one, the treatment group did grow more; but since the error bars overlap around one gram in average difference, it can be suggested that hypothetically they could have been the same in difference making it not significant.  
These findings are like H. Frederik Nijhout and Carroll M Williams who tested JH as a trigger for pupation. In their experiment, they discovered that the Manduca Sexta will stop producing JH when larvae attain a weight around five grams [Nijhout:1974]. However, in our experiment, the treatment group continued to grow past five grams and did not begin to pupate. This is because even though their body may have stopped producing JH, they were still receiving the imitator precor that allowed them to continue to grow rather than start to pupate like the control group. This leads to an alternative explanation of our experiment that suggests that the presence of JH does more than affect mass gain of larvae but also the process of metamorphosis.
The next step for this study would be to look at different amounts of precor in the diet of the Manduca Sexta to determine if there can be a significant difference. This would be done by having several treatment groups with varying drops of precor in the diet but would otherwise follow the same procedure as this experiment. This is important to know for IGRs, insect growth regulators, and more. By knowing the effects of varying amounts of JH, it can help distinguish substances used that will affect the growth and development of not only Manduca Sexta but other insects as a pest control [Johnson: 2018]. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that additional JH in insects does affect growth and development but is not significantly different than those who do not acquire extra.
