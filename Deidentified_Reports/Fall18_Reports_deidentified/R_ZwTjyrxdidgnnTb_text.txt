Title: The effect of light and dark environments in Betta splenden aggression

Abstract:
The experiment below follows the observation of the aggressive behavior of the Betta splenden  fish when placed in an unfamiliar environment. The hypothesis for the experiment was that Betta splendens will display more aggressive behaviors when conditioned in darkness. Betta splendens are more commonly known as Siamese fighting fish. A group of four pairs of Betta splenden fish were retrieved, two pairs to be conditioned in light and two pairs to be conditioned in the dark. The fish were separated and conditioned for about 5 hours. Once finished, the fish conditioned in light were observed first, having their aggression measured based on the number of aggressive behaviors they displayed and based on the length of time their red mane was displayed. The fish conditioned in darkness were observed next, their aggression measured the same way. Both figures showed fish conditioned in light being more aggressive. The one tailed two sample t-test did not yield significant results (t-stat = .52, p-value = 0.310) showing that the change of environment did not lead to increased aggression.

Introduction:
Organisms have a variety of interaction with their environment. These interactions that animals perform cannot be observed in human terms. This applies to all their behaviors, including the aggressive, reproductive, and defensive behaviors. Organisms can be forced into a specific behavior dependent on the situation, an organism may take to a fight or flight response. When the fight response is chosen, organisms prepare to display aggressive behaviors. One animal that typically displays the fight response is the Siamese fighting fish, or Betta splenden, which displays multiple aggressive behaviors, especially towards their own species, which is known as intraspecific behavior [Johnson: 2016 ]. These behaviors include broadside movements which are made up of (in order of increasing aggressiveness) pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing and facing movements which are made up of (in order of increasing aggressiveness) erect pectoral fins, and then protrusion of the branchiostegal membrane [Johnson et al.: 2016]. Due to the dynamitic nature of environments, this experiment will focus on how the Betta splenden react in terms of aggressiveness when placed in a different environment. With these behaviors in mind, it can be  hypothesized that Betta splenden fish placed in a dark environment for five hours will display more aggressive behaviors than those that are not and left in regular conditions. 

Materials and Methods:
For this experiment, eight individual fish will be retrieved. These fish will then be split into pairs, two pairs to be conditioned by light and two to be conditioned by the darkness. The pairs that will be conditioned by darkness will be placed into a cabinet with no light filtering in, separated by a glass and an opaque plastic divider. In order to observe the aggression, two things will be observed: the number of aggressive behaviors shown and the length of the time the red mane is flashed, both in the span of 5 minutes. These observations will be made simultaneously. After this, the data will be recorded and compiled into a chart of averages. A one tailed two sample t-test was conducted in order to see if there was any significant statistical difference between the control and treatment group. 

Results:
The experiment did not yield significant results based on the statistical data gathered . When analyzing figure 1 and figure 2, it can be observed that fish conditioned in the dark did not display an increase in aggressive behavior  (Figure 1) (Figure 2). Fish that were conditioned in light displayed more aggressive behaviors according to both figures. The one tailed two sample t-test  did not show significance (t-stat = .52, p-value = 0.310 ). 

Discussion:
Based on the results, the hypothesis that Betta splenden fish placed in a dark environment for five hours will display more aggressive behaviors than those that are not is rejected.  The fish that were conditioned in the dark for about five hours did not display a pattern of increasing aggressiveness (Figure 1). A pattern of heightened aggressiveness is found in the fish that were conditioned by light. The statistical tets shows that the results are insignificant . It is important to note that pair 1 from the light conditioned group displayed more aggression than any other pair. One limitation was that the fish may not have had enough time in the dark. With more time, the fish may have had more time to try and adapt to their new environment, 5 hours may have only provided a temporary change. For future experiments, a longer time should be used such as 24-48 hours. This may give the Betta splenden more time to attempt to adapt to their environment. Other experiments that could be performed may be a way to reward the fish for seeing which could be more aggressive, as it is known that the fish can be conditioned to display or not display their aggressive behavior [Adler: 1963]. Aside from this, perhaps it can be studied how multiple mirrors would draw a reaction from their intraspecific behavior as it is known they get aggressive when noticing their own species members [Arnott: 2016]. Betta splenden open many options to ethologists.
