Title: The Effect of Sunlight on Wild Pea Plant Growth

Abstract:
Resource allocation is the plant's ability to allocate recourses to where they are most needed and to increase the plant's ability to receive an increased amount of resources in the future. Environmental variables such as sunlight and soil nutrients can affect the way organisms allocate resources. Through resource allocation, the organism responds to changes in these variables. In the following experiment, we look at the effect low and high levels of sunlight have on the growth of pea plants. While the data shows the trend we were hoping for (higher mean mass for plants given more sunlight), the data is statistically insignificent due to the results of our two sample t_test. This report will analyze what brought us to this conclusion, possible reasons for this insignificance and present new ways to utilize our data. 

Introduction:
This experiment will analyze the effect of sunlight on the wild pea plant. Pea plants are part of the Fabaceae family which also includes Legumes and are native to the Mediterranean region [UConn Home and Garden Education Center, 2017]. Typically, these plants are grown in woodlands, chaparral and scrub habitats. Like other plants, they require light energy to grow, however, they are able to survive with just low lighting. For healthy pea plants, it is best to grow them in an area that receives six to eight hours of sunlight per day. In terms of resource allocation, typically, when a plant needs light energy it will allocate resources to the leaves so that they have a larger surface area to absorb light energy. The plants may also allocate resources to their stems so that they can grow taller and be closer to the source of light energy. In this experiment, we tested the effect of sunlight on the growth of pea plants. We hypothesized that if the pea plants receive more light they will grow more successfully and therefore have a higher mean mass.

Materials and Method:
To test our hypothesis, we established two different environments. Environment 1 had access to full sunlight and environment 2 had access to minimal sunlight. We created the effect of minimal sunlight using a shade tarp. Each environment consisted of a tray with 6 compartments. Within each compartment, we planted 5 pea plants (30 seeds in total). We kept constant the type of soil, the type of pea plant, and the amount of water given for each of the compartments in both environments. We watered the plants by holding the spout over each compartment for three seconds. We watered and monitored the plants for approximately 1.5 weeks. After 1.5 weeks passed we began to take our measurements. We determined the overall success of the growth of the plants by taking their individual masses and calculating the mean mass. For each of the 6 compartments, we randoMly selected 3 pea plants and weighed them individual while recording their mass into our raw data. After doing this for both environments, we calculated the mean mass of all 18 plants we measured for each environment. We also found the standard deviation within the data for each environment to show us the disparity between our results. For our statistical data, we conducted a t_test. We ran a two-sample t_test because we were comparing the means of two groups of data. The p_value from this test showed us the statistical significance of our data. 

Results:
Our experiment showed that the mean mass for the plants in environment 1 was 1.572g and the mean mass for plants in environment 2 was 1.466g. The standard deviation for environment 1 was 0.32 and the standard deviation for experiment 2 was 0.33, therefore there was a similar disparity between data in each group. Even though the mean mass for environment A was larger, our results did not support our hypothesis as our calculated p_value (0.34) was greater than 0.05. Since our p_value was greater than 0.05 we established our data as statistically insignificent. 

Discussion:
Overall, our results did not support our hypothesis that environment 1 would have a significently larger mean mass because it was exposed to more sunlight. Our hypothesis was not supported because our calculated p_value from the two-sample t_test was greater than 0.05, (0.34&gt;0.05) therefore rendering our data as not statistically significent. This outcome may have occurred because since the experiment was so short-lived (took place over 1.5 weeks) it is possible that the plants had enough nutrients left in their seeds to grow and therefore did not rely heavily on photosynthesis for resources. Since the pea plants were able to be supported with nutrients from the seed, not having full access to sunlight did not affect the growth of the plant to a point where it was statistically significent in our data. Furthermore, it is possible that the minimal sunlight condition was sufficient light energy for the plants to grow considering pea plants are able to grow in minimal sunlight conditions [UConn Home and Garden Education Center, 2017].
 In addition, in our initial observations of the experiment, before we collected data we saw that the roots of the plants in environment A (more sun) were longer than the roots of the plants in environment B (shade). It is possible that this is because the plants in the sunlight were receiving sufficient light energy and therefore decided to allocate resources to the roots of the plant in order to get more nutrients from the soil. In our observations, we also found that the shoots of the plants in environment B were mostly taller than the shoots of the plants in environment A. In order to explore these observations and take our experiment further, we could collect data from our plants needed to calculate the root-shoot ratio for each environment and then use these values to determine the health of the plants. 
Overall, the allocation strategies used by the pea plants in our experiment is unclear because the data we collected proved to be statistically insignificent. In other studies, shifts in the allocation patterns of plants that have been placed under changing environmental conditions have been proven to maximize plant growth [Fakhri, Grace: 2008]. Therefore, we can predict that with further observation, by conducting a longer lasting experiment, or by taking different measurements, pea plants will exhibit similar behavior in that they will use resource allocation to increase their growth and be more fit.

Environment 1 has a greater mean mass than environment 2 (1.572g&gt;1.466g). The error bars on the graph are based on the standard deviation of environment 1 (0.32) and the standard deviation of environment 2 (0.33). *************************************************************************
