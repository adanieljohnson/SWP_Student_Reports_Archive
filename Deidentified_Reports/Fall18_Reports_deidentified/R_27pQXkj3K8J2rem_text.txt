Title: The Effects of pH on Rate of Photosynthesis in Spinach Leaves

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants use sunlight to synthesize energy from carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis produces oxygen as a byproduct. There are many stages in photosynthesis, but oxidation reduction is one that can be affected by many environmental factors. In this experiment, chloroplasts were centrifuged with various pHs such as 6.5, 4, and 10, to see how different pH affect photosynthetic rate. Assays were made and DCIP electron receptor was used to measure the DCIP reduction as a decrease in light absorbance at 600nm. Based off results, it was concluded that oxygen reduction is optimal at pH 6.5.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants capture and store energy from the sun. It is usually seen in two parts, the light reactions and the dark reactions. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts absorb solar radiation in chlorophyll molecules. Electrons excited by captured solar energy leave carrier molecules, and electron excitement triggers a chemical reaction that cleaves water to release electrons that replace the ones that recently left the carries, and generate a proton gradient. Then a H+ gradient is formed to power ATP synthesis. The electrons on NADPH and the ATP are then used in chemical reactions that synthesize 6-carbon glucose form 1-carbon carbon dioxide molecules. All of the ATP generated by reactions of photosynthesis is consumed during the reactions of glucose synthesis [Johnson: 2016]. In this lab, we will be using the 6-dichlorophenol idophenol (DCIP) electron receptor to measure the DCIP reduction as a decrease in light absorbance at 600nm. DCIP assays can be used to determine if environmental conditions, chemicals, and other factors affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis [Johnson: 2016]. In this particular lab, we will focus on answering the question: How does pH affect reduction reactions required for photosynthesis in spinach leaves? Because pH is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, it is fitting to experiment with pH and photosynthesis because of the H+ gradient in photosystem II, as well as the fact that extreme pH can denature enzymes and prevent the plants from photosynthesizing. It is important that we carry out this experiment because in the natural environment, in some circumstances like acid rain fall, plants could be affected by altered pHs, and this could affect crop growth and production. In a similar experiment dealing with plant growth and pH, it was evident that citrus plant survival was insensitive to low pH, so we are interested in how various pHs affect the absorbance in our experiment [Long:2017]. Other plants such as C. acidophilia are well adapted to low pH and relatively low primary production rates were not a result of pH stress [Gerloff-Elias: 2005]. Conversely, plants such as S. fuscum and S. magellanicum had decline in their photosynthetic rate as pH increased [Haraguchi: 1996]. In the experiment, our positive controll will be pH 6.5, and our negative controll will be tubes without chloroplasts. We hypothesize that the chloroplasts centrifuged with the buffer solution of pH 6.5 will have the most electrons moved during photosynthesis because the reduction of oxygen reaction will increase, showing more photosynthetic activity than the chloroplasts centrifuged at other pHs such as 4 and 10.


Materials and Method:
To start, a mortar, pestle, medium-sized beaker, and the centrifuge tubes were placed on ice. Next, the mortar and pestle were packed with four deveined spinach leaves. 10 Ml of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) were ground into the spinach until it was a thick paste with no large chunks of leaves left. 10 more Ml of grinding buffer was added and mixed with the slurry. Then, the slurry was strained through cheese cloth into the beaker and poured in a 50 Ml centrifuge tube. That tube along with a balance were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 200 x G (200 times the force of gravity; 1200 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) at 4oC. The pellet was collected and the supernatant was centrifuged again for ten minutes at 1,000 G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge), in order for the highest density of chloroplasts to be collected. Next, 15 Ml of grinding buffer were added to the pellet and it was suspended by stirring. 5 Ml of the suspended pellet were added to centrifuge tubes labeled pH 4, pH 6.5, and pH 10. Simultaneously, 5 Ml of the corresponding pH buffers were poured into the centrifuge tubes. They were left to sit for 10 minutes. Each tube was centrifuged again at 200xG for 3 minutes and poured into test tubes. There were 13 test tubes. One was the blank, 3 were pH 6.5, 3 were pH 4, 3 were pH 10, and 3 had no chloroplasts. To begin the assay, 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts were added to all tubes except the no chloroplasts tubes. 100 μl of pH 6.5 chloroplast mixture was added to the first three tubes. 100 μl of pH 4 chloroplast mixture was added to the next 3 tubes. 100 μl of pH 10 chloroplast mixture was added to the last three tubes. Along with the chloroplasts, water, 2 Ml of 130 mM DCIP, and reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, pH 6.5) was added to the tubes. The test tubes were mixed. Immediately, tube 0 was poured into a cuvette and the spectrophotometer was blanked at 600 nm. Each tube thereafter was poured into cuvettes and the absorbance of each tube was recorded. These absorbencies were recorded as time 0. The same method was done again after 10 minutes of direct sunlight. The absorbance of each tube was recorded and results were averaged and graphed. A standard two-tailed t_test was run to conclude the statistical significance of our results.


Results:
To determine which pH the reduction reaction would be optimal at, we measured the absorbance between pH 6.5, 4, and 10 at 0 minutes and at 10 minutes. We incubated chloroplasts in various pHs to and measured absorbance via assays. We found that after performing a two-tailed t_test our results were not statistically significent, but our data trends show that pH 6.5 is the optimal pH for photosynthesis [Figure 1]. The absorbance of all the pHs decreased, but the absorbance of the pH 6.5 decreased much more drastically than the other pHs. The negative controll, without the chloroplasts, also decreased, whereas the blank remained constant. It was interesting that the absorbance for the tube with no chloroplasts decreased after ten minutes, because there should have been no difference due to no photosynthetic activity occurring. There was a greater decrease in absorbance at pH 4 than pH 10, but neither compared to the absorbance after 10 minutes for pH 6.5.


Discussion:
Our trends in data support our hypothesis that the reduction reaction would be optimal at a pH of 6.5. Although our results were not statistically significent, they did show what we hypothesized to be valid, but we cannot reject the null hypothesis, because the purpose of the statistical analysis was to confirm the results were based on the change in variables we were testing. The absorbance decreased for each pH after sitting in sunlight for 10 minutes. A decrease in absorbance means in increase in reduction of oxygen, which implies an increase in photosynthetic activity. The reason why our results are not statistically significent is because the pH 4 absorbance and pH 10 absorbance still decreased in the ten minutes, just as the pH 6.5 absorbance did. If they had increased, or remained constant, it would prove that oxidation reduction is not occurring, and therefore photosynthesis is not occurring.  Not all plants have the same optimum pH for photosynthetic activity though. In a recent study by Olga Invers, it was concluded that the optimum pH for seagrass was around 8, whereas for spinach it was around 6.5 [Invers: 1997]. Although, most plants do have an optimum pH between pH 6 and 7.5 [Mendendez: 2001]. To continue experimentation, we could try the same experiment but with more drastic pH, or with different plants. It would be interesting to collect plants after acid-rainfall to determine if the low pH would affect the reduction process.  It would also be interesting to see at what point the enzymes are denatured and photosynthesis halts. A source of error in our experiment could have been one our data points. One of our tubes changed color significently, but none of the others did, so there might have been a mistake there. Overall the experiment was successful, and it would be fascinating to continue experimentation on this subject.
