Title: The Effect of Calcium on the Contraction Force of a Frog Leg

Abstract:
There are many processes that influence muscle contraction; we decided to look at calcium’s effect on it. We expected that if we added calcium to the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg, then the force of the muscle contraction would increase. However, our data showed that calcium does not increase the muscle contraction; it instead decreased the force. Yet, the p value was still significent meaning that it does have an effect, but it was not the one we hypothesized.

Introduction:
Model organisms are used in biology to help scientists understand biological processes through species that are widely studied. In this experiment, the model organism was a frog, specifically, the frog’s leg. We looked at the gastrocnemus muscle and the sciatic nerve. Nerve impulses are sent from the spinal cord to the neuromuscular junction. This causes the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and when ACh binds, the sodium channels are opened spreading the action potential through the fiber. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Johnson: 2018]. This calcium is necessary for the muscle contraction which causes the muscle fibers to shorten [Ruegg: 1992]. Due to great research, we know a lot about how muscles and muscle fibers work. But the influence of ions on these muscles and muscle fibers are less researched than the anatomy. We hypothesized that if we inject a frog leg with calcium, then the force of the muscle contraction will increase.

Materials and Method:
Initially, we obtained three frog legs, using each is its own experimental and controll. We began dissecting the frog leg by placing it on a dissecting pan, then pulling the skin down from top to bottom. We made sure to moisten with frog ringer’s solution and keep it moist throughout the experiment. We separated and freed the sciatic nerve by using dissecting needle and forceps. This procedure was repeated for all three frog legs. For the direct stimulation part of the experiment, we directly stimulated the nerve attached to the muscle. We placed the pin electrode on the sciatic nerve and recorded the results. We repeated this by changing the voltage to 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 V. This was repeated for each leg with adding 0.1 Ml of calcium and without adding calcium. Fatigue is counteracted by the addition of frog ringer’s solution. The paired t_test was used to compare the difference of the contraction force when adding calcium and not adding calcium in a frog leg. 

Results:
We chose the highest contraction value for each controll and then used the corresponding experimental value with it (Fig. 1). These six numbers were used in the paired t_test.
We saw that when calcium was added, the force of contraction was consistently about 0.1 V smaller than when no calcium was added (Fig. 2). The p value for the paired t_test was 0.0012. Our controll and experimental groups are statistically different from each other. 


Discussion:
It was statistically found that our hypothesis was not supported by the paired t_test because the average contraction force in volts was lower when calcium was added than when no calcium was added (Fig. 2). The statistically significent result means that our results were not random; however, it means that our results were significent in the fact that our hypothesis was not supported. There was an observable trend in our data: the addition of calcium decreased the force of contraction in the frog leg because it induced sustained tetanus [Ruegg: 1992]. This is seen in Fig. 2 in how the plotted added calcium points are below the no added calcium plotted points at relatively similar levels; the decrease is approximately the same. This shows that added calcium does have an effect on the contraction, it is just not the effect we hypothesized. This is because the frog leg already meets the threshold, so more calcium did not increase the contraction force [Johnson: 2018]. If we repeated this lab, we could alter our hypothesis to see how much of an effect the addition of calcium has on the decrease and muscle contraction and how it induces tetanus more quickly.
