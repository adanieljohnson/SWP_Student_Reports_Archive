Title: Effects of 0.1 mL of Caffeine on Strength of Muscle Contraction in Rana Pipiens Frogs

Abstract:
Rana Pipiens Frogs rely on electrical stimulation in order to contract their muscles. Electrical signals, either from an electrical probe, or the nervous system, causes the release of calcium in their muscles, resulting in cross-bridge formation, and a visible twitch or full contraction. Caffeine has been seen to promote the release of calcium in frog legs, resulting in a larger contraction of the muscle. Three frog legs will be used, each used as a control for 5 trials and an experimental group for 5 trials. Two of the experimental groups had a larger V2-V1, meaning they had a larger contraction with caffeine, however one group had a smaller V2-V1. A two-sample t-test determined the control and experimental groups were significantly different. The effects of caffeine on muscles did not become clear from this experiment, and further research is needed to determine the specific effects of injecting caffeine into Rana Pipiens’ legs.

Introduction:
Animals are able to move voluntarily due to skeletal muscle contractions. These contractions are controlled by nerves that innervate muscle fibers. Action potentials sent through nerves reach the axon terminal where they open calcium channels. The influx of calcium causes vesicles containing acetylcholine to be released and enter the synaptic cleft where they bind to receptors on muscles and initiate a graded potential in the muscle fiber. This induces the formation of cross bridges between the actin and myosin in the muscle fibers. These cross bridges are the basis of a muscle contraction. A single contraction is said to be a twitch. If the influx of calcium in the muscle fibers continues, the muscle continues to contract and is said to be in tetanus. Rana pipiens frogs follow this pattern of muscle contractions. The gastrocnemius muscle, similar to a calf muscle in humans, is stimulated by the sciatic nerve, which causes the muscles to contract. This muscle can also be stimulated directly with probes, which send electrical signals that mimic those that the sciatic nerve would send. Using probes, one can record the magnitude of the twitch and contraction, allowing you to see the level of tetanus achieved. Allen Isaacson and Alexander Sandow performed an experiment on Rana Pipiens, testing the change in contraction strength from adding 1 mm of caffeine directly into the frog leg and then stimulating the sciatic nerve [Isaacson: 1967]. Our experiment adjusts their experiment by instead injecting 0.1 mL of 1 mm caffeine directly into the gastrocnemius muscle, and stimulating the muscle directly instead of stimulating the sciatic nerve. Additionally, we will assess whether the contractile force, which is measured as V2-V1, increases or decreases. We predict this will cause multiple short twitches to occur and increase the contractile force we record.

Materials and Methods:
3 Rana Pipiens frogs were obtained at random. The first frog was stripped of the skin around it. The gastrocnemius muscle was identified and separated from the bone it was attached to. The muscle was cut at the Achilles tendon, ensuring part of the Achilles tendon came off with it. A string was tied tightly around the Achilles tendon with a loop on the end, and then attached to the BNC. This was adjusted so that the leg was 90 degrees to the top of the apparatus, and it was not being pulled too tightly or hanging too loose. The pin electrode was inserted into the muscle, with the black on top and the red on the bottom. Ringer’s solution was added to ensure the leg stayed moist. On the computer, a low amplitude was selected and fired. If a twitch occurred, we lowered the number, but if a twitch did not occur we increased the amplitude. Once a twitch occurred we determined the threshold. From here we fired 5 times and recorded the contractile force for each of the simulations. 0.1 mL of 1mM of caffeine was obtained in a syringe. It was injected carefully directly into the muscle. Once injected, we increased the voltage by 0.5 from the control and initiated 5 twitches. The contractile force for all of these were also recorded. This entire process was repeated of the next 2 frog legs. After obtaining our data, we conducted a paired t-test in order to determine if the difference in contractile force from the control and experimental groups were significant. 

Results:
All three frog legs we stimulated contracted with each stimulation during the control. After injecting caffeine into them the first and third time, the muscle swelled and became hard. When we stimulated it the muscle twitched slightly and quivered. When we injected caffeine into the second frog leg it did not swell as much and did not harden. When we stimulated the muscle, it twitched regularly. The first and third frog leg showed an increase in contractile force in the experimental group, while the second frog leg showed a decrease in contractile force in the experimental group. From a paired t-test we found our data to be statistically significant (t-stat= 2.77, df= 14, P= 0.015). 

Discussion:
 The results of this experiment indicate that injecting Rana Pipiens’ legs with .1 mL of caffeine causes the frog leg to significantly change its contractile force. The results of the control compared to the experimental values were found to be statistically different, but they were not all statistically different in the direction that we hypothesized. Injecting caffeine into the Rana Pipiens’ legs caused several short twitches to occur, however, it only caused the contractile force to increase in Frog 1 and 3 and caused it to decrease in Frog 2. When caffeine is injected into a frog leg, it causes calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, making the muscle contract. At this point, the muscle is in chemically induced tetanus, and tightens up. This is where we observed the muscle become rock hard in the 1st and 3rd leg, but not the 2nd. This suggests we may not have injected all of the caffeine into the 2nd leg, which resulted in the inconsistent results. When the muscle was already in tetanus, we stimulated it with probes, which caused any remaining unformed cross bridges to form. This caused the very small, wavering twitches that we witnessed. The contractile force of the 1st and 3rd legs increased by 0.316 and 0.471. This increase suggests that the caffeine caused the leg to contract again, while already contracting, resulting in increased tension in the leg. The contractile force of the 2nd leg decreased by 0.173. If not all the caffeine was injected originally, then the frog leg would not have been in complete chemically induced tetanus. When the leg was stimulated, there were still cross bridges that could be formed, resulting in a normal twitch of slightly less tension. A continuation of this study could copy Isaacson’s study of adding increasing amount of caffeine to the frog leg, but instead trying to find if there is an amount of caffeine so potent that the leg will not twitch at all even when it is stimulated [Isaacson: 1967].
