Title: Study of the Effects of Nitrogen on Mung Bean Growth

Abstract:
This lab report details an experiment exploring the effects of excess nitrogen on the growth and development of Mung Bean plants (Vigna radinta). We hypothesized that plants growing in a low nitrogen environment would have a lower root to shoot (R:S) ratio than plants growing in a high nitrogen environment. The data collected was analyzed using a two sample T-test, ultimately proving that there was no significent difference in the growth over two weeks of plants in low and high nitrogenous environments. 

Introduction:
In this experiment we decided to investigate the effect of nitrogen on mung bean growth. The mung bean (Vigna radinta) is indigenous to Asia and grows as an annual vine. We wanted to see how adding an excess of nitrogen to the plants nutrients would affect he growth of the mung bean. We hypothesized that plants growing in a low nitrogen environment would have a lower root to shoot (R:S) ratio than plants growing in a high nitrogen environment. We used a two-sample T-test to analyze our data to decide whether or not our data was significent. 

Materials and Method:
For this experiment we prepared 8 pots with soil and proceeded to plant 10-15 mung bean seeds in each pot. We planted this many seeds so that it would be guaranteed that at least some of them would grow to full size. After planting the seeds in the pots we labled four of the pots treatment and the other four pots controll and then placed them in the greenhouse. For the next 2 weeks we watered them and for the treatment group we added dissolvable nitrogen to the water to create a solution that the plants were then watered with. After 2 weeks we then harvested the mung beans by washing away the soil in a tap so as to damage the roots as little as possible. Once cleaned off we separated the plants, being careful to keep the plants separated by pot. We then measured the root and stem length as well as the weight of the root and stem. After the measurements we used a two sample T-test to determine if our findings were conclusive or not. 

Results:
After the two weeks of watering we ran into a bit of an issue. Due to external factors that we could not controll, all of our treatment groups seeds rotted as well as some of our controll group. We were still able to harvest most of the controll group and gather data from those plants, and used supplemental data for the treatment group. The results of our experiment showed that there was no significent difference between the treatment group and the experimental group in both length R:S ratio (P-value: 0.0567, DF: 52, T-Value: 1.609, Figure 2 and 3) and weight R:S ratio (P-value: 0.343, DF: 52, T-Value: 0.405, Figure 1 and 4). These results mean that our hypothesis is rejected because there was not a significent difference in the data collected. 

Discussion:
There could have been many factors that caused out plants to die, despite being cared for. These could be improper planting, not enough nutrients, or external temperatures being to extreme for growth based on location within the greenhouse, but the most likely factor is that they rotted or molded because of a microbe that was in the seed. Despite that set back we were able to acquire enough data to compare against our controll group. This data ultimately proved to be insignificent leading to the conclusion that the amount of nitrogen that we used did not cause a large enough on the growth of the plant. I think that this has to do with were the plant stores nitrogen. According to a study in 2014 done on lettuce, excess nitrogen is stored in the edible, or leafy portions of the plant, so there is not necessarily a tangible effect on the growth of the roots and stems of the plant. I believe that this is most likely true for the mung bean as well. Further study on the mung bean and the effect of nitrogen would be interesting if we focused more on the leaf development of the plant, comparing the leaf surface area and weight of plants in low and high nitrogenous environments.
