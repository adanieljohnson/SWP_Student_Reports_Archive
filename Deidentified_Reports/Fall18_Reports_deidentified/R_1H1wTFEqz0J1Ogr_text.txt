Title: The Effect of Cold Temperature and Room Temperature Environments on Time of Contact for Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Aggressive behavior is an essential component of competition and survival between animals in increasing fitness and dominating territory. This experiment analyzed factors that impact aggressive behavior eventually leading to attack for the Betta Splendens fish. Six fish were obtained and separated into three groups of two. Six trials total, three for cold temperature water and three for room temperature water were conducted, and the amount of time it took for attack and thus contact to occur was measured. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to analyze and compare the calculated mean time before contact between the two treatment conditions. It was hypothesized that cold water would delay the attack time for Betta Splendens compared to in room temperature water.  The collected data did not support the hypothesis, where cold water did not have a significant effect on difference in the mean time of attack for the fish. The effect of colder water thus did not have enough of a biological effect on the fish to significantly alter the behavior.

Introduction:
Aggressive behavior in nature is multifold in purpose, including increased fitness, territory dominance, and competition for resources and mates [Johnson: 2018].  Use of aggressive behavior allows for advancement of certain individuals over others in terms of the factors previously listed. In the aggressive behavior patterns of the Betta Splendens fish, escalating facing and broadside movements eventually lead to contact through directed attack [Johnson:2018]. This attack may then be ignored, matched, or the opposing fish may flee. Certain factors and reinforcements such as food, or amount of time between encounters of fish may impact the nature of aggression between fish [Hogan:1970].  In this experiment, the mean amount of time before aggressive contact between 3 groups of 2 fish in two different conditions of room temperature water and cold water was compared to analyze how differing temperatures of water may impact the rate of aggressive behavior leading to physical contact upon attack It was hypothesized that cold water would delay the attack time for Betta Splendens compared to in room temperature water.

Materials and Methods:
Six Betta Splendens fish were acquired and split into three groups of two. Each group was put through a trial in the room temperature water conditions, at 18 0C,  in which the fish were put together and the amount of time it took for an attack was measured. Ice cubes were then slowly added to the tanks holding the fish and temperature was monitored until it reached 15 0C. The same procedure was then repeated for the three groups under cold water conditions. The times were measured in seconds and the mean time was calculated for each condition. The data was analyzed using a two-tailed paired t-test to determine statistical significance between the two mean time values between the two treatment conditions. 



Results:
The mean time of contact for the Betta fish under room temperature water conditions was 122 seconds ± 24.75 seconds(Figure 1) and the mean time of contact for the Betta fish under cold temperature water was 143 seconds ± 28.02 seconds(Figure 1). There was not a statistically significant difference in the calculated means of the treatment groups (t-value=1.295, p-value=0.325, df=2), and the appearance of the fish during the different trials did not have any significant observational differences. 



Discussion:
The results of the study did not support the hypothesis of the experiment (Figure 1) (Figure 2), as well as the results of the statistical test as it did not yield a significant difference between times of attack of the two treatment groups. These results did not support the previously mentioned case studies, as the temperature of water did not correlate with a significant difference in behavior of the Betta Splendens fish under trial. It can thus be inferred that decrease in water temperature by a few degrees does not impact the amount of time of contact upon attack between aggressive Betta fish. In a study examining the effects of water temperature on survival of trout in basic life functions, it was found that colder water temperatures significantly decreased rate of survival of trout [Jonsson: 2010]. An additional study examining the ability to perform life functions such as territorial dominance also found that temperature of environment directly impacted abundance of fish populations over time [Kuczynski: 2017]. Evidence from these case studies contributed to the hypothesis originally formed as well as the suggested explanation  predicted for the experiment. Other factors in environment or directed stimuli do impact the aggressive behavior of Betta Splendens fish, however.  A recent study investigating the effect of the drug Fluoxetine on aggressive behavior of the fish yielded a significant difference in expression of aggressive behavior of the male betta fish being tested [Lynn:2007]. Thus, certain factors can and do exhibit significant alteration of behavior of Betta fish.  Investigating how these fish react in terms of temperature and environmental conditions is essential in that although these fish are domestic species in large proportions, optimizing living conditions and understanding impact of changes in environmental conditions to favor natural behaviors is important as this knowledge can be applied to the wild portion of the species in their respective environment. Furthering this experiment could include repeating it with significantly colder temperatures to see if extreme changes impact time of attack, or using different stimuli to understand what factors significantly alter aggressive behavior in these fish.
