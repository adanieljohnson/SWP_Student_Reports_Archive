Title: Aggressive Behavior of Betta splendins in Response to Change in Water Color of Environment

Abstract:
Animals exhibit aggressive behaviors in response to interaction with other organisms as a tactic for sexual selection and self-protection. Scientists conduct experiments to observe how environmental factors may affect aggressive behavior in different species. This experiment focused on aggressive behavior of male Betta splendins, a species known for its dramatic displays of aggression in both interspecific and intraspecific interaction. The experiment tested how the color of the water in the environment of B. splendins influences aggression during intraspecific male-on-male interaction. Behavioral displays of four B. splendins in natural, red, and blue water were observed and recorded using a point system. It was hypothesized that B. splendins would exhibit more aggressive behavior in red water and less aggressive behavior in blue water. Results of the experiment showed that B. splendins exposed to red and blue water environments exhibited less aggressive behavior than those in natural colored water, but the difference in behavior was not significent.


Introduction:
Aggression is an adaptation evolved in animals that plays a significent role in reproductive success and survival [Johnson: 2018]. Aggression is a behavior commonly studied by scientists in the context of sexual selection and as a means of protection against predators. Displays of aggression can be an organism’s response to the presence of individuals within or outside of their own species. Betta splendins are often used as subjects of research on aggression because they exhibit very specific and easily observable agnostic behaviors in response to intraspecific interaction. These behaviors are classified into broadside and facing displays, and range in aggression based on perceived severity of the threat [Johnson: 2018]. Studies have been conducted to understand how environmental conditions such as water color can influence behavior in fish. One study found that tank color had an effect on stress levels and feeding rates of common carp fish, where results showed that white colored tanks increased metabolism in fish originally adapted to black backgrounds [McLean et al: 2008]. The same study found that Nile tilapia exhibited increased respiration on white backgrounds than on black, green, yellow, blue or red backgrounds [McLean et al: 2008]. This experiment tested the effect of water color on aggressive behavior in male B. splendins. It was hypothesized that changing the water color of the environment of two red B. splendins to red would increase aggressive behavior during male on male intraspecific interaction, and that changing the water color to blue would decrease aggressive behavior.


Materials and Method:
In order to quantify aggressive behavior in the B. splendins, a ranking/point system was devised based on relative aggressiveness of specific behaviors and the duration of the behavioral display. Aggressive behaviors in B. splendins are categorized into two groups: broadside and facing displays, with three behaviors in each category. The three broadside and three facing displays were each ranked on a scale of 1-3, 1 being the least aggressive and 3 being the most aggressive. The point values for those behaviors were multiplied by 1.1 if the duration of the displays exceeded 1 min, 1.2 if it exceeded 2 minutes, and so on. The sum of the point values for each individual was used to quantify aggression in each environment. The controll trial was conducted by placing two male B. splendins in a tank separated by a transparent barrier. For the first treatment group, the two fish were placed together in a tank with 7 drops of red dye, and for the second treatment group, the two fish were placed together in a tank with 4 drops of blue dye. For each trial, aggressive behavior was observed and recorded over a 5-minute period, followed by a 3-minute rest period. All three trials were repeated for a total of 2 pairs of B. splendins. The values for aggressiveness were calculated for each fish numbered 1-4 in each environment, and an ANOVA statistical analysis test was used to analyze the data

Results:
Data from this experiment displayed in Figure 1 shows that B. splendins in red and blue water exhibited less aggressive behavior than in natural colored water. The values for average aggression factor for fish in red (2.4+/-4.8) and blue (2.3+/-2.96) water were similar, and the average value for the controll group was slightly greater (3.58+/- 2.53). Fish #2 demonstrated more aggressive behavior than the other fish in all trials. Results of ANOVA statistical analysis show that there was no statistical difference among any of the three trials (f(11)=0.158, p=0.856). Error bars in Figure 1 show the standard deviation in the results for each trial.

Discussion:
The results of this experiment refute the hypothesis that aggressive behavior of B. splendins would increase if placed in an environment of red water, and decrease in an environment of blue water. Though the data shows a lower aggression factor in blue water than in the controll environment, there is not a significent difference between the values, thus the hypothesis must be rejected. It can be concluded that the color of the water in the environment does not have a significent effect on aggressive behavior in B. splendins. It was observed that fish #2 exhibited generally more aggressive behavior than the other fish in all three environments whereas fish #1, #3, and #4 all exhibited variation in aggressive behavior, leading to inconclusive results. These observations lead to the possible conclusion that displays of aggressive behavior in intraspecific interaction among B. splendins are more dependent on the innate aggressive tendencies of individuals than the physical characteristics of the environment. A possible confounding variable in the experiment is that the addition of food coloring made the water darker and inhibited the ability of the fish to identify the presence of another male, lowering the potential for aggressive behavior. Though the results of this experiment were inconclusive, another study found that Oreochromis niloticus, or Nile tilapia, living in a blue tinted environment have significently higher reproductive rates than those living in a white tinted environment [Volpato: 2004]. These results show that though the color of the environment may not have an immediate effect on behavior of B. splendins, there may be an effect on long term behavior patterns such as reproduction. This concept can be applied to the scientific field of marine environment conservation. Ethologists may conduct similar experiments over longer periods to observe the long-term effects of human disruption to marine environments on the behavior of various species in that habitat.
