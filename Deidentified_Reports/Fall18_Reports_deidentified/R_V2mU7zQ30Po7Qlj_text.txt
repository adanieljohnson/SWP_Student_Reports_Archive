Title: The effects of Azadiracthin in Manduca Sexta over a two week trial  Abstract

Abstract:
The main hormones that effects the Manduca Sexta are prothoraciotropic (PTTH), juvinile hormone (JH)and ecdysterone (20E).  The experiment was done using azadirachtin, a hormone blocker and to block the 20E (ecdysterone)and keep them as larva. We hypothesized that the caterpillars would not pupate but continue to grow. We predicted that the azadirachtin would stop the commitment process.We tested the caterpillars by feeding the controll six drops of distilled water in the food given and six drops of azadiracthin in the experimental group. Our controll group t value (1.0175g +/- 1.18)  was greater than our experimental group’s p value(-1.4325+/-0.36).


Introduction:
The main hormones thats effect the Manduca Sexta are prothoraciotropic (PTTH), Juvinile Hormone(JH)  and ecdysterone (20E). We focused on ecdysterone which is regulated by ptth. Ecdysterone regulates timing of molting during insect development and additional functions in adult insects. If 20E is eliminated entirely, the animals die. To slow the growth of the insect we can use an inhibitor called azadirachtin to prevent the insects from starting the commitment pulse. The commitment pulse is when there is a temporary rise in 20E and JH levels are slighly low .There is a second slight rise in 20E in the insect which the commitment pulse. In a study on Locusta Migratoria they put azadirachtin in neem trees which the Locusta eat. The study showed using moult inhibition is due to an interference with the endoctrine system rather than to altered feeding bahviour.
[K.-P.Seiber,H.Rembold: 1983] Our project allowed us to use the hormone blocker azadirachtin and try to keep the pests from pupating into adult moths. Keeping them larva helps tobacco farmers keep their tobacco from being destroyed. Will the hormones blocker keep the pesticides from reaching pupation? We hypothesized that azadirachtin would prevent the Manduca Sexta from reaching its commitment pulse but would continue to grow. 


Materials and Method:
Over the course of 2 weeks, we monitored the growth of 8 caterpillars grouped into 4 controllled and 4 experimental. We separated the replicates into two containers – one for controll and one for experimental – with a separate compartment for each caterpillar. The experimental caterpillars were given 6 drops of the blocker hormone azadirachtin, and 10 grams of food daily. We gave our controll group 6 drops of distilled water in 10 grams of food daily. Each day we weighed each separate caterpillar with a scale and in grams and measured them in millimeters.. The caterpillars  were stored in an incubator over-night and food in the refrigerator. Data recorded in google sheets and a two-tailed T-test was run on the weight to compare the controll versus the experimental group.


Results:
There were only two caterpillars, from the experimental group, in the experiment that did not pupate. One of the two caterpillars died while it was pupating. All of the controll caterpillars pupated within a couple of days into the experiment.. The controll group increased in weight while the experimental group either remained at the same weight or lost weight while managing to pupate later than the controll group. The mean of the controll caterpillars was 1.0175g +/- 1.18 and the mean of the experimental caterpillars were (-1.4325+/-0.36)
Weight: t_stat=3.94, d.f.=6. P=0.003.


Discussion:
In the end of the experimental, the hypothesis was nt supported but the statiscal data was . We stated, the experimental group would not pupate but would continue to grow, if given 6 drops of food in 10 grams. We were proven wrong because two of our four caterpillars reached the commitment pulse. We observed that there was a difference between the two groups in length and weight. The controllled Manduca were gaining weight daily. The experimental Manduca weighed the same or less than on each day. The experimental group weighed less, but still pupated at a faster rate than anticpated. This caused for the t-value and p_value to be significently different. In a study on Rhodnius prolixus larvae, they conducted an experiment where Trypanosoma cruzi were found inside the stomach and azadirachtin blocked the development of protozoan intermediate forms.[M.R. Cortez et al :2012] This could be why these insects continue to multiple. When 20E is blocked they can still reach commitment pulse and pupate. The azadirachtin hormone blocker slowed the pupation process down but did not cause for the Manduca Sexta to grow normally and stop pupation. For people who are affected by the Manduca can use azadirachtin to slow pupation but it will cause for the Manduca to become smaller.

Figure 1. Mean weight of caterpillars and Standard deviations. Control (1.0175)  Experimental (-1.4325) T-test showed controll was much higher rates than experimental.  The change in controll groups weight was postive and experimental was negative. The experimental had a negative mean becasue those caterpillars lost weight over the trial.
