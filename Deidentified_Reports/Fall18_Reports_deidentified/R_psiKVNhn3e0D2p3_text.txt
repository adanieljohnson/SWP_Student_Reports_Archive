Title: The Effect of Artificial Exposure to Pesticide Carbaryl on the Twitch Threshold of the Gastrocnemius Muscle in Lithobatis Spenocephalus Legs

Abstract:
Uses of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and AChE inhibitors, such as in the pesticide Sevin (formally known as carbonyl), render study of its effect on organisms, even those it isn’t targeted toward, relevant in ecological examinations of commercial compounds. In this study, the consequence of AChE inhibition on the gastrocnemus muscle of the Southern Leopard Frog (Lithobatis sphenocephalus) was observed by measuring twitch threshold before and after injecting of Sevin into the muscle. The statistical significance of the increase in twitch threshold following injection indicate that AChE does indeed have an effect on neuromuscular controll. While it is speculated that the inhibitor operated to reduce muscular response to stimulus by creating an excess of ACh in the post synaptic clefts, this must be confirmed with further research that directly injects ACh into the muscle rather than AChE. The implications of this study for the neuromuscular controll of populations in contact with Sevin and other AChE inhibitors remain unknown. However, studies that expose subjects to the compound through alternate method, as opposed to by the direct artificial injection used in this experiment, provide a framework for mimicking the natural mechanisms in which organisms come into contact with Sevin.

Introduction:
The presence of acetylcholine (ACh)—a crucial neurotransmitter that facilitates muscle contraction—and acetylcholine blockers in conventional medicine and, more importantly to this study, pesticides create a need to understand how the compound affects the muscular movement mechanism in organisms, particularly in animal bodies, which nerves are unique to. The current body of knowledge reports that ACh will bind to its receptor, an ion channel, on a cell membrane, opening the channel to allow sodium ions to enter. This ion movement creates a change in concentration, generating an action potential that will release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and begin the sliding filament mechanism, resulting in muscle contraction [Sadava: 2017]. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the enzyme which breaks down ACh in the post synaptic cleft and prevents receptors from being over activated, is present in Sevin, a popular commercial pesticide also known as carbaryl and has been shown to have toxic effects on the organisms exposed to it [Branch: 1986] [Davidson: 2007]. To judge the effects of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on muscular contraction, the minimum stimulus required to generate the response of a single fiber, or the twitch threshold, will be determined before injection of the inhibitor and after injection. Due to availability of and relative ease with which Southern Leopard Frog legs can be dissected, the gastrocnemus muscle of a Lithobatis sphenocephalus makes an ideal subject on which to perform this procedure. It is hypothesized that a muscle would require a greater stimulus to contract after injection of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor than it would prior to this exposure.

Materials and Method:
Three freshly amputated legs from three different frogs were obtained and prepared by detaching the skin and dissecting the gastrocnemus muscle so that some of connective tissue between the muscle and the bone was removed without detaching the entire muscle from where it meets the joint to the rest of the leg. Each muscle was then strung up to a transducer, one at a time in its lab tray that the muscle was positioned vertically and perpendicularly to the rest of the leg which laid horizontally in the tray. Each muscle was directed stimulated with several single pulses of constant duration until the twitch threshold was found and measured through LabScribe. The AChe inhibitor  treatment of 0.1 Ml 2% Sevin was then injected into each muscle. Since Sevin is a relatively large molecule and diffuses relatively slowly through the muscle, five minutes were allowed between injection and further testing. After 5 minutes, the twitch threshold of each frog leg was measured again by the same procedure. Following experimentation, a one-tailed paired t_test was performed using a p_value of 0.05. 

Results:
In all legs, the minimum stimulus needed to cause muscle contraction was lesser prior to treatment than the twitch threshold after treatment. Upon performance of a paired t_test, the statistical significance of this observation was confirmed with the mean of the twitch threshold after the treatment found to be significently greater than its mean before the treatment (t_stat = 2.91, d.f. = 2, P = 0.05).

Discussion:
The significance of the positive difference between twitch threshold before and after Sevin injection confirms the alternate hypothesis and indicates a cause-effect relationship between AChE inhibition and decreased muscle contraction. To speculate, the exposure to Sevin likely resulted in the excess of ACh in the post synaptic clefts in the leg, causing paralysis by over activation of receptors [Sadava:2017]. While this interpretation posits that the only effect of AChE relevant in the results in the buildup of ACh, it is possible the inhibitor has other effects. A multi-group experiment that injects a treatment of ACh, ranging from high to low concentrations and similarly measures twitch threshold before and after could test this conjecture. 
Though other studies corroborate negative effects of carbaryl on animals, it is in capacities that do not explicitly involve muscles [Davidson: 2007]. Additionally, the contact with the pesticide tested in such studies is indirect, whereas this experiment artificially exposes the subject organisms to carbaryl by directly injecting it. Therefore, a gap in knowledge exists regarding the effect of Sevin on twitch thresholds under natural circumstances, especially in the long term. Repeating this experiment without injecting the treatment, but rather by allowing the legs to bathe in a Sevin solution unskinned could reveal new insights into the real danger the pesticide poses on proximate populations as it is currently used. However, developing techniques to test twitch threshold of the gastrocnemus muscle without removing the skin will take some creative solutions.
