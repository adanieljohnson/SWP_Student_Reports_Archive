Title: 2% Sevine, an AChE inhibitor, does not have a significant effect on the rate of tetany.

Abstract:
Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that is vital for the stimulation and subsequent contraction of the myofibrils that comprise muscles. However, when muscles are stimulated repeatedly, tetany occurs and the muscle eventually runs out of ATP, resulting in fatigue and a failure to continue contracting. As a result, acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter, is necessary to take the neurotransmitter back up into the presynaptic neuron that released. In this experiment we tested the effects of 2% solution of sevine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, on the rate of tetany. By stimulating the sciatic nerve of a skinned frog leg, we expected to see tetany occur sooner. However, our data did not display a statistically significant difference and failed to support our hypothesis. This suggests that there could have been an error during the experiment, or that the presence of acetylcholinesterase is not vital for the removal of acetylcholine from its receptors on the myofibril. 

Introduction:
This experiment examines the role of acetylcholinesterase on the rate at which tetany occurs. Particularly, it tests whether 2% solution of sevine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, increases the rate at which tetany occurs. Within the muscular system, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that stimulates individual myofibrils, also known as muscle cells, to fire action potentials and release calcium, which then causes the muscle fiber to shorten [Johnson: 2018]. The removal of acetylcholine results in the cessation of muscular contraction. Acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme responsible for breaking the neurotransmitter down and returning it to the presynaptic neuron from which it was released.  Moreover, tetany is what occurs when the muscle is stimulated to the point of maximum contraction. However, the cell cannot maintain this state and eventually runs out of ATP, resulting in fatigue. In previous experiments, “the decline in the ability of the muscle to sustain tetanic response after indirect stimulation due to the test organophosphates” was found to be “proportional to the inhibition of AChE. These results confirm the concept of the dependence of these abnormalities on the accumulation of endogenous acetylcholine in neuromuscular junction” [Faff 1973]. In this case, the muscle was unable to maintain tetany because the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase resulted in repeated stimulation of the muscle, causing it to run out of the ATP necessary to contract. Therefore, the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase caused fatigue more rapidly. This experiment seeks to test the effect of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor on the rapidity with which tetany is induced. Since tetany occurs when the cell is maximally contracted, restricting the breakdown of acetylcholine, the stimulator of the cell, may alter the time of tetany. We predicted that 2% of sevine will increase the rate at which tetany occurs, inducing it sooner as a result of overstimulation of the muscle.


Materials and Methods:
Materials and Methods
Three frog legs were taken and skinned using a pair of forceps. The legs were then moistened with Ringer’s solution to prevent them from drying out. The thigh muscles were then separated in order to reveal the sciatic nerve, which was then gently freed from the muscle with minimal contact to metal. Following this, the gastrocnemius muscle and corresponding Achilles’ tendon were removed from the heel and a string was tied to the end of the Achilles’ tendon. The string was then used to suspend the muscle by the force transducer on a ring stand. A stimulator electrode, which was connected to a stimulated and a computer responsible for recording myograms, was placed underneath the sciatic nerve. Each leg then underwent a control and treatment experiment. For the control, the sciatic nerve was continuously stimulated by the probes, inducing tetany in the gastrocnemius muscle. For the treatment run, each gastrocnemius muscle was injected with 1 mL 2% sevine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, in various locations. The same process as the control was then repeated for each leg. A paired t-test was used to evaluate the difference between the control and treatment runs at the stimulus of 10Hz. 


Results:
Within the control run of the experiment, all three frog legs reached tetany at 20 hertz (Hz) of stimulation. During treatment run of the experiment, the first frog leg reached tetany at 20 Hz of stimulation similar to the control groups. However, the second and third legs reached tetany at 10 Hz. As a whole, during both the control and experimental groups the distance between peaks decreased as tetany occurred and the muscle contracted continually, resulting in a distance of zero seconds. When comparing the control and experimental groups, in two out of the three frog specimens, the presence of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor caused the decrease in the distance between peaks (Fig. 1). A paired t-test was used to analyze the data. However, the results were not significantly different (p-value = 0.24; t-value = 1.63; degrees of freedom = 2). 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that the presence of 2% of solution of sevine would increase the rapidity at which tetany was produced, was not supported. We expected to witness tetany at a low level of stimulation in the experimental groups than in the control groups. While two out of the three legs did experience tetany at a slightly lower stimulation, there was not a statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups (p-value = 0.24; t-value = 1.63; degrees of freedom = 2), resulting in the conclusion that the presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor does not make tetany occur sooner. This implies that, though acetylcholinesterase was inhibited and therefore was unable to break down acetylcholine, either there was not a sufficient amount of the inhibitor or the role of the enzyme in not vital for slowing tetany. Additionally, the lack of the results that were expected could suggest an error on the part of the experimenters. It could also be due to chance. Since the purpose of acetylcholinesterase it to break down the acetylcholine that binds to receptors on myofibrils, depolarizing them, its absence should result in a failure to take the neurotransmitter back up into the presynaptic cell. In the previous study mentioned in the introduction, the presence of organophosphates, a form of AChE inhibitor, caused abnormal neuromuscular transmission and successive tetany [Faff: 1973]. These results, similar to our hypothesis, suggested that the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase would have a significant impact on tetany in muscles. However, since that was not the case, we can hypothesize that the muscles did not achieve tetany more rapidly either due to error or because of an insufficient amount of inhibitor. As a result, the experiment could be improved by testing different inhibitors and different concentrations of inhibitors using the same procedures. Fully understanding the effects of AChE inhibitors and, subsequently, the role of acetylcholine could have long term impact on the understanding of muscle function and could possibly have medical and therapeutic effects for diseases.
