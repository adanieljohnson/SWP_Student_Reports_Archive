Title: Effect of Sudden Changes in Light Presence on the Behavior of Male Betta Splendens

Abstract:
Betta splendens exhibit a wide range of intra-specific, agonistic behaviors that make it possible for researchers to observe and quantify interactions between male Betta splendens. This experiment seeks to analyze these behaviors and the effect a prolonged period of darkness will have on specific agonistic behaviors of male Betta splendens. It was hypothesized that when male Betta splendens are kept in darkness for a prolonged period of time, the sudden change from a dark environment to a light environment will cause male Betta splendens to be more aggressive. In this experiment 4 groups of 2 male Betta splendens were analyzed as the male Betta splendens were placed side by side in a tank and separated by a glass divider. Two groups experienced a prolonged period of darkness then were suddenly introduced to a light environment while the other 2 groups remained in the light environment for the duration of the experiment. The aggressive behaviors of the Betta splendens were observed and quantified to determine the effect of the sudden change of light presence on the fish and an unpaired two-sample t-test was conducted to determine this change’s statistical significance. 

Introduction:
Organisms have different intra and inter-specific agonistic behaviors that can be analyzed to better understand animal behavior. This lab focuses specifically on the intra-specific behaviors between male Betta splendens. Betta splendens were chosen for this experiment because they exhibit a wide range of intra-specific aggressive behaviors. The aggressive displays of Betta splendens are “highly stereotypic, conspicuous, and well documented”, which contributes to why they are a good species to study in terms of animal behavior [Doutrelant:2001]. Betta splendens, also known as Siamese Fighting fish are native to Thailand and in the wild can be found in inland waters of the Orient [Hargrove: 1999]. Intraspecific behaviors of Betta splendens include two main types of movements; broadside movement and facing movements. For this lab, male Betta Splenden behavior was examined to determine the level of aggression Betta splendens show towards one another after being in a prolonged period of darkness. In similar experiments, when Betta splendens were placed in complete darkness, the darkness effectively stopped all responding in the fish [Hogan: 1970]. The fish are essentially kept in a state of relaxation while in a dark environment [Hogan:1970]. Betta broadside movements include pelvic fin flickering, tail beating and tail flashing [Dept. of Biology: 2018]. Facing movements include facing with pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula and showing red mane [Dept. of Biology: 2018]. Other agonistic behaviors include raising the dorsal fin, lowering the head and arching the back [Dept. of Biology: 2018]. It was hypothesized that when male Betta splendens are kept in darkness for a prolonged period of time, the sudden change from a dark environment to a light environment will cause male Betta splendens to be more aggressive.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 8 male Betta splenden were collected. Two Betta splenden, separated by both a removable opaque divider and a glass divider, were placed in a glass tank (group 1). Three replicates of the tank were made for a total of 4 tanks with 8 Betta splendens. The experimental groups (groups 3 and 4) were placed in a cabinet to simulate a dark environment for 4.5 hours, while the control groups (groups 1 and 2) remained in a light environment. When collecting data and making observations, the fish were brought into or stayed in (depending on which group) the light environment and the opaque divider was removed allowing the Betta splendens to become aware of each other’s presence. Data was collected for a total of 5 minutes. The agonistic behavior of the Betta splendens was quantified by counting the number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by each fish and timing the duration each fish showed his red mane. An unpaired two sample t-test was used to analyze the data. 

Results:
The average number of aggressive behaviors exhibited by male Betta splendens who remained in the light (groups 1 and 2) was 17.25 ± 18.71, while the average for the Betta splendens who received the dark treatment (groups 3 and 4) was 11.5 ± 13.30 (Figure 1). In terms of the duration of time the Betta splenden flashed their red mane, the average exhibited by fish who remained in the light was 101.75 ± 97.34 seconds compared to an average of 68.25 ± 84.26 seconds for Betta splendens who received the dark treatment (figure 2). Overall, there was no statistical significance in the increase of instances of agonistic behavior under different treatments (t stat: 0.50, df: 6, p value: 0.317). There was also no statistical significance in the increase of time Betta splendens flashed their red mane (t stat: 0.52, df: 6, p value: 0.310).

Discussion:
Based on the results of the experiment, the hypothesis that a prolonged period of darkness would increase aggression among male Betta splendens was not supported. Though not to a significant extent, the Betta splendens that were exposed to darkness were less aggressive than the Betta splendens in the control group which may be because the darkness relaxed the fish to a point where they were minimally active [Hogan: 1970]. While quantifying the data for the experiment, it was observed that control group one appeared to be an outlier. The Betta splendens in group one behaved exceptionally aggressive toward one another, each of them holding their red manes for approximately three times the duration of the second group of most aggressive fish. In future studies, to further examine the possible effects of light and dark environments on Betta splendens, experimental groups can be kept under dark treatments for a longer period of time. Additionally, observation can take place for a longer duration of time, which will allow for each male Betta splenden to become fully aware of the presence of the other which is critical since the aggressive displays are elicited by the presence of another Betta splenden [Kalat:1975].  Furthermore, in a study that analyzed the onset of combat in male Betta splendens, it was observed that aggressive behaviors between Betta splendens can occur over a long period of time and may not even appear until after a few hours [Bronstein: 1983]. Therefore, it can be determined that longer observation time could lead to more significant results.
