Title: The Effect of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition on Muscle Contraction Strength in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
In Rania pipiens, as in many organisms, action potentials traveling to the neuromuscular junctions which connect muscle fibers to neurons prompt the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, allowing actin and myosin to bind and thereby resulting in muscle contraction. This experiment seeks to address the effect of introducing Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens leg on the magnitude of contraction the muscle produces. We hypothesized that if we were to introduce .1g of a 2% Sevin solution (an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor) to the frogs gastrocnemus muscle, that the muscle would produce a greater magnitude of contraction. We stimulated three frog legs to contract, applied the inhibitor to the muscle, and tested again to gauge any difference in contraction the inhibitor produced. The first and second legs showed greater magnitudes of contraction following the injection than after. However, our results proved to be statistically insignificent, with P = 0.652. It is likely that the acetylcholinesterase inhibiting 2% Sevin solution was not allowed adequate time to absorb into the muscle tissue, and thus never reached the neuromuscular junctions in any meaningful quantity.

Introduction:
Muscle contraction occurs when an action potential traveling along an axon arrives at a neuromuscular junction — the synaptic junction found between an axon terminal and the motor endplate of a muscle. Previous research in the field of neurology indicate that the arriving action potential triggers the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which causes a graded potential to travel along the muscle fiber’s surface and into its t-tubules [Nachmansohn: 1943]. This results in the release of calcium into the sarcoplasm of the fiber, triggering the binding of actin and myosin and the resulting contraction of the muscle. Understanding the role of acetylcholine on the strength of muscle contraction is important in the field of medicine. Certain diseases and forms of poisoning, such as that inflicted by exposure to tetradoxin, inhibit neuromuscular interaction and can result in paralysis or impeded muscle contraction. Understanding the relationships between neurons and muscles is necessary for the treatment of these medical issues. We believe that Sevin will inhibit the function of acetylcholinesterase, resulting in its inability to break down acetylcholine in the neuromuscular junction and increasing the intensity of the twitch as excessive amounts of it are received. This experiment will test the effect of introducing the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Sevin to the gastrocnemus muscle of a Rania pipiens leg on the magnitude of the muscles contraction. Three legs will be stimulated with and without exposure to the inhibitor, and the magnitude of the contractions before and after the injection will be recorded. We hypothesize that injecting Sevin into the gastrocnemus muscle will result in an increased muscle contraction strength.

Materials and Method:
To assemble the experiment, we obtained three Rania pipiens legs. We removed the skin from each leg and severed the point of connection between the gastrocnemus and the heel. We then affixed each leg by string to the arm of an adjustable sensor apparatus such that the gastrocnemus muscle was suspended above and isolated from the remainder of the leg. We positioned two nodes to lightly pierce the muscle to provide the stimulus. We then stimulated each muscle with five 1.5 mV shocks, recording the resulting T2-T1 differences (T2-T1 resulting from the difference of contraction force and resting threshold). We then pierced the gastrocnemus and injected 0.1 g of 2% Sevin solution into the muscle, waited one minute to allow absorption, and repeated the process of stimulation. We used a paired two-tailed t_test to determine the statistical validity of the resulting data.

Results:
The first and second trial showed a minor increase in contraction force in the Rania pipiens legs following their injection with .1g of a 2% Sevin solution. The first trial increased by 0.053 ± 0.0172, the second increased by 0.104 ± 0.105 (Figure 1). The third trial showed a decrease in contraction force following the injection by 0.0816 ± 0.113 (Figure 1) . The results were proven to be statistically insignificent, as d.f.=2, t_stat=.524, P=.652. We noticed that the gastrocnemus muscle bulged at the site of injection when we inserted the Sevin solution.

Discussion:
Although the first and second trial leg reflect our hypothesis that treating Rania pipiens legs with an acetylcholinesterase inhibiting 2% Sevin solution would result in increased magnitudes of contraction when stimulated by shock, our hypothesis was ultimately rejected as the data showed no supporting statistical significance. Likely, our experiment produced too little data from too few trials to build any significent statistical evidence to validate the findings. However, we may have erred in our allowance of only one minute following injection for the solution to seep into the muscle tissue. Considering the observed bulge at the site of injection, it is likely that the Sevin solution was not fully absorbed by the tissue and thus had a minimal effect if any on the strength contraction produced by the gastrocnemus. Therfore, more time should be allotted in future trials to allow proper absorption. Esterase breaks down extraneous molecules found in the neuromuscular junction following the arrival of an action potential.  Because action potentials reach the axon terminals at the neuromuscular junction and result in the release of acetylcholine at this site, the AchE inhibiting solution must penetrate into the neuromuscular junctions within the cell such that the acetylcholine is not broken down in the cleft [Nachmansohn: 1943]. If it does not reach the junctions, but rather remains in a localized pocket of solution on the exterior such as in our experiment, then no effect will be had.  Further study could be conducted to test and determine the amount of time necessary for an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to sufficiently absorb in to the muscle fiber.
