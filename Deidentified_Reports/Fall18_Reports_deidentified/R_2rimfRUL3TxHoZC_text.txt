Title: Variation of root to shoot ratio in field peas exposed to different amounts of sunlight

Abstract:
Resource allocation is a very important concept in the field of evolutionary biology. It is important to understand the way plants adapt to their environment in the absence of either essential biotic or essential abiotic factors. Here we will look at the effects that the amount of sunlight has on Pisum sativum arvense, commonly known as field peas. In order to test this, there were two different treatments of field peas. One in a dark setting and one in a light setting. The expectation was that the replicates in the dark setting would have a larger root to shoot ratio because of the way they allocated their resources. However the results revealed that the plants in the dark setting had a smaller root to shoot ratio because the plants in the light setting were given more resources to thrive. These results showed us that the amount of sunlight had no effect on the root to shoot ratio of weight, however it did on length. This is because the seeds had to develop appropriately by allocating their resources appropriately to the environment. Overall, this experiment was a small representation of the importance of phenotypic plasticity in the development of plants especially when resources are limited. 

Introduction:
In every ecological community, the residing organisms are affected by both biotic and abiotic factors. In this experiment, our model organisms were P. sativum arvense, more commonly known as field peas.  Plants can change how they allocate existing resources according to their environmental circumstances. This is called phenotypic plasticity and applies only to the new growth of plants [Johnson: 2018]. To understand this better, we wanted to test how abiotic factors affects the growth of field peas, specifically the amount of sunlight. We placed the field peas into two different groups: one group had full sunlight and the other had none. By considering these two factors, we will measure the root to shoot ratio of the resulting plants. It is important to recognize that phenotypic plasticity doesnâ€™t just have to be expressed by the genotype of the plant. It can be conveyed at the behavioral, physiological, developmental, or biochemical level of an organism [Pigliucci: 2363]. That is why it is important to test such things as sunlight because it is essential to the growth of all photosynthetic organisms thus making it necessary to study the effects of. In this experiment we will assess the physiological effects that limited access to sunlight has on an organism. We predict that the plants growing in the light setting will have a larger root to shoot ratio than the field peas growing in the lighted environment.

Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we put two groups of field pea seeds that were watered and fertilized in both a dark setting and a light setting. The controlled factors were that both groups were fertilized the same amount at the beginning and watered 100mL daily. However, the independent variable was the amount of sunlight that they received. For the plants with direct sunlight, they were placed in a greenhouse whereas the plants with no sunlight were placed in a cabinet. To measure how sunlight affects these plants, we will be measuring their root to shoot ratios in both weight (grams) and length (centimeters). These measurements served as our dependent variable. To analyze this data, we used a two-tailed T test for our statistical analysis.

Results:
The trend in figure 1 shows that the plants with access to sunlight had a higher root to shoot ratio in both weight and length than the plants in the dark setting. However, the mean root to shoot ratios of weight are not statistically significant in plants growing in light and dark environments (t stat=1.913, df=18, p= 0.071). The mean root to shoot ratio for length is statistically significant in plants growing in both light and dark environments (t stat=6.988, df=18, p=0.000). 

Discussion:
Because the weight root to shoot ratios were not statistically significant, the alternate hypothesis was rejected. In the case of measuring length, the alternate hypothesis was also rejected, however the results indicated that the root to shoot ratios for length were statistically significant. Overall, the experiment suggests that phenotypic plasticity is important in field peas because of the way the replicates in the dark setting had to allocate their resources differently under an absence of an essential abiotic factor like sunlight. However, it is important to recognize the atypical replicates of this experiment that may have skewed the results. For example, in the light environment for weight there was one value that was extremely different from the rest because it was much larger than the rest so it changed the data as well as the standard deviation. In order to remedy this, it would be beneficial to add more treatments as to reduce the impact of one such plant. Because there was a huge difference in phenotype, it is clear that the amount of sunlight greatly impacts the development of field peas. However, it is crucial to note that phenotypic plasticity varies among many different species. Research has shown that there could be a correlation between the genetics of the species as well as the environment around the species that contributes to its phenotypic plasticity. [Schlichting: 1986]. This reiterates that phenotypic plasticity can come in very different circumstances, and can be behavioral as well as developmental [Pigliucci: 2006]. This experiment is just a small representation of the developmental capabilities of field peas specifically.
