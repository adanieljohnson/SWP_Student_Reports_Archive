Title: The Effect of a Calcium Inhibitor on Muscle Response in Frog Legs 

Abstract:
Muscle contraction is an essential part of life in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and calcium plays a key role in this process. This experiment investigated how an addition of a calcium inhibitor to the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg would affect the muscle response when the sciatic nerve was directly stimulated. The nerve was stimulated on three different frog legs at 0.5V, 0.75V and 1.0V both before and after the addition of a calcium inhibitor. A statistical analysis was done on the data using a two-tailed paired t-test. The addition of a calcium inhibitor led to data that was calculated to not be significant, however, there were trends shown that the responses in two of the three frog legs were higher prior to the introduction of a calcium inhibitor. 


Introduction:
The skeletal muscle makes up the somatic neuromuscular system in both vertebrates and invertebrates [Johnson:2016]. Skeletal muscle consists of myofibers, which are multinuclear, and bound together by connective tissue. These components work together with motor neurons and various chemicals to cause muscle contractions. When nerve impulses arrive at the neuromuscular junction, acetylcholine (ACh) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminal. ACh binds on the membrane of the muscle fibre, opening the sodium channels. This generates an action potential that spreads throughout the fibre while also stimulating the release of Ca+2 [Johnson:2016]. Ca+2 activates the contractile mechanism of the muscle fibre. Calcium attaches to troponin, moving tropomyosin out of the way so that cross bridges of actin and myosin can bind using ATP and produce muscle contraction [Allot:2014]. Common examples of calcium channel blockers are nifedipine, verapamil and diltiazem. 
A frog leg is composed of two main parts: the sciatic nerve and the gastrocnemius muscle. The sciatic nerve is a mixed-function nerve, made up of the axons of both sensory and motor neurons. This nerve serves the purpose of supplying sensations to the foot and lower leg [Johnson:2016]. The gastrocnemius muscle of the frog is half of the calf muscle, and it helps with the flexion of the foot at the ankle joint and the leg at the knee joint [Cartee:1992]. Calcium plays an essential role in the stimulation of the sciatic nerve and the contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle. This experiment will serve the purpose of investigating how a calcium inhibitor will affect the muscle response. 
The hypothesis for this experiment is that if a calcium inhibitor is added directly to the gastrocnemius muscle, then the muscle response will change. The control of this experiment will be the first round of stimulation on each frog leg before the addition of the calcium inhibitor. The independent variable will be the voltage at which the nerve is stimulated, and the dependent variable will be the muscle response. 


Materials and Methods:
Three frog legs were skinned to reveal the sciatic nerve, which was directly stimulated by laying probes on top of it. Extra precautions were taken to assure that no metal was touching the probes, as that could have affected the readings. An initial reading of the frog leg muscle response by directly stimulating the sciatic nerve was taken. Before injecting the calcium inhibitor, the nerve was stimulated at 0.5V, 0.75V and 1.0V. The data was recorded in a chart, and then the calcium inhibitor was injected directly into the gastrocnemius nerve. After the calcium inhibitor was injected, eight minutes passed, and the nerve was directly stimulated again at 0.5V, 0.75V and 1.0V. After all of the data was recorded, the first frog was taken down, and the process was repeated again with the two remaining frog legs. 
	In order to analyze the data collected from the experiment, a two-tailed paired t-test was performed with a significance level of 0.05. The muscle response from the stimulation with 0.75V will be used in this statistical analysis. 


Results:
In the initial reading prior to the addition of the calcium inhibitor, the average muscle response was 0.628V. This served as our control group. After the calcium inhibitor was added, the reading was 0.401V (Fig 1). Therefore the average difference in the muscle response was -0.227V. Using the t-value of 1.182, a p-value of 0.358 was calculated through a two-tailed paired t-test. 
	In terms of qualitative observations, the contractions could be observed in the twitching of the muscle. The legs did not have a reaction until 0.5V, however, as the voltage of the direct stimulation increased, so did the intensity of the contractions. All of the contractions, regardless of voltage level, were quick to occur. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis that if a calcium inhibitor was injected directly into the gastrocnemius muscle of a frog leg, and the sciatic nerve was directly stimulated, that the addition of the calcium inhibitor would change the muscle response, was not supported, as the p-value was found to be not significant. However, the raw data collected somewhat supports the hypothesis, as a trend can be observed that in all of the frog legs except the last one, the response was higher in the frog legs without the calcium inhibitor than in those with the calcium inhibitor. The trend in the graph (Fig 1) can be explained by looking at the role that calcium plays in muscle contraction. Ca+2 triggers the overall muscle contraction process, as it attaches to troponin and allows for the cross bridges of actin and myosin to form [Allot:2014]. Therefore, if there was a calcium inhibitor added to the muscle, there would not be as much calcium readily available. Not only would this then slow down the overall reaction time, but it would also cause the muscle contraction to decrease in intensity. Less cross bridges would form between actin and myosin, and therefore the muscle contractions would not be able to occur as frequently. 
	There can be some inconsistencies observed in Frog Leg #3, as the muscle had a higher response after the injection of the calcium inhibitor than the control. An explanation for this could be an error in the execution of the experiment. There is a possibility that when injecting the calcium inhibitor, some leaked out of the muscle, therefore resulting in a lesser effect on the muscle response. 
	An experiment was done using these same basic understandings by Dr. Louise J Beaton, except it was performed on human muscles, and was looking at how calcium inhibitors would affect already damaged muscles by having the subjects take different amounts of calcium channel blockers on different days. The idea was that if muscles are damaged, in order to aid in their rehabilitation, contractions should be limited [Beaton:2002]. Calcium channel blockers have been known to prevent the subsequent injury following muscle damage in rodents [Beaton:2002]. The results obtained by this experiment further emphasize the essential role that calcium plays in muscle contraction, being that it, to a certain extent, controls the intensity and speed of the response of the muscle. One way to extend this experiment would be to also do an experiment solely on the gastrocnemius muscle by way of indirect stimulation, to see how the results differ. In addition, one could perform an experiment adding calcium directly to the muscle and seeing if it had a similar or opposite effect to the results of this experiment.
