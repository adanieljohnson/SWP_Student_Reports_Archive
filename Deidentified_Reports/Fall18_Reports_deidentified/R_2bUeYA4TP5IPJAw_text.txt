Title: Implications of temperature fail to affect photosynthetic reduction reactions in Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
The reduction reactions of the electron transport chain play an integral role in photosynthesis, as they are responsible for setting up the proton gradient used to synthesize ATP. These reduction reactions, along with the effects of various conditions on the reactions, may be quantified using the Hill reaction. Temperature has been found to affect reduction reactions, with these reactions having an optimal temperature. It was hypothesized that increasing or decreasing temperature would affect the ability of Spinacia oleracea to perform reduction reactions in photosynthesis. Methods included the preparation of chloroplasts with DCIP, and periodic measurement of absorbance at each of four experimental temperatures using a spectrophotometer. Average percent change in absorbance was significantly higher for the 0-3°C group at 20 minutes compared to the room temperature group (p = 0.022), but all other data points did not reach statistical significance. It was concluded that there could be a trend of greater photosynthesis at lower temperatures in Spinacia oleracea. Implications of continuing this temperature-photosynthesis research would be to better predict the impact of climate change on photosynthetic organisms, especially on food crops.


Introduction:
Photosynthesis, or the conversion of light energy to chemical energy, includes both light-dependent and independent reactions. Among the light-dependent reactions are redox reactions in which electrons are transported back and forth between molecular complexes. In the electron transport chain, light must first be absorbed by chlorophyll, which excites electrons and allows for them to move from chlorophyll. Excited electrons are then enabled to cleave water, releasing electrons and also establishing a proton gradient. Electrons then bind to the carrier molecule NADP+ to form NADPH. The electron transport chain step is crucial for ATP production, as the movement of protons down their electrochemical gradient from the lumen to the stroma of the chloroplasts powers ATP synthesis. Protons move through the ATP synthase complex as they travel to the stroma, resulting in the creation of ATP [Johnson: 2016].
An alternate electron acceptor to NADP+, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCIP), may be used in photosynthesis to determine the effects of a given condition on reduction reactions. DCIP becomes reduced according to the Hill reaction, provided that chloroplasts and light are supplied: 2H2O + 2DCIP  2DCIPH2 + O2.  DCIP in its oxidized form is dark blue, due to its aromatic ring structure, whereas reduced DCIP is colorless. Therefore, reduction of DCIP may be measured as a percent decrease in absorbance at 600 nm [Johnson: 2016]. 
One such condition that may influence reduction reactions in photosynthesis is temperature. In a study in which Hordeum vulgare (barley) was exposed to a range of temperatures, it was found that the rate of DCIP reduction was greatest in chloroplasts at approximately 30 ˚C. A possible explanation for differences in photosynthesis across temperatures postulated by Nolan et al. was that chloroplast membranes take different conformations depending upon the temperature; this could impact the establishment of a proton gradient across the membrane. Also, with change in temperature, sites of electron acceptance on carrier molecules are altered [Nolan: 1976]. 
 In this experiment, the effect of varying temperatures on photosynthesis in Spinacia oleracea (spinach) will be examined. It is expected that temperatures representing either an increase or a decrease from the control temperature of 25 ˚C will have a significant effect on ability of Spinacia oleracea to perform photosynthesis, specifically reduction reactions.


Materials and Methods:
After having removed the central veins, 4 spinach leaves were washed and dried. The spinach and 10 mL of 400 mM cold grinding buffer (sucrose in Tricine buffer with pH 8.0) were added to a cold mortar and pestle. Spinach was then ground to a paste before the addition of 10 more mL cold grinding buffer. After mixing the buffer and spinach paste, the resultant slurry was subsequently strained using 3 layers of cheesecloth and a cold beaker. The filtered liquid was transferred to a chilled centrifuge tube and spun at 200 x G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant from the first tube was then transferred to a second chilled centrifuge tube, with care taken to not transfer debris. The second tube was centrifuged at 1000 x G for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was then poured into a third tube before resuspending the pellet at the bottom of the second tube in 20 mL cold grinding buffer. In the preparation of 13 test tubes, 6 mL water, 2 mL of 100 mM phosphate reaction buffer (pH 6.5), and 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP were added to tubes 1-12. Test tube 13, the blank, was prepared with 8 mL water and 2 mL reaction buffer. To start the assay, 100 μl chloroplasts (from pellet in second centrifuge tube) were added to all tubes, which were immediately mixed. After blanking the spectrometer and setting wavelength to 600 nm, time 0 absorbance was measured for tubes 1-12. The tubes were then transferred to their assigned temperature conditions in either warm water or ice baths: 0-3°C (tubes 1-3), 25°C (4-6, control group), 35°C (7-9), and 45°C (10-12). Absorbances of samples were measured again at 10, 20, and 30 minutes, first blanking the instrument before each round of measurements. At the end of the experiment, absorbances at the various time points were compared to initial absorbances using percent change, or [(Absorbance at time zero – Absorbance at the time ‘N’ )/ Absorbance at time zero]  x 100%. Data analysis was conducted with a one-way ANOVA test as a means of comparing the relative amounts of photosynthesis which occurred under different temperature conditions.


Results:
By referring to the results of the Tukey-Kramer test (Table 1), it may be noted that the only data point significantly different from the room temperature group is that of the 0-3°C group at the 20-minute mark (p = 0.022). Despite insignificance of other data points and large, overlapping error bars, a greater percent change in absorbance is observed for the 0-3°C group than that of the 25°C group at the 20-minute time point (Figure 1). At 20 minutes, the 25°C group has an average percent change in absorbance of 11.043% (SD: 4.22), whereas the 0-3°C group has an average percent change in absorbance of 44.075% (SD: 10.37). 


Discussion:
It was hypothesized that increasing or decreasing temperature from the 25 ˚C control would significantly impact the relative amount of reduction reactions performed in Spinacia oleracea. The hypothesis cannot be accepted, since the only significant comparison was between the 0-3˚C and 25˚C groups at the 20-minute mark. Based on our hypothesis, significantly different percent changes in absorbance from those at 25 ˚C should have been observed at all temperatures and time points. 
An explanation for the difference in percent change in absorbance between the 0-3˚C and 25˚C groups might be provided by examining the habitat in which Spinacia oleracea is grown. The optimal temperature at which plants can perform photosynthesis is able to acclimate to the different environments in which they grow [Armand: 1978]. Spinacia oleracea is typically grown at temperatures of 2-24 ˚C, or in relatively cool environments. Plants grown in cool environments perform more photosynthesis at low temperatures relative to plants from warmer environments, as their photosynthetic machinery is more cold resistant. Conversely, the photosynthetic machinery of plants grown cool environments has not adapted to warm temperatures, so these plants perform less photosynthesis at higher temperatures [Bjorkman: 1975]. Plants grown in cool climates may not be able to resist alterations in chloroplast membranes and electron acceptance sites at higher temperatures [Nolan: 1976].
A greater percent change in absorbance was observed in the 0-3 ˚C group compared to the control at 20 minutes, meaning that reduction of more DCIP occurred at 0-3 ˚C. As DCIP became reduced in the 0-3 ˚C group, the sample became clearer, resulting in a high percent decrease of absorbance. The interpretation of this data point could be that it shows an increased ability of Spinacia oleracea to perform photosynthesis at lower temperatures. Given that Spinacia oleracea grows in cool environments, it would be reasonable to state that its photosynthetic machinery has adapted to perform well at cold temperatures. However, although there could be a trend of more photosynthesis at lower temperatures in spinach relative to at higher temperatures, another experiment with more replicates is needed to confirm this trend.
One possible source of error in the experiment could have been that the spectrophotometer wasn’t properly calibrated, as the absorbance measurements frequently fluctuated. A second likely source of error might be attributed to an insufficient number of replicates. Several absorbance values appeared to be outliers, but due to the small number of trials, there was too little data to statistically prove these values to be outliers. Thus, these values could not be rejected and were included in all graphs and calculations. Inclusion of outliers might have caused statistical tests to show insignificance, whereas if more replicates had been performed, there would be an opportunity to statistically determine and reject any outliers.
It would be of value to further investigate temperature-photosynthesis trends, as rising temperatures related to climate change impact a variety of photosynthetic organisms, both terrestrial and aquatic, such as Stylophora pistillata (coral) [Reynaud: 2003]. Moreover, change in temperature due to climate change could negatively affect crops, resulting in drastic implications for global food supply [Rosenzweig: 1994]. Therefore, a worthwhile future study might examine effects of temperature on photosynthesis in rice plants, a common food source.
