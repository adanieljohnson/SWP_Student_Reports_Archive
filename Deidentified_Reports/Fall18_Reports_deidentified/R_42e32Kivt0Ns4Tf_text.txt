Title: The effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of Fagopyrum esculentum

Abstract:
    In an ecological community, animals are biotic factors of the environment and wind, sunlight, nutrient, etc., are the abiotic factors of it. Plants adapt to the biotic and abiotic factors to survive, and they do it by altering their resource allocation. This experiment focused on the effect of herbivory, one of the biotic factors, on the resource allocation of buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum). We measured its allocation by calculating its root to shoot ratio and hypothesized that if herbivory is present, buckwheat would allocate more of its resources to its roots. Our hypothesis was not supported as our results showed. However, we found in past literature and formed a new hypothesis on the resource allocation of buckwheat, and future study is still needed to further support this hypothesis.


Introduction:
    In an ecological system, the animals and plants must live and interact with each other for all of them to survive. The animals are the biotic factors of the environment, which is the environmental stimuli originated from other organisms, whereas abiotic factors include wind, sunlight, nutrient condition, etc. [Johnson:2016] Resource limitation is what greatly affects the behaviors of plants within a community in terms of abiotic factors. For example, in an open field with plants, though it seems unlimited, the amount of sunlight that reaches the open field in a specific amount of time is actually limited. Thus, the sunlight that each plant in that area can receive is limited. Plants will then subdivide their limited internal resources, such as light energy trapped through photosynthesis or nutrients absorbed, among different organs of themselves to adapt to their environment. [Staddon:2013] 
    The resources required for plant growth can be categorized into those obtained above the ground and under the ground in the soil. The shoots of the plants are capable of generating sugar derived from the process photosynthesis, and the roots are able to absorb nitrogen and other nutrients as well as taking up water from the soil. Plants will allocate their individual energy and resources between roots and shoots in order to better adapt to their environment, as mentioned above. In an experiment did by J. Brown, she studied the effect of experimental burial on resource allocation of Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Chrysothamnus nauseosus, and Distichlis spicata. She discovered that as the severity of burial increased, all species shifted biomass from below-ground to above-ground components. [Brown: 1997] 
    Not only should plants adapt to the abiotic factors, but also cope with biotic factors in their community. Herbivores attack plants and feed on their leaves, and can have significent negative effects on the targeted plants. In the experiment carried out by Wilbur, the effect of insect herbivory on the growth and fitness of Verbascum thasus L. was studied and discovered that reducing herbivory had a marked positive effect on the fitness of the plants and concluded that herbivore-induced impacts on individual plant performance are substantial. [Wilbur:2013] In response to herbivory behaviors, plants will also adjust their resource allocation. In the experiment by Caldwell on two semiarid Agropyron bunchgrasses, the experimenters simulated the herbivory by defoliate the plants, and discovered, though different in amount, both the species grew new tillers and the leaf blades of regrowing tillers had higher photosynthesis capacity. [Caldwell: 1981]
    In our experiment, we planned to also figure out the effect of herbivory on the resource allocation of plants. We chose buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) as our subject plant. Buckwheat is a short-season crop, which has a branching root system with a primary taproot that reaches far into the soil. It has triangular seeds and branches freely. [Stone: 1906] We hypothesized that if herbivory is present, buckwheat would allocate more of its resources to its roots and root: shoot ratio would increase.



Materials and Method:
    We used a total of ten pots, where 5 served as the controll group and the other 5 as the experimental group. We filled the 4/5 of the pots with soil and planted in each pot 10-20 seeds of buckwheat. We covered all the seeds with soil and watered all the pots. In the following two weeks, we watered all the pots regularly and clipped small holes on all the leaves in the experimental group every day. After two weeks, we carefully picked 3 plants out of each pot. We separated their roots from the others and washed off the soil on them with water. After that, we measured the length and weight of each root and shoot. Fifteen plants in each group were measured and we had a total of 30 plants. We then calculated the root: shoot ratio based on length and weight. Finally, we compared the controll group with the experimental group by running a 1-tailed 2-sample t_test to analyze the data.


Results:
    The mean root: shoot ratio based on mass was 0.263 for the controll group and 0.280 for the experimental group. The standard deviation was 0.171 for the controll group and 0.059 for the experimental group. (Figure 1) The mean root: shoot ratio based on length was 0.969 for the controll group and 0.833 for the experimental group. The standard deviation was 0.271 for the controll group and 0.259 for the experimental group. (Figure 2) The results one-tailed two-sample t_test showed that the mean of root: shoot ratio based on mass for the controll group was not significently smaller than that of the experimental group. (t(1) = 0.376, p = 0.335, d.f. = 30) Also, the mean of root: shoot ratio based on length for the controll group was not significently larger than that of the experimental group. (t(1) = 1.449, p = 0.0789, d.f. = 30)


Discussion:
    As shown in the result, the root: shoot ratios based on both length and weight were not significently different between the controll and experimental group. This means that our hypothesis of that if herbivory is present, buckwheat would allocate more of its resources to its roots and root: shoot ratio would increase was not supported. Our hypothesis might be wrong because in the study of Caldwell as mentioned in the introduction, both the species grew new tillers after defoliation and the leaf blades of regrowing tillers had higher photosynthesis capacity, which indicated that plants would allocate more of their resources to its shoots rather than the roots after being attacked by the herbivore. [Caldwell: 1981] Also, Gadd, M. suggested in another study that plants respond to herbivory through above-ground regrowth. In their study, the simulated herbivory was associated with compensatory regrowth and branches whose leaves were removed grew faster and had more leaves one year later. [Gadd:2003] In his book, Staddon stated that the most critical determinant of resource allocation patterns within the plant would be natural selection acting at individual level to adapt to its environment. [Staddon:2013] In this case with herbivory, we concluded that the shoots of the plants were being attacked and thus the amount, fitness and performance of leaves are selected within each plant. To avoid the deficiency in photosynthesis because the reduced leaves by herbivores, plants would allocate their resources to grow more leaves that are better in function. On the other hand, we noticed the great standard deviation in the root: shoot ratio based on length. We proposed that it was due to experimental errors. When measuring the root length, we measured the roots from where the color of the stem turned white. Also, when separating the roots, they were tangled together. We might have accidentally damaged the root since the roots of buckwheat are fragile. These would both lead to the great standard deviation. To get the best result, in the future, we should use actual herbivores such as insects instead of simulating the scene by clipping the plants. Also, we should experiment with a few other species to compare and determine the effect of herbivory on different species and the various strategies these species utilize to protect themselves.
