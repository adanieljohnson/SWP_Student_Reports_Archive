Title: The Difference of Photosynthesis Rates in Spinach (spinacia oleracea) and Kale (Brassica oleracea var. Sabellic) Chloroplasts as Measured with DCIP

Abstract:
	This experiment studies the rate of photosynthesis in chloroplasts from kale (Brassica oleracea var. Sabellic) and spinach (spinacia oleracea). The plants need light exposure to run photosynthesis. There were samples of each placed in high intensity light environments, while a control was kept in room light. It was expected that the light samples would have a faster rates of photosynthesis than the controls. And the spinach and kale chloroplasts would demonstrate different rates. DCIP was used as an alternate electron acceptor that was used to track electron movement and photosynthesis rate through absorbance. The samples were observed over a 30 minute period with absorbance recorded every 10 minutes. It was found that the hypothesizes were supported. Both light samples showed much larger percent change than their respective control. And the spinach chloroplasts demonstrated a much faster rate of photosynthesis than kale. This was found to be most likely due to the fact that spinach can grow well in shade while kale is a sun plant. 


Introduction:
Photosynthesis is one of the most important metabolic process carried out by plants. Chlorophyll molecules in chloroplasts begin the process by absorbing photons which excites electrons causing them to leave their initial carrier molecule. Each photon absorbed excites an electron, the excited electrons then build up and create a positive and negative charged areas within the chloroplast membrane. This separation of charge represents stored energy [Youvan and Marrs, 1987]. These excited electrons cause a chemical reaction that cleaves water. This cleavage results in two things: 1. Release of more electrons to replace the ones that have moved and 2. Generation of a proton gradient. This proton gradient, along with high energy electrons, stored as NADPH, power ATP synthesis. NADPH is the result of the reduction of NADP+, meaning electrons on NADPH are very high in energy. NADPH and ATP electrons are then used in reactions to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide as summarized in the following equation:
6CO2 + 12H2O C6H12O6 + 6H2O + 6O2
Photosynthesis is divided into 3 substages. The first two stages are considered light dependent reactions. These are the stages when photons generate NADPH and the reactions occur that create a proton gradient. As seen in previous experiments, a chlorophyll’s exposure to light is crucial for photosynthetic activity [Malone and Neale, 1981]. Absorption of photons causes the electrons to move from one carrier to another, meaning exposure to light is crucial. In the light-independent stage and enzyme, RUBISCO, uses ATP and reducing power in NADPH to combine CO2 with ribose phosphate to create glucose. 
During photosynthesis, electron transport chains in chloroplasts will pass electrons to acceptors beside NADP+. NADP+ is very difficult to measure in a general lab setting, so using other acceptors is a better way to track photosynthesis and electron activity. An alternative acceptor is DCIP. Oxidized DCIP is dark blue with an aromatic ring structure that absorbs light maximally at 600nm. However, reduced DCIP has a conjugated carbon-carbon double bond and is colorless. This color change can be measured as a decrease in absorbance at 600nm. 
In this experiment, photosynthesis is tracked using DCIP to monitor electron activity in both kale (Brassica oleracea var. sabellic) and spinach (spinacia oleracea) leaves when they are exposed to different amounts of light. Both plants will have control samples in normal light and samples in enhanced light. Based on the findings of previous studies and background information, the DCIP absorbance in the enhanced light samples will record reduced DCIP absorbance [Malone and Neale, 1981]. This would mean photosynthesis is occurring and electrons are moving. The absorbance will also likely decrease in the normal light samples, but not to the same degree. There is also likely to be a difference in absorbance between the spinach plants and the kale plants. It is unclear which will have a faster rate of photosynthesis, but they are unlikely to be the same based on different chemical makeup. There has not been extensive research on the specific different photosynthesis rates between kale and spinach, mean it is difficult to predict between the two which will be faster. 

Materials and Methods:
Leaves from both kale and spinach were used in this experiment. A mortar and pestle, a medium sized beaker and 2, 50mL centrifuge tubes were placed on ice. While they were cooling the veins were removed from 4 spinach leaves and 4 kale leaves. Which were then rinsed and dried. While the mortar and pestle was still cold we added the spinach or kale leaves and 10mL of cold grinding buffer and ground until pasty. Another 10mL do grinding buffer was added and the solution was then strained through three layers of cloth in a chilled beaker. The collected green liquid was transferred into a chilled 50mL centrifuge and spun at 200G for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was poured out of the tube into a second chilled 50mL centrifuge. This was then spull at 1,000G for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was then removed but we were careful not to disturb the pellet. 20mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and was suspended by stirring it gently with a transfer pipet. Next, we labeled 13 large test tubes and placed them in a rack. Three kale control, three kale light, three spinach control and three spinach light tubes were prepared with 6 mL water, 2mL 130 mM DCIP, and 2mL reaction buffer at pH 6.5. The blank tube was prepared with 8 mL water, and 2mL reaction buffer at pH 6.5.
To begin the assay we added 100𝛍L of the enriched chloroplasts prepared above, kale to the first six and a blank and spinach to the second six and a blank. Each tube was then immediately mixed after adding the chloroplast solution and the mixtures were transferred to the spectrometer cuvettes. The spectrostrometer was immediately blanked using tube 0 (blank) and measured all of the samples. Tubes 4-6 and 10-12 were placed in light while 1-3 and 7-9 in a normal setting. After 10 minutes we repeated the absorption reading, and then again another time for a total of 30 minutes and four readings. A two sample t-test was used to analyse the data. 


Results:
The P value from two-sample t-test for the kale light sample with the kale control was 0.00385. The P value for the spinach light sample and control was 0.0220. The value for the kale light sample and the spinach light sample was 0.00834.

	Both the kale and spinach light samples demonstrated a larger percent change than their corresponding control. Kale light had a final change of 44.1% while the control was only 27.3% (Figure 1). Spinach light had a 79.4% change and the control was 43.4% (Figure 2). Both of these experiments are statistically significant because they provide a confidence interval above 95%. Spinach chloroplasts reported larger changes in absorbance when compared to kale for both control and light samples. Spinach light demonstrated a 79.4% change and the kale was 44.1% (Figure 3).  


Discussion:
Initially we hypothesized that the absorbance of the samples in light would demonstrate a large decreased absorbance at 600nm than their corresponding controls. We also hypothesized that there would be a difference in absorbance between the kale and spinach light samples because the chloroplasts had a different rate of photosynthesis. The results of our experiment proved both of these hypothesize to be correct. Both Figure 1 and Figure 2 demonstrate that, although the rate of change might have varied, overal the samples placed in light showed a greater percent change in absorbance by the end of the experiment. The spinach light sample demonstrated the largest change at 79.4%, while its control was only 43.4% (Figure 2). The kale chloroplast results showed similar trends. The light sample changed by 44.1% after 30 minutes while the control had only changed 27.3% (Figure 1). It is important to note that our hypothesise did expect some change in the control samples as they were not completely placed in the dark. They experienced room level light and the chloroplasts would therefore be expected to proceed with some level of photosynthesis. These results are similar to those found in other studies mentioned in the introduction [Malone and Neale, 1981]. It was found light exposure was one of the key controlling factors in a plants ability to carry out photosynthesis. 
The second part of our hypothesis can also be supported with resulting data shown in Figure 3. The final spinach change was 79.4% while kale was only 44.1% (Figure 3). Although they both showed significantly larger change when compared with the respective control, the spinach chloroplasts clearly had a fast rate of photosynthesis under the conditions. In fact, the change in the kale light sample was only 0.3% above the spinach control. When directly comparing kale and spinach, spinach proved to be faster. Overall, the experiment was well carried out and left little opportunity for error. 
It is interesting that there is such a disparity between the spinach and kale light samples. Most research does not point to different photosynthesis rates between different species. However, one study observed the difference in photosynthesis rates between sun and shade plants [Boardman, 1977]. It was found that shade plants can usually carry out photosynthesis at a faster rate. This was believed to be the case because plants in shade must be very efficient with the sunlight they are exposed to. Upon further research, I learned spinach is one of the most tolerant vegetables that grow in shade [Arsenault, 2016]. This explains the large disparity between the spinach and kale light samples. Kale normally grows in the sun and therefore has a slower photosynthesis rate than that of spinach, which can grow in the shade. 
Further studies could be done on the difference in photosynthesis rates between shade and light plants. This can aid in the general growth of plants as well as discovering ways to effectively increase food production. This same experiment can be carried out between a variety of species and while manipulating other variables such as temperature.
