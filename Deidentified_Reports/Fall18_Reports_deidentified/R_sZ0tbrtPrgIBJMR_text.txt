Title: The Difference of Photosynthesis Between Kale and Spinach 

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is one of the processes in which organisms use the energy captured from the sun. In this lab, the effects of added light vs no added light and it’s effects on the change in absorbance in both spinach(spinicia oleracea) and kale(Brassica oleracea var. sabellic) chloroplasts were observed through the use of DCIP as the electron acceptor in the Hill Reaction. It was hypothesized that a difference between plant types and rates of absorption would be apparent and the chloroplasts in the additional light would have greater changes in absorbance than their respective controlls. The results showed a clear trend as the rate of change of absorbance was much higher in the kale and spinach in light compared to their respective controlls as the percent change of absorbance in the Kale controll was an average of 22% change, while the kale in light had an average 42% change in absorbance. The Spinach controll had an average percent change of 28% while the spinach in light had an average of 71%. Therefore, the hypothesis were proven correct. It was concluded that more DCIP was being reduced in the added light sample compared to controlls and in spinach compared to kale, as their absorbance dropped more and the percent change in absorbances were higher.

Introduction:
In order to live, organisms need to extract energy to use in different cellular processes. Photosynthesis is one of the processes in which organisms use the energy captured from the sun. The energy can be stored as covalent bonds, redox potential, and an electrical or chemical gradient across a bilayer. The energy can further be use in many metabolic processes. In this lab, the process of photosynthesis is the main focus of the lab. Photosynthesis produces glucose, water, and molecular oxygen. It’s reaction is shown:                                                                                                   
                                       6CO_(2 )+6H_2 O+light energy→ C_6 H_12 O_6+6O_2  
 Photosynthesis occurs in 3 steps, 2 light dependent steps that use light to create a proton gradient and form NADPH, and a final light independent step that creates the 6 carbon glucose molecule. More specifically, in the light dependent reactions, light is used to excite electrons on chloroplasts in order to cleave water and create a proton gradient (II) and produce NADPH (I) [Sakai 2018]. When the electrons are excited through photon absorption, a proton gradient is created through negative and positive charges along the outer membrane of the chloroplasts. [Youvan and Barry 1987] The electron transfer process is called the Hill Reaction, in which DCIP used as an electron acceptor, in order to observe this reaction and determine what environmental conditions affect the transfer of electrons and overall rate of photosynthesis. The reaction is listed below:
2H_2 O+2DCIP→2DCIPH_2+ O_2
 The organisms of study are Kale, Brassica oleracea var. sabellic, and Spinach, spinicia oleracea. In this lab, the effects of added light vs no added light and it’s effects on the change in absorbance in both spinach and kale chloroplasts will be observed. A difference between plant types and rates of absorption is also expected due to variance in leaf species. Based on previously conducted studies, the chloroplasts in added light are predicted to have greater rates of photosynthesis [Arnon 1952]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the chloroplasts in the additional light with have greater changes in absorbance than their respective controlls as the rate of photosynthesis would be higher causing their absorbances to drop a greater proportions. 


Materials and Method:
To begin, the large veins from 3 small spinach leaves and one large kale leaf were removed. The leaves were then washed and dried. The next processes were performed on the kale and spinach leaves separately. The leaves were added to the cold mortar and pestle along with 10Ml of grinding buffer and ground until it was a paste. Another 10 Ml of grinding buffer was added and mixed in before being strained by a 3 layered cheese cloth. Then, 200ul of the liquid is stored on ice and labeled sample of A. The rest of the liquid is poured into a centrifuge tube and labeled Sample A. The centrifuge was then balanced and spun at 200x G for 3min at 4 degrees Celsius with Sample A. Sample A was then poured into centrifuge B, avoiding transferring any debris that had previously settled. Then, 200ul of B was placed into a microtube and labeled Sample B. B was then centrifuged at 1,000 x G for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. After being centrifuged, B was poured into a 05 Ml tube labeled C, once again avoiding the pellets. Then B was put on ice. Following that, 20 Ml of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and was stirred gently. Then, 3 replicants of the mixtures and shown below in Image 1 were created, labelling 12 test tubes 1-12.

100 ul of enriched chloroplasts previously prepared were added to the tubes above, with 1-6 being kale and 7-12 being spinach. The solutions were then mixed and transferred to cuvettes. After transferring into the cuvettes, the spectrometer was blanked with the blank, or test tube 0, and the absorbances of the 12 cuvettes were taken and recorded at 600nm. Following the recordings, test tubes 1-3  and 7-9 were placed in a general light setting (just left on table with natural rooms light), while 4-6 and 10-12 were placed under a lamp for 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes, the absorbances were again taken and recorded. The tubes were once again placed in their respective light environments for 10 minutes until recorded again. This was repeated for a total of 30 minutes. In order to analyze the data, two sample t_tests were used.



Results:
When viewing the data in figure 2 and 4, it is clear that both the kale and spinach in light showed greater changes in the absorbances than their respective controlls. The Kale controll had an average of 22% change, while the kale in light had an average 42% change in absorbance with a P value of 0.0084. Spinach controll had an average percent change of 28% while the spinach in light had an average of 71% with a P value of 0.0232. The confidence interval was above 95% for both of these tests, deeming them statistically significent. It was also observable that the percent change in absorbance in spinach was 28% larger than the change of absorbance in kale (figure 3). 

Discussion:
Originally, it was hypothesized that the absorbances of the kale and spinach in added light would be lower than their respective controlls and their percent change of absorbance would be greater than their respective controlls. It was also hypothesized that there would be a difference in absorbance rates between kale and spinach. Both of the hypotheses were proven to be correct.  
	As seen in figures 2 and 4, the percent change of absorbance in the Kale controll was an average of 22% change, while the kale in light had an average 42% change in absorbance. Similarly, the Spinach controll had an average percent change of 28% while the spinach in light had an average of 71% . This shows that in the light samples for both, as the time in light went on the absorbance got smaller and the percent change get larger. This allows for the conclusion that more DCIP was being reduced in the added light than in the controll samples. Further more, this shows that the rate of photosynthesis is greater in the samples with additional light. 
	As seen in figure 3, there was indeed a large difference between thee percent change of absorbance between kale and spinach. The spinach in light has an average percent change of absorbance of 71%, while the average percent change of kale was 34%. This allows for the conclusion that the Hill reaction was taking place at a greater rate, and DCIP was being reduced more in the spinach plant compared to the kale leaves. Although it cannot be concluded without further research, the difference in rates may be due to whether prnot spinach and kale or shade or sunlight plants. Based on a previous study, shade plants have greater densities of chlorophyll and therefore are more efficient at photosynthesis [Boardman 1977].
A way this experiment could be improved would be to do more than 2 samples in order to see a more constant trend. As mention in a previous study, fluctuations of rates of photosynthesis and light intensity could be attributed to variance among the amount of chloroplasts extracted in each sample [Peeters 1978]. Another way this experiment could be further studied would be to test more than just two species of plant.
