Title: Effects of soil acidity on root to shoot ratio in buckwheat plants

Abstract:
Understanding resource allocation can assist in emphasizing characteristics in plants, and is influenced primarily by environmental factors. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of plants would be lower in acidic soil than in neutral soil, and would therefore be less suitable than neutral soil. Buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, was used to determine the suitability of acidic (pH 3.5) soil to neutral (pH 7) soil, though vermiculite was used as a soil substitute. After 2 weeks of germination, there was no significent difference in the root to shoot ratios of plants watered with acidic water and normal water (t_stat = 0.416, d.f. = 4, P = 0.70). This indicates that acidic soil is not considered to be any more or less suitable for plant growth than neutral soil, and further that soil acidity may play a less vital role in resource allocation than hypothesized.


Introduction:
Resource allocation describes the tendency of organisms to make use of available energy and other assets in the manner best suited to the organism’s environment and specific needs. Understanding resource allocation in plants specifically can assist in encouraging plants to grow a certain way, such as attempts to understand why Agropyron desertorum, a type of bunchgrasss, has such a high grazing tolerance, and perhaps use this understanding to increase the grazing tolerance of more finicky plants [Caldwell: 1981]. Furthermore, manipulation of plant growth and resource allocation may have uses in commercial agriculture, when trying to obtain a larger root or leaf/stem growth per plant. This experiment used buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, to study the effects of acidic soil on the root to shoot ratio of plants, furthermore, if acidic soil is unsuitable for plant growth. Buckwheat is an ideal model organism due to its commonness and accelerated germination. In the event that soil pH negatively affects the availability of soil nutrients, or the uptake ability of plants, the root structure of the plant should compensate by growing larger, relative to the total plant size. We hypothesize that plants grown at in a pH of 3.5 will have a lower root to shoot ratio than plants grown in pH 7 soil.


Materials and Method:
Six square pots were filled with vermiculite (pH 7) and divided into two trays labeled “acid” and “controll,” respectively. Twelve shallow holes were made in each pot, about half an inch deep. One to two buckwheat seeds were placed in each hole, and covered with surrounding vermiculite. The pots were watered until uniforMly moist and given 50 Ml of liquid fertilizer each. The trays were left in a climate-controllled environment with access to natural light for two weeks. The controll tray pots were watered with normal water and the acid tray pots special 3.5 pH water mix once every day. After two weeks, three sprouts from each pot were extracted from the vermiculite by gently breaking the vermiculite apart in a tub filled with 2 inches of water. The stalks were then rinsed of all remaining vermiculite, patted dry, and weighed individually. The samples were then cut apart into root and stem, with the point of pigment change between them serving as the cut-off. The shoots, or stems, of the plants were also weighed, and the root mass was determined by subtracting the shoot weight from the total weight of the sample. The maximum root and shoot length per pot was also recorded. A two-tailed t_test was used for statistical analysis of the controll and acid groups.

Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio for the mass of controll plants was 0.15 and the mean root to shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.17 (Fig.1). The mean root to shoot ratio for length in the controll plants was 0.57 and the mean root to shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.51 (Fig.2).  The standard deviation for mass in the controll plants was 0.028 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.039 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for length in controll plants was 0.19 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.11 (Fig.2). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results, with a critical value of 0.05. The mean of the length controll group was not statistically significently different than that of the length experimental group (t_stat = 0.416, d.f. = 4, P = 0.70). Overall appearance and growth of the plants appeared uniform at the end of the experiment. Results indicate both the controll and experimental plants had similar length and weight (Fig.1 and 2). Both experimental and controll demonstrated the same growth pattern.


Discussion:
This experiment yielded no strong evidence of the unsuitability of acidic soil for plant growth. This could be due to the resilience of buckwheat or similar lack of soil microbes in both the neutral and acidic vermiculite. This could be due to carbon loss found in soil that has a pH over 6.2, balancing out negative effects of pH 3.5 soil, or a lack of negative impact from pH 3.5 soil entirely [Malik: 2018]. Other impacts of more a more basic pH include insolubility of iron [Morgan: 2013]. However, one would think that, due to the dependency of biological systems on enzymes, that vastly different soil pH ranges would have some impact of soil nutrient uptake. Due to non-covalent interactions and their effects on protein conformation, enzymes perform best in specific ranges, leading to the possibility that the enzymes involved in soil nutrient uptake/processing either have a vast active pH range, or are not as involved with this particular biological process, making it a more physically dependent function. Further experimentation at a variety of pH values would be a worthwhile endeavor, and perhaps give insight as to the more intricate processes behind nutrient uptake in the roots.
