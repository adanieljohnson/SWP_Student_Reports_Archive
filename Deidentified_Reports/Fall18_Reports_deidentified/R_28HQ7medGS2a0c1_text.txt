Title: The effect of plant spacing on the growth of Pisum sativun

Abstract:
The growth of field peas (Pisum sativun) is affected by many diverse factors. One of them being how it allocates its resources. To test whether resource allocation could affect its growth, its root and shoot growth will be measured in accordance to the amount of space the seed is allowed to germinate in. It is expected that the root to shoot weight ratio for field peas grown in a high seed density environment will be higher as space is a limiting factor and they will allocate more resources to grow their roots in order to get the right nutrients for effective growth. Our data showed a significent difference in root to shoot weight ratio. This significance suggests that a lower density environment would be desirable as the plant will not exhaust itself by allocating its resources to root growth and instead shoot growth.

Introduction:
This experiment evaluates the growth of Field peas (Pisum sativun), which are primarily used for human consumption. They have a high level of amino acids, starch, fiber, and other micronutrients. [Mishra: 2012] [Boye: 2015] Adding these into one's diet would be beneficial as it also contains high levels of certain amino acids which are low in cereal grains. [Oelke: 1991] The addition of this to a diet will replenish stores for those amino acids. When growing a plant, its yield and growth rate would be preferably high to maximize one's yield. Thus, it is important to optimize method for planting these seeds. Field peas can produce over 5,000 lbs of dry matter when grown right. [Clark: 2007] Some may suggest that seeds should be planted at a higher density over an area in order to increase the chance that the seeds germinate. However, when seeds are planted in an overcrowded space, there may be detrimental consequences. Plants need space to spread their roots and shoots. If they are not able to do so then nutrient deficiency, root disease, and poor flowering may occur. [Sattell: 1998] In this lab, we will observe the growth of the field peas (Pisum sativun) in a crowded and not-crowded condition. The hypothesis for this experiment is that field peas grown in a high seed density environment will have a higher root to shoot ratio. This is predicted because space is a limiting factor and they will allocate more resources to grow their roots in order to get the right nutrients for effective growth.

Materials and Method:
Preparation of Plants	
Obtain 8 pots and fill it with vermiculite. Add 5 Ml of MiracleGro to each pot, distribute evenly over the surface of vermiculite. Label 4 pots with high density and the other 4 with low density. In the high density pots, plant 20 seeds. In the low density pots, plant 10 seeds. Make sure the seeds are evenly spaced out and are planted 2 inches deep into the vermiculite in all of the pots. Water the plants every day for 1.5 weeks. 

Plant Harvesting and Measurement	 
Harvest plant by pulling them out carefully out of the vermiculite and submerge in water to break apart the vermiculite. Pat dry with paper towels. Weigh 5 whole plants together and record the weight. Separate the roots from shoots by cutting each plant at the roo-shoot junction and remove the seed. Weigh the shoots of the same 5 whole plants and record the data. Do the same for the roots and repeat for all conditions.

Statistical Analyses 
Use a two-sample t_test to calculate the one-tailed p_value to determine whether or not data is significent for the root:shoot ratios of the high and low density conditions.

Results:
The mean root:shoot weight ratio for the low density plants was 1.315 and the mean root:shoot weight ratio for the high density plants was 1.6 (Fig.1). The standard deviation for the low density plants was 0.199415813 and the standard deviation for the high density plants was 0.119163753 (Fig.1). The standard deviation for length in controll plants was 0.0908 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.1264 (Fig.1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze the data. The mean of the root:shoot weight ratio for the low density plants was statistically significently different than that of the high density plants (t_stat = 2.453647, d.f. = 6, P = 0.049545).

When plants were harvested, there was a visible difference in root and shoot growth for the two conditions. Plants in the low density condition had less root growth than that of plants in the high density condition. However, plants in the low density condition also had visibly longer shoots than that of the high density condition. The coloring of the root and shoot were the same.

The results show that plants in the low density environment have a smaller R:S weight ratio (closer to 1 or an even growth in both root and shoot) while the plants in the high density environment have a larger R:S weight ratio (larger than 1). 


Discussion:
According to the data, our hypothesis in this experiment is supported. We observed a significent difference in R:S weight ratio in the two conditions at the 0.05 level. This suggests that plants in the high density environment have a larger root weight than shoot weight. With the knowledge that plants will allocate resources based on what they need, and since there are more plants in the same area, there will be more competition for resources. The results make sense that in a limited/crowded space that the plant will allocate its energy to grow its roots in order to obtain the nutrients it needs. For people who want to grow field peas (Pisum sativun), a lower density environment would be desirable as the plant will not exhaust itself by allocating its resources to root growth.
