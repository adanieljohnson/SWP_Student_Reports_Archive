Title: The Effect of Cold Temperature on Male Betta Splendens Intraspecies Behavior

Abstract:
In this experiment, the effect of water temperature on the time it would take male betta fish to bite each other. It was hypothesized that the male betta fish in the colder water would take longer to react to each other than when tested in the room temperature water. Three groups, consisting of two male betta fish, were tested for up to 5 minutes, or until contact was made, in 15 degrees Celsius and 18 degrees Celsius water. The resulting mean difference calculated from the experiment was not significant (t-stat=1.295, df=2, p=0.325). As such, the hypothesis was rejected, and cold water did not decrease contact time between male betta fish.

Introduction:
Betta fish, also known as Betta Splendens, are popular subjects for experiments about behavior, especially intraspecies behavior. A lot of resources that betta fish acquire are allocated towards aggressive behaviors used for competition and mating [Johnson: 2018]. These aggressive behaviors vary in severity and type: broadside and facing movements [Johnson: 2018]. In order of least to most aggressive behaviors are pelvic fin flickering or erect pectoral fins, tail beating or spreading opercula, and tail flashing or protruding branchiostegal membrane [Johnson: 2018]. Those agonistic behaviors culminate in biting, which the male betta fish use to deter or kill their competition. Due to domestic breeding, betta fish are retaining one of their agonistic behaviors known as “fighting colors”, which are vibrant and a stimulant for male betta fish to begin aggressive behavior [Todd: 2008]. In contrast, wild male betta fish are actually dull in color, and only display brighter, more vivacious colors when excited by another male’s challenge [Johnson: 2018]. Male betta fish who are the quickest to display aggressive behaviors, like tail beating, have an advantage over their opponent, who chooses to use that information to decide whether to engage or flee the encounter [Castro: 2006]. In colder temperatures, animals are required to use more resources to maintain body temperature [Cho: 1982]. Based on that information, it is hypothesized that colder temperatures will decrease the time it takes male betta fish to make contact compared to room temperature.

Materials and Methods:
Six male betta fish were obtained for the experiment. The six male betta fish were divided into three groups, with each group having two male betta fish. Each group was tested twice, once in room temperature water of 18 degrees Celsius, and again in slightly colder water of 15 degrees Celsius. In each trial, with six total trials, the chosen group of male betta fish were placed together, with no divider. They were monitored during the interaction to determine when the male betta fish would make physical contact. The time was measured in seconds to quantify the aggressive behavior of the male betta fish. If the time exceeded five minutes with no contact, it was concluded the male betta fish would not make contact. The individual male betta fish were isolated after each interaction for five minutes, with no way to make physical contact or visually see another male betta. The water was cooled down by gradually adding ice to the tank with thermometer in it with an approximate ten second delay, and no more ice was placed in the tank after 15 degrees Celsius was achieved. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine if the amount of time it took male betta fish to make contact in cold water was statistically significant compared to in warm water.

Results:
The mean time it took the male betta fish to make contact in 18 degrees Celsius water was 122 seconds +/- 24.76 (figure 1). Similarly, the mean time it took the male betta fish to make contact in 15 degrees Celsius water was 142 seconds +/- 28.024 (figure 1). The statistical test showed that the mean difference between the room temperature water and the colder water was not significant (t-stat=1.295, df=2, p=0.325). A slight reaction was observed in the colder temperature water, as the male betta fish did take longer to make contact, but it was not a significantly longer amount of time.

Discussion:
The hypothesis that male betta fish would take longer to make physical contact in colder water was rejected. The colder temperature did not have a statistically significant impact on how long it takes male betta fish to make contact during an interaction. The mean time for the colder water was only slightly longer than that of the experiments done in the room temperature water, and not drastically different. It was previously expected that, as the temperature became colder, the male betta fish would be allocating more of their resources towards maintaining their body temperature instead of displaying agonistic behaviors [Johnson: 2018]. An improvement to the lab would be to make a more drastic change to the temperature. However, a three degrees Celsius difference may not have been enough of a contrast in temperatures to warrant a palpable change in the male betta aggressive behaviors, while in contrast a more vast difference of about six degrees could have resulted in a more extreme result [Hess: 1952].The fish may not have had time to properly adjust their body systems to the colder water, so their metabolism rates could have been operating faster than is usual for betta fish in colder water.  Also, other factors go into the interaction between male betta fish. Body size causes an automatic agnostic advantage for male betta fish, and the size differences of the male betta fish could have negatively impacted the results so it took longer for the fish to make physical contact [Bronstein: 1984]. Another external factor is the strength of the visual stimulation provided by the opponent fish. Stimulations that are more intense tend to cause long-duration attacks [Bronstein: 1983]. In conclusion, making a temperature colder does not affect the amount of time it takes for two male betta fish to make physical contact when interacting.
