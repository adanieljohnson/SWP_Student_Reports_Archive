Title: The effects of Ecdysterone blockers on Manduca sexta growth and pupation 

Abstract:
Hormones are an integral part of growth in organisms, and in Manduca sexta two hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, are the most important hormones in growth. In this experiment, we were testing the effects of a 20E blocker on the species Manduca sexta. We hypothesized that caterpillars with a 20E blocker would not pupate and would weigh more than the controll group. We weighed our caterpillars every day for 2 weeks and conducted a 2-sample t_test to compare the two groups and found that there was not a statistical difference between the weight of the controll group and the treatment group. 

Introduction:
Hormones change and effect biological processes in living organisms; including reproduction, temperature regulation and growth. In the species Manduca sexta, more commonly known as tobacco hornworm, growth is seen in six stages, 5 larvae stages and a pupa stage, where the larvae transitions into an adult. The larvae stages are characterized by segmented, soft-bodied organisms who eat leaves, whereas pupa are characterized by reduced movement and are enclosed in a protective cocoon. The final transition occurs when the pupa molts its cocoon and emerges as an adult. These six stages are regulated together by the nervous and endocrine systems. This experiment will examine with the endocrine system, specifically the role of ecdysterone in growth and pupation of Manduca sexta. Ecdysterone (20E) is a steroid hormone that is secreted from the back of the head and controlls the timing of the pupa molting. Ecdysterone and juvenile hormone (JH) work together to controll the growth and metamorphosis of the Manduca sexta; near the end of the last larvae stage of the Manduca, JH decreases drastically and a small rise in 20E, called the commitment pulse, signal to the Manduca to start the beginning stages of pupation [Johnson AD: 2018]. 
	In an experiment done by Lynn Riddiford, they were looking at the effect of 20E induced metamorphous when the commitment pulse has been initiated. They then initiated a fake commitment pulse in Manduca, in their 4th larvae instead of the 5th, and saw the larvae transition from a larva into a pupa, instead of into the 5th larvae stage. This experiment also discovered that there are multiple types of ecdysterone that play different roles in the body of the caterpillar; that even when a higher concentration of JH is present in the caterpillar, when 20E that is used for initiating pupation is introduced in the organism, pre-mature pupation occurs in the 4th larvae stage [Riddiford: 1977]. This experiment is an important finding, because it emphasizes the role that 20E has on the pupation rates. However, this experiment does not show what the effects would be if 20E was blocked during the organism’s development. In our experiment, we will we determining what effects a 20E blocker will have on the caterpillar’s growth and pupation rates. We hypothesize that if Manduca sexta are given ecdysterone blocker, they will not pupate and will weigh more than caterpillars that are not given ecdysterone blocker. The null and alternate hypotheses are as stated below: 
			H0= No significent difference between the weight of caterpillars with ecdysterone blocker than caterpillars without ecdysterone blocker
			Ha= Significant difference between the weight of caterpillars with ecdysterone blocker than caterpillars without ecdysterone blocker


Materials and Method:
Eight caterpillars were chosen, at similar points in their lifecycle, and separated into 2 groups; the controll group (caterpillars 1-4) and the treatment group (caterpillars 5-6). Individual containers for each caterpillar were prepared with air holes poked into the sides. The caterpillars were weighed and placed in the containers and each container was labeled with the respective caterpillar number. Each group is fed 10g of food and 6 drops of ecdysterone blocker is added to each of the treatment group’s food. The caterpillars are weighed every day for two weeks and fed when they run out of food; if one group still has food when all the others is gone, that caterpillar is not fed until it is time to clean out the containers. Containers are cleaned when the food is looking watery and slimy. 
After data collection is complete, we took the averages of the caterpillar’s weight over the span of the 2 weeks, the results of the controll group and treatment groups were compared using a 2-sample-t_test. 


Results:
Figure 1 and 2 show the weight of the caterpillars over a span of 2 weeks, and we can see that in the controll group (Figure 2), with no 20E blocker, there is a similar “peak weight” between the caterpillars as well as the peak weight occurring at a similar time. In Figure 2, with the 20E blocked caterpillars, have differing peak heights and they do not occur at similar days during the period. 
2 sample t_test was conducted on the average weights of the caterpillars and the p_value = 0.0904, and with an α-level of 0.05 is considered statistically insignificent. Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 


Discussion:
During our observations, the caterpillars who were given a 20E blocker never did pupate, which was part of our hypothesis, however, because the weight difference between the controll and the treatment was not statistically significent. We can see that the treatment group do not weigh as much as the controll group, but it was not by much. Because of mechanisms like commitment pulses, we assumed that 20E and JH hormone were inexplicably tied together; that if 20E never showed up then we would continue to see and increase in JH hormone. The experiment by Riddiford showed the 20E blocker decreased the weight of the caterpillars and kick starts pupation pre-maturely [Riddiford: 1977]. It was then hypothesized that the opposite action would cause caterpillars to continue to gain weight, because they wouldn’t have a signal to lose their water weight for pupation, and levels of JH would continue to rise. 
	We can see from our results that this is not the case, however. We are not sure what exactly occurs between JH and 20E from this experiment, but one way that we could determine how JH and 20E work together is to create treatment groups that have varying levels of JH and 20E. Based our results here, we could hypothesis that JH levels will have a higher impact of caterpillar weight than 20E.
