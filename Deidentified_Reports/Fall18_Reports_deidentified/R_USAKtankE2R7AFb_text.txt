Title: Photosynthetic effect of increasing salinity on chloroplasts extracted from Spinacia oleracea

Abstract:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. My experiments main objective is to determine how does increasing salinity levels affect the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts in the Spinacia oleracea. To conduct this experiment, we extracted chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea and used a spectrophotometer to calculate the absorbance and I used anova test to calculate significance. Our data found that salinity was found to not significantly affect the rate of photosynthesis.

Introduction:
Photosynthesis is the process in which plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. In this photosynthetic process, the energy from sunlight converts water and carbon dioxide to high energy sugars and oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs in a three-stage process. The first two stages are called the light-dependent reactions which generates NADPH. The last stage is called the light-independent reactions where glucose molecules are created. 
Photosynthesis is sensitive to different environmental factors. Salinity effects the rate of photosynthesis in plants due to reduced stomatal conductance and the restricted availability of CO2 for carboxylation. [Brugnoli: 1991]. Due to this there will be a buildup of O2 in the leaf from the light reactions which will make CO2 unavailable in the light-independent reactions. With this knowledge, in our experiment we posed the question, how does increasing salinity levels affect the photosynthetic activity of the chloroplasts in the Spinacia oleracea? We used spinach as our model organism due to the fact that it is chloroplast-dense and easily accessible. In a research article, it was concluded that for spinach, salt stress does not result in any major decrease in the photosynthetic potential of the leaf [Robinson: 1983]. With this knowledge, we hypothesized that increasing the salinity in Spinacia oleracea would not affect the rate of photosynthesis due to the compartmentation of ions within the cell, would prevent the accumulation of NaCl in the chloroplast. 


Materials and Methods:
In this experiment, we extracted chloroplasts from Spinacia oleracea to measure the effect of salinity. First, we cleaned spinach leaves with water and blotted to dry. We then removed the large central veins from 4 medium-sized spinach leaves and added them to a chilled mortar and pestle. Then we added 10 mL of cold grinding buffer (400 mM sucrose in Tricine buffer, pH 8.0) to the mortar and pestle and spinach leaves and grinded that into a thick paste. We then added an additional 10 mL of cold grinding buffer. Then we strained the entire mixture through 3 layers of cheesecloth into a chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube and spun it at 200 x G (1200 rpm in RT-7 centrifuge) for 3 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was poured out of the tube, without transferring debris, and into a second chilled 50 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1,000 x G (2800 rpm in the RT-7 centrifuge) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Then the supernatant was poured into a clean 50 mL tube without disturbing the pellet. Then, 20 mL of grinding buffer was added to the pellet and suspended by stirring gently with a transfer pipet. 
In preparation for the salinity experiment, 16 large test tubes were placed in a rack and prepared. We also prepared 3 different saltwater solutions by using the  equation and those solutions were made at 0.25 M, 0.50 M, and 1 M.  In the first test tube, it was used as the blank and contained 8 mL of water and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph). We used 3 test tubes as the negative control and they contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph) but contained no chloroplasts so that no reaction would occur. We used 3 test tubes as the positive control and they contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph) but these tubes did not contain salt in their water concentration. The next 3 test tubes were the experimental 1 and contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph) but the salt water concentration was 0.25 M. The next 3 test tubes were experimental 2 and contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph) but the salt water concentration was 0.50 M. The next 3 test tubes were experimental 3 and contained 6 mL of water, 2 mL of 130 mM DCIP, and 2 mL of the reaction buffer (100 mM phosphate, 6.5 ph) but the salt water concentration was 1 M. 
After we prepared the test tubes we added 100 μl of the enriched chloroplasts to test tubes #4-16 and mixed each tube immediately. We then transferred the mixtures into spectrophotometer cuvettes and then we blanked the spectrophotometer to 420 nm using the blank. We then measured the absorbance of all the samples at 420 nm. We then placed all the samples underneath a lamp for 10 minutes. The absorbance of each mixture was measured using the spectrophotometer every 10 minutes for 30 minutes. To analyze the collected data, an anova test was conducted, with p&lt;0.05 used to determine statistical significance.


Results:
The graph shows the photosynthetic activity for no chloroplasts, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.5M NaCl, and 1 M NaCl throughout the experiment in 10 minute intervals until 30 minutes elapsed.  The data from the chloroplasts treated with NaCl and the chloroplasts treated without NaCl was not statistically significant at any of the concentration levels (df=11, p= 0.636). An anova test was performed. In Figure 1, The 0.25 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and the 1 M NaCl all show a similar trend to each other with 0.25 M NaCl having the greatest change in its photosynthetic rate. In Figure 1, it also shows that there was a rapid increase in the rate of photosynthesis from the 20 to 30-minute time frame in the no chloroplasts.



Discussion:
The collected data supports our hypothesis. Salinity was found to not significantly affect the rate of photosynthesis. The mean measured change in absorbance in no chloroplasts, 0.25 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 M NaCl were very similar except for the one outlier in no chloroplasts from time 20 to 30 (Figure 1). Due to the p value of 0.636 there was no statistical significance between salinity and the rate of photosynthesis. Due to this calculation, the null hypothesis that there will not be a significant increase in photosynthetic with increasing salinity levels was supported by the data. But, the alternative hypothesis was not supported by data collected for the salinity levels. In previous studies observing the effects of salinity on the rate of photosynthesis in spinach chloroplasts has shown that the salt did not affect the photosynthetic rate. It was found that the photochemical efficiency of PSII was not affected by salt stress and that suggests that salt-tolerant cotton varieties may have a better protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes under salt stress [Meloni: 2003]. It was found that spinach and other plants have the ability to respond to the induced salinity by adapting. For example, they can change increase the activity of enzymes or the compartmentalization of ions. A possible explanation for our data could be due to stomatal conductance. It was found that increasing salinity can decrease stomatal conductance [Brugnoli: 1991]. There may have been some error in our experiment due to the fact that we set our spectrophotometer to 420 nm instead of 600 nm which would affect the rate at which DCIP was reduced. The next logical step for this experiment is to test different salts like KCl to see if the type of salt has any different effects. This experiment is important to the overall knowledge of biology because with many changes to the environment due to global warming and changing temperatures it is important to know how salt can affect photosynthesis in plants. For example, the impact if icy roads are salted we should know the impact if that salt ran over to plants.
