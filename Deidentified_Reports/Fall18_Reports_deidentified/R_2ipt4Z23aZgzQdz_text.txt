Title: The effect of gender on the reaction time of Betta splendins when presented with food

Abstract:
Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) is a fish that has been domesticated due to its unique aggressive behavior and beautiful colors. Male Betta splendins are especially eye-catching as they must engage in agnostic behaviors to protect their nests and assert dominance against other males. In this lab, we will be observing pairs of fish of the same gender with and without the presence of food in order to see if the addition of a valuable resource would affect the behavior of the fish. The hypothesis of this experiment is that male Betta splendins will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendins. Our data showed a significent difference (P=0.000017) in the time it took for the fish to notice each other. This significance suggests that male Betta splendins will display aggressive behaviors towards the other fish present when presented with valuable resources like food, suggesting that there is a dominance hierarchy.

Introduction:
Siamese fighting fish (Betta splendins) is a fish native to Southeast Asia and the unique aggressive behavior and beautiful colors of these fish have made it a common domesticated aquarium fish. [Braddock: 1955] In the domesticated fish market, the most extravagant looking fish of this species are the males. This is because the males spend a large amount of energy on the process of reproduction than female Betta splendins. [Justus: 2018] Male Betta splendins have been known to defend their territories against other males as well as court females using agnostic behaviors which refer to “any activity related to fighting, whether aggression or conciliation and retreat.” [Barrows: 2000] This includes fin erection, branchiostegal flaring, and tail beating. [Tillberg: 2010] Dominance is an important trait to male Betta splendins as they must protect their nest and territories against other males. [Todd: 2008] In this lab, we will be observing pairs of fish of the same gender with and without the presence of food in order to see if the addition of a valuable resource (food) would affect the behavior of the fish. With the knowledge that male Betta splendins tend to be more aggressive than females, the hypothesis of this experiment is that male Betta splendins will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendins.

Materials and Method:
Male-male fish interaction without food was conducted for 5 minutes. The time it took for fish to notice each other was measured using a stopwatch. Fish were then given at least 5 minutes of rest. The process was repeated on female-female fish pairings without food. Then, the observations were repeated on male-male and female-female pairings with the presence of food. Record all times, in seconds, for fish to notice one another. An ANOVA test was conducted to calculate the p_value and determine whether or not there was a significent difference between the time it took for fish to notice each other between the conditions.

Results:
The mean time it took for the male fish to notice each other was 49.67 ± 9.29 seconds for the ‘no food’ condition and 15.00 ± 5.00 seconds for the ‘with food’ condition. The mean time it took for the female fish to notice each other was 216 ± 34.51 seconds for the ‘no food’ condition and 61 ± 25.16 seconds for the ‘with food’ condition (Figure 1). An ANOVA test was used and it indicates that there is a significent difference (P=0.000017) in the time it took for the fish to notice each other.

Discussion:
With reference to the ANOVA test, the p_value generated is significent according to the alpha of 0.05. The Tukey-Kramer test also shows that there is a significent difference between some groups. It indicates that the males and females behave differently, that female behavior is different when there is a presence of food, and that male behavior is not different with the presence of food. The results support the hypothesis that male Betta splendins will be less distracted by the presence of food than female Betta splendins. It can be concluded that male Betta splendins will display aggressive behaviors towards the other fish present when presented with valuable resources like food, suggesting that there is a dominance hierarchy. Past studies have indicated that fish of both sex form dominance hierarchies in the presence of a community [Goldstein: 1975] Reinforced with the fact that male Betta splendins are the ones that have to protect the nests and territories, it makes sense that they are less distracted by the food than females as it is key to their survival that they are aggressive. [Todd: 2008] Further studies could possibly look into the presence of an audience and food. The addition of an audience could be interesting since dominance hierarchies exist and it may affect the agnostic displays of the fish, in relation to where it lies in the dominance hierarchy of the community it’s in.
