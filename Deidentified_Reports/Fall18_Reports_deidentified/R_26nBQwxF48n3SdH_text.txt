Title: Male and female Betta splendens response time to another betta of the same gender with and without the presence of food

Abstract:
Animal behavior is studied in order to draw connections and evolutionary significance between and within species. In this particular study, we were observing both male and female Betta splendens with and without the presence of food in order to determine what males and females respectively are more motivated by for optimum survival: the presence of another betta of the same gender or food availability. We observed a male in the presence of another male and a female in the presence of another female and recorded when the two fish took notice of each other, then we added food to those same conditions and recorded at which time the two fish noticed each other. We found that males and females differ in the time it takes for them to notice each other with food present, and that females display a difference in notice time with food versus without food. We hypothesize that these results would be due to the fact that males invest more in reproduction than females and thus must be more aware of the imminent threat of attack to protect their territory and nests.

Introduction:
The study of animal behavior is called ethology. We study this in order to understand the importance of specific behaviors and the overall fitness of a species and to draw evolutionary connections. In this experiment we will be studying Betta splendens, common aquarium fish that originated in Southeast Asia. Normally, wild males are gray, but they can turn bright red or blue when intimidated by other males. Besides color change, they may also exhibit broadside and facing movements. These obvious intraspecific behaviors make Betta splendens excellent organisms of study, not to mention, they display sexual dimorphism: phenotypic differences between males and females of a species [Snekser: 2006]. Males have larger bodies and longer fins. Interestingly, female bettas are much less aggressive; in fact, when given a choice, female bettas prefer to live in groups [Snekser: 2006]. Males do not exhibit this because they must fight for their own territory to build bubble nests in, since males put more effort into their reproduction than do the females [Justus: 2018]. In this experiment, we were attempting to determine what male and female Betta splendens are more pressured by for optimum survival (respectively): the presence of another fish of the same species and gender or food availability. We quantified our data by measuring how long it takes for the fish to notice each other in the presence of food and without it. We believed that females would notice the food immediately and would show minimal aggression or attention to the other female when food was present, since they generally prefer to coexist in groups. On the other hand, we predicted that males would remain aggressive with one and other regardless of food availability and will become alert immediately after being exposed to another male in any circumstance. In short, we hypothesize that there will be a significant difference in response time between males and females with and without food.

Materials and Methods:
First, we obtained two divided fish tanks with water. In one, we had one male betta fish on each side of the divider and in the other we had one female on each side. One layer of the divider was clear and one was opaque. We removed the opaque portion of the divider in each tank and recorded the behavior of the males and females respectively for five minutes. Specifically, we recorded at what time the fish noticed one and other, approaching the divider. We did this three times with five minutes of rest between each testing period during which we put the opaque dividers back in place. Next, we removed the opaque dividers from each tank while also placing food into each side of the divider and recorded the behaviors of the males and females. Again, we noted at what time the fish noticed each other. We did this three times with five minutes of rest between each repetition. Finally, we used an ANOVA test to calculate the means of each group and the one-tailed p value. We evaluated our results using an alpha of .05. We used a Tukey-Kramer test to determine which groups showed a significant difference between each other. 



Results:
The p value is .000017. The averages (in seconds) for each group in their order on the graph are 29.77, 15, 216 and 61. The females took the longest of any group to notice each other when they had no food (216 seconds). The standard deviations in their order on the graph are 9.29, 5, 31.45, and 25.16. The letters above the bars denote significant differences between males and females both with and without food, as well as a difference among the females with food and without food. 

Discussion:
Figure 1 shows that our data produced a p value of .000017. This is less than the alpha of .05, thus we can conclude that there is a significant difference between certain groups in our experiment. After running a Tukey-Kramer test, we found out that there is a significant difference between the females without food and the females with food, and between the males and females both with and without food. This gives support to our initial hypothesis. However, there are a few caveats. One is that females still noticed each other even when food was present. This could be due to the fact that placing food in the water caused the fish to swim closer to the glass and thus take prolonged notice of the fish on the other side. Second, we observed that male bettas still acknowledge the food eventually despite seeing the imminent threat of another male, although they displayed aggressive broadside behaviors even while eating. We believe this could be caused by habituation; these test fish have been in the lab for a week and may be used to the constant stimuli of having another male present, thus knowing it is not an immediate a threat [Halperin: 1997]. This could further be explained by the fact that, since males put more effort into reproduction, the success of hatchery is also largely dependent on access to nutrients found in food, and the males may have been attempting to feed themselves in order to gain strength to prepare for potential offspring in the future [Sipauba-Tavares: 2016]. Still, the females took much longer to notice each other in the presence of food than did the males, thus showing that males are more aware of the possibility of competition even when there are nutrients available. We believe that this could be due to the fact that males need to fight for territory against other males to build bubble nests for reproduction whereas the fitness of a female is not impacted by this factor; they need food more than a territory to reproduce [Justus: 2018]. To support this, we could study the behavior of a male and a female together with and without the presence of food in order to determine if males show the same level of aggression during feeding when a female is present instead of a male. Males invest more into reproduction than females, but since females are also necessary for said reproduction, we could determine whether or not males value their own territory and food over the desire to have a potential mate. In previous studies, females have been deterred by overly-displaying males [Clotfelter ED: 2006]. Similarly, overly vigorous males also have fewer eggs in their nests, thus males have an incentive to not show overly ambitious aggressive movement in the presence of potential mates [Clotfelter ED: 2006].
