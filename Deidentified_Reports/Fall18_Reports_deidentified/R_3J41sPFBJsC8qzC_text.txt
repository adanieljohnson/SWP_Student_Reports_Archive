Title: Caffeine injection causes increased muscular contraction amplitude in Rana pipiens

Abstract:
The effect of caffeine on the body as a stimulant is well known. It is used by a large percentage of the western world to maintain wakefulness both in the mornings and late at night. Not so well known are the specific mechanisms by which it influences neuromuscular activity. Experimentation in this area can answer questions about the potential health benefits and drawbacks habitual caffeine consumption can have on the body, or perhaps even its uses in physical training and athletic competition. We predicted that caffeine injection into the gastrocnemius muscle of a Rana pipiens specimen would cause a sustained contraction at a greater amplitude than the same muscle stimulated in the absence of caffeine. In each of three experiments, upon injection with caffeine, the muscle contracted and sustained at its maximum amplitude. Our data showed a significant difference before and after the injection of caffeine and, thus, our hypothesis was supported (P = P = 1.04E-9, P = P = 1.25E-10, P = P = 6.33E-7).

Introduction:
The neuromuscular activity of an organism controls essential voluntary and involuntary muscular action through the conduction of neural action potentials. The presence of calcium ions in a muscle fiber's sarcoplasm are crucial in facilitating the mechanism by which contraction occurs, and, therefore, is necessary for normal muscular function. In order to examine neuromuscular physiology, it is helpful to examine the amphibious species Rana pipiens. This species possesses a gastrocnemius that is innervated by the sciatic nerve very similarly to a number of mammals, especially humans. Experimenting on Rana pipiens with certain chemical stimulants—caffeine, for example—can give us insight into how such substances could affect humans. Athletic performance and training, for one, could benefit from an understanding of what certain chemicals do to boost or impair muscular endurance and strength. Study has already shown that caffeine can directly potentiate the power output of skeletal muscle at certain concentrations below the physiological maximum [Tallis: 2011]. Aware that caffeine acts as a stimulant, we predicted it would, either by causing the sustained release of calcium into the sarcoplasm or serving as a substitute for calcium, cause a sustained contraction of increased amplitude upon introduction to the gastrocnemius of Rana pipiens.

Materials and Methods:
Three frog leg specimens of the species Rana pipiens were prepared according to video instructions provided by the Biology Department. The legs were degloved and periodically moistened with frog Ringer's solution. A threshold stimulus amplitude for contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle was established for the first leg. Stimulus was applied using the probes of an iWorks TA data acquisition device, beginning with the number of pulses = 1, frequency = 1, and pulse width = 5 msec. Then, number of pulses was changed to 5 and stimulus voltage was changed to 0.5 V more than the determined threshold amplitude. The stimulus of the frog leg at this new amplitude and pulse number was recorded without caffeine first. Then, recording continued as 0.1mL (200 mMol) of caffeine was injected at various points in the gastrocnemius muscle. When the muscle contraction plateaued at a maximum amplitude, the leg was once again stimulated with 5 pulses at the same voltage. The specific amplitude (V) of muscle contraction were recorded for each of the 5 pulses applied pre- and post-caffeine injection. The same process was repeated for the following two legs. The data was run through three paired t-tests, one for each of the individual legs.

Results:
Stimulation of the pre-caffeine injection gastrocnemius showed five separate muscular contractions which corresponded to the five separate pulses applied by the iWorks TA device. Upon the injection of caffeine, muscular contraction occurred without any outside stimulus. The Rana pipiens gastrocnemius became rapidly maximally contracted; the five pulses of stimulation applied after the caffeine injection caused no further visible contraction of the muscle. In all three legs, our data displayed a significantly higher amplitude of contraction after the injection of caffeine (leg 1: t-stat = 275.69, df = 4, P = 1.04E-9; leg 2: t-stat = 467.92, df = 4, P = 1.25E-10; leg 3: t-stat = 55.45, df = 4, P = 6.33E-7). Leg 1 and 2 displayed similar pre- and post- caffeine contraction amplitudes. The mean amplitude of leg 1 (pre-caffeine) was 0.454V ± 0.005 and (post-caffeine) 0.756V ± 0.003, while leg 2 (pre-caffeine) was 0.047V ± 0.005 and (post-caffeine) was 1.022V ± 0 (Figure 1). Leg 3, on the other hand, experienced a pre-caffeine amplitude of 1.341V ± 0.021 and post-caffeine of 1.990V ± 0.031 (Figure 1). Additionally, error occurred during our second trial, in which the transducer was set to apply stimulus at the threshold value, rather than 0.5 V above it. During the same trial, the electrodes fell out mid-recording and were quickly reinserted. This, however, did not affect the recording of pre- or post-caffeine contraction amplitude values. 

Discussion:
Based on the significance of this data, we can reject the null and accept our alternative hypothesis. Caffeine effected an increase in contraction amplitude of the Rana pipiens gastrocnemius muscle. Similarly, a systematic review of the literature on the role of caffeine in muscle contraction concluded that the ingestion of caffeine does indeed have a egrogenic effect, causing improved muscular voluntary contraction (MVC) [Warren: 2010]. Our results are likely due to an influence of caffeine on the ability of calcium to control the interaction of actin and myosin filaments, which regulate gastrocnemius contraction at the level of individual sarcomeres. One study suggest that caffeine interacts with the ryanodine receptor, which would mean it facilitates muscular contraction through the opening of ion channels, rather than direct interaction with actin and myosin filaments[Tarnopolsky: 2008]. These findings provide an interesting basis for further questioning. The role of caffeine in enhancing muscular performance, especially with regards to endurance or regular caffeine consumption, is something of particular relevance to humans. One study, for example, has already concluded submaximal muscle stimulation in combination with caffeine potentiates the same force regardless of whether the subject was a habitual or nonhabitual caffeine consumer [Tarnopolsky: 2000].
