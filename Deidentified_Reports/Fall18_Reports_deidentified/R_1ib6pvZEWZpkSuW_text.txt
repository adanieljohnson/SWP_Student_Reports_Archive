Title: Effect of Cooling Muscles on Contraction Force in Rania pipiens

Abstract:
Temperature has an effect on the formation and release of crossbridges in muscle fibers which should decrease muscle twitch strength. We planned our experiment to study the muscle twitch of the Rania pipiens under both room temperature and after an ice bath to determine if twitch force is affected by cold. The experiment was conducted on the gastrocnemus of the Rania pipiens where the legs were tested for maximum contraction force at room temp and then cooled in an ice bath and tested again. The hypothesis was rejected as the two tailed t test yielded a p value of 0.44 with an alpha value of 0.44 and 3 degrees of freedom. 


Introduction:
Muscle contraction are controllled by electrical signals sent by the nervous system via motor neurons. The place where a motor neuron meets a muscle is called the neuromuscular joint also called the NMJ. At the NMJ acetylcholine is released to bind on the muscle and open Na+ channels to start a muscle action potential or MAP. The MAP is responsible for the muscle contraction by signaling the release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum which uncover the actin myosin binding sites.  The muscle being isolated in the Rania pipiens is the gastrocnemus muscle of the frog leg which is needed for the frog to hop. We can generalize the results of the experiment to humans since frogs and humans have the same skeletal muscle anatomy.  A commonly held belief in the athletic world is that cold weather will hinder athletic performance. A study conducted on humans saw a decrease in maximal output of the test subjects [Sargaent: 1987]. We believe that the lower maximal output will affect the twitch strength of muscles because of a slowing of crossbridge formation and release.  Our intention is to test the effect of twitch strength in muscles that have been chilled to look for a similar decrease in twitch contraction. Knowing how the cold affects muscle contraction is important because humans live in areas with cold climates. By cooling the frog legs, we hope to see a decrease in the force of the contraction of the Rania pipiens measured in volts.

Materials and Method:
The Rania pipiens legs will be held in a refrigerated unit until being brought to the lab. Once in the lab the leg will be degloved and the gastrocnemus detached at the distal tendon. The sciatic nerve will be isolated from the larger thigh muscles as well. The gastrocnemus will be attached at the distal end to an apparatus that will measure the force of the contraction. A contraction will be induced by electrodes applied directly to the muscle. First the threshold of the legs will be tested then add 1 volt to the threshold to test contraction force at. The contraction force will be taken 3 times at room temperature with a 30 second rest between contractions. The frog leg will then be placed in an ice bath at 6 degrees C for 5 minutes then test the contraction force at the same voltage 3 times with a 30 second rest period between stimulation. The 3 values for each leg at room temperature and after the ice bath will be averaged and put through a one tailed paired t_test with an alpha value of 0.05.

Results:
The average contraction force of the room temperature legs was 0.546 volts +/- 0.097 volts. The average contraction force after an ice bath was0.414 volts +/- 0.310 volts. The two tailed paired t_test had a p_value of 0.44 with 2 degrees of freedom with an alpha value of 0.05. Figure 1 is an illustration of the averages of room temperature contraction force and after ice bath contraction force with standard deviation bars included.

Discussion:
The results of the experiment were determined to not be significent. Cooling the legs for the intended time period seemed to have no effect on contraction strength.  The legs may not have had a long enough time period to cool in the ice bath. The study conducted by Sargaent had subject in the ice bath for 45 minutes [Sargaent: 1987], 9 times the length each leg was iced in our study. The shorter ice bath may not have allowed the muscle to completely cool therefore not effecting the muscle enough for a significent change in twitch strength. A separate study on frog legs found a Q10 of peak tetanic force to be less than or equal to 1.5 [Rall: 1990]. Another factor with a higher Q10 was crossbridge formation which was slowed down by the cold. All crossbridges are formed when the muscle is excited and all contract but are slow to form and to be released therefore we saw effect on twitch strength.  The literature continues to say at tetanic force appears to be temperature independent until tested at large temperature differences and can plateau at certain temperature jumps before a large change in force production [Rall: 1990]. The difference between room temperature and the ice bath should have been a large enough temperature difference to see a change but none was seen. Prior to experimentation the frog legs were stored in a refrigerator and may have not had enough time to adjust to room temperature for the experiment and not showing actual effect of temperature on frog muscles. This experiment shows that strength is not affected by cold but other factors such as crossbridge formation and release may be the cause of decreased athletic performance. Understanding how muscles are affected by cold temperatures can help the world better understand how muscle function.
