Title: The developmental effects of the hormone blocker AZAGUARD on Manduca sexta

Abstract:
        The control of insect populations oftentimes proves to be a necessity in agriculture and research in this area is useful in determining the effects of various hormones and hormone blockers on the development and life cycle of different insect species. In this study Azaguard was predicted to prevent the pupation of Manduca sexta into an adult. A control group fed a diet of Manduca food and water was created alongside an experimental group fed a diet of Manuduca food and the hormone blocker Azaguard. This was done to acertain the affect of Azaguard on the development of Manduca sexta caterpillars. These factors were measured in the change in length, weight, and physical appearance of the two caterpillar groups over multiple days. We found that Azaguard has a negative effect on Manduca sexta in that it prevents pupation and in concentrations of about 1 drop per gram of food can result in the death of the caterpillar population over time.

Introduction:
        The control of certain insect populations is essential in protecting valuable food and cash crops. As the need for food and other resources increases it is valuable to understand the effects of certain hormone-blocking insect controlling substances. In this case a specific look is being taken on Manduca sexta, otherwise known as a hornworm. This species has been used extensively in hormone regulation research which makes it a perfect species for to be looked at. Through the combination of juvenile hormone and ecdysone the pupation of Manduca sexta is regulated [Riddiford: 2003]. We choose the hormone blocker Azaguard to be used on our experimental group. Azaguard prevents insects from moving between larval, pupal, and adult stages by stopping the release of the hormones, ecdysterone and juvenile hormone, that regulate the growth and development of insects. In our experiment we started with the larval caterpillar stage of Manduca sexta and wanted to see the effects of Azaguard on our experimental group. We wanted to see if the caterpillars in the experimental group would molt or not and also to see the chemical’s effect on their growth and development. We hypothesized that the introduction of Azaguard into the diet of Manduca sexta caterpillars would prevent the commitment pulse and therefore pupation into an adult.

Materials and Methods:
        Eight Manduca sexta were taken at random and divided into two groups of four: an experimental and control group. They were placed into two four section containers based on if they would be part of the control or experimental group. The experimental group received ten grams of Manduca sexta each containing ten drops of Azaguard each. The control group received ten grams each of Manduca sexta food containing ten drops of water each. The water was added to maintain texture consistency between the two caterpillar groups.
	Over the course of thirteen days the caterpillars were checked each day. On these days they had their container sections emptied of waste and old food and had new food added prepared to the same specifications above. Before being placed back in their containers they were weighed in grams and measured length-wise in centimeters. A detailed table of observations and measurements was kept for each day the caterpillars were checked.
	Once the data for thirteen days was collected it was run through a two sample t-test to acquire p-values for the sets of data. One t-test was run for length and one was done for mass.


Results:
        The caterpillars were also subject to physical observations such as color, texture, and activity. Of note is that around day five all four experimental caterpillars began to grow progressively less active in terms of movement and response to being picked up. A sharp contrast the control group that was consistently active until they pupated. Around day seven they experimental caterpillars began to lose weight. A gap in data caused by a weather even made it impossible to pinpoint the day of death for the experimental caterpillars, but on day eleven all experimental caterpillars were dead.
        The averages in the above figures show a mass and length gain in both the experimental and control groups. The growth ended for the experimental group around day three, resulting in a steady decline of averages until their eventual death. The same pattern was observed for the control group, except that it ended in their pupation rather than death.
        The two sample t-test used resulted in a two-tailed p-value of 0.640782 for weight and 0.456403 for length.


Discussion:
        Our 10 drops of Azaguard per ten grams of food appears to not only prevent the pupating of Manduca sexta but also causes them to cease eating and eventually die as they lose mass. The control group successfully gained mass and pupated while continuing to eat normally until pupating. The control group likely provides an accurate representation of the natural development and life cycle progression of Maduca sexta from larva to pupa. The experimental group shows the effects of Azaguard on development of Manduca sexta until they die from those effects. Our hypothesis was supported in that our chosen hormone blocker and the amount of it given to each caterpillar in the experimental group would prevent pupation. We did not foresee the hormone causing death, however. It can be established that Azaguard led to their deaths as all experimental caterpillars died and none in the control group did so.
	Other research with hormone blocking/suppression in Manduca sexta has shown similar results in the prevention of pupation. A 2003 study showed that the regulation of juvenile hormone can effectively halt the development of Manduca sexta by preventing their pupation into an adult [Riddiford: 2003]. Another study from 1974 found similar results in preventing juvenile hormone production and release as responsible for halting Manduca sexta development [Nijhout: 1974]. These studies, like ours, show the effect of hormone regulation by blocking result in halting the development of Manduca sexta. The main effect of our research showed a quick and effective hormone blocking that was strong enough to prevent pupation and result in a chemical imbalance that led to the deaths of our experimental caterpillars.
	The high p-values acquired from our t-test suggest that it is highly possible the differences of length and weight between caterpillars is due to a confounding variable. This does not, however, reject our alternate hypothesis. Our hypothesis was still supported overall as it was thought that the caterpillars in the experimental group would fail to pupate because of the hormone blocker not that it would affect their size and weight.
	This brings up a possible future experiment to analyze the effects of Azaguard on Manduca sexta development in terms of changes in their length and weight over time receiving the hormone.
	The research we carried out has practical implications. For the population control of Manduca sexta a strong concentration of the hormone blocker Azaguard may be used. If the result is to prevent the pupation of the species and/or to cause them to weaken and die it provides a highly effective method of doing so.
