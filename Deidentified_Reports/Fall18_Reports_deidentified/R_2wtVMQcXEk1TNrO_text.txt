Title: Effects of Acytelcholinesterase Inhibitor, Sevin, on the twitch threshold response of the sciatic nerve

Abstract:
Our experiment is testing the effects of the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin, on the voltage strength of the twitch threshold response in stimulating the sciatic nerve of a frog leg. In order to test the strength of the voltage response and the effect of Sevin, we will have a control group that receives no treatment, and a treatment group that will be treated with a 2% solution of Sevin. We hypothesize that if we add 2 percent solution of Sevin to the sciatic nerve of the frog leg, the threshold potential for a response to stimuli will increase. Following our tests, two out of three treatment frog legs showed an increase in the threshold potential, causing a general pattern of support for our hypothesis. However, our paired t-test resulted in a p-value of 0.482964, indicating no statistical significance between the control and treatment runs of the frog legs. This can be contributed to the limited number of frog legs, for our data analysis is likewise slightly limited in its representation of the entire population. 


Introduction:
Our experiment is testing the effects of the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Sevin, on the voltage strength of the twitch threshold response in stimulating the sciatic nerve of a frog leg. The skeletal muscles of vertebrates and invertebrates, including our model organism the frog leg, are made up of numerous myofibers which are bound together to form the skeletal muscles themselves [Johnson: 2016]. The muscles are innervated by motor neurons whose axons reach into a muscle and likewise innervate individual myofibers at locations called neuromuscular junctions. These neuromuscular junctions receive nerve impulses which cause a release of acetylcholine (ACh). The ACh then binds to receptors on the membrane of the muscle fiber, which opens sodium channels that generate an action potential. This action potential then stimulates the release of Calcium which excites the contraction of the muscle [Feldberg: 1936]. The neurotransmitter Ach lingers in the synaptic cleft of the muscle until the enzyme Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) rapidly destroys ACh. If AChE is inhibited, ACh remains in the synaptic cleft, resulting in a prolonged contracted paralysis of the muscle which can affect the threshold response [Wernig: 1979]. The threshold response can be defined as the first point in which a response above 0 is observed. In the case of our experiment, the threshold response is the first point in which a muscle contraction is observed prior to stimulating the sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Our experiment is testing the voltage strength of the threshold response both before and after stimulation of the sciatic nerve with AChE inhinitor, Sevin. The dependent variable of our experiment is the threshold response (v), while the independent variable is the number of amps used to stimulate the sciatic nerve. The frog leg is an exemplary model organism for our experiment in that the nerve and muscle activity and responses have been widely studied, giving us an ideal basis on which to interpret and discuss our results. We hypothesize that if we add 2 percent solution of Sevin to the sciatic nerve of the frog leg, the threshold potential for a response to stimuli will increase.


Materials and Methods:
In order to observe the effects of AChE inhibitor, Sevin, on the twitch threshold of the frog leg, our group received three frog legs that we would directly stimulate in order to observe both a control threshold and a treatment threshold. To begin our experiment, we skinned each leg and moistened it with frog Ringer’s solution. Next, using a dissecting probe we separated the inner thigh muscles, revealing the sciatic nerve. We freed the nerve from its attached connective tissue and placed it over the electrodes in order to prepare for direct stimulation. Beginning with 0.1 V stimulus, we directly stimulated the muscle and observed the response. Based on the response level, we either scaled the voltage down or up by increments of 0.25 single stimulus pulses of increasing amplitude in order to determine the threshold voltage for nerve stimulation. Once the threshold voltage was determined, we then treated the frog leg with 2% Sevin solution by placing two drops of the inhibitor on the sciatic nerve itself and injecting at an angle around the gastrocnemius muscle. We waited five minutes for the Sevin solution to absorb until repeating the same process of direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve to determine the threshold voltage. We recorded the threshold voltage for the control and treatment thresholds and then repeated the same process for the next two legs. After recording the control and treatment thresholds for all three frog legs, we used a paired t-test to analyze the data and evaluate our results.



Results:

The control group threshold responses for each frog leg were between 0.2 amp and 0.095 amp, while the actual responses for the control group threshold response were between 0.0095 V and 0.015 V. For the treatment group, the threshold responses for each frog leg were between 0.18 amp and 0.1 amp, while the actual responses were between 0.041 V and 0.002 V. Overall, the threshold responses for the control and treatment groups were very similar; however, the treatment group had a slightly higher threshold response than the control group threshold response. Figure 1 depicts the trend of the treatment (blue) and control (orange) groups threshold response (V) and amplitude stimulus (amp), revealing a slightly higher threshold response for the treatment group except for one value point. The P-value of 0.482964 indicates no statistical significance between the control and treatment runs of the frog legs.


Discussion:
Our experiment was testing the effects of the Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, Sevin, on the voltage strength and amplitude stimulus of the threshold response in stimulating the sciatic nerve of the frog leg. Figure 1 shows the difference in the threshold response to direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve of the control group compared to that of the treatment group which was treated with 2% Sevin solution. As Sevin is an AChE inhibitor, the inhibition of AChE will result in ACh remaining in the synaptic cleft, resulting in a prolonged contracted paralysis of the muscle which can affect the threshold response [Wernig: 1979]. If ACh remains in the synaptic cleft, the level and duration of the action of ACh will increase, once more resulting in a change of the threshold response [Feldberg: 1936]. In the case of our experiment, following the treatment of the frog leg with Sevin, the threshold response voltage and amplitude stimulus were minimally higher in two of three of the frog legs. We saw a general pattern of support of our hypothesis based on the slightly higher threshold responses of the treatment group; however, the minimal difference and the high p-value reveal no statistical significance. The high p-value can point towards the fact that this is a very limited study with small control and experimental groups. For future tests, larger control and treatment groups would allow us to analyze data that is more representative of the entire population, allowing us to see the true effects of sevin on the threshold response.
