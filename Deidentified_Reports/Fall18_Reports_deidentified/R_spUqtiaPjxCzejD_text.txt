Title: The Effect of Seltzer water on photosynthetic activity as measured by the reduction of DCIP

Abstract:
We studied the effect of carbonated seltzer water on the photosynthetic activity of isolated chloroplasts. After comparing the photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts exposed to distilled water as opposed to carbonated seltzer water, we found that the rates of photosynthesis were lower in the chloroplasts that were exposed to seltzer water. However, our results to not be statistically significant as our p-value was 0.17, which is not significant.


Introduction:
Enzymes catalyze reactions but cells still need energy for those reactions to run. Plants use photosynthesis to harvest light energy. Then, plants use glycolysis and respiration for more energy. In photosynthesis, which takes place in chloroplasts, plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose, which is a reactant in glycolysis and respiration. Photosynthesis uses the electrons that have been excited by photons. These electrons, once hit by a photon, become high energy electrons. As these high energy electrons bounce from molecule to molecule, they release some energy. That energy is harnessed to make a proton gradient which powers ATP synthesis. In a study done in 1966 by Jensen and Bassham, they found that green plants not only need photon/electron energy, but also the assimilation of carbon dioxide in the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle (Jensen 1966). In our reaction, we will be exposing some of our chloroplasts to carbonated seltzer water to test the effect of carbonation on chloroplasts. Since carbon dioxide is crucial to photosynthesis, we hope that adding carbonated water will increase the levels of carbon dioxide that the chloroplasts are exposed. We hypothesize that we will see a higher rate of photosynthesis in the chloroplasts that have been exposed to the seltzer water because the seltzer water has carbon dioxide, which is a reactant in photosynthesis. As a result of the excess reactant, equilibrium will have shifted, and thus more photosynthesis must occur for the reaction to reach equilibrium again. The solution (with or without chloroplasts) that we will be testing will be blue at the beginning of the reaction because of the DCIP indicator that is in the reaction. As the chloroplasts photosynthesis, the color blue fades which means the more photosynthesis that occurs, the less color and less absorbance reading. Since we hypothesized that the chloroplasts in seltzer water would have a higher rate of photosynthesis, there will be a lower absorbance reading than the chloroplasts with no seltzer water, and consequently a higher percent change in absorbance over time. 

Materials and Methods:
First, we removed the large central veins from 4 medium spinach leaves and blotted the leaves dry. In a cold mortar pestle, we added the deveined leaves and 10mL of cold grinding buffer and ground the spinach into a thick paste. After adding another 10mL of grinding buffer, we strained the entire mixture through 3 layers of cheesecloth, keeping only the liquid. We transferred that liquid into centrifuge tube A and spun it at 200xG for 3 minutes at 4 degrees celsius. We then took the supernatant out of centrifuge tube A and poured it into centrifuge tube B and centrifuges tube B at 1,000xG for 10 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. We poured out the supernatant again, before resuspending the pellet from tube B in 20mL of grinding buffer. We then took 10mL of the resuspended pellet from tube B and placed it in a separate tube. We then added 10mL of water to one tube, and 10mL of seltzer water to the other tube. We then spun both tubes at 2800 rpm for 10 minutes and again poured off the supernatant and resuspended both pellets in 10mL of grinding buffer. Using the table below, we set up our test tubes for experimentation.

After adding the chloroplasts, we mixed the tubes immediately and transferred the mixtures into spectrophotometer cuvettes. After setting the spectrophotometer to 600nm, we blanked the spectrophotometer using the blank with chloroplasts exposed to water then measured all the samples with the chloroplasts that were exposed to water. We next blanked the spectrophotometer again using the blank with chloroplasts exposed to seltzer then measured all the samples with the chloroplasts that were exposed to seltzer. We then measured the absorbance for all the tubes again in the same order every 10 minutes for 30 minutes total. We then used a one tailed independent t-test, assuming equal variance, to analyze our results and determine whether or not there was a statistically significant difference in photosynthetic activity in chloroplast treated with carbonated seltzer water versus distilled water. 


Results:
The carbonated water decreased the percent difference in absorbances over time, as shown in figure 1. For our distilled water chloroplasts, the mean percent change at 10 minutes was 16.39% ± 0.11. The mean percent change at 20 minutes was 31.44% ± 0.17, and the mean percent change at 30 minutes was 45.15 ± 0.23. On the other hand, for our seltzer water chloroplasts, at 10 minutes, the percent change was 11.5% ± 0.06. For 20 minutes, the percent change was 22.77% ± 0.05 while the percent change was 27.95% ± 0.06.


Discussion:
We hypothesized that the seltzer water would increase the carbon dioxide levels in the solution, and as a result we would see an increase in photosynthetic activity. However, our results do not support our hypothesis, and we did not see an increase in photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts that were exposed to seltzer water. In fact, the photosynthetic activity, as well as the percent change in absorbance, in the chloroplasts that were exposed to carbonated seltzer water was seen to be lower in our experiment, but not statistically significantly lower, since our p-value was 0.17, which is not less than 0.05. Jensen, in his article, also had similar results, as he found that the rates of carbon reduction during photosynthesis by isolated chloroplasts were disappointingly low (Jensen 1966). As seen in figure 1, the percent change in the absorbances for the chloroplasts exposed to seltzer water is lower at each time as opposed to the chloroplasts exposed to water. In a biological context, this means that adding carbonated water to chloroplasts would not increase the rate of photosynthesis, nor would it help the chloroplasts by helping it create more energy. Next time, we could see if placing the chloroplasts that were exposed to seltzer water in the dark or under a bright light would help the chloroplasts in either direction. Some sources of error could have stemmed from not knowing how much carbon dioxide was in the seltzer water. Next time, if we knew the concentrations of carbon dioxide, we could test to see if different levels of carbonated water would still have the lower photosynthetic activity, or if a certain concentration of carbon dioxide will increase the photosynthetic activity.
