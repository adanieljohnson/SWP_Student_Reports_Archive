Title: Effects of Lidocaine and Pyrethrin on the Migration Capabilities of [Physarum polycephalum]

Abstract:
The overall purpose of this experiment was to determine how the signaling pathways of [Physarum polycephalum] are affected when exposed to sodium channel activators (Pyrethrin) and inactivators (Lidocaine). The sodium channels of [P. polycephalum] affect the motility of the organism, and ultimately determine its ability to migrate towards a stimulus. This experiment investigates the chemotactic nature of [P. polycephalum] in response to these two chemical stimuli. The movement of sodium ions across the plasma membrane of [P. polycephalum] causes the organism to initiate the interaction of actin filaments to generate movement towards a stimulus, or otherwise known as positive chemotaxis. On the other hand, when the organism is placed in the inactivator environment, it initiates no movement as a result of sodium ions not being transported across the organism’s plasma membrane. For this experiment, we hypothesized that the [P. polycephalum] placed in the Lidocaine environment would show less migration distance towards the proposed food source (oatmeal flakes), when compared to the Pyrethrin environment where we hypothesize that the [P. polycephalum] will show a greater overall migration distance. After completing the experiment, we found that [P. polycephalum] exhibited no movement 

Introduction:
Cellular signaling is a natural phenomenon that occurs in all living organisms. An organism’s ability to recognize and interact with the environment around them is crucial to their survival. Specific signaling pathways allow for the organism to respond to various environments. For this experiment, we will be investigating the chemotaxis of an acellular slime mold known as [Physarum polycephalum], in response to two chemicals, Lidocaine and Pyrethrin. The [P. polycephalum] being used in this experiment will be in a plasmodial state, where they will move around like an amoeba. The network of actin filaments of their cytoskeleton allow for the Physarum to migrate, but the cytoplasmic streaming of nutrients and chemical signals allow for the Physarum to respond to the environment around them [Costello & Adamatsky : 2014]. Plasmodia are characterized as multinucleate organisms that undergo synchronized division and under stressed conditions they will produce spores to spread the plasmodia [Laffler & Dove : 1977]. Lidocaine and Pyrethrin both impact the cytoplasmic streaming of the organism. [P. polycephalum] reveal a basic feedback mechanism between a signaling molecule and a motility contraction response. Nutrient stimuli initiate the release of a ligand that activates a signaling pathway to generate movement towards a food source [Alim et al.: 2017]. For the purpose of this experiment, we used the understanding of how the movement of sodium ions across the plasma membrane serve as a signal to initiate the overall movement of the organism. In Physarum, Lidocaine acts as a sodium channel blocker, therefore causing the organism to recede its actin filaments and prevent the Physarum from being able to migrate towards a food source. Pyrethrin acts as a sodium channel promoter, therefore causing the sustained opening of these channels and allowing for the influx of sodium ions flowing across the plasma membrane of the organism. This rush of sodium ions into the cytoplasmic system of the organism causes the Physarum to migrate more quickly towards a nearby food source. These chemical behaviors of Physarum allow us to predict how the organism will generate movement towards a food source, in response to their environment. Therefore, for this experiment, we hypothesize that the Physarum placed in the Lidocaine environment will reveal no movement towards an available food source, and the Physarum placed in the Pyrethrin environment will show increased migration towards the food source. 

Materials and Method:
	To begin this experiment, 9 water-agar plates were obtained and divided into three groups of 3. Then, each group of 3 agar plates were labeled “Control”, “Lidocaine”, or “Pyrethrin”. Then, two 1cm by 1 cm squares were drawn in the center of each agar plate on the back. These were centered around the diameter of the agar plate. Then, the Lidocaine was diluted from a 20x concentration by adding 19 Ml of water to 1 Ml of Lidocaine. This same step was then repeated for the dilution of Pyrethrin. After this, the spatula was sterilized in ethanol and used to cut of the boxes in the agar plate that were traced on the backside of the agar plate. The spatula was sterilized after every cut. Then, 4Ml of Lidocaine were poured onto each of the 3 agar plates labeled “Lidocaine” and 4 Ml of Pyrethrin were poured onto each of the 3 agar plates labeled “Pyrethrin”. The chemicals were left to sit on the agar plates for 5 minutes, then the residue was dumped into chemical waste. After this, a stock culture plate of Physarum was obtained, and 18 1cm by 1cm squares of stock culture were cut out to fill each of the boxes in all three groups. Then, 6 oatmeal flakes were strategically placed in a circle around the two Physarum samples in each agar plate. The sides of the plates were then tapped closed. The plates were then wrapped in foil and placed in a black bag for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the growth of the Physarum towards the oatmeal flakes were measured in millimeters, starting from the stock culture squares outward. The average distances for each group were statistically tested using an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test.  

Results:
Assuming our experiment was successful, we would have seen the most migration in the controll group, the second most migration in the Pyrethrin group, and the least average migration in the Lidocaine environment. After looking at our plates, we saw that the [P. polycephalum] showed no movement at all. If the [P. polycephalum] were to reveal any movement towards the oatmeal flakes, we would have seen branch-like extension forming from the center of the [P. polycephalum] stock culture samples. Since the controll group and both experimental groups did not reveal signs of migration, there was no data to be analyzed using an ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer test. 

Discussion:
After completing this experiment, we found that the Physarum showed no migration towards the food source in both the Pyrethrin and Lidocaine environments, and the controll environment. One attribution to this could be the fact that the Physarum that were being tested on were severely undergrown. Therefore, the Physarum were unable to use cytoplasmic streaming to transfer the chemical signals of the Pyrethrin, as well as the food source. If the Physarum cannot efficiently transport a chemical signal down the actin filaments of its cytoplasmic complex, then it will not be able to recognize the presence of a food source. This could lead us to reasoning as to why the Physarum did not generate any movement outward, towards the food source. Another study discusses how the effect of a chemical substance on the migration rate of [P. polycephalum] cannot be determined if the “nutritional status” of the plasmodium is unknown [Knowles & Carlile : 1978]. Therefore, the plasmodium could have been in a dietary state where they were not consuming a food source; this would explain why they did not migrate towards the oat flakes. Another biological explanation for this could be attributed to the fact that the chemical stimuli did not reach a threshold for the plasmodium to react to the substance. This study discusses how in order for plasmodium to respond to a chemical substance, that substance must reach a threshold for the plasmodium to recognize the substance [Ueda et al.: 1975]. For this experiment, we did not test the chemical thresholds for the plasmodium, so this could be the reason that we saw no growth. In addition to this, temperature could have been a major factor that affected the outcome of this study. Another study states how an ideal temperature is crucial for the plasmodium to undergo synchronized division [Mohberg & Rusch : 1969]. This ultimately reveals that the temperature of the room the plasmodium was stored in could have affected their ability to grow and divide. In addition to this, another study revealed that Pyrethrin is used as a form of insecticide and is highly toxic to some organisms [Bond : 2014]. Therefore, this chemical may have affected the [P. polycephalum] the same way it kills off insects, which ultimately explains why we saw no migration amongst Physarum that were placed in the Pyrethrin environment. All of these factors may have contributed to the outcome of our study. For future studies, it will be important to assess the temperature of the room in which the experiment is taking place, the toxicity levels of the chemicals in use, and the chemical thresholds of the experimental species. Overall though, since the Physarum were severely undergrown, the actin filaments of the amoeba were unable to successfully carry a chemical signal down the Physarum’s signaling pathway to evoke a cellular response and generate movement towards a food source.
