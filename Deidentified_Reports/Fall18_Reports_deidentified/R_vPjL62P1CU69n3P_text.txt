Title: The Effects of Blocking Ecdysone on Growth Rate of Manduca Sexta Caterpillars

Abstract:
This experiment focuses on the effects of inhibiting ecdysone on the growth of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. Ecdysone is an important growth hormone that regulates the timing of insect molting. If there is too little ecdysone in the insect’s system then molting can be halted or never occur. The chemical azadirachtin was fed to the caterpillars in order to block the release of ecdysone. The effects of the ecdysone inhibiting chemical were measured by change in mass and physical observations between the controll and experimental caterpillars. The hypothesis was that inhibiting the ecdysone of the juvenile caterpillar with azadirachtin (brand name azagaurd) will decrease the mass of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, and the caterpillar will not reach the pupating stage of development. The caterpillars were fed 10 grams of food per 4 drops of azadirachtin and their masses and appearance were recorded over a 14-day period. The two-tailed p_value resulted in 0.137. Therefore, the results were not significent and the hypothesis was not supported. This information provides important insight into cost effective pest controll as it clarifies how much azadirachtin needs to be fed to the caterpillars in order to prevent maturation.

Introduction:
Insects rely on hormones to regulate their growth and life cycle stages. These hormones are referred to as IGRs or insect growth regulators. Many insects including caterpillars undergo a major change in body shape, driven by the changing hormones within its system. The two main growth hormones are ecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH). Ecdysone is responsible for regulating timing of molting during insect development. Whereas Juvenile Hormone regulates the type of molting during development. In other words, the JH determines whether or not molting will occur or if the insect will remain as a juvenile [Staal: 1975]. If either of these hormones are tampered with, the life cycle of the insect will be affected. This experiment will focus on how blocking ecdysone of a juvenile Manduca sexta caterpillar affects the growth rate. The results and experimental outcome will be based on observations and mass change. The Manduca sexta is a model organism for other insects, who’s growth hormones can be easily manipulated by adding chemicals to the food source. Azadirachtin is a chemical that when given to the insect (caterpillar), the ecdysone is blocked in their system, therefore affecting the typical growth rate of the caterpillar [Robbins: 1970]. This study found that the inhibition of ecdysone caused inhibited growth, development, and/or reproduction [Robbins: 1970]. The insects were not able to reach their commitment pulse and could not pupate. Therefore, the researchers determined how much ecdysone inhibiting chemical needed to be given to the insects in order to halt growth and reproduction, thus eradicating the pest. These changes in mass and growth stages can be easily measured and observed. We hypothesize that inhibiting the ecdysone of the juvenile caterpillar with azadirachtin (brand name azagaurd) will decrease the mass of the Manduca sexta caterpillar, and the caterpillar will not reach the pupation stage of development.

Materials and Method:
Eight Manduca sexta caterpillars of similar mass, about 2.75 g to 3.75 g, were selected and divided into controll and experimental groups (4 caterpillars in each group). Each caterpillar was placed in its own container with air holes and properly labeled. Each was fed one of two diets. The controll was fed ten grams of food with four drops of di water thoroughly mixed in. The experimental was fed ten grams of food with four drops of azadirachtin (azagaurd) thoroughly mixed in. All caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 28C in a twelve-hour dark, twelve-hour light cycle to mimic the environment. The caterpillar’s food was replaced on days 5 and 8 when they appeared to have eaten most of it. Each day the caterpillars were weighed. The mass along with observations of how they appeared were recorded. In order to assess the results of the experiment, a two-sample two-tailed t_test was used. This was used in order to compare the means from two separate (controll and experimental) groups of data.

Results:
The results showed that the controll caterpillars did not grow a significent amount more than the experimental caterpillars. The average difference in the growth of the controll from the beginning to the end of the experiment was 1.928 +/- 0.3008 g. Whereas the average difference in growth of the experimental caterpillars was 1.005 +/- 1.033 g. Each of these values are demonstrated in figure 1. Similarly, in the observations, the controll caterpillars appeared to progress throughout the life cycle stages faster and more regularly than the experimental caterpillars. Around day 5 the commitment pulse appeared in the controll caterpillars. However, the commitment pulse appeared in the experimental caterpillars around day 8. Finally, the controll caterpillars reached pupation around day 10, and the experimental caterpillars reached pupation around day 14. Experimental caterpillar 3 appeared dead on day 14. The two-tailed p_value is 0.137, degrees of freedom is 6, and the t-value is 1.714. Based on the p_value of the experiment, the results are not statically significent. 

Discussion:
Our hypothesis, that inhibiting the ecdysone of the Manduca sexta juvenile caterpillar would decrease the mass and prevent pupation of the caterpillar, was not supported. We observed no significent difference at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the amount of azadirachtin used in this experiment did not inhibit enough ecdysone to change the path of development of the caterpillar. These results are likely due to the amount of azadirachtin that was being given to the caterpillars. We only used 4 drops of the chemical with the food, and the chemical was also diluted to a great degree, further reducing the amount of ecdysone blocking chemical that the caterpillars were receiving. Additionally, past studies have suggested that blocking ecdysone is successful in preventing pupation of insects, however a greater amount, specifically 5.0 µg per larva, needed to be used to be effective [Robbins: 1970]. A larger amount being used causes a more significent change in the maturation stages of the insect; therefore, more drastically causing a lack of growth and an inability to reach the commitment pulse and pupation. If in our experiment more azadirachtin had been used for the caterpillars, we likely would have seen significently smaller caterpillars that did not reach the commitment pulse, and they likely would have died. Understanding the growth hormones of insects is an important component of pest controll. In order to eliminate the pest, experimentation on the hormones can provide important insight into the most cost-effective method to eliminating the problem.

The controll caterpillars were fed normal food and the average difference in mass change is displayed on the left. The experimental caterpillars, on the right, were fed four drops of azadirachtin per ten grams of food, and their average change in mass is shown. Each bar is the mean mass change of 4 caterpillars from the experimental or controll group, and the error bars represent the standard deviation for the two groups. *************************************************************************
