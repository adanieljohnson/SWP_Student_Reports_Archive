Title: Agonistic Behavior of Male Betta Fish in Colored water

Abstract:
This study looks at the intraspecific behaviors of the male Betta splendens fish. When in vicinity of another male betta, these fish exhibit highly colorful and aggressive behaviors. We want to test the affect of a color stimulus on the behavioral response times of the male betta fish. We hypothesized that darker colored water would lead to slower response and recognition times in the fish.  This would be due to impaired vision. To test our hypothesis we utilized 3 different pairs of male betta fish. Each trial was ran through a tank containing clear and then colored water. The overall outcome of the study found there to be no statistical difference between response times in clear water and colored water. To fully understand the intraspecific behaviors of the male betta fish the next step to our study should focus around neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Serotonin has been proved to have an effect on the behaviors of the betta fish, often making them less aggressive.



Introduction:
In this study we are looking at the intraspecific behaviors of the male Betta splendens (Siamese fighting fish. Intraspecific behaviors occur only between organisms within the same species. We are utilizing the male betta fish because of there exciting displays of aggression towards one another. When in the same vicinity male betta’s often exhibit a number of aggressive behaviors such as tail flicking, or broadside motions. Robertson and Sale (1974) studied Betta displays toward eight different models comprised of specific shapes and body patterns. The overall results suggested that male Betta displayed aggressive behavior in the presence of certain stimuli (e.g. shape and body pattern) [Craft:2003]. We will look at the affect water coloration will have on the species-specific responses of the male betta fish. In normal aquariums visibility is 100%. We hope to mimic the effects of dirty water, or nighttime water encounters by adding color to the water. Darker water should impair the vision of the betta fish. We hypothesize that discolored water will lead to males taking longer to recognize each other and exhibit aggressive behaviors.


Materials and Methods:
In this study we tested six different male betta fish. Each fish had similar coloration. In doing the test we used one aquarium with clear water, and another with colored water. In each aquarium we placed a piece of plastic down the middle. Using a fishing net we placed one male on each side of the barrier. We recorded the time it took for each fish to notice the other and exhibit and aggressive response. We recorded the data after each trial and processed our results with a paired two-tailed statistical T-test. The cutoff for significance in our results was set to p=0.05 or lower.


Results:
The data depicted in the table shows the average of the results of each trial (figure 1). The first trial showed a trend of longer reaction times for the fish when placed in the clear water.The trend for the second trial showed longer aggression responses from the fish in the colored water. In the final trial we saw behavior that we could not explain. In the final test of the colored water each fish took the same amount of time to react to one other, roughly 1 minute and 30 seconds. However, when placed in the clear water we saw no signs of aggression. The male betta fish never reacted in the final trial of the clear water. The mean reaction time between male betta fish in clear water shows no statistical difference from the mean reaction times inside of colored water (t-stat= -1.107, df=2, P=0.3834).


Discussion:
In looking at the findings of the study we cannot say that our results supported our hypothesis. We hypothesized that colored water might affect vision. This would cause slower reaction times in the colored water. However our results say that the betta fish were not affected by the coloration of the water. During the study we observed a very strange encounter between two males. While inside of the clear water both male betta fish refused to exhibit aggressive behavior toward one another. We noted that these two fish had previously been in a physical altercation while being used for a different study. One fish had even injured the dorsal fin of the other. We speculated that this altercation could have somehow lead to lesser aggression between the two in our study. The next step to our study would be finding other stimuli that could lead to less aggression in male Betta splendens. Past research has implicated serotonin as an important neurotransmitter in the facilitation of aggressive behavior in Siamese fighting fish [Eisenreich:2015]. More recent studies have been showing that aquatic species tend to show decreased territorial aggression after exposure to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine [Eisenreich:2015]. The next logical step would be to start looking at more hormonal stimuli and how they affect aggression in male betta fish.
