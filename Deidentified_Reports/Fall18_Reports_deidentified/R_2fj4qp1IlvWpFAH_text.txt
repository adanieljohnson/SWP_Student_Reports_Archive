Title: JH analog had a negligible effect on length and weight gain of Manduca sexta

Abstract:
In this experiment, we studied how juvenile hormone (JH) affected the growth and development of Manduca sexta caterpillars, an organism that goes through a holometabolous life cycle. We hypothesized that the caterpillars would grow in weight and length less than the control group on average. We fed one group of caterpillars normal food and we fed an experimental group food with methoprene, a JH analog. Methoprene is used as an IGR by farmers to prevent caterpillars from turning into adult moths. Using a one-tailed 2-sample T-test, we found that our results were not statistically significant. Our results did not support our hypothesis, as the caterpillars in the experimental group did not grow or weight more than those in the control group. We suspect that while JH seems to keep the caterpillars in larval form, high levels of the hormone cause the caterpillars to have stunted development. This study has implications for the usage of methoprene as an effective IGR. Our experimental caterpillars did not grow as well as the control group, supporting the idea that methoprene keeps holometabolous insects in larval stage.


Introduction:
In this study, we researched the larval form of Manduca sexta, commonly known as the tobacco hornworm. This insect goes through a holometabolous life cycle, meaning that it changes from a larva (in this case, a caterpillar) to a moth. Many hormones play a part in regulating this life cycle, and one of them is juvenile hormone (JH). In a previous study, the researchers discovered that methoprene could be used to keep other holometabolous insects in larval stage until they died [Wu: 2006]. Methoprene works as a JH analog, meaning that it mimics JH and binds to receptors that receive JH. It is also known that juvenile hormone analogs can be used as an insect growth regulator (IGR) in place of traditional pesticides because it interferes with the normal life cycle of the caterpillar and prevents them from becoming adults [Staal: 1973]. While it is effective in keeping the insect in larval form, methoprene has been shown to cause weight gain in the larvae [Miranda: 2002]. IGRs are used in place of traditional pesticides because they cause some sort of change in the development of a larva that prevents them from reaching adulthood and reproducing. They are a safer alternative to other chemicals because they only affect the insect that they target rather than the entire ecosystem. In our experiment, we are seeking to observe the effects that methoprene will have on the maturation of the Manduca sexta caterpillar. We will give one experimental group 10 droplets of Martin's brand methoprene and observe how the weight and length of the experimental group compares with the weight and length of the control group. The results of our experiment will give information on the effectiveness of this specific analog and concentration as an IGR. We expect our experimental group to be, on average, smaller and lighter than the control group because the JH should impair the experimental group's growth and development.


Materials and Methods:
We used two containers to separate the control and experimental groups. Each container had 4 caterpillars, and each caterpillar had its own walled-off compartment in the container. Every day, a group member cleaned the containers and gave each caterpillar 10g of food. The control group was given 10 drops of water with their food, and the experimental group was given 10 drops of methoprene. Every day for 9 days (when the first caterpillar began to pupate), the caterpillars were weighed and measured, and the data was recorded in a table. The caterpillars were kept at a constant temperature of 25 degrees Celsius and light for the entire experiment. At the end of the experiment, we compared the average length and weight of the two groups using a one tailed 2-sample T-test.


Results:
Besides length and weight, there were some physical differences that we observed in the caterpillars. Over the course of the experiment, all control group individuals were firm, bright green, and quite active when touched. By contrast, the experimental group individuals were generally lighter in coloration and less active. One individual, #3 in the experimental group, began to exhibit sluggish behavior by Day 3. At Day 6, the individual turned brown, lost weight, and never pupated. The caterpillars in the control group had an average growth of 2.325 +/- 0.699 cm , while the experimental group only had an average growth of 1.1 +/- 2.005 cm. The control group also gained more weight on average than the experimental group, gaining on average 7.2225 +/- 2.569 g. The experimental group only gained on average 5.045 +/- 3.963 g. Using a two-sample t-test, we found that the change in length between the experimental and control group was not statistically significant (t-value = .9221, p-value = .8012, df = 6). Using the same test, we also found that the change in weight between the experimental and control group was not statistically significant (t-value = 1.154, p-value = .8413, df = 6).


Discussion:
The results of our experiment did not confirm our hypothesis; the caterpillars in the experimental group did not grow more on average than the caterpillars in the control group. Because our tests told us that our results were not significant, we can infer that the methoprene had no significant effect on caterpillar growth and weight gain. It has been proven that juvenile hormone supplements have caused various insects, not just Manduca sexta, to remain in larval form for their entire lives [Slama: 1965]. It is known that methoprene is an IGR, which eventually kills the larva that is treated with it by keeping the organism in its larval stage for more time than normal [Staal: 1973]. Because it is an IGR, we can infer that too much JH was toxic to the caterpillars and could have altered other functions in the body that caused the them to grow less. It is possible that by adding less JH, we could have achieved results that would have supported our hypothesis. A study where scientists gave silkworms, another holometabolous insect, 1 ng of methoprene, they gained weight, and too much methoprene actually slowed the food consumption of the silkworms [Miranda: 2002]. The caterpillars that we treated with JH did not pupate, which is consistent with the knowledge gathered about JH. However, the fact that they did not grow as much as the control group suggests that there may be more to learn about how JH negatively affects the growth and development of insects. The information learned from this experiment can be applied to the use of IGRs as pesticides. Knowing that a large amount of methoprene does affect growth or weight gain means that farmers can use them as pesticides without worrying that the caterpillars will grow bigger and perhaps eat more food.

Figure Legends: 
Figure 1: Average growth of caterpillars in control and experimental group. The caterpillars in the control group grew more on average than the caterpillars in the experimental group. The caterpillars were measured every day using a ruler and were stretched out to ensure the most accurate measurement. The p-value for this data was .8012, showing no statistical significance between the 2 groups. The control error bar represents +/- .699 cm and the experimental error bar represents +/- 2.005 cm.
