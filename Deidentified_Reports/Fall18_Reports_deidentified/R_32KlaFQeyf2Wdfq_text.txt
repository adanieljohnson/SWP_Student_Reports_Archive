Title: Juvenile Hormone affects the growth of Caterpillar 

Abstract:
Hormone is indispensable in many organisms, without hormone, lives will stop growing and the world will stop working. In this experiment, we look at how Juvenile Hormone (JH) affect pupating of a tobacco hornworm, Manduca Sexta. The hypothesis was that if we add JH in the caterpillars’ food, they can still gain weight but they will never pupate and will never become adults. We randoMly assigned 8 caterpillars into two groups, one group with normal food and one with food with JH and we recorded their weight and appearance every day. Although our data of their weight didn’t show there was a significent different, the appearance of two groups proved our hypothesis. This experiment shows that Hormones affect growing and play important part in body of every organisms. 

Introduction:
Hormone is one of the most important components that influence the growth of organisms. This experiment examine the role Juvenile Hormone take in Caterpillar’s development. As we learned previously in class, in the life circle of Manduca caterpillar, they start their life with egg. After 3 to 5 days, they became the first instar larva. Then, within 13 days, the caterpillars will molt 4 times before they changed into the fifth instar larva. After their fifth molt, they metamorphose to pupa. And finally, the pupa become adult moth. Inside the Manduca Sexta, there are three main hormones: Prothoracicotropic (PTTH), Ecdysterone (20E), and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Within these hormones, JH and 20E works together to controll growth, molting, [Johnson:2016]and metamorphosis of Manduca and low level of JH is very necessary for normal pupating [Kenji: 1978]. When we think of the system of pupating, only a huge drop of JH and a high level of 20E can lead to the change of the insect from a larva to a pupa. In that case, what will happen if we add the JH in the food of the caterpillar to keep their level of JH high? Since JH plays an important rule in the development of insect, we need to know which part of the development it can actually influence. In order to answer this question, we need to artificially add JH in to the caterpillar’s food and measure the weight of each caterpillars as well as record their appearance every day to see if there’s any different from the caterpillars with normal food and JH level. In this experiment, our hypothesis is that if we add JH in the food the caterpillars eat, they might increase their weight as normal but will never become pupa and will never change into adults. We use the Manduca Sexta as our model organism because their reproductive rate is high and it is easy to controll their hormone level.

Materials and Method:
First eight Manduca Caterpillars were selected by us from the same bottle and were randoMly divided into two groups of four each Then, we weighted each of the caterpillars and recorded their initial weight. After that we placed each caterpillar in its own separate rearing jar with their group marked at the bottom and their number in the group marked on the side of their jar. Then we fed each caterpillar one of two diets: four received 10g each normal food with 12 drops of water (The controll group) or four received 10g each normal food with 12 drops of JH pretended (The experimental group). 
Then all caterpillars were kept in the same incubator with the same temperature and day time. After doing that, we recorded their weight and their appearance every day with a standard lab balance and last 15 days, we took photo every day. At the end of the 15th day, we calculated the weight differences between the first and the last day of each caterpillar. We also calculated the average weight differences of each group and the two-tailed p_value to see if there was a significent difference between those two groups. 


Results:
The mean weight differences between the first day and the last day for the controll group is 0.2925g, and the mean weight differences between the first day and the last day for the experimental group is 1.525g (Graph 1). We used a two-sample t_test to analyze our results. The two-tailed p_value of the controll group and treatment group was 0.390118 with degrees of freedom=6, t-value=0.926112 (Table 1). Based on the data, the mean of weight of controll group is not significently different from the mean of weight of treatment group. During the experiment, #2 in experiment group died on day three, and all the other caterpillars were alive. However, all the caterpillars gained weight at first few days, but at around day 6, all of the started to loss weight. Also, when the caterpillars started to change color, they didn’t move as much as they used to be. And in the end, three of our caterpillars in the controll group changed into pupa, and none of the caterpillar in the treatment group changed. 

Discussion:
The hypothesis of our experiment was supported by our data. In the hypothesis we said that if we add JH in the food the caterpillars eat, they might increase their weight as normal but will never become pupa and will never change into adults. For the first part, all of the caterpillars gained their weight at first few days. Although they lost their weight in the end, the trend of weight of controll group are similar to the experimental group. The second part of the hypothesis was also right since three caterpillars of our controll group which receive just the normal food changed into pupa, but none of the caterpillars in the treatment group which ate food with JH turned into pupa. Although there was no significent difference the weight of two groups, the appearance of the caterpillar really indicated that the JH affect the process of pupating, and high level of JH can prevent the caterpillars from changing into pupa. Moreover, past investigations have found that JH also inhibits cuticular melanization in tobacco hornworm, Manduca Sexta. [Truman: 1973]. This could further explain why larva with high level of JH cannot pupate. Since the process of becoming a pupa need to get darker, with high level of JH, the larva cannot change their color, and in the end, they cannot metamorphose. 
Although the data could prove our hypothesis, we can still improve the experiment by choosing our samples more carefully next time. Since the initial weight of our caterpillars were very different, and the health situation of some of them were not very good, the final data were very hard to calculated. Also, because of the death of one of the caterpillars in the experimental group, the final result of the mean of treatment group and the p value became not very accurate. So next time, we can choose the caterpillars all around a particular gram with good health condition. 
Not just the insect, daily life of human also depends on hormone. By studying how the JH hormone influence the growth of Manduca Sexta, we can understand how hormone works in the organism and realize the importance of Hormone in organism.
