Title: The increase in root to shoot ratios in Vigna radiata with higher levels of nitrogen nutrients

Abstract:
This study looks at plant resource allocation with root to shoot ratios in Vigna radiata. Focusing on nitrogen levels in soil, we compared high levels of nitrogen in one group to normal levels of nitrogen in the controll group. Due to the fact that nitrogen is an essential nutrient needed for plant growth we hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of high nitrogen level plants would be lower than that of the normal levels of nitrogen plants. After watering the plants for two weeks, either with nitrogen solution or regular tap water, we then recorded our masses and lengths for the ratios. Our results showed that the average mass and length root to shoot ratios were greater in the high levels of nitrogen group. After performing a two-tailed t_test statistical analysis we found that only the length ratios were significently different, but the mass ratios had no significent difference. We concluded that due to the fact that the regular conditions already had sufficient levels of nitrogen, adding more nutrients was harmful to the plant. Nitrogen levels are important to study because this plant nutrient can be harmful to the environment in many ways. 

Introduction:
Plants change their allocation strategies due to different environmental conditions in order to increase growth. A good indicator of change in growth is root to shoot ratios with weight and length. The model organism we chose to study plant allocation in is the Vigna radiata, better known as the mung bean plant. This is a well-suited organism because of its small size and short life cycle. Since we knew that plants often allocate the growth of their roots depending on amounts of nutrients in the soil, we decided to study how different nitrogen levels effect root and shoot growth. The nitrogen cycle is very important when it comes to industrial food production, but also leads to many environmental problems. The cycle has been greatly accelerated due to the use of artificial nitrogen fertilizers worldwide, enabling a large increase in food production. Unfortunately, it has led to issues like eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic systems as well as acidification. [Galloway: 2008]. This shows that adding nitrogen has improved agricultural techniques and food production yet may be harming the environment. This raises the question of how much food production should be increased before the environment and climate change suffer? A study on two invasive plant species compared the phenotypic responses to nitrogen and concluded that their two species could grow better in higher nitrogen environments, suggesting that enhanced soil nitrogen levels might promote their invasion. [Manlian: 2005]. With studies like this in mind and due to the fact that nitrogen is an essential nutrient needed in plants, we predicted that increasing the levels of nitrogen would improve plant growth. Using two different groups and manipulating the soil nitrogen levels, we hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of high nitrogen level plants would be lower than that of the regular amounts of nitrogen plants.

Materials and Method:
The Vigna radiata plants were grown in two different nitrogen conditions, with four pots in each group. The high levels of nitrogen plants were kept on a different tray than the controll group that was given regular water. 24 hours before planting, the mung beans were soaked in water. The next day, eight pots were assembled with vermiculite. They were each pre-watered and given 50 milliliters of Miracle Gro. Each pot had nine holes dug with a few seeds being added to each. The two trays were left in the greenhouse with the same conditions except for the amounts of nitrogen in the water added. The plants were watered daily for two weeks with either regular tap water or the high nitrogen solution. After the two weeks, the plants were removed from the soil and cut to separate the root and the shoot. The roots and shoots of each plant were weighed and measured in length. From here a two tailed t_test was used to compare the root to shoot ratios of the different conditions and a critical p_value of less than 0.05 was desired for the data to be significently different. 

Results:
The general trends for the root to shoot ratios are that the high nitrogen level groups have a larger value when averaged together. For the length root to shoot ratio displayed in Figure 1, the mean of the high nitrogen levels group was statistically significently different than that of the controll group. (t_stat=3.78, d.f.=6, p=0.0046). However, the mass root to shoot ratios shown in Figure 2 are too similar in value that there is not a significent difference indicated by the two-tailed t_test. (t_stat=0.17, d.f.=6, p=0.435). 

Discussion:
Our results did not support our hypothesis that the root to shoot ratio in high nitrogen level mung bean plants would be lower than those in regular levels of nitrogen. Root to shoot ratios were calculated for both length and weight, which was helpful because only the length ratios gave significently different results. Although the mass ratios were not significently different, it was visually apparent that the controll group plants grew taller, while the high nitrogen group showed signs of death with loss of coloring and holes forming in the leaves. Although we did not predict these results, they are logical because the Miracle Gro and soil used already should have provided a sufficient amount of nitrogen nutrients for the plants. By adding higher amounts of nitrogen, it became harmful for the plant and hindered growth. High amounts of nitrogen can be harmful in any aspect of the environment, whether it is contributing to climate change or ecosystem acidification. The nitrogen cycle often leads to a cascade of effects like causing photochemical smog, then being oxidized in the atmosphere to nitric acid, then deposited on the ground leading to eutrophication. [Galloway: 2008]. A study similar to this one focused on the effect of nitrogen and sun levels on net photosynthesis and growth in coffee plants. They found that high nitrogen levels increased plant height no matter the amounts of light and promoted a larger leaf area in the plants grown in the shade. [Fahl: 2015]. This does not align with our results in which higher nitrogen levels decreased plant height, but probably because our controll group already had sufficient levels of nitrogen. Some possible sources of error in our experiment is that we could have used a larger sample size, with more plants, and also tested more than just two levels of nitrogen. For future studies, one could look at multiple levels of nitrogen in more than just one plant, while also comparing the results to different soil nutrients. Through our design we were able to conclude that when using soil and Miracle Gro that already has essential nutrients needed for a plant, adding extra amounts of nitrogen can be harmful to plant grow and later lead to other environmental issues.

The two averages are very close in value with the high nitrogen level average at 0.794 grams (0.242) and the controll group at 0.764 grams (0.253). *************************************************************************
