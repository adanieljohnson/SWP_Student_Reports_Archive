Title: Lack of effects of soil acidity resource allocation through root to shoot ratio in buckwheat plants

Abstract:
Understanding resource allocation can assist in emphasizing characteristics in plants. Resource allocation is influenced primarily by environmental factors. The effects of acidic pH on resource allocation was the purpose of this lab, as pH influences the activity of enzyme-catalyzed reactions involved in biological functions. It was hypothesized that the root to shoot ratio of plants would be lower in acidic soil than in neutral soil, and would therefore be less suitable than neutral soil. Buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, was used to determine the suitability of acidic (pH 3.5) soil to neutral (pH 7) soil, though vermiculite was used as a soil substitute. After 2 weeks of germination, there was no significant difference in the mass root to shoot ratios of plants watered with acidic water and normal water (t-stat = 0.416, df = 4, P = 0.70) and no significant difference in the length root to shoot ratios of plants watered with acidic water and normal water (t-stat = 0.71, df = 4, P = 0.489). This indicates that acidic soil is not considered to be any more or less suitable for plant growth than neutral soil, and further that soil acidity may play a less vital role in resource allocation than hypothesized.


Introduction:
Resource allocation describes the tendency of organisms to make use of available energy and other assets in the manner best suited to the organism’s environment and specific needs. For instance, plants in low nutrient soil will grow larger root complexes to compensate, and plants in areas with poor sunlight will develop more leaves to catch as much light as possible. Understanding resource allocation in plants specifically can assist in encouraging plants to grow a certain way. For instance, there has been research on  why Agropyron desertorum, a type of bunchgrasss, has such a high grazing tolerance, and perhaps use this understanding to increase the grazing tolerance of more finicky plants  [Caldwell: 1981]. If this tolerance is not merely a matter of genetics, and grazing tolerance is a matter of resource allocation and therefore manipulated environmentally, more efficient grasses and Furthermore, manipulation of plant growth and resource allocation may have uses in commercial agriculture, when trying to obtain a larger root or leaf/stem growth per plant. This experiment used buckwheat, or Fagopyrum esculentum, to study the effects of acidic soil on the root to shoot ratio of plants, furthermore, if acidic soil is unsuitable for plant growth. Buckwheat is an ideal model organism due to its commonness and accelerated germination. In the event that soil pH negatively affects the availability of soil nutrients, or the uptake ability of plants, the root structure of the plant should compensate by growing larger, relative to the total plant size. We hypothesize that plants grown at in a pH of 3.5 will have a lower root to shoot ratio than plants grown in pH 7 soil.


Materials and Methods:
Six square pots were filled with vermiculite (pH 7) and divided into two trays labeled “acid” and “control,” respectively. Twelve shallow holes were made in each pot, about half an inch deep. One to two buckwheat seeds were placed in each hole, and covered with surrounding vermiculite. The pots were watered until uniformly moist and given 50 ml of liquid fertilizer each. The trays were left in a climate-controlled environment with access to natural light for two weeks. The control tray pots were watered with normal water and the acid tray pots special 3.5 pH water mix once every day. After two weeks, three sprouts from each pot were extracted from the vermiculite by gently breaking the vermiculite apart in a tub filled with 2 inches of water. The stalks were then rinsed of all remaining vermiculite, patted dry, and weighed individually. The samples were then cut apart into root and stem, with the point of pigment change between them serving as the cut-off. The shoots, or stems and leaves, of the plants were also weighed, and the root mass was determined by subtracting the shoot weight from the total weight of the sample. The maximum root and shoot length per pot was also recorded. The root to shoot ratio was calculated by dividing the root weight or mass by the shoot weight or mall. A two-tailed t-test was used for statistical analysis of the control and acid groups, with a critical value of 0.05.


Results:
The mean root to shoot ratio for the mass of control plants was 0.15 +/- 0.028 and the mean root to shoot ratio for the mass of experimental plants was 0.17 +/- 0.039 (Fig.1). The mean The mean root to shoot ratio for length in the control plants was 0.57 +/- 0.19 and the mean root to shoot ratio for length in the experimental plants was 0.51 +/- 0.11 (Fig.2).  The standard deviation for mass in the control plants was 0.028 and the standard deviation for mass in experimental plants was 0.039 (Fig.1).  The standard deviation for length in control plants was 0.19 and the standard deviation for length in experimental plants was 0.11 (Fig.2). The mean of the length control group was not statistically significantly different than that of the length experimental group (t-stat = 0.416, df = 4, P = 0.70). The mean length of the control group was not significantly different than the length of the experimental group (t-stat = 0.71, df = 4, P = 0.489). Overall appearance and growth of the plants appeared uniform at the end of the experiment. Results indicate both the control and experimental plants had similar length and weight (Fig.1 and 2). Both experimental and control demonstrated the same growth pattern.


Discussion:
This experiment yielded no strong evidence of the unsuitability of acidic soil for plant growth, and therefore did not support the hypothesis. This could be due to the resilience of buckwheat or similar lack of soil microbes in both the neutral and acidic vermiculite. This could be due to carbon loss found in soil that has a pH over 6.2, balancing out negative effects of pH 3.5 soil, or a lack of negative impact from pH 3.5 soil entirely [Malik: 2018]. This means that the pH had no effect on plant growth, and therefore no effect on the resource allocation of buckwheat plants. Other impacts of more a more basic pH include insolubility of iron [Morgan: 2013]. However, one would think that, due to the dependency of biological systems on enzymes, that vastly different soil pH ranges would have some impact of soil nutrient uptake. It is common knowledge that due to non-covalent interactions and their effects on protein conformation, enzymes perform best in specific ranges. It logically follows that the enzymes involved in soil nutrient uptake/processing may either have a vast active pH range, or are not as involved with this particular biological process, making it a more physically dependent function. The results of this lab indicate that manipulation of pH would be of no use in agricultural pursuits due to its lack of physical effect. However, further experimentation at a variety of pH values would be a worthwhile endeavor, and perhaps give insight as to the more intricate processes behind nutrient uptake in the roots that prevented pH affecting resource allocation via root to shoot ratio.
