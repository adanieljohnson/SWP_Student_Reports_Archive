Title: The Effects of Pyrethrin and Lidocaine on [Physarum polycephalum]

Abstract:
The purpose of this experiment was to determine if the sodium-ion channel pathways and their role in chemical signaling in Physarum polycephalum would be effected by the presence of an activator and inhibitor. In this experiment, the activator was pyrethrin and the inhibitor was lidocaine. When in the presence of an activator, sodium-ion channels release sodium ions across the plasma membrane, and it prompts the Physarum to move via actin filaments. The hypothesis was that the Physarum would move a further distance in response to the pyrethrin, and it would move a smaller distance in response to the lidocaine. The experiment resulted in no movement in any of the nine plates, including the controll plates, lidocaine plates, and pyrethrin plates. These results can be attributed to multiple factors including: possible toxicity of pyrethrin to Physarum, improper growth of the Physarum, and laboratory temperature. 

Introduction:
Physarum is a slime mold that spends most of its life in search of food by utilizing the function of actin microfilaments to move around [Johnson: 2018]. If physarum does not have access to a food source, it will revert to a suspended stage where it will remain until food becomes present before the plasmodium returns [Johnson: 2018]. Signal transduction pathways dictate and regulate physarum’s behaviors; these pathways include G-protein coupled receptors, the cAMP-mediated path, the IP3-mediated path, ion channel-coupled pathways, and Ca+2-activated signaling. Typically, the behaviors that are known to physarum include, but are not limited to, chemotaxis, phototaxis, and gravitaxis [Johnson: 2018]. Specifically, this experiment will be dealing with chemotaxis which is where the physarum is signaled to by a source, and, as a result, the physarum moves towards it [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, the source will be oatmeal flakes surrounding the physarum. The signaling pathways that are being manipulated and tested in this experiment is a type of ion channel-coupled pathway dealing with the diffusion of Na+. In these pathways, Na+ ions diffuse into the cell and cause a signal transduction cascade to occur [Johnson: 2018]. The movement of ions into the cell can be disrupted by the presence of an inhibitor, in this case, lidocaine is an inhibitor of Na+ ions [Strichartz: 1973]. In addition, an activator known as pyrethrin would have the opposite effect and stimulate the process of chemotaxis [Johnson: 2018]. In this experiment, the source will be oatmeal flakes surrounding the physarum. The hypothesis is that in the presence of an inhibitor the physarum will not move very far towards the food source, and in the presence of an activator, the physarum will move very far towards the food source. 


Materials and Method:
First, we labeled the back of three agar plates with controll, three were labeled lidocaine treatment, and three were labeled pyrethrin in treatment. Then two boxes were drawn in the middle of the plates with a space between the blocks. The lidocaine was then diluted by taking 1 Ml of lidocaine and adding 19 Ml of water. The pyrethrin was then diluted in the same way. The spatula was cleaned with ethanol and the boxes were cut out of the agar plate, cleaning the spatula between each box. Four milliliters of lidocaine were rubbed on the surface of the three-lidocaine treatment water agar plates. Four milliliters of pyrethrin were then rubbed on the surface the three-pyrethrin treatment plates. Stock culture plates were then obtained and blocks of Physarum were removed and placed in both of the cut-out block spaces in all nine of the water agar plates. The spatula was cleaned with ethanol between each block. Then, eight oatmeal flakes were put equidistance from each other in a circle along the perimeter of each of the nine plates. The sides of the plates were taped so that the top would not come off and the plates were then wrapped in foil. A small window was cut at the top of each plate by slightly cutting the foil. All of the plates were then placed into a black bag. 


Results:
The results of this experiment showed no movement in any of the nine experimental plates. The three experimental groups included: the controll plates, the plates with lidocaine as an inhibitor, and the plates with pyrethrin as an activator, and they all looked unchanged, as there was no Physarum movement. However, if the Physarum had moved, the controll plates would have shown the furthest movement towards the food, the pyrethrin plates the second furthest, and the lidocaine plates would have moved the least. As there was not any movement recorded, there are no results or statistical tests to document. 


Discussion:
The observations of the nine plates revealed that there was no movement of the Physarum. Due to the fact that we were unable to run a statistical test because of a lack of data, the hypothesis cannot be supported or rejected. There are various possible explanations as to why there was no movement in any of the nine plates. One reason could be due to the fact that we may not have left it sit long enough for the Physarum to sense the food and move towards it. Additionally, the optimal living conditions for the Physarum were not satisfied, as the laboratory is very cold and Physarum is typically kept in an incubator. A study states that the movement of Physarum is facilitated by heat and it intensifies its oscillations [Durham, Ridgway: 1976]. Also, temperature plays an integral role in Physarum’s ability to develop and split at constant rates [Mohberg, Rusch: 1969]. Therefore, the colder temperature in the laboratory may have prevented normal chemotaxis movement towards the food source, as seen by the results. Furthermore, if The Carolina Biological Supply had improperly grown the Physarum, it could lead to their inability to identify chemical signals. In addition, this could also cause the Physarum to be unable to relay chemical signals down the sodium ion channel pathways that we were attempting to manipulate with an inhibitor and activator. This can be directly attributed to Physarum’s failure to utilize cytoplasmic streaming. As a result, the Physarum is unable to relay chemical signals from lidocaine and pyrethrin to the actin filaments that help Physarum move towards the food source. The lack of movement in the pyrethrin plates could be attributed to the high toxicity of pyrethrin. Research showed that pyrethrin is known to be a toxin to insects, as it is commonly used with insecticides [Davies et. al: 2007]. Thus, pyrethrin could also be toxic to Physarum; as a result, it could damage the Physarum and prevent it from moving towards a food source. Also, if the bag was sealed completely, the Physarum may have been unable to get air. One final consideration is that it may have been transitioning to the splorodium stage. This would mean that the Physarum would not be moving, as it is typically measured in the active plasmodium stage.
