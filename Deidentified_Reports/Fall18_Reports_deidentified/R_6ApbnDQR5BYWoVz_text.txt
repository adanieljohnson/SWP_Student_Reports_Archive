Title: The Effect of Water Color on Betta splenden agonistic behaviors 

Abstract:
In biology, it is important to understand how members of the same species interact with each other in different situations. Whether it be agonistic or aggressive behavior presented during mating season or collaborative behavior, it is necessary to know specifically how species demonstrate these behaviors. In this experiment, researchers observe these intraspecific behaviors and asses based on a scale whether conditions of water coloring (specifically food coloring present in their water) either reduces or increases the demonstration of these aggressive behaviors. Researchers found that there is not a statistical significant difference between the amount of aggressive behavior displayed by fish with colored water in their tank compared to the fish before water color was added to their tank. 

Introduction:
Betta splendens, commonly referred to as Siamese fighting fish, are known to exhibit aggressive or agonistic behaviors between two male B. splendens. This is recognized as an intraspecific behavior. Intraspecific behavior is displays of behavior between two organisms of the same species. Intraspecific behavior behavior for B. splendens include broadside and facing movements. Broadside movements are displayed when a fish turns its side towards its opponent, and has three movements that increase in level of aggressiveness (pelvic fin flickering, tail beating, and tail flashing). They also exhibit facing movements, facing opponents with their pectoral fins erect, spreading opercula, and protruding Branchiostegal membranes (also known as the red mane) [Robertson: 1979]. There are certain factors that are thought to have an effect on these aggressive behaviors. In this experiment specifically researchers are looking at the factor of visibility, as variables that limit visibility in B. splenden water are thought to reduce aggressive behavior demonstrations. It is hypothesized that if Betta splenden are in colored water that limits their visibility that it will decrease the amount of agonistic behavior demonstrations.

Materials and Methods:
Three different sets of two Betta splendens were collected and placed in 3 tanks (1 tank for each set), and one opaque and one clear divider was placed in between the two fish in each tank. All of the fish were red. The tanks were all filled with room temperature water and had been fed prior to this experiment, growing accustomed to the tank environment. For each set of fish the experiment began by lifting the opaque divider (to let the fish see each other) and then recording the frequency of each aggressive behavior according the developed behavior scale. The scale was based on an increasing level of aggressiveness determined by the specific display behavior, and for Broadside movements the scale was Fin flick (1), Tail beat(2), Tail flash (3) and facing movements were Erect pelvic fins (1), Spreading operculum (2), and protruding Branchiostegal membrane (3). The more these behaviors were demonstrated based on the scale, the more aggressive each B. splenden's behavior trend was thought to be. In the next part of the experiment, blue water coloring was added to the set of the tanks, and red food coloring was added to the tanks after the blue (with clear water replacing blue water). Then their aggressive behavior frequency was recorded. Data was then compiled and an ANOVA test was run to determine the significance of the results.

Results:
The Mean of the control trials of B. splenden was 3.575 with a standard deviation of 2.528. The Mean of the red experimental trial was 2.4 with a standard deviation of 4.8. And the Mean of the Blue experimental trials was 2.3 with a standard deviation of 2.959. The Turkey Kramer test found that the results were not significant across all groups (figure 1). This was shown through the sum of squares among groups being 4.022 with (df = 2, Avg = 2.01. p = .856). This was also shown with the sum of squares within groups being 114.568 (df = 9, Avg. = 12.73) (figure 1).


Discussion:
In this lab, the hypothesis was not supported. This is due to the statistical results of the ANOVA test showing no statistical significance across all three testing groups, with (df = 2, Avg. = 2.011, p = .856). This implies that visibility was not hindered significantly enough to have an effect on the agonistic behaviors when food coloring was added to and changed the color of the water, thus suggesting that it also did not significantly hinder visibility between the two fish, as it was even observed that in colored water the fish were still able to find their way towards each other in about the same amount of time (3.5 minutes) in almost every trial. This however is still a confounding variable, as it is not known whether visibility was hindered enough to have a significant effect. This promotes the idea that further testing should look into whether the concentration of coloring or opaqueness of the water hinders visibility and therefore intraspecific behaviors in Betta splenden.
