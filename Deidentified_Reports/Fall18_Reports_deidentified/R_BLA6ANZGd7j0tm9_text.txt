Title: The effects of growing mung beans in different densities on their root to shoot ratio.

Abstract:
We studies how shoot:root energy allocation in mung beans responds to different planting densities. The mung beans were grown over two weeks in different densities in small planters in the greenhouse. The roots and shoots weights and lengths were then measured and average ratios found. There was a clear difference in the weight ratios between the two groups but the difference in length was negligible. We concluded that due to the competition for resources the roots of the mung bean were given more resources and grew more robustly in order to collect enough resources. 


Introduction:
 In this lab, we were looking at how mung beans allocate resources when grown in different densities.  Mung beans or Vigna radiata are high in protein and are also a rich source of calcium, phosphorous and other vitamins. Because of this, mung beans can be extremely important in areas of the world with little access to animal protein [Grant:2018]. According to gardeningknowhow.com, 15-20 million pounds of mung beans are consumed per year in the United States and almost 75% of these are imported [Grant:2018]. These beans prove to be a potentially very important crop as populations of developing countries rise and so, it is important to figure out the most efficient way to raise them in order to produce the most yield.  
In a study conducted on silage corn, another crop plant, to determine (amongst other things) the effects of planting the seeds at different densities, “it was determined that as intrarow seed spacing increased, mean emergence time decreased and seedling emergence increased” [Malasli:2017]. According to the two-year experiment, there were significent effects on plant height, on the number of ears per plant and on ear weight as spacing increased [Malasli:2017].
Plants get their energy from many different sources and when one is rarer than the others, the plant will redirect resources into whichever structures are needed to collect the rarer resource. This can be quantified by measuring the root/shoot ratio of a plant which can show if resources are being distributed equally or if the plant is sending more resources to its roots or shoots. If the plant is allocating too much of its resources to its roots then the shoot of the plant (the part that yields a crop) will not grow as much.
Because of the mung beans need to compete for limited resources, we hypothesize that mung beans grown in a high-density environment will develop a higher root to shoot ratio then beans grown in a low-density environment in their effort to find ample amounts of resources. 


Materials and Method:
First, we filled six planters with vermiculite then we added 50 mg of nitrogen to each planter and soaked all of the planters in water. We poked nine holes in each planter all evenly spaced about 1-2 inches apart. For the low-density planters, we put two mung bean seeds in each hole. For the high density planter we put six seeds in each hole. We placed all the planters in the greenhouse and watered all of them equally once per day for two weeks. We then chose four random plants from each planter for a total of 12 plants from each of the low and high-density groups. We measured the weight in grams and length in centimeters of each plant’s root and shoot. We then found the root:shoot ratio for each plant’s length and weight and then found the averages for each statistic. We used a one tailed t_test to see if the high density group had a significently higher root to shoot ratio the low-density group.


Results:
Statistics tests:

Root:shoot weight ratio
Df: 22
T-value: 3.95	
P-value: 0.0006

Root:shoot length ratio
Df: 22
T- value: 0.402
P value: 0.345 

The p_value for weight root:shoot ratio was 0.0006 which was statistically significent at ⍺ = 0.05. The p_value for length was 0.345 which was not statistically significent. 


Discussion:
Our hypothesis was partially supported by the weight root:shoot ratio but not the length root:shoot ratio. Due to the higher competition for soil nutrients we thought the high density group would have an overall higher root:shoot ratio. Visually, the high density mung beans had skinnier stems but both plants looked about the same height. This supports the finding that the the weight root:shoot ratio was more significent then the length. Malasli’s study also found that  the increased spacing between seeds led to an increase in stem diameter, which they attributed to the increase in growth habitat [Malasli:2017]. A possible reason why there was a difference in significance between length and weight ratios would be that mung beans make their underground structures more or less robust when allocating resources rather then growing longer. 
In a study conducted on the crop plant maize, it was found that root growth was more inhibited than the shoot under high plant density, because as plant density increases, photoassimilates are less frequently allocated to the root. “Therefore, the plant has to make better use of the limited photoassimilates to build a more efficient root system with sufficient capacity for water and nutrient uptake” [Shao: 2018]. 
It is also possible that the root:shoot length ratio was not significent because the nutrient rich environment the plants were growing in provided enough resources for even the high density planters and the roots were not actually under much competition. This possibility is supported by Berendse’s study which found that “at the lower nutrient supplies the proportional allocation to root mass increased with increasing competitive stress, while in the higher nutrient treatment the relationship between competitive stress and shoot to root ratio was neutral” [Berendse: 2009].
