Title: Behavioral response of [Physarum Polycephalum] to varying wavelengths of light

Abstract:
The behavior of the slime mold [Physarum Polycephalum] changes in response to varying environmental stimuli including exposure to light. Phototaxis can be triggered by light-induced cAMP intracellular signaling pathways which cause the observed movement of the Physarum. Exposure to different wavelengths of light (red and blue specifically) may result in different phototaxic behavior that exposure to white light. To test this hypothesis, Physarum samples were exposed to a small window of either red, blue, or white light and their distance and direction traveled were measured and recorded after 48 hours. A one-tailed two-sample t-test was then performed between the white and red light and the white and blue light which indicated a statistically significant difference in the direction traveled toward the light source of the red light treatment group but not for the distance traveled away from the light source in the blue light treatment group. Despite the statistical insignificance, negative phototaxis was still observed when exposed to blue light. The differences in phototaxis may be a result of different photoreceptors for different wavelengths of light in the cells of Physarum which likely trigger distinct signaling pathways resulting in differences in movement.


Introduction:
[Physarum Polycephalum] is a species of slime mold that naturally lives in dark, humid environments. Physarum is able to crawl through the extension of the actin filaments under its plasma membrane in response to different environmental stimuli. Since the behaviors of Physarum are easy to observe, it makes for a good experimental subject. Phototaxis (both positive and negative) can occur in response to light; visible light waves have been shown to inhibit growth as well as create a light avoidance effect (negative phototaxis) [Schreckenbach: 1984]. Previous studies in similar species of slime molds have suggested phototaxis control through light-induced secretion of cAMP (a second messenger in many slime mold signaling pathways) which triggers cellular movement and controls phototactic orientation toward a light source [Miura: 2000]. 
 Phototaxis likely plays an important role in finding an optimum place for growth and sporulation; therefore, exposure to different wavelengths of light may result in differences in phototaxis behavior (in terms of both distance and direction traveled) of Physarum. Since blue light has a higher light frequency, shorter wavelength, and higher energy photons—Physarum exposed to this light may demonstrate greater negative phototaxis (move farther away from the light source) than a sample exposed to red light since its properties (longer wavelength, lower frequency, lower energy photons) more closely resemble those of the dark, which is its optimum environment for Physarum [Hato: 1976]. Because of their distinct properties, exposure to blue light may result in a farther distance traveled by the Physarum away from the light source than a sample exposed to red light because the cellular reception of blue light may induce a different intracellular signal response than that of red light. Since the blue light treatment is less like the optimum environment of Physarum, there may be more clear and extreme movement away from the light source than in the red light sample; therefore, samples exposed to blue light may travel a greater distance away from the light source than Physarum samples exposed to red light after 48 hours. 


Materials and Methods:
15 PDA plates and a Physarum stock sample were obtained and a line with two equidistant 1x1 cm boxes was drawn on the bottom of each. 4 plates were labeled “blue light”, 4 “red light”, 4 “control: white light”, one “dark” (negative control), and one “all light” (positive control). The agar was then cut out of the traced squares on each PDA plate and removed using forceps sterilized with ethanol. A block of Physarum culture was then transferred into each empty well. Each plate was taped closed and wrapped in foil (except the “all light” plate which was left unwrapped). Each plate’s label was then written again on the outside of the foil. A small window about ½ cm x ½ cm was cut out of the edge of each plate, except the all dark control. The plates were then placed under a lamp with light of the color corresponding to their condition group. The dark control plate was placed in a dark bag in a drawer. After 48 hours, each plate was unwrapped and a mm ruler was used to measure the distance traveled by the Physarum in each sample and was recorded along with the direction traveled relative to the light window. A two-sample one-tailed t-test was then performed to test the difference in one direction between the average distance traveled of each treatment group against the white light control at an α-value of 0.05.


Results:
Distance traveled was recorded as a positive value when the Physarum moved away from the light source and as a negative value when it traveled toward the light source. In the dark control condition, Physarum moved in all directions and in the all light condition there was no observed movement of the Physarum. Measurements were not obtained for one Physarum block in the visible light treatment and one block in the red light treatment because the Physarum blocks were knocked out of their wells. In two red light samples and one blue light sample, no movement of the Physarum was observed following the 48 hour period. Figure 1 displays the average distance travelled by the Physarum in each treatment; in visible light it was 4.42 mm (SD = 2.57), in red light it was -2.43 mm (SD = 3.41), and in blue light it was 4.88 mm (SD = 5.46). A one-tailed two-sample t-test performed between the visible and red light data yielded a P-value of 0.00057 (T-stat = 4.25, α-value = 0.05, df = 12) which was not greater than the α-value of 0.05, while that performed between the visible and blue light resulted in a P-value of 0.42 (T-stat = 0.2, α-value = 0.05, df = 13) which was greater than the α-value of 0.05. 


Discussion:
As indicated by the results, exposure of Physarum Polycephalum to red light did have a statistically significant effect on the distance traveled by the slime mold compared to that when exposed to white light while exposure to blue light did not. Although the measurements were not statistically significant, the Physarum exposed to blue light did demonstrate observable movement away from the light source-- indicating negative phototaxis similar to (but not statistically different from) that which results from exposure to visible light. 
Since red and blue light have such distinct physical and energetic properties, they are likely received by different receptors on Physarum cells. The stimulation of these receptors may trigger different cAMP-mediated pathways or cause the release of different amounts of cAMP which could lead to differences in enzyme activation and therefore varying behavior between the Physarum samples in each treatment. This cAMP release has been shown to affect the phototactic turning of slime molds in response to light and may have caused the samples exposed to red light to orient toward the light source during phototaxis instead of away like the samples exposed to blue light [Miura: 2000]. Similar studies on phototaxis suggest the presence of multiple photoreceptors which lead to different behavior of slime molds when exposed to different wavelengths of light [Hato: 1976]. In order to better understand the relationship between phototaxis and the properties of light, Physarum could be exposed to intermediate visible light waves (between blue and white and white and red) in order to see which ranges of light show similar effects on the behavior of phototaxis and therefore likely trigger the same of similar cellular signaling pathways. Additionally, a similar experiment and data collection with Physarum samples treated with cAMP inhibitors could give further insight on the intracellular role of cAMP on both distance and direction traveled by Physarum when exposed to varying wavelengths of light. A better understanding of the specific biochemical mechanisms behind each kind of phototaxis, as well as behind normal cellular behavior in the optimum environment, could lead to a better understanding regarding the effects of light on these processes.
