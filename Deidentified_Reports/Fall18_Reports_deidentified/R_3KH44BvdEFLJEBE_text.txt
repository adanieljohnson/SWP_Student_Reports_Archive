Title: The Negative Effects of JH Analog Hormone Precor on the Growth of Menduca Sexta

Abstract:
Menduca Sexta is the insect being studied in this experiment and it has a common name tobacco hornworm. This type of insect is used as the experimental animal because researchers have a perfect knowledge of the life cycle of Menduca Sexta and also the specific body structures. The development of the insect from an egg into an adult is largely influenced by different types of hormones. The main hormones are Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH) which both have influence on the growth of the insect and the pupating stage as well. In the experiment, we had two groups with 4 caterpillars each – one is the controll group and the other is the tested group. For tested group, the precor was used as the JH analogous hormone and five drops of precor were added to the caterpillar’s food in order to test the hypothesis that the precor would take the caterpillars longer time to pupate and the tested group would grow larger in weight. After the data was obtained, the statistical method was used to verify the hypothesis. The result of the experiment was that 5 drops of precor will not affect the growth in weight of the caterpillars but will slow down the pupate stage to a certain point. 

Introduction:
Manduca Sexta is an insect in the Order Lepidoptera and it has a life cycle of 19 to 23 days to grow from eggs to adult moths. The life cycle of Manduca Sexta is an example of a holometabolous life cycle which means the major body recognition is during pupal metamorphosis. Metamorphosis means that the adults will have a totally different appearance from the larva stage. 

Before the pupal metamorphosis, there is one point called commitment pulse, which is the point that the larva has had enough energy and resources to undergo the pupa stage. The commitment pulse is controllled by two hormones called Ecdysterone (20E) and Juvenile Hormone (JH). Ecdysterone regulates the timing of molting during insect development, and additional functions in adult insects. JH HORMONES (JH) play a key role in the development of insects from embryo to adult.[Larry: 1975] During the larval stages high titres of the hormones prevent differentiation and in a typical case, hormone titres are relatively high during early larval instars but decrease in the late instars preceding metamorphosis.[Larry: 1975] Normally, Manduca Sexta has 5 larval instars and up to the 4th larval instar, JH levels stay fairly high. At the end of the 4th larval instar, JH levels drop to a very low level and remains at low concentration until the insect reaches the commitment pulse. This phenomenon shows that JH inhibits the pupating stage of Menduca Sexta which means if the level of JH is high, then the caterpillar will never turn into an adult stage. 

In order to see if the JH regulates the growth and pupating stage of the Menduca Sexta, we will use the precor in the experiment. Precor, also named methoprene, acts as the JH analog and has the similar function as the JH hormone. In the experiment, two groups of small Menduca Sexta caterpillars – one is the controll group with water in the food and the other is the tested group with the precor – were used. The hypothesis is that 5 drops of precor in the food will make the caterpillars grow larger in weight than the controll group because it takes them longer to pupate or to meet the commitment pulse. The weights of the caterpillars were recorded every day so that the exact growth of each caterpillar could be used in further study. After the data were collected, then statistic method were used to analyze them and got the result. The result of the experiment could decide whether the hypothesis could be accepted or not.


Materials and Method:
In the experiment, there were two containers with 4 caterpillars in each and they lived in separate cubicles. The Menduca Sexta caterpillars been chosen should be similar in size and length which would be helpful for further comparison study. Four caterpillars were selected in the controll group and each was given around 10g of food mixed with 5 drops of water. The other four caterpillars were fed with around 10g of food mixed with 5 drops of precor. All Menduca Sexta caterpillars were kept in the same incubator at 28℃, in 12 hr dark; 12 hr light cycle. The caterpillars were measured in weight for 7 days from the first day of the experiment. When the food had dried or had been fully consumed, it is replaced with new ones with the same drops of water or precor. The independent variable is 5 drops of precor and the dependent variables are the growth in weight of the caterpillars and the time for pupating. 

After the data were recorded, calculated the growth in weight for each caterpillars and then calculated the average increase in weight and the standard deviation for each group. Then the two-sample t_test would be used to obtain the p_value in order to decide whether the hypothesis should be accepted or rejected.


Results:
The average growth in weight for the controll and the JH group is close as one is 1.063g and the other one for the JH experiment group is 1.096 and there is only around 0.03g difference. Usually, the growth on each day varied. For example, usually on the first one or two days, the caterpillars grew slowly and after two or three days later, they increased the weight at a slightly constant speed. 
The caterpillar 3 in the controll group and caterpillar 3 in the JH group both had a small average increase in weight or a decrease. They did not grow or eat the food but they were still included in the test because in the nature there will be similar occasions and the experiment should include all the situations. 

According to the two average and standard deviation numbers, the two-sample t_test was used in the experiment and the p_value of this test is 0.954 which a degree of freedom value of 6 and the t-value of 0.0601. 


Discussion:
The hypothesis stated that the precor would take the caterpillars longer time to pupate and the tested group would grow larger in weight. However, according to the two-tailed sample test, the statistically result is not appropriate enough to accept the hypothesis. The phenomenon reflected the 5 drops of precor in the food did not have a significent effect on the growth of weight of Menduca Sexta caterpillars. However, after two weeks of the experiment, the caterpillar 3 in the tested group actually started to grow in size. So if keep running the experiment for two weeks or more then the effect might be more significent so that more accurate conclusions according to the hypothesis could be made. 

However, even though the data did not support the hypothesis that the caterpillars treating with the precor will grow larger and heavier than the normal ones, it could still be concluded that the precor can make the caterpillars take longer time to pupate. For example, for caterpillar 1 in the controll group, it started to pupate on the 7th day of the experiment and another one started to pupate at the end of the experiment. However, all four of the caterpillars in the tested group were still in light blue and had no signal for pupating. So five drops of precor still had effect that will take longer for caterpillars to hit the commitment pulse. The reason of this phenomenon is that the application of the juvenile hormone analog will prevent the change in protein synthesis which should be stop before the metamorphosis. Thus, the intermolt change in the lamellar assembly process appears to result from hormone-induced changes in cuticular protein synthesis. [WILLIAM: 1986]

As five drops of precor only have effect on the timing for precor but not the weight in this experiment, another experiment can be carried out changing some variables. For instance, the next experiment can be tested on the effect of 10 drops of precor on the growth of Menduca Sexta and the experiment can last for more than three weeks until the normal Menduca Sexta has already finished its life cycle so that the conclusion will be more direct.
